arrangements and improvements, public utility services, parks, playgrounds, and other
developments, the use of property, the density of population, and other matters relating
to the physical development of the city. Such comprehensive plan may be prepared in
sections, each of which will relate to a major subject of the comprehensive plan, as
outlined in the planning commission's program of work.
Subd. 6. Procedure for adoption of comprehensive city plan.

has been referred to the planning commission for report thereon and an attested copy of
such report has been filed with the city council. Failure of the planning commission to
report within 40 days or such longer period as may be designated by the city council will

investigation on applicants for positions with the city, as provided by this section. This
section applies only to applicants who are finalists for paid or volunteer positions with the

directly to the position sought. The police department may not perform a background
investigation unless the applicant consents in writing to the investigation and to the release
of the investigation information to the city administrator and other city staff as may be
appropriate. An applicant's failure to provide consent will disqualify the applicant for the
position sought. If the city administrator rejects the applicant's application due, solely or in
part, to the applicant's prior conviction of a crime, subject to the exception set forth in
Minnesota Statutes, section 364.09, the city administrator must notify the applicant in

over to the responsible authority by such officer, agent or employee or member of a city
department. The responsible authority must make provisions for receiving and safe
keeping of property and money delivered to them and coming into their possession in
the course of municipal operations. A receipt will be issued to the person delivering
such property or money to the city. Such property must be stored in a safe place and
such money deposited with the city finance officer/treasurer in a special account for a
period of three months unless claimed by the lawful owner.
Subd. 3. Claims by owners. During such three-month period, the responsible authority

such property or order such money paid to the owner after receiving satisfactory proof
of ownership and after providing ten days' notice by mail to the person, other than the
police officer or city employee, who delivered such property and to such other person
who has asserted a claim of ownership. The city finance officer/treasurer must not issue
any order for the disbursement of such money without the written order of the
responsible authority. If ownership cannot be determined to the responsible authority’s
satisfaction, the responsible authority may refuse to deliver such property or order the
payment of such money to anyone until ordered to do so by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
Subd. 4. Claim by finder. If the lawful owner does not claim the property or money
during this three-month period, the responsible authority may deliver the property or
order the money paid to the person, other than the police officer or city employee, who
delivered it to the responsible authority if such finder will have previously asserted in
writing a claim to the property or money.
Subd. 5. Transfer to general fund. If any such money is not claimed by the lawful owner
or finder within the three-month period, the responsible authority will so notify the city
finance officer/treasurer and the money must then be transferred to the general fund of
the city.
Subd. 6. Disposal. After the three-month period, property not delivered to the lawful
owner or finder will be sold by the responsible authority at public auction to the highest
bidder or appropriated to the use of the city.

movement, storage, care and sale of such property.

authority determines to be in the public interest summarily dispose of any property
coming into the responsible authority’s possession which the responsible authority

CHAPTER IV - BUILDING, HOUSING AND CONSTRUCTION REGULATIONS
Section 400: Building code
400.01. State building code.
Subdivision 1. Code adopted. The Minnesota state building code, Minnesota
Statutes, sections 326B.101 to 326B.194, including all of the amendments, rules and
regulations established, adopted, amended, and published from time to time by the
Minnesota commissioner of labor and industry, is hereby adopted by reference with the
exception of the optional chapters, unless specifically adopted in this section. The
Minnesota state building code is hereby incorporated into this section as if fully set out
herein.
Subd. 2. Administration and enforcement. The application, administration and
enforcement of the building code shall be in accordance with Minnesota Rules Chapter
1300. The city building official designated by the city council will be responsible for the
administration and enforcement of the building code within the corporate limits of the
city. The designated city building official must be certified by the State of Minnesota
pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 326B.133. The building official will be
responsible for all aspects of code administration, including the issuance of all building
permits and the inspection of all manufactured home installations.
Subd. 3. Violation and penalties. It is unlawful for any person to erect, construct,
enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, or demolish, equip, use, occupy
or maintain any building structure in the city contrary to or in violation of any provision of
the building code embodied in this section. Each day during which a violation of the
building code is committed, continued or permitted constitutes a separate offense. The
violation of this section constitutes a misdemeanor and will be punished in accordance
with Minnesota Statutes, section 609.03.
Subd. 4. Interpretation. The provisions of this section are intended to be the minimum
requirements for the construction, repair, alteration or moving of buildings and
structures in the city. This section will not abrogate or annul any existing easements,
restrictions, covenants or applicable statutes or regulations.
Subd. 5. Electrical. In accordance with Minnesota Statues, section 326B.36, the
commissioner of the Minnesota department of labor and industry shall be the
responsible authority for administration of the electrical code, including issuing permits
and conducting inspections.
[Revised 5-18-15, Ordinance 428]
400.03. Building permit.
Subdivision 1. Permit required. No person, firm, or corporation may erect, alter,
construct, enlarge, repair, move, improve, convert, demolish, equip, use, occupy, or
maintain any building, structure, or any portion of it, without a proper building permit
issued by the city. No building permit or other permit pertaining to the use of land or
buildings will be issued unless such building is designed and arranged to conform to the
provisions of the state building code and the zoning chapter.
Subd. 2. Survey required.
(a) Every application for a building permit, excluding interior remodels,
re-roofs, re-siding and general maintenance, must be accompanied
by a certified site survey at a scale and in quantities deemed
necessary by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator
may waive the survey requirement for decks and pools of any size,
additions with a footprint no larger than 400 square feet in area,
detached accessory structures no larger than 400 square feet in
area, and any addition which does not change the existing footprint
of the structure. A waiver may be granted if the applicant provides a
prior certified site survey of the property which includes hardcover
calculations and submits a scaled drawing of the proposed
improvement indicating existing improvements, property lines,
accurate distances, wetlands/waterbodies, easements and other
information that would typically be indicated on a survey. The zoning
administrator may require a new certified site survey despite the
applicant meeting the above criteria if the proposed improvement
appears to encroach on a setback, exceed the hardcover limitation,
violate any other city standard or if there has been a substantial
change or addition to the site since the previous survey.
Because the survey will be used to determine whether an application
is in conformance with city code, it is the responsibility of the
applicant to ensure information provided on the survey, including
existing and proposed topography, corresponds to submitted
building plans. An issued building permit authorizes only land
alterations identified on a survey. Surveys must include all
information deemed necessary by the zoning administrator to
provide for the enforcement of this chapter and the zoning
ordinance.
(b) Applicants for all new principal residential structures must provide to the city an
as-built foundation survey upon completion of work to the foundation.
(c) The as-built foundation survey must certify both the final setbacks of
the structure being built and the elevations at which the new
structure exists. Failure to provide a foundation survey upon
foundation completion will result in the builder continuing with
construction at the builder’s own risk. Expenditures incurred beyond
the construction of the foundation will not be considered in
determining the actions required to bring the building into
conformance if not built to approved plans. The foundation survey
will be on-site before the framing inspection is done and approved by
the building official.
(d) Applicants for all new principal residential structures must provide to
the city an as-built grading survey upon completion of work. The asbuilt
grading survey must certify the final topography of the site and
verify the drainage patterns existing upon completion of work. The
city reserves the right to withhold the certificate of occupancy for a
dwelling until final grading addresses all problems that may be
detrimental to adjacent properties.
(e) Any person aggrieved by a decision of the zoning administrator
regarding the requirement for a survey under this subd. 2 may
appeal that decision to the board of appeals and adjustments under
section 505.05, subd. 3 of the city code.
Subd. 3. Denial of permit for effect on drainage.
(a) No building permit will be issued where the relative elevations of the
proposed building grade and the established road grade will conflict
in such manner as to cause damage by altering the drainage or flow
of surface waters to the road or nearby roads or to the adjacent or
nearby premises.
(b) The city may deny a permit for the construction of a dwelling upon
ground which is too low, too steep, or otherwise improperly situated
for proper drainage.
(c) In the course of the construction, alteration, repair or moving of any
building or structure, no obstruction, diversion, bridging or confining
of the existing channel or any natural waterway through which
surface water naturally flows upon and across land will be made
without the approval of the city and unless there is compliance with
the requirements of this chapter and other applicable ordinances or
regulations.
Subd. 4. Permit and inspection fees. Permit and inspection fees will be as authorized in
Minnesota Rules Chapter 1300.0120. The method of establishing permit fees and the
fee amount will be determined by the city council. The fee schedule will be established
by a special ordinance.
Subd. 5. Surcharge. In addition to the permit fee required by subd. 4 above, the building
permit applicant will be assessed a surcharge, which is to be remitted to the Minnesota
department of labor and industry as prescribed in Minnesota Statutes, section
326B.148.
Subd. 6. Unauthorized work. If the building official finds any work regulated by the code
being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of the code or in a dangerous or
unsafe manner, the building official may issue a stop work order. The stop work order
will be issued pursuant to Minnesota Rules Chapter 1300.0170.
Subd.7. Special inspection. Any special inspections, testing, or verification as required
by the building code will be at the owner's or applicant's expense.
Subd. 8. Building Permits and Completion of Exterior Work. A municipality may by
ordinance adopt an official control that requires exterior work authorized by a building
permit issued in accordance with the State Building Code, tobe completed within a
specified number of days following the issuance of the building permit. The local
regulation may not require completion of exterior work earlier than 180 days following
the issuance of the permit.
Subd. 9. Permit Expiration. If a permit expires pursuant to MN Rules Chapter 1300 as
stated on the permit application, a new permit may be re-issued for a period of six
months following expiration, provided 1) that no changes have or will take place in the
plans or specifications of the project, 2) that no code change has taken place, 3) that
the permit renewal fee set forth in the city’s fee schedule has been paid, and 4) that no
more than 12 months has elapsed since abandonment or suspension of work. After that
time, a new permit must be obtained.
400.05. Plumbing Plan Review.
Subdivision 1. Review required. Prior to installation of a system of plumbing other than
for a single-family dwelling with independent plumbing service, complete plumbing plans
and specifications, together with any additional information that the commissioner may
require, shall be submitted on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner
of the department of labor and industry. No construction shall proceed except in
accordance with the approved plans. Any alteration of extension of any existing
plumbing system shall be subject to these same requirements.
[Revised 5-18-15, Ordinance 428]
400.07. Certificates of occupancy.
Subdivision 1. Certificate required. No person, firm, or corporation may use, occupy, or
maintain any building, or structure, or any portion thereof, without a proper certificate of
occupancy. The certificate of occupancy shall issued in accordance with Minnesota
Rules Chapter 1300.0220.
Subd. 2. Temporary occupancy. The building official may issue a temporary certificate
of occupancy before the completion of the entire work covered by the permit, provided
that the portion or portions may be occupied safely. Temporary certificates of
occupancy may be issued for a period not to exceed 60 days. Fees for temporary
certificates of occupancy shall be determined by ordinance. If a permanent certificate of
occupancy is not issued by the expiration date of a temporary certificate of occupancy,
any resident or occupant of the subject structure shall be required to vacate the
structure until such time as a validly issued permanent certificate of occupancy is
obtained.
Subd. 3. Revocation. The building official may issue a written suspension or revocation
of a certificate of occupancy issued under this section if the certificate is issued in error
or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or if the building or use of the building,
structure, or portion of the building or structure is in violation of any ordinance or
regulation or a provision of the code.
400.09. Agricultural buildings.
Subdivision 1. Applicability of the building code. The building code does not apply to
agricultural buildings, except as specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 326B.121.
Subd. 2. Agricultural building defined. For the purposes of this section an "agricultural
building" is defined as a structure on agricultural land, as defined in Minnesota Statutes,
section 273.13, subdivision 23, designed, constructed, or used exclusively to house
farm implements, livestock or agricultural produce or products used by the owner,
lessee, and sub-lessee, of the building and members of their immediate families, their
employees, and persons engaged in the pick up or delivery of agricultural produce or
products. Private and commercial indoor riding arenas or commercial stables are not
agricultural buildings.
400.11. Unsafe buildings.
All buildings or structures which are structurally unsafe or not provided with
adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to
human life or health, or which in relation to existing use constitute a hazard to safety or
health, or public welfare, by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation,
obsolescence, fire hazard, or abandonment, as specified by ordinance, state statutes or
regulation, are unsafe buildings. All such unsafe buildings must be abated by repair,
rehabilitation, demolition, or removal in accordance with the procedure specified in the
building code, or Minnesota Statutes, sections 463.15 to 4463.26 or other applicable
statutes, regulations, or codes.
400.13. Numbering of houses and buildings.
Subdivision 1. Numbers required. The owner or occupant of a house or commercial
building in the city must place on the front of each such house or commercial building
suitable house or building numbers in accordance with Minnesota State Fire Code,
section 505. The numbers must be large enough to be read from the street upon which
the house or commercial building is located. If any house or commercial building is too
remote from the fronting road or street to be plainly visible from the fronting road or
street, a sign or post with visible and legible approved numbers or addresses, or a
range of numbers or addresses from lowest to highest, shall be placed at the driveway
entrance in such a manner that the numbers or addresses are visible from either
direction of travel on said road or street. In addition, if there are multiple driveways
branching from the main driveway, each subordinate driveway shall be marked in a
similar manner.
Subd. 2. Duties of building official; enforcement. The building official must enforce this
subsection. The building official must give the owner or occupant of any house or
commercial building that does not conform with this subsection 10 days’ written notice
within which to comply with the terms of this subsection.
Subd. 3. Temporary Street Address. When a new house or building is under
construction, until such a time as permanent house of building numbers or other
numbering in accordance with 400.13 is in place, a temporary sign shall be placed at all
driveways and subordinate driveways indicating the address of each house and
building.

if the certificate of occupancy for said building is not older than one year.
Such grading and earth moving will need to have been approved by the
city at the time of issuance of the building permit, providing that a plan
showing property drainage and protection of adjoining property has been
submitted. Changes to the proposed grading approved by the building
permit will require city approval.
(e) Normal and customary grading in connection with the construction of a
driveway independent of the amount of material involved which does not
significantly affect existing drainage or low-lying land on the property or
adjacent properties.
(f) Activities associated with public road construction and maintenance.

Section 417 – Mining
417.01. Purpose.
Commercial mining, stripping, extracting and excavating activities are now being
and for some time have been conducted in certain places in the city, in order to remove
from the ground black dirt, sand, gravel and other minerals or substances existing on, in
or under such places. Such acts are inherently accompanied by noise and dust, often
create hazardous conditions, and usually result in lasting disfigurement of the places
where they are carried on, and thus tend to interfere with the existing land uses in
nearby areas, and to discourage further permanent development, and to diminish the
public health, safety and general welfare. It is therefore desirable to regulate both
existing operations and any further extension of such mining, stripping, extraction and
excavation operations in the city, all by means of the power granted to the council
pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 412.221, subdivisions 23, 24, and 32 and to
regulate by ordinance public nuisances, noise or other disorder and uses of land in the
city for various purposes, and to provide for the good order of the city and the general
welfare of the public.
417.03. Places permitted.
Subdivision 1.
No person will commercially mine, strip, excavate or otherwise extract or remove
black dirt, sand, gravel or other minerals or substances existing on, in or under any

Section 420 - Erosion and sediment control for land
disturbing activities.
420.01. Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to promote, preserve and enhance the natural
resources within the city and provide protection from adverse impacts caused by
erosion and poor sediment control by regulating land disturbances or development
activities that would have an adverse and potentially irreversible impact on water quality
and unique and fragile environmentally sensitive land; by minimizing conflicts and
encouraging compatibility between land disturbances, development activities, water
quality and environmentally sensitive lands; and by requiring review standards and
procedures.
420.03. Applicability.
Every applicant seeking a permit to allow land disturbing activities of one acre or
greater shall submit a stormwater pollution prevention plan to the city engineer. No
building permit, subdivision approval or development permit to allow land disturbing
activities may be issued until approval of the stormwater pollution prevention plan or a
waiver of the approval requirement has been obtained in strict conformance with the
provisions of this section.
420.05. Exemptions.
The provisions of this section do not apply to:
(a) Any part of a subdivision if a plat for the subdivision has been approved by
the city on or before the effective date of this section.
(b) A lot for which a building permit has been approved on or before the
effective date of this section.
(c) Installation of fence, sign, telephone, cable television, electric poles and
other kinds of posts or poles, utility lines or service connections to these
utilities which result in creating under one acre of exposed soil.
(d) Any activity that disturbs less than one acre of land.
(e) Emergency work to protect life, limb or property.
(f) Routine agricultural or silvicultural activity.
420.07. Definitions.
The following words and terms, wherever they occur in this section, are defined
as follows:
Best management practices (BMPs) means erosion and sediment control and
water quality management practices that are the most effective and practicable means
of controlling, preventing, and minimizing degradation of surface water, including
avoidance of impacts, construction-phasing, minimizing the length of time soil areas are
exposed, prohibitions, and other management practices published by state or city.
Land disturbing activity means any land change that may result in soil erosion
from water or wind and the movement of sediments into or upon waters or lands within
this government’s jurisdiction, including clearing and grubbing, grading, excavating,
transporting and filling of land.
Dewatering means the removal of water for construction activity. It can be a
discharge of appropriated surface or groundwater to dry and/or solidify a construction
site.
Energy dissipation means methods employed at pipe outlets to prevent erosion.
Examples include, but are not limited to: concrete aprons, riprap, splash pads, and
gabions that are designed to prevent erosion.
Erosion prevention means measures employed to prevent erosion including but
not limited to: soil stabilization practices, limited grading, mulch, temporary or
permanent cover, and construction phasing.
Final stabilization means that either:
(a) All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and a uniform
(e.g., evenly distributed, without large bare areas) perennial vegetative
cover with a density of 70 percent of the native background vegetative
cover for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas
not covered by permanent structures, or equivalent permanent
stabilization measures (such as the use of riprap, gabions, or geotextiles)
have been employed;
(b) For individual lots in residential construction by either: (a) the homebuilder
completing final stabilization as specified above, or (b) the homebuilder
establishing temporary stabilization including perimeter controls for an
individual lot prior to occupation of the home by the homeowner and
informing the homeowner of the need for, and benefits of, final
stabilization; or
(c) For construction projects on land used for agricultural purposes
(e.g., pipelines across crop or range land) final stabilization may be
accomplished by returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction
agricultural use. Areas disturbed that were not previously used for
agricultural activities, such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to surface
waters and drainage systems, and areas which are not being returned to
their preconstruction agricultural use must meet the final stabilization
criteria in (a) or (b) above.
General contractor means the party who signs the construction contract with the
city to construct the project described in the final plans and specifications. Where the
construction project involves more than one contractor, the general contractor will be
the party responsible for managing the project on behalf of the city.
Impervious surface means a constructed hard surface that either prevents or
retards the entry of water into the soil and causes water to run off the surface in greater
quantities and at an increased rate of flow than prior to development. Examples include
rooftops, sidewalks, patios, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, and concrete,
asphalt, or gravel roads.
National pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) means the federal
program for issuing, modifying, revoking, reissuing, terminating, monitoring, and
enforcing permits under the Clean Water Act (Sections 301, 318, 402, and 405) and
United States Code of Federal Regulations Title 33, Sections 1317, 1328, 1342, and
1345. In Minnesota, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency is responsible for
administering these requirements.
Normal wetted perimeter means the area of a conveyance, such as a ditch,
channel, or pipe that is in contact with water during flow events that are expected to
occur once every year.
Operator means the person (usually the general contractor), designated by the

420.13. Stormwater pollution prevention plan approval standards.
No Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, which fails to meet the standards
contained in this section shall be approved by the city.
Subdivision 1. Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by
temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, upflow chambers,
hydrocyclones, swirl concentrators or other appropriate controls as appropriate. Water
may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion, scour, or flooding of the site or
receiving channels or a wetland.
Subd. 2. Construction site waste.
(a) Solid waste. Collected sediment, asphalt and concrete millings, floating
debris, paper, plastic, fabric, construction and demolition debris and other
wastes must be disposed of properly and must comply with MPCA
disposal requirements.
(b) Hazardous materials. Oil, gasoline, paint and any hazardous substances
must be properly stored, including secondary containment, to prevent spill,
leaks or other discharge. Restricted access to storage areas must be
provided to prevent vandalism. Storage and disposal of hazardous waste
must be in compliance with MPCA regulations.
(c) Liquid waste. All other non stormwater discharges (concrete truck
washout, vehicle washing, maintenance spills, etc.) conducted during the
construction activity shall not be discharged to the municipal storm sewer,
wetlands, natural drainageways, or waters of the state.
Subd. 3. Tracking. All construction entrances and exits must have appropriate rock
construction entrance to minimize the sediment tracking onto the public or private street
and/or stormwater conveyance system.
Subd. 4. Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets must be protected by appropriate
BMPs during construction until all sources with potential for discharging to the inlet have
been stabilized.
Subd. 5. Site erosion control. The following criteria (a through d) apply only to
construction activities that result in runoff leaving the site.
(a) Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site shall be
diverted around disturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise, the channel shall
be protected as described below. Sheet flow runoff from adjacent areas
greater than 10,000 square feet in area shall also be diverted around
disturbed areas, unless shown to have resulted runoff rates of less than
0.5 ft./sec. across the disturbed area for the one year storage. Diverted
runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not cause erosion, scour, or
flooding of the conveyance at receiving channels.
(b) All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to
minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time.
(c) Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site shall be controlled by
meeting either subsections (1) and (2), or (1) and (3) below.
(1) All exposed soil areas with a continuous positive slope within
200 lineal feet of a surface water, must have temporary erosion
protection or permanent cover for the exposed soil areas year
round, according to the following table of slopes and time frames:
Type of slope Time
Steeper than 3:1 7 days
10:1 to 3:1 14 days
Flatter than 10:1 21 days
(2) For sites with more than 10 acres disturbed at one time, or if a
channel originates in the disturbed area, one or more temporary or
permanent sedimentation basin shall be constructed. Each
sedimentation basin shall have a surface area of at least one
percent of the area draining to the basin and at least three feet of
depth and constructed in accordance with accepted design
specifications. Sediment shall be removed to maintain an average
depth of three feet. The basin discharge rate shall also be
sufficiently low as to not cause erosion, scour, or flooding along the
discharge channel or the receiving water.
(3) For sites with less than 10 acres disturbed at one time, silt fences
or equivalent control measures shall be placed along all sidesteps
and downslides sides of the site. If a channel or area of
concentrated runoff passes through the site, silt fences shall be
placed along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the
channel. The use of silt fences or equivalent control measures
must be properly maintained during construction activities.
(d) Any organic storage piles containing more than 10 cubic yards of material
should not be located with a downslide drainage length of less than 25
feet from the toe of the pile to a roadway or drainage channel. If
remaining for more than seven days, they shall be stabilized by mulching
vegetative cover, tarps or other means. Erosion from piles which will be in
existence for less than seven days shall be controlled by placing straw
bales or silt fence barriers around the pile. In-street utility repair or
construction soil or dirt storage piles located closer than 25 feet of a
roadway or drainage channel must be covered with tarps or suitable
alternative control, if exposed for more than three days, and the
stormdrain inlets must be protected with an appropriate filtering barrier.
420.15. Stormwater pollution prevention plan review procedures.
Subdivision 1. Process.
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans meeting the requirements of sections
420.13 and 420.15 must be approved by the city engineer or designated representative
in accordance with the standards of this section.
Subd. 2. Duration.
Plan approval will expire one year after the date of approval unless construction
has commenced in accordance with the plan. However, if prior to the expiration of the
approval, the applicant makes a written request to the city engineer for an extension of
time to commence construction setting forth the reasons for the requested extension,
the city may grant one extension of not greater than one year. Receipt of any request
for extension shall be acknowledged by the city engineer within 15 days. The city
engineer shall make a decision on the extension within 45 days of receipt. Any plan
may be revised in the same manner as originally approved.
Subd. 3. Condition.
A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan may be approved subject to compliance
with conditions reasonable and necessary to insure that the requirements of this section
are met. Conditions may limit the size, kind or character of the proposed development,
require the construction of structures, drainage facilities, storage basins and other
facilities, require replacement of vegetation, establish required monitoring procedures,
stage the work over time, require alteration of the site design to insure buffering and
require the conveyance to the city or other public entity of necessary lands or
easements.
420.17. Maintenance requirements
Subdivision 1. The applicant shall be responsible at all times for the maintenance and
proper operation of all erosion and sediment control measures. On any property on
which land-disturbing activity has occurred pursuant to a permit issued under this
section, the applicant shall, at a minimum, inspect, maintain and repair all disturbed
surfaces and all erosion and sediment control measures and soil stabilization measures
every day work is performed on the site, and at least weekly, until land-disturbing
activity has ceased. Thereafter, the applicant shall perform these responsibilities at
least weekly until vegetative cover is established. The applicant shall maintain log of
activities under this section for inspection by the city on request.
Subd. 2. If upon inspection, the city finds that any private stormwater management
facilities or erosion control devices require maintenance, repair, or replacement, but
such deficiencies do not create a critical or imminent threat to adjacent properties, the
environment, or other stormwater facilities, the party or parties responsible for the
continued operation of the facilities shall be given written notice of the findings, what
actions are required to correct the situation, and a timetable by which such activities
must be completed. Such parties shall have 15 days to reply to the city indicating their
response to the notice. If the responsible party or parties do not complete the necessary
activities stipulated by the city, the city council after notice and public hearing may order
that such activities are completed by the city or its designated contractor and that all
costs associated with such activities be certified by the city engineer to the city council.
The amount so charged shall be a lien upon the properties benefiting from and utilizing
the stormwater facilities maintained, repaired or replaced and shall be added to, and
become, and form part of the taxes next to be assessed and levied upon such
properties, and the council shall, by appropriate resolution, assess the costs above
mentioned against said properties, and certify the same to the county auditor of
Hennepin County, Minnesota. The same shall be collected and enforced in the same
manner as the collection of real estate taxes.
420.19. Notification and inspection
The applicant or its authorized agent shall notify the city at the following points
during the project:
(a) On completing installation of perimeter erosion and sedimentation
controls;
(b) On completing land-disturbing activities and putting into place measures
for final soil stabilization and revegetation;
(c) When the site has been permanently stabilized and revegetated; and
(d) When all temporary erosion and sedimentation controls have been
removed from the site.
420.21. Right of entry and inspection; noncompliance procedures
Subdivision 1. Right of entry and inspection. The applicant shall allow the city and its
authorized representatives, upon presentation of credentials to:
(a) Enter upon the permitted site for the purpose of obtaining information,
examination of records, conducting investigations or surveys;
(b) Bring such equipment on to the permitted development as is necessary to
conduct such surveys and investigations;
(c) Examine and copy any books, papers, records, or memoranda pertaining
to activities or records required to be kept under the terms and conditions
of the permitted site;
(d) Inspect the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan measures required by
the city; and
(e) Sample and monitor any items or activities pertaining to any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
Subd. 2. Notice of noncompliance.
In the event work does not conform to the approved Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan or requirements listed in the provisions of this section, the city engineer
or authorized representative shall issue a written notice of noncompliance to the
applicant detailing the corrective actions necessary for compliance. The applicant shall
conduct the corrective actions within the time period determined by the city. If an
imminent hazard exists, the city may require that the corrective work begin immediately.
Subd. 3. Stop inspection.
If corrective actions identified in the notice of noncompliance are not completed
by the time period determined by the city, the city engineer or authorized representative
shall stop all inspections required for land use or building permit approvals until all
corrective actions identified in the notice of noncompliance are completed. The
applicant shall notify the city engineer or authorized representative upon completion of
the corrective action and the city shall resume inspections on the permitted property no
later than the following business day.
Subd. 4. Special assessment.
If corrective action is not taken within 14 working days after the city stops all
inspections required for land use or building permit approvals, the city may conduct the
necessary work to bring the site into compliance with this section and the approved
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan. The city may assess the cost of completing the
necessary work against the affected property. As a condition of obtaining the
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan permit, the owner shall waive notice of hearing
and hearing on the special assessment to be levied by the city, concur that the benefit
to the property exceeds the amount of the proposed assessment, and waive all rights
under Minnesota Statute 429.081 to challenge the amount or validity of assessment.
420.23. Enforcement.
Subdivision 1. Penalties.
Any person, firm, or corporation failing to comply with or violating any term of this
section, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Each day that a violation exists shall
constitute a separate offense. The city may also suspend any land use or building
permits until the land owner has corrected the violation.
Subd. 2. Where this section imposes greater restrictions than other ordinances of the
city or provisions of this code, this section shall prevail. All other ordinances of the city
inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency
only.

CHAPTER V - PLANNING AND LAND USE
Section 500: Subdivision Regulations
500.01 Subdivision Regulations
Subdivision 1. UAuthorityU.
Pursuant to the powers and jurisdictions vested through Minnesota Statutes,
chapters 412 and 462, and other applicable laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations
of the state, the city does hereby exercise the power and authority to review, approve,
and disapprove subdivisions of land within the corporate limits of the city. By the same
authority, the city does exercise the power and authority to pass and approve the
development of subdivisions of land already recorded in the county recorder's office if
such subdivisions are entirely or partially undeveloped.
Subd. 2. UPolicy.
(a) It is the policy of the city to consider the subdivision of land and the
subsequent development of subdivided land as subject to the control of
the city pursuant to the official comprehensive municipal plan of the city
and this section for the orderly, planned, efficient, and economical
development of the city.
(b) Land to be subdivided will be of such character that it can be used safely
for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood, or

intention and serves as the basis for conceptual discussion
between the city and the applicant. The purpose of the
review is to allow staff, the park and planning commissions,
and the city council an opportunity to guide the applicant as
to what is generally expected by the city, and to alert an
applicant to potential problems with the proposal. This
feedback can then be used by an applicant to make an
informed decision on whether to proceed with a formal
preliminary application. The sketch plan review does not
require any formal approval or denial from the city council.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 24 of 301
2) Preliminary Plat staff review. All Class III subdivisions must
be completed by submittal of a plat. The planning
department will coordinate the review of preliminary plat by
all appropriate city staff persons and governmental agencies.
Staff will notify by mail—at a minimum—property owners
within 500 feet that a public hearing will be held regarding
the proposed preliminary plat.
3) Referral to other agencies. The planning department will
contact other government agencies or jurisdictions as
appropriate to seek staff assistance, information, and
comments.
4) Parks and recreation commission review. The park and
recreation commission will study the proposed development
and recommend action to the city council with regard to land
dedication, trail easement dedication, cash in-lieu, park and
trail development, and/or the provision of open space or
greenway areas. The park and recreation commission is
required to provide information to the applicant as to how the
subdivision relates to the Park, Trail, and Open Space Plan
and provide a recommendation to the city council.
5) Planning commission review. At the advertised time and
place, the planning commission will hold a public hearing
which will constitute the platting authority public hearing as
required by Minnesota Statutes. Notice of the hearing will
consist of the time and place thereof, the address of the
property and a brief description of the proposal including
applicant’s name, number of lots proposed, and the proposed
use thereof, and will be published in the official newspaper at
least ten days prior to the meeting. Written notification of said
meeting must be mailed at least ten days prior to all owners
of land set forth on the property owner's list within 500 feet of
the boundary of the property in question. The
recommendations of the city staff and governmental agencies
will be clearly addressed to the planning commission. At the
discretion of the planning commission, the public hearing may
be closed or may be held open for additional information. The
planning commission will recommend approval, conditionally
approve or disapprove of the preliminary plat for city council
consideration.
6) Preliminary plat city council review. The city council should
approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the preliminary
plat within the time deadlines established by Minnesota
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 25 of 301
statutes. Particular attention will be given to the record
developed by the planning commission study of the proposal
and to the recommendation of the park and recreation
commission and city staff. The city council may accept an
extension to the state mandated review deadline if offered by
the applicant and desired by the council.
7) City council resolution. The action for approval or denial shall
be in form of a resolution and sent to the applicant upon
approval. The city council will consider if the preliminary plat
is consistent with the following:
i) The plat is consistent with the comprehensive plan or
other similar plan;
ii) The plat does conform with existing zoning and
subdivision regulations, and other applicable city code
provisions or laws;
iii) The plat does not create conflict with existing
easements;
iv) Adequate public infrastructure, including, but not
limited to, roads, utilities, storm water systems,
emergency services, schools, exist to support the
additional development potential created by the plat;
v) The additional development created by the plat does
not increase traffic levels beyond the capacity of existing
roads;
vi) The lots to be platted are configured to accommodate
the proposed development to ensure compliance with
zoning regulations, including, but not limited to the
residential building design standards under subsection
505.07 subd.12;
vii) The plat is designed to mitigate potential negative
impacts upon the environment, including, but not limited
to, topography; steep slopes; trees; vegetation; naturally
occurring lakes, ponds, rivers and streams; susceptibility
of the site to erosion and sedimentation; drainage;
susceptibility of the site to flooding; and stormwater
storage needs; and
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 26 of 301
viii) The plat is not detrimental to the health, safety, or
general welfare of the public.
8) Grading prior to final plat approval. Subsequent to
preliminary plat approval by the city council, the applicant
may apply for an excavation permit from the city and upon
receipt of such permit may commence construction to the
grades and elevations required by the approved preliminary
plat. The permit must be reviewed in accordance with the
excavation/fill permit requirements, and may not be issued
until the grading plans are approved by the city engineer and
other appropriate agencies.
9) Failure to file a complete final plat application within 180
days of preliminary plat approval will be construed as formal
withdrawal of the proposed subdivision, unless an extension
is requested in written form prior to the deadline of the
expiration of the preliminary plat. Renewal of any proposed
subdivision after this deadline will require a new sketch plan
application including application form, material submittals
and fee payments.
10) Final plat staff review.
i) The planning department will review the final plat
application for conformity with the zoning regulations of
the city and this section and with the conditions and
requirements of preliminary plat approval, and will
certify the status of same to the city council. The final
plat must be consistent with the preliminary plat
approval.
ii) The city attorney and city engineer will review the
record plat drawing, easements, deeds, covenants,
agreements and other documents for proper legal
form, proper representation and complete execution by
all required parties, all to uphold the interests of the
city, and will certify the approval of the above to the
city council.
11) City council review. The city council will approve or
disapprove all final plat applications by resolution which will
set forth in detail any conditions to which the approval is
subject, or reasons for disapproval. No vested rights shall
accrue to any plat by reason of preliminary or final plat
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 27 of 301
approval, except as established by statute. All requirements,
conditions, or regulations adopted by the city applicable to
the subdivision or to all subdivisions generally shall be
deemed a condition for any subdivision approval or issuance
of building permits for lots in a previously approved
subdivision.
12) Development Agreement. In a development agreement, the
city council will stipulate the period of time when the letter of credit
shall be filed and the required improvements installed. In no event
shall the period of time stipulated by the city council for completion
of required improvements exceed two years from the date of the
final resolution. The development agreement shall be signed and
returned to the city, along with payments of all applicable
development fees, submission of the letter of credit, and
submission of any other legal documents or requirements as
specified in the development agreement or final plat resolution.
Upon receipt of these required submissions, the signed mylars and

500.21 Registered Land Surveys
Subdivision 1. UPurposeU.
Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 508.47, subdivision 6, the
purpose of registered land surveys is to "simplify the description of the registered
land in connection with its transfer. Land conveyed by reference to a registered
land survey will be deemed to be conveyed by metes and bounds." Before filing
any registered land survey in the office of the county recorder, all such surveys
will be approved in the manner required for the approval of subdivision plats,
including the provision of mounted and reproducible copies and endorsement by
the city.
Subd. 2. URegistered land surveys for final plat reviewU.
Registered land surveys will be accepted for final plat review subject to the
following conditions:
(a) Registered land surveys may be submitted in lieu of record plats for
Class I and Class II subdivisions;
(b) Registered land surveys may be required for Class I subdivisions
by resolution of the city council or by order of the district court
(Minnesota Statutes, section 507.48, subdivision 2);
(c) Registered land surveys will not be accepted for expedited or Class
III subdivisions which must be submitted in the form of record plat
drawings;
(d) All parcels of land shown on registered land surveys will be clearly
identified by letter designation.
500.23 Lot Improvements
All public and/or private improvements required by the city to be
completed by the subdivider prior to final plat approval, will be fully completed
and will have had a certificate of satisfactory completion issued by the city
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 40 of 301
engineer prior to endorsement of the final plat by the city. All public and/or private
improvements required by the city to be completed by the subdivider after final
plat approval will be fully set forth in a subdivider's agreement to be executed
prior to final plat approval.
Subdivision 1. ULetter of credit to include lot improvementU.
The letter of credit will include an amount to guarantee completion of all
requirements contained in this subsection including, but not limited to, soil
preservation, final grading, lot drainage, lawn-grass seeding, removal of debris
and waste, fencing, and all other lot improvements required by the city council.
Subd. 2. ULot arrangementU.
The lot arrangement will be such that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building
permits to build on all lots in compliance with the zoning regulations of the city
and in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved
street.
Subd. 3. ULot dimensionsU.
Lot dimensions will comply with the minimum standards of the zoning
regulations of the city. Where lots are more than double the minimum required
area for the zoning district, the city may require that such lots be arranged so as
to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would be
necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with the zoning
regulations of the city. In general, side lot lines will be at right angles to street
lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a
better street or lot plan. Dimensions of corner lots will be large enough to allow
for erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both
streets. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business,
commercial, or industrial purposes will be adequate to provide for the off-street
parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development
contemplated, as established in the zoning regulations of the city.
Subd. 4. UMinimum lot areaU.
The minimum area requirement for each proposed lot will be as prescribed
in the zoning regulations of the city.
Each proposed lot to be serviced by the public sanitary sewer system
must have a contiguous area of dry buildable land equal to at least thirty percent
of the minimum required lot area for that use district.
Each proposed lot to be serviced by an on-site sewer treatment system
must have:
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 41 of 301
(a) A contiguous area of dry buildable land equal to 10,000 square feet
for a principal structure; such 10,000 square feet must include an
area measuring at least 60 by 125 feet;
(b) A contiguous area of dry buildable land equal to 2,000 square feet
for an accessory structure; such 2,000 square feet need not be
immediately adjacent to the principal structure building site but
must be accessible over the subject lot;
(c) 14,000 square feet of contiguous possible drainfield area; such
14,000 square feet will be located such that it will reasonably
service the principal structure for which the drainfield is intended;
such 14,000 square feet of possible drainfield area may be situated
so as to have two separated sites of at least 7,000 square feet of
contiguous area each; and
(d) A septic site evaluation report must be completed by an evaluator
licensed by the state.
Any area of the proposed lot that meets the definitions of both dry
buildable land and possible drainfield area may be used to meet the minimum
requirements of either, but may not be used to satisfy the minimum requirements
of both.
Public and private rights-of-way, or vehicular or pedestrian easements
may not be used in order to meet any portion of the minimum lot area
requirements. This right-of-way and easement provision will not apply to
subdivisions in the AP-agriculture preservation zoning districts.
Subd. 5. ULakeshore lotsU.
The granting of any easements which purport to grant access to a lake to
any person for any uses, including but not limited to docking, mooring, swimming,
and launching of boats is prohibited, except as allowed by chapter VI.
Subd. 6. UDouble frontage lots and access to lotsU.
(a) Double frontage and reversed frontage lots must be avoided except
where necessary to provide separation of residential development
from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation.
(b) Lots must not, in general, derive access exclusively from an arterial
roadway. Where driveway access from any arterial roadway may
be necessary for several adjoining lots, the city council may require
that such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to
limit possible traffic hazard on such roadway. Where possible,
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 42 of 301
driveways must be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring
vehicles to back into traffic on any arterial roadway.
Subd. 7. USoil preservation, grading and seedingU.
(a) No certificate of occupancy will be issued until final grading has
been completed in accordance with the approved final plat and the
lot precovered with soil with an average depth of at least six inches
which will contain no particles over two inches in diameter over the
entire area of the lot, except that portion covered by buildings or
included in streets, or where the grade has not been changed or
natural vegetation seriously damaged. All public and private
improvements will be in accordance with the Minnetrista
Engineering Standards and any amendments or new standards
adopted thereto.
(b) Lawn-grass seed will be sown at not less than four pounds to each
1,000 square feet of land area. In the spring, the seed will be sown
between March 15 and May 15; and in the fall, the seed will be
sown between August 15 and September 30 on any disturbed
areas. The seed will consist of a maximum of ten percent rye grass
by weight and a minimum of ninety percent of permanent bluegrass
and/or fescue grass by weight. All seed will have been tested for
germination within one year of the date of seeding, and the date of
testing will be on the label containing the seed analysis. All lots will
be seeded from the roadside edge of the unpaved right-of-way
back to a distance of 25 feet behind the principal residence on the
lot. No certificate of occupancy will be issued until respreading of
soil and seeding of lawn has been completed; except that between
October 1 and March 15, and between May 15 and August 15, the
applicant must submit an agreement in writing signed by the
subdivider and the property owner, with a copy to the planning
department, that respreading of soil and seeding of lawn will be
done during the immediately following planting season as set forth
in this section, and leave a cash escrow for performance in such
amount as will be determined by the planning department. Sod may
be used to comply with any requirement of seeding set forth herein.
(c) Lots will be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all
buildings and individual lot drainage will be coordinated with the
general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage will be
designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from
each lot to adjacent lots.
Subd. 8. UDebris and wasteU.
No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish, or any
other waste materials of any kind will be buried in any land, or left or deposited
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 43 of 301
on any lot or street at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy on a
subdivision. No such material will be left or deposited in any area of the
subdivision at the time of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of
public improvements, whichever occurs first.
Subd. 9. UFencingU.
Each subdivider will be required to furnish and install fences wherever the
city council determines that a hazardous condition may exist. The fences must be
constructed according to standards established by the city engineer. No
certificate of occupancy will be issued until the fence improvements have been
duly installed.
Subd. 10. UBodies of water and watercoursesU.
If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, marsh, wetlands, or a
portion thereof, lot lines must be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of
those areas among the fee owners of adjacent lots. The city council may approve
an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe
maintenance of those areas is so placed that it will not become the city’s
responsibility. Where a watercourse separates the buildable lot area of a lot from
the street by which it has access, provisions will be made for installation of a
culvert or other structure, of design approved by the city engineer.
500.25 Roads
Subdivision 1. Public Roads
Public streets and roads will be required to be platted, constructed and
dedicated to the city when required by the city council consistent with the
recommendations of the planning commission and the city staff and the
established city practices and design standards. Public roads must be completed
and issued a certificate of satisfactory completion by the city engineer prior to
final plat approval or, when specifically authorized by the city council, will be
subject to the conditions of a subdivider's agreement to be executed prior to final
plat approval.
Subd. 2. Private Roads
(a) Dedication to the public. Dedication of all roadways to the public is the
clear and definite preference of the city council. If, however, the construction of a
private roadway would better preserve and protect sensitive environmental
features, the city council may require or allow private roadways in any zoning
district.
(b) Private roadways in the AP & A zoning districts. The city council may
allow or require private roadways in the AP and A zoning districts, if the city
council finds that:
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 44 of 301
(1) The property is being developed to the maximum density
allowed by the zoning regulations of the city and the
comprehensive plan;
(2) There is no existing or potential need for through streets to
provide for adequate traffic development patterns;
(3) The proposed subdivision will not result in the landlocking of
proposed lots or the continued landlocking of existing lots which lie
adjacent to the proposed subdivision; and
(4) The proposed private roadway will be adequately maintained
by private means in such a manner as to assure continued safe
and quality access for pedestrians, bicyclists, utilities and vehicles,
including emergency service and maintenance vehicles.
(b) Private roadways must meet the following conditions:
(1) The subdivider must identify the private roadway on the final
plat as a separate outlot at least 50 feet in width if it is a through
street;
(2) The subdivider must identify the private roadway on the final
plat as a separate outlot at least 50 feet in width if it is not a through
street;
(3) The subdivider will provide for a permanent homeowner’s
association with a road maintenance agreement in order to ensure
ownership and maintenance of the roadway outlot;
(4) The proposed private roadway will be adequately maintained
by private means in such a manner as to assure continued safe
and quality access for pedestrians, bicyclists, utilities and vehicles,
including emergency service and maintenance vehicles;
(5) The ownership of the roadway outlot will be perpetually
vested in the homeowner’s association;
(6) The subdivider must construct the private roadway in
accordance with city standards and specifications;
(7) The subdivider must file the necessary bonds with the city to
assure proper construction and satisfactory condition of the private
roadway;
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 45 of 301
(8) The proposed lots which will be served by the private
roadway must meet all of the minimum requirements of the zoning
regulations of the city;
(9) The subdivider will dedicate underlying public roadway and
utility easement over the roadway outlot to the city in a form
acceptable to the city;
(10) The subdivider will establish on-street parking restrictions on
the private roadway, in a form acceptable to the city, including the
installation of necessary signage; and
(11) The subdivider will file the necessary documents, in a form
acceptable to the city, in the title of all proposed lots which will be
served by the private roadway, specifically stating that the city has
no obligation, now or in the future, to provide services to that
roadway.
Subd. 3. Road Design Standards
(a) Generally. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width, and
improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access
to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation, and road maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and
avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the design standards for roads in
this part are required and the construction of all public and private improvements
will be in accordance with the Minnetrista Engineering Standards and any
amendments or new standards adopted thereto.
(b) Road surfacing and improvements. After sewer and water utilities
have been installed by the subdivider, the subdivider will construct all road
pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, cul-de-sacs,
and sidewalks in conformance with all construction standards, and specifications
adopted by the city or city engineer and will be incorporated into the construction
plans required to be submitted to the subdivider for final plat approval.
The subdivider will construct roadways in the AP, A, SDD, RDB, R-1, R-2,
R-3, R-4, R-5, C-1, C-2, C-3, I and Planned Unit Development zoning districts to
be paved standards, at subdivider’s expense, in accordance with engineering
standards.
(c) Roadway classification. All roadways must be classified as one or
more of the following:
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 46 of 301
(1) Principal arterial, which is a roadway intended to connect
urban subregions with one another, connect urban and rural service
areas with metro centers, to connect outstate cities;
(2) Roadway, private, which is any roadway for which the city or
other political subdivision will not be responsible for its maintenance
and operation;
(3) Roadway, public, which is any roadway for which the city or
other political subdivision is or expects to be responsible for its
maintenance and operation;
(4) Intermediate arterial, which is a roadway intended to connect
two or more subregions; provide secondary connections outstate. It
complements principal arterials in high volume corridors;
(5) Minor arterial, which is a roadway intended to connect
adjacent subregions and activity centers within subregions;
(6) Collector, which is a roadway intended to connect
neighborhoods within and between subregions;
(7) Local, which is a roadway intended to connect blocks within
neighborhoods and specific activities within homogeneous land use
areas;
(8) Parkway, which is a local roadway intended to provide low
speed and low volume vehicular or bicycle access to or through
recreational areas, parks, lakeshore;
(9) Roadway, deadend, which is a roadway with only one
vehicular-traffic outlet.
(d) Right-of-way specifications.
(1) The minimum right-of-way widths must be as follows:
(i) For principal arterial, intermediate arterial and minor
arterials, as recommended by the city’s comprehensive
transportation plan;
(ii) For collectors, 80 feet;
(iii) For locals, 60 feet;
(iv) For parkways, 100 feet;
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 47 of 301
(v) For cul-de-sacs, 60 feet;
(vi) Private roadways must be placed in a 50-foot wide
outlot and built to public road standards, in conformance with
specifications or engineering standards adopted by the city
council.
(2) Rights-of-way needed for future roadways in the opinion of
the city must be provided.
(3) Right-of-way widths or additional widths must be provided in
existing rights-of-way in excess of the standards designated in this
section due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide
adequate earth slopes. Such slopes will be in excess of three to
one.
(e) Railroads and limited access roadways. Railroad rights-of-way and
limited access roadways where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands must be treated as follows:
(1) In resident districts a buffer strip at least 25 feet in
depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the
district will be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or
limited access roadway. This strip will be platted as an outlot;
(2) In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses
the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the
railroad will be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable
depth of commercial or industrial sites;
(3) Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street
which crosses the railroad at grade will be at a distance of at least
150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance will be
determined with due consideration of the minimum distance
required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate
approach gradients;
(4) Streets crossing the railroads will be avoided.
(f) Intersections.
(1) Streets will be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets
at an angle of less than 75 degrees will not be acceptable. An
oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 48 of 301
should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet
therefrom. Not more than two streets will intersect at any one point
unless specifically approved by the city.
(2) Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing
street will coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite
side of such street. Intersection jogs with centerline offsets of less
than 150 feet will not be permitted, except where the intersected
street has separated dual drives without median breaks at either
intersection. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment
will be continuous. Intersection of major streets will be at least 800
feet apart.
(3) The minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local
streets will be at least 20 feet. The minimum curb radius at an
intersection involving a collector street will be at least 30 feet. Alley
intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block will
have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering
practice to permit safe vehicular movement.
(4) Intersections will be designed with a flat grade of at least 100
feet. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to the flat grade of the
intersection, a leveling area will be provided having not greater than
a two percent rate of change of vertical curvation for a distance of
100 feet, measured from the nearest point of the flat grade as
provided for herein.
(5) Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic
hazard by limiting visibility, the subdivider will cut such ground
and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of
the right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary by the city to
provide an adequate sight distance.
(6) The cross-slopes of all streets, including intersections, will
be two and a half percent or less.
Subd. 4. Road dedication and reservations
(a) Street systems in new subdivisions must be laid out so as to
eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing
half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street will be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The city
may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider
improves and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width
within subdivider’s own subdivision boundaries.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 49 of 301
(b) Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road or when the
comprehensive municipal plan or some other agency indicates
plans for realignment, improvement or widening a road that would
require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the subdivider
will be required to improve and dedicate at subdivider’s expense
such areas for widening, improving or realignment of such roads.
Such frontage roads and streets will be improved and dedicated by
the subdivider at subdivider’s own expense to the full width as
required by this section.
(c) Land reserved for any road purposes may not be countered in
satisfying yard or area requirements of the zoning regulations of the
city whether the land is to be dedicated to the city in fee simple or
an easement is granted to the city.
Subd. 5. On-site roads
(a) Scope. This subsection applies to on-site roadways in subdivisions.
(b) Grading and improvement plan. Roadways must be graded and
improved and conform to the city’s construction standards and specifications and
must be approved as to design and specifications by the city engineer, in
accordance with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to final plat
approval.
(c) Topography and arrangement.
(1) Roadways must be related appropriately to the topography.
Roadways will be curved wherever possible to avoid conformity of
lot appearance. All roadways will be arranged so as to obtain as
many as possible of the building sites at, or above, the grades of
the streets. Grades of streets will conform as closely as possible to
the original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves
will be avoided. Specific standards are contained in the design
standards of this section.
(2) All streets will be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated right-of-way as
established in the comprehensive municipal plan.
(3) All thoroughfares will be properly related to specific traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools,
churches, and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the
pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
(4) Roadways will be laid out to conform as much as possible to
the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 50 of 301
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum
number of roadways necessary to provide convenient and safe
access to property.
(5) The gridiron roadway pattern need not necessarily be
adhered to, and the use of curvilinear roadways or U-shaped
roadways will be encouraged where such use will result in a more
desirable layout.
(6) Through streets are preferred by the city and will be required
in the majority of cases. Cul-de-sacs may be considered, if
environmental and topographic conditions so merit. Through streets
will be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided
or, if the adjacent property is undeveloped and the roadway must
temporarily be a dead-end roadway, the right-of-way will be
extended to the property line and a temporary cul-de-sac will be
dedicated and constructed.
(7) In business and industrial developments, the roadways and
other accessways will be planned in connection with the grouping
of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys,
truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas
so as to minimize conflict or movement between the various types
of traffic, including pedestrian.
(d) Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed arterial, the city may require that access to such
roadways be limited by one of the following means:
(1) The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the arterials and
front onto a parallel local or collector roadway. No access will be
provided from the arterial, and screening must be provided in a strip
of land along the rear property line of such lots;
(2) A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops
entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a
parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto
the arterial;
(3) A marginal access or service road separated from the
arterial by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at
suitable points.
(e) Road names and street addresses. The sketch plan as submitted will
not indicate any names upon proposed streets. The city must name all roads at
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 51 of 301
the time of preliminary plat approval and assign street addresses. The local
postmaster must be consulted by the planning department. Names must be
sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other road names in the city so
as not to cause confusion. A road which is or is planned as a continuation of an
existing road must bear the same name.
(f) Road regulatory signs.
(1) The subdivider must deposit with the city at the time of final
subdivision approval the sum of money as determined by the city
engineer for each road sign and the installation cost thereof. The
city will install all road signs before issuance of certificates of
occupancy for any residence on the streets approved.
(2) The city will place signs at all intersections within or abutting
the subdivision, the type and location of which to be approved by
the city engineer.
(g) Street lights. Installation of street lights will be required in the
following zoning districts: R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, Urban Planned Unit
Developments, and Commercial/Industrial districts.
(h) Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips will not be permitted
adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent
property to such street.
(i) Construction of roads and dead-end roads.
(1) The arrangement of roadways must provide for the
continuation of roadways between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic,
effective fire protection, for efficient provision of utilities, and where
such continuation is in accordance with the city comprehensive
municipal plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the
roadways must be temporarily dead-end roadways, the right-of-way
will be extended to the property line. The city may limit the length of
temporary dead-end roadways in accordance with the design
standards of this section.
(2) Where a roadway does not extend to the boundary of the
subdivision and its continuation is not required by the city for
access to adjoining property, its terminus will normally not be
nearer to such boundary than fifty feet. However, the city may
require the reservation of appropriate easement to accommodate
drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac must
be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end roadway in
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 52 of 301
accordance with the city's construction standards and
specifications.
Subd.6. Off-site roads
(a) Access to improved public roadways. No subdivision will be approved
unless the area to be subdivided will have adequate access from an existing
publicly dedicated and opened roadway. Such roadway must be suitably
improved as required by the city, the state or county. In the event the public
roadway, including but not limited to existing bridges, drainage structures,
lighting, shoulders, base, pavement, alignment or site distance, is not suitable to
handle the proposed additional vehicular traffic from the subdivision, the
subdivider at subdivider’s expense will be responsible for first improving the
public roadway to a standard acceptable to the city, to ensure that the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens presently using the roadway and in the future
will be protected and will not be adversely affected by the increased use of the
roadway caused by the subdivision. This improvement must be accomplished
prior to final plat approval unless the city agrees and the subdivider provides a
suitable letter of credit to complete the improvements in the subdivider's
agreement.
(b) Access to improved public roadways over existing private roadways.
Wherever the area to be subdivided is to utilize an existing private roadway in
order to gain access to the public roadway, such private roadway will be suitably
improved as provided in this subsection for public roadways.
500.31 Water Supply
Subdivision 1. UGeneral requirementsU.
(a) Necessary action will be taken by the subdivider to extend or
create a water-supply district for the purpose of providing a watersupply
system capable of providing domestic water use and fire
protection. All lots in new subdivisions within the municipal urban
service area will be connected to the city's water system.
(b) Where a public water main is accessible, the subdivider will
install adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) subject to
the specifications of the state or city. All water mains will be at least
six inches in diameter or as deemed necessary by the city engineer
for future service of water.
(c) Water main extensions must be approved by the city.
(d) To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants and all
water supply improvements and all improvements proposed to be
served, must be shown on the preliminary plat, and the cost of
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 53 of 301
installing same must be included in the performance bond to be
furnished by the subdivider.
Subd. 2. UIndividual wells and central water systemsU.
(a) In the discretion of the city, if a public water system is not
available, individual wells may be used or a central water system
provided in such manner that an adequate supply of potable water
will be available to every lot in the subdivision. Water samples must
be submitted to the state health department for its approval, and
individual wells and central water systems must be approved by the
appropriate health authorities. Orders of approval must be
submitted to the planning department.
(b) If the city requires that a connection to a public water main
be eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual
well or central water system, the subdivider must make
arrangements for future water service at the time the plat received
final approval. Performance or cash bonds may be required to
ensure compliance.
Subd. 3. UFire hydrantsU.
Where required, fire hydrants will be located within 225 feet of any
structure and will be approved by the city. To eliminate future street openings, all
underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves
and all other supply improvements must be installed before any final paving of a
street shown on the plat.
500.41 Plat Design Standards
Subdivision 1. UConformance to applicable rules and regulationsU.
In addition to the requirements established herein, all final plats will
comply with the following laws, rules and regulations:

The applicant will place permanent reference monuments in the
subdivision as required by state law.
Subd. 4. UCharacter of the landU.
Land which the city council finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or
development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, soil conditions,
rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or
other features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general
welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its
surrounding areas, will not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods
are formulated by the developer and approved by the city council, upon
recommendation of the city engineer, to solve the problems created by the
unsuitable land conditions. Such land will be set aside for uses as will not involve
such a danger.
Subd. 5. UConditionally buildable slopes
Conditionally buildable slopes, as defined, may be used to meet the
minimum required amount of dry buildable land for any proposed lot only if the
following provisions are satisfied:
(a) If the conditionally buildable slope is not to be disturbed by

buildings; existing topography at a contour interval
sufficiently detailed to define the topography over the entire
conditionally buildable slope; within 50 feet of a potential or
proposed construction site each tree over four inches in
diameter at a height of six feet above grade must be located
to scale; the location of dense undergrowth and bushes; the
location of any existing exposed soil; and the location of any
proposed vegetation removal.
(3) No clear cutting will be permitted.
(4) An erosion and sedimentation plan satisfactory to the
city council and city engineer must be submitted at the time
of final plat application. This erosion and sedimentation plan
must include at least the following: contour lines that extend
a minimum of 100 feet off-site, or sufficient to show on- and
off-site drainage; the site's property lines must be shown in
true location with respect to topographic information; the
location of proposed excavations and fills, of on-site storage

Hennepin Conservation District, and/or must be approved by
the city engineer prior to final plat approval.
(6) Slope stability information satisfactory to the city
engineer and city council must be submitted at the time of
final plat application.
(7) If the proposed subdivision includes any lot which will
not be serviced by the public sanitary sewer system, and a
potential or proposed on-site septic system drainfield site is
located within 50 feet of the toe of any conditionally
buildable slope, then at the time of final plat application
such information must be submitted as required by the city
engineer to complete a review of the drainfield's effect upon
the stability of the slope.
(8) Prior to final plat approval or the issuance of any
permits, a hold harmless agreement must be executed,
which must indemnify the city, its officials, agents, and
employees from any and all action due to events resulting
from construction upon or use of any conditionally buildable
slope.
Subd. 6. USubdivision nameU.
The proposed name of the subdivision will not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered
by this section. The city council will have final authority to approve the name of
the subdivision which will be determined at preliminary plat.
Subd. 7. UGeneral construction standards and specificationsU.
The construction of all public and private improvements will be in
accordance with the Minnetrista Engineering Standards and any amendments or
new standards adopted thereto.
500.43 Preservation of Natural Features and Amenities
Subdivision 1. UGenerallyU.
Existing features which would add value to residential development or to
the city as a whole, such as trees, as herein defined, watercourses and falls,
beaches, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, will be preserved in the
design of the subdivision. No trees will be removed from any subdivision nor any
change of grade of the land effected until approval of the preliminary plat has
been granted. All trees on the plat required to be retained will be preserved, and
all trees where required will be welled and protected against change of grade.
The vegetation map will show the number and location of existing trees, as
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 57 of 301
required by this section and will further indicate all those marked for retention,
and the location of all proposed shade trees required along the street side of
each lot as required by this section.
Subd. 2. UShade trees planted by subdividerU.
(a) As a requirement of subdivision approval, the city may require that
subdivider plant shade trees on the property of the subdivision.
Such trees are to be planted within five feet of the right-of-way of
the road or roads within and abutting the subdivision, or, at the
discretion of the city, within the right-of-way of such roads. One tree
will be planted for every 40 feet of frontage along each road unless
the city council, upon recommendation of the city engineer, will
grant a waiver. Such waiver will be granted only if there are trees
growing along such right-of-way or on the abutting property which
in the opinion of the city council comply with this section.
(b) New trees to be provided pursuant to this section will be approved
by the city engineer and will be planted in accordance with the
specifications of the city engineer. Such trees will have a minimum
trunk diameter (measured 12 inches above ground level) of not less
than two inches. Only oak, honey locust, hard maples, or other
long-lived shade trees, acceptable to the city engineer and to the
city council, will be planted.
500.44 Variances
Subdivision 1.
The planning commission may recommend, and the city council may
approve, a variance from the requirements of this ordinance. A variance may be
granted in accordance with Section 505.05 Subd. 9.
500.45 Non-residential Subdivision
Subdivision 1. UGenerallyU.
(a) If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for commercial
or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect to
such land will make such provision as the city council may require.
(b) A nonresidential subdivision will also be subject to all the requirements
of the site plan approval set forth in the zoning regulations of the city.
Site plan approval and nonresidential subdivision plat approval may
proceed simultaneously at the discretion of the city council. A
nonresidential subdivision will be subject to all the requirements of this
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 58 of 301
section as well as such additional standards required by the city
council, and will conform to the proposed land use and standards
established in the comprehensive municipal plan, and the zoning
regulations of the city.
Subd. 2. UStandardsU.
In addition to the principals and standards in this section, which are
appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, in the case of nonresidential
subdivision, the subdivider will demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city council
that the street, parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the
uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards will be observed:
(a) Proposed industrial parcels will be suitable in area and dimensions
to the types of industrial development anticipated;
(b) Street rights-of-way and pavement will be adequate to
accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be
generated thereupon;
(c) Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to
street, curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and construction;
(d) Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to
the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and
stormwater drainage;
(e) Every effort will be made to protect adjacent residential areas from
potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial
subdivision, including the provision of extra depth in parcels
backing up on existing or potential residential development and
provisions for a permanently landscaped buffer strip when
necessary;
(f) Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic, will not
normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
500.47 Park Dedication Requirements
Subdivision 1. URequiredU. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section
462.358, subd. 2b, the city requires all subdividers to dedicate to the city or
preserve for public use as parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, open
space or areas of natural and environmental significance a reasonable portion of
the buildable land of the subdivision. For the purposes of this section, a
“subdivider” means any party separating an area, parcel, or tract of land under
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 59 of 301
single ownership into two or more parcels, tracts, lots, or long-term leasehold
interests. The city council, at its discretion, may elect to require in lieu of land an
equivalent cash payment based on the fair market value of the buildable land no
later than the time of final subdivision approval. Any cash payment shall be
placed in a special fund and used only for the purposes for which it was obtained,
including the acquisition and development or improvement of the public park
system or debt retirement in connection with land previously acquired. The form
of contribution (cash or land, or any combination thereof) shall be decided by the
city council based upon need and conformance with the comprehensive plan and
the park plan therein. For purposes of this section, “buildable land” means the
gross acreage of all property in the subdivision excluding wetlands designated by
federal or state agencies, areas below the 100-year ordinary high water
elevations and arterial streets and roadways.
[Revised 02/04/2008, Ordinance 319]
Subd. 2. UAdministrative proceduresU. The city council shall establish the
administrative procedures deemed necessary to implement the provisions of this
section, including all those required by Minnesota Statute, section 462.358.
[Revised 02/04/2008, Ordinance 319]
Subd. 3. UDedicated land requirementsU. Any land dedicated to the public
as a requirement of this section shall be reasonably useable for one or more of
the public purposes for which it is acquired. Factors used in evaluating the utility
of the area proposed to be dedicated shall include size, shape, topography,
drainage, geology, tree cover, access and location.
Subd. 4. UStandards for determinationU. The parks and recreation
commission may from time to time recommend changes to the standards and
guidelines established by this section for determining which portion of each
subdivision should reasonably be required for public dedication. Such standards
and guidelines may take into consideration the zoning classification to be
assigned to the buildable land, the particular use proposed for such land,
amenities to be provided and factors of density and site development as
proposed by the subdivider.
[Revised 02/04/2008, Ordinance 319]
Subd. 5. UParks and recreation commission recommendationU. For each
subdivision, the parks and recreation commission shall recommend to the city
council the total area and location of the land that should be dedicated within the
subdivision for public use.
Subd. 6. UArea of dedicated landU. Subdividers shall be required to dedicate
to the city for use as parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, open space,
or areas of natural and environmental significance the percentage of the
buildable land of the subdivision or the equivalent fair market value in cash as set
out below:

(b) For commercial and industrial subdivisions, the subdivider shall, at
the discretion of the city council, dedicate five percent of the
buildable land area of the subdivision or an equivalent amount of
cash in lieu.
(c) UMaximum paymentsU. In no event shall the cash in lieu payment
exceed $25,000 per residential lot.
[Revised 02/04/2008, Ordinance 319]
Subd. 7. UExemption for newly created lots with an existing dwelling or
structure.
For residential subdivisions on which a dwelling unit currently exists, the
required dedication shall not apply to the resulting lot containing the existing
home. For commercial and industrial subdivisions on which there is an existing
permitted or conditionally permitted use, the required dedication shall not apply to
the resulting lot containing the existing use.
Subd. 8. UFuture subdivisionsU. Any land which is further subdivided shall
be subject to the park dedication requirements in effect at the time of such
additional subdivision. Previously subdivided property from which a park
dedication has been received, being resubdivided with the same number of lots,
is exempt from park dedication requirements. If, as a result of resubdividing the
property, the number of lots is increased, then the park dedication or per-lot cash
fee must apply only to the net increase of lots. In no event shall the city be liable
for any repayment because of a subsequent reduction in the required park
dedication.
[Revised 02/04/2008, Ordinance 319]
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 61 of 301
Subd. 9. UCash contribution in lieu of landsU.
(a) In subdivisions in which the amount of land to be dedicated to the
public is less than the amount required in Section 500.47,
subdivision 6, the city council shall require a cash contribution by
the subdivider in lieu of dedication of the additional land. The
amount of cash to be contributed shall be based upon the fair
market value of the equivalent land that would otherwise have been
dedicated.
(b) For purposes of this section, the fair market value means the value
of the land at a time no later than final subdivision approval,
determined in accordance with the following:
(1) The planning department shall make a recommendation to
the city council regarding the fair market value of the land,
after consultation with the subdivider.
(2) The city council, after reviewing the planning department’s
recommendation, may agree with the planning department
or the subdivider, as to the fair market value. If agreement is
not reached in this matter, the fair market value shall be
determined in accordance with one of the following:
a. Fair market value as determined by the city council
based upon a current appraisal submitted to the city
by the subdivider at its expense. The appraisal shall
be made by appraiser who is a member of SREA or
MAI, or an equivalent real estate appraisal society; or
b. If the city council disputes such appraisal, it may
obtain a second appraisal of the land by a qualified
real estate appraiser whom the city council selects,
which appraisal may be accepted by the city as being
an accurate appraisal of fair market value. The cost of
the second appraisal shall be paid by the subdivider.
Subd. 10. ULands designated for public use on official map or
comprehensive land use plan.U Where a proposed park, recreational facility,
playground, trail, open space, or area of natural and environmental significance
that has been indicated in the comprehensive plan or park plan is located in
whole or in part within a proposed subdivision, such proposed public site shall be
designated as such and shall be dedicated to the city by the subdivider.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 62 of 301
Subd. 11. UDensity and open space requirementsU. Land area dedicated for
public use under this section may not be used to calculate the density
requirements of the subdivision. Additionally, land dedicated under this section
shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, open space requirements of the zoning
ordinance and standard development easements. At the discretion of the city
council, land set aside through conservation easements may be accepted, in
whole or in part, as a dedication if deemed to be of public benefit in achieving
goals established by the comprehensive plan and park plan.
[Revised 02/04/2008, Ordinance 319]
Subd. 12. UCredit for private open spaceU. Where private open space for
park and recreation purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such
space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the
subdivision, such areas may be used for credit at the discretion of the city council
against the requirement of dedication for public purposes, provided the city
council finds it is in the public interest to do so and that the following standards
are met:
(a) Yards, court areas, setbacks and other open space required to be
maintained by the zoning ordinance shall not be included in the
computation of such private open space;
(b) The private ownership and maintenance of the open space is
adequately provided for by written agreement;
(c) The private open space is restricted for park and recreation
purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of
the future owners of property within the subdivision and which
cannot be modified without the written consent of the city council;
(d) The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use
for park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such
factors as size, shape, topography, geology, drainage, access, and
location of the private open space land; and
(e) The facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial
accordance with the provisions of the recreational element of the
comprehensive plan, or park plan, and are approved by the city
council.
Under no circumstanceSsS, however, shall such credit for private facilities
exceed 25 percent of the amount required to be dedicated to the public
under this section.
Subd. 13. UFunding, accounting, budgeting, expenditure of cash in lieu of
landsU. All cash contributions received from subdividers in lieu of land dedicationSsS
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 63 of 301
shall be deposited into a separate fund to be used for the purposes for which the
cash was obtained, including acquisition of land, the development or
improvement of existing public sites, or for debt retirement in connection with
land previously acquired. The city council shall establish separate budgeting and
accounting procedures to oversee said fund.
[Revised 02/04/2008, Ordinance 319]
500.49 Homeowner’s Associations Agreements
The city council may, upon recommendation of the planning commission
and/or city staff require the subdivider to create a viable homeowner's
association, acceptable to the city which will be responsible for the ownership
and maintenance of among other things: common facilities, private roads, private
sewer and water lines, open space, pathways, storm drainage ways, and storm
drainage ponds, and any improvements which are not to be accepted by the city
for public ownership and maintenance. Such maintenance will include, among
other things, repair, replacement when necessary, snow removal, grass cutting,
weed control, clean-up of trash and debris, mosquito control, odor control, silt
removal from storm drainage ponds and drainage ways, and grading and
surfacing of private roads. If a reasonable maintenance standard is not
maintained by the homeowner's association, the city will have the right to take
corrective action it deems appropriate to protect the health, safety and welfare of
the public and to assess against said homeowner's association and/or the land in
the subdivision for all costs incurred therefor. Such corrective action will not
change the status of a private improvement. When a homeowner's association
agreement is required by the city, or whenever a subdivider intends to create a
homeowner's association, the form and content of the association agreement
must be approved by the city prior to final plat approval. Any proposed
homeowner's association agreement may be required to include the standard
provisions which are available from the city. The subdivider will submit three
copies of the executed association agreement, bylaws and articles of
incorporation for incorporated associations to the city attorney for review.
500.51 Subdivider’s Agreements
The city council may, upon recommendation of the planning commission
and/or city staff, require the subdivider to execute a subdivider’s agreement prior
to final plat approval. The subdivider’s agreement will set forth in the standard
city form those improvements required to be completed as a condition of
subdivision approval, the party responsible for the installation and maintenance
of the improvements, and the method of payment of the installation and
maintenance costs.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 64 of 301
500.53 Effective period of final plat approval
(a) The intent of the subdivision approval process is that final approval
will be granted only upon satisfactory completion of all
requirements by the subdivider, in which case plat certification and
recording will follow without delay. Whenever a final plat is
disapproved, or approved with modifications or conditions, the
subdivider will have 180 days to file an amended final plat including
the required changes, alterations or additions, to provide any
additional documents, agreements or letter of credit and to pay any
required fees or charges, all as set forth in the resolution of final
plat approval or disapproval.
(b) Failure of the subdivider to complete any or all requirements within
this time period will constitute a formal withdrawal of the proposed
subdivision. Renewal of any proposed subdivision after this
deadline but within 360 days of final approval or disapproval will
require a new preliminary plat application including application
form, material submittals and fee payment. Renewal of any
proposed subdivision one year or more after a final approval or
disapproval will require a complete subdivision review beginning
with the sketch plan and including new applications, material
submittals and fee payments, unless otherwise extended by the city
council.
500.55 Plat Certification
Subdivision 1. UScopeU.
Except as otherwise stated, this subsection applies to plat certification and
recording.
Subd. 2. UPurposeU.
Plat certification is the final stage of the subdivision review process.
Certification of plat approval by the city is required for legal recording of the
subdivision in the county recorder's office, which recording is required by state
statutes and this section for legal transfer of property ownership or interest.
Subd. 3. UGeneral requirementsU.
The legal documents, including record plat drawings, easements,

certification by the city of a subdivision plat and/or the acceptance and recording
of any easement or deed will not be deemed to constitute or imply acceptance by
the city of any streets, roads, easements or parts shown on the plat or identified
by easement or deed.
500.59 Effective period of plat certification and buildability
Plat certification by the mayor and city administrator is evidence that all
the requirements of this section and of the resolution of final plat approval have
been completed by the subdivider. Final plat certification will authorize transfer
and use of the land consistent with the provisions of chapters IV and zoning
regulations of the city in effect at the time of final plat approval. The city does not
guarantee or warrant that any lot created by approved subdivision is buildable or
usable in any way, and the city does not guarantee or warrant the continued
enforcement of the existence of chapter IV or zoning regulations or this section.
Consistent with the procedures established by state statute, this section, chapter
IV and the zoning regulations are subject to change and amendment, which
possible future change may adversely affect the transfer or use of any lot or tract
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 68 of 301
created by a subdivision approved under the provisions of this section. The fact
of city council approval, certification and filing of any subdivision does not grant
any vested rights to the owner of any such subdivided property.
500.61 Assurance of Completion and Maintenance of Improvements
Subdivision 1. UCompletion of required improvementsU.
Before the mayor and city administrator sign a final plat, the subdivider will
complete or agree to complete at subdivider’s cost all of the required public or
private improvements as required in this section and as specified in the
resolution approving the final plat and in the subdivider's agreement, and in the
case of public improvements, to dedicate same to the city, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances on the property and public improvements thus
dedicated.
Subd. 2. ULetter of creditU.
The city may waive the requirement that the subdivider complete certain
public and private improvements and dedicate certain public improvements prior
to the signing of the final plat, and that, as an alternative, require the subdivider
to provide a letter of credit at the time of the application for the final plat approval
in an amount estimated by the city engineer as sufficient to secure to the city the
satisfactory construction, installation, and where appropriate, dedication of the
incomplete portion of the required private and public improvement. The amount
of the letter of credit will be equal to one and one-half times the amount above
estimated. Such letter of credit will comply with all statutory requirements and be
satisfactory to the city attorney as to form and manner of execution. The letter of
credit will be irrevocable and allow the city to receive payments from the issuer of
the letter of credit in an amount sufficient to complete the improvements or repair
or replace any defective workmanship or materials. The period within which the
required public and private improvements must be completed will be specified by
the city in the resolution approving the final subdivision plat or in the subdivider's
agreement and will be incorporated in the letter of credit and will not exceed two
years from date of final plat approval. The city may, upon proof of difficulty,
extend the completion date set forth in such letter of credit for a maximum period
of one additional year. The city may at any time during the period of such letter of
credit accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the letter of credit.
Subd. 3. UTemporary improvementsU.
The subdivider will build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements
required by the city and will maintain same for the period specified by the city.
Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, subdivider will file
with the city a separate suitable letter of credit for temporary facilities, which letter
of credit will insure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed,
maintained and removed.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 69 of 301
Subd. 4. UCost of improvementsU.
All required public and private improvements will be made by the
subdivider, at subdivider’s expense, without reimbursement by the city.
Subd. 5. UGovernmental unitsU.
Governmental units to which these letters of credit and contract provisions
apply may file in lieu of a contract or letter of credit a certified resolution or
ordinance of that governmental unit agreeing to comply with the provisions of this
section.
Subd. 6. UFailure to complete required improvementsU.
For subdivisions for which no letter of credit has been posted, if the
improvements are not completed with the period specified by the city in the
resolution approving the final plat, the approval will be deemed to have expired.
In those cases where a letter of credit has been posted and required
improvements have not been installed within the term of such letter of credit and
resolution approving the final plat, the city may thereupon declare the developer
in default and draw down on the letter of credit and require that all improvements
be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time that
the letter of credit is declared to be in default. Moreover, the city may withhold
building permits and certificates of occupancy for lots in the subdivision until the
required improvements have been installed. In the event that the city undertakes
the installation of the required private improvements, the city by doing so, will not
undertake the subsequent maintenance of those private improvements.
Subd. 7. UAcceptance of dedication offersU.
Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of streets, public areas,
easements and parks for which the city thereafter will be responsible, will be by
resolution of the city. Acceptance of deeds and easements granting to the city
open space, drainage and conservation easements, underlying public road
easements, utility easements, will be by resolution approval of the final
subdivision plats, which acceptance will not be deemed to constitute or imply
acceptance of a formal dedication of those properties for which the city thereafter
would be responsible. The approval by the city of a final plat will not be deemed
to constitute or imply acceptance by the city of any streets, easement or park
shown on said plat. The city may require said plat to be endorsed with
appropriate notes to this effect.
Subd. 8. UInspectionsU.
The city may inspect required public and private improvements during
construction. The applicant will pay to the city an inspection fee of three percent
of the estimated cost of the required improvements, which fee will be paid to the
city prior to the signing of the resolution approving the final plat. If the city finds
upon inspection that any of the required improvements have not been
constructed in accordance with the city's construction standards and
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 70 of 301
specifications, the subdivider will be responsible for completing the
improvements and no building permits or certificates of occupancy will be issued
until the required improvements have been completed by the subdivider.
Wherever the cost of improvements is covered by a letter of credit, the subdivider
and the company providing the letter of credit will remain liable for completing the
improvements according to specifications.
Subd. 9. URelease of letter of creditU.
The city will not accept dedication of required improvements, nor release
nor reduce the amount of the letter of credit, until the city engineer has submitted
a certificate stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily
completed and until the subdivider's engineer or surveyor has certified to the city
engineer, through submission of detailed "as-built" construction drawing and
survey plat of the subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and
other information required by the city council or city engineer, that the layout of
the line and grade of all required improvements is in accordance with
construction plans for the subdivision. The city may require that a title insurance
policy be furnished to and approved by the city attorney indicating that the
required public improvements are free and clear of any and all liens and
encumbrances. Upon such approval and recommendation, the city may
thereafter accept the public improvements for dedication in accordance with the
established procedure.
Subd. 10. UReduction of letter of creditU.
The amount of a letter of credit may be reduced upon actual dedication of
public improvements or upon satisfactory completion of the private improvement
and then only to the ratio that the improvement bears to the total required
improvements for the plat. In no event will a letter of credit be reduced below
twenty-five percent of the principal amount until satisfactory completion of all
required improvements.
Subd. 11. UEscrow deposits for lot improvementsU.
(a) Whenever, by reason of the season of the year, any lot
improvements required by this section cannot be performed, the
planning department may, nevertheless, issue a certificate of
occupancy, provided there is no danger to health, safety, or general
welfare upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be
determined by the city engineer for the cost of the lot
improvements. The performance bond covering such lot
improvements will remain in full force and effect.
(b) All required lot improvements for which escrow monies have been
accepted by the planning department at the time of issuance of a
certificate of occupancy will be installed within a period of nine
months from the date of deposit and issuance of the certificate of
occupancy. In the event that the lot improvements have not been
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 71 of 301
properly installed, at the end of the time period the planning
department will give two weeks' written notice to the escrower
requiring escrower to install same, and in the event that same are
not installed properly, the planning department may request the city
council to authorize the city to proceed to contract out the work.
for the installation of the necessary lot improvements in a sum not
to exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the time of the
issuance of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow monies
are being deposited with the planning department, the escrower will
obtain and file with the planning department prior to obtaining the
certificate of occupancy a notarized statement from the purchaser
or purchasers of the premises authorizing the planning department
to install the improvements at the end of the nine month period in
the event that the same have not been duly installed by the
escrower.
Subd. 12. UMaintenance of required improvementsU.
(a) The subdivider will be required to maintain all private improvements
and individual lot improvements and provide for snow removal on
streets and sidewalks until acceptance of said private
improvements by a subsequent lot owner or homeowner's
association. The subdivider will be required to maintain all public
improvements and provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks until acceptance of the public improvements by
resolution by the city. If there are any certificates of occupancy
upon a street not already dedicated to and accepted by the city, the
city may on twelve hours' notice plow the street or effect emergency
repairs and charge the cost thereof to the subdivider and if the
subdivider fails to pay those amounts within ten days of a receipt
thereof, the city may declare a portion of the letter of credit to be
due and owing and to charge those monies against that portion of
the letter of credit.
(b) The subdivider will be required to file a warranty bond with the city,
prior to the issuance of the certificate of satisfactory completion, in
an amount considered adequate by the city engineer and in a form
satisfactory to the city attorney in order to insure the satisfactory
condition of the required public and/or private improvements,
including all lot improvements on the individual subdivided lots for a
period of one year after the date of the issuance of the certificate of
satisfactory completion.
Subd. 13. UDeferral of required improvementsU.
(a) The city may defer at the time of the approval of the final plat,
subject to appropriate conditions, the installation of any or all such
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 72 of 301
public or private improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite
in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare, or
which are inappropriate because of the inadequacy or lack of
connecting public or private improvements.
(b) Whenever it is deemed necessary by the city to defer the
construction of any public or private improvements required herein
because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or
lack of connecting public or private improvements, or for other
reasons, the subdivider will pay his estimated share of the cost of
the future improvements to the city prior to the signing of the final
plat, or the subdivider may post a letter of credit insuring completion
of the improvements upon demand of the city.
Subd. 14. UIssuance of building permits and certificates of occupancyU.
(a) When public and/or private improvements are required for a
subdivision, building permits and certificates of occupancy may be
issued subject only to the approval of the city council and will be
provided for in the subdivider's agreement.
(b) Building permits will not be issued to any lot which lot has access
only onto proposed public or private street unless such street has
been improved to the point so that it is adequate as determined by
the city engineer, for vehicular access by the prospective occupant,
by police and fire department and emergency vehicles.
(c) In no case will a certificate of occupancy be issued to any building
on any lot in the subdivision, which lot has access only on a new
public or private street until a certificate of satisfactory completion
has been issued for that public or private street. Allowances other
than provided in this section must be approved by the city council
and be documented within the subdivider’s agreement.
Subd. 15. UConsumer protection legislation and conflicts of interest
statutesU.
(a) No building permit or certificate of occupancy will be granted or
issued if the subdivider will have violated any federal, state, or local
law pertaining to consumer protection of real estate land sales,
promotion, or practices, or any applicable conflicts-of-interest
legislation with respect to the lot or parcel of land which is the
subject of the permit or certificate, until so ordered by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
(b) With respect to the lot or parcel of land, in the event a building
permit or certificate of occupancy has been granted or issued, it will
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 73 of 301
be subject to a revocation by the city until so ordered otherwise by
a court of competent jurisdiction.
(c) Any violation of a federal, state, or local consumer protection law
(including but not limited to: Postal Reorganization Act of 1970; the
Federal Trade Commission Act of 1970; Interstate Land Sales Full

property, the zoning of which is proposed to be changed;
(2) A recommendation of the planning commission; or
(3) Action of the city council.

(d) Referral to planning commission. Except in the case of initial
recommendation by the planning commission, any proposed
change will be submitted to the planning commission and its
recommendation thereon will be submitted to the city council,
before further proceedings are taken. Prior to making a
recommendation, the planning commission may hold whatever
public hearings it deems advisable in the manner provided in
section 505.05, subdivision 4. If no recommendation is transmitted

proposed amendment in the manner provided in section 505.05,
subdivision 4. After such hearings, the city council may vote upon
the adoption of any proposed amendment or it may refer it back to
the planning commission for further consideration. In considering
the proposed amendment, due allowance will be made for existing
conditions, for the conservation of property values, for the direction
of building development to the best advantage of the entire city,
and for the uses to which the property affected is being devoted at
the time. No change will be recommended unless it is required of
the public good, is in the interest of the public health, safety, and
welfare, and is compatible with the comprehensive plan of the city.
(f) Denial. The proposed amendment may be denied by motion
of the city council and such motion will constitute a finding and
determination by the city council that the conditions required for
approval do not exist.
Subd. 6. Site Plan Review
(a) The following shall require site plan review by the planning
commission and city council: all new uses and developments within
the public/semi-public facilities zoning district; all new uses or major
changes to existing uses in any zoning district that do not require
any other type of land use application; all non-residential
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 100 of 301
subdivisions, and any multi-family residential building design plans.
A “major change” shall be defined as any modification which
increases the size of the building(s) on the site or the use by more
than twenty-five percent. Any change to an existing use that does
not require any other type of land use application and does not
meet the definition of a “major change” under this section shall
require an administrative site plan review by city staff. City staff
has the discretion in these instances to require that the application
be reviewed by the planning commission and city council.
(b) The owner or developer shall submit an application for site
plan review to the city planning department. The application
shall be accompanied by the following information and
documentation to the extent that it is not otherwise required
by another land use application being made by the applicant
for the same site at the same time:
(1) the street address and legal description of the
property;
(2) the applicant’s name, address, telephone number and
interest in the property;
(3) the owner’s name, address and telephone number if
different from the applicant and the owner’s signed
consent to the filing of the application;
(4) the zoning classification, zoning district boundaries
and present use of the property;
(5) a survey showing property boundaries; existing
improvements, including utilities, drainage tiles and
wells; topography of the site and area within one
hundred feet of the property’s boundaries at two foot
contour intervals; existing trees and other significant
vegetation; easements of record, including the
dimensions thereof; and wetlands;
(6) a site plan of the proposed improvements showing all
buildings, including details of loading docks, parking
areas, driveways, access points, berms, easements
and adjacent public or private streets;
(7) floor plans and building elevations, including a list of
building materials, showing a sketch or computerMinnetrista
City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 101 of 301
generated image of proposed buildings as viewed
from surrounding properties;
(8) a site plan of existing uses on property adjacent to the
site, and within 100 feet of the property line, showing
the locations of any buildings, including loading
docks, entrances, and other significant features and
illustrating sight lines to proposed uses;
(9) a proposed grading plan at two foot contour intervals;
(10) a landscaping plan;
(11) a drainage and storm water plan;
(12) a utility plan;
(13) a sign plan;
(14) a lighting plan;
(15) a table of all proposed uses by type and square
footage, including estimated water and sanitary sewer
usage;
(16) a schedule of staging or timing of development; and
(17) an application fee.
Upon receipt of an application for a site plan review, the planning
department shall determine whether the application is complete. If
the application is not complete, the planning department shall notify
the applicant in writing that the application is not complete and shall
specify the additional documentation or information that the
applicant will be required to submit before the application will be
considered complete. When the application is complete and if the
application is not to be administratively reviewed by city staff, the
planning department shall refer the matter to the planning
commission for review.
(c) The planning commission shall review the proposed site plan
on the basis of the information and documentation submitted by the
applicant and any other information available to it. The review may
occur separately or in conjunction with any other city hearing or
review required under state statute, the city code or any other
applicable law or regulation regarding the same property or
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 102 of 301
development and occurring at the same time. The planning
commission shall review the proposed site plan to determine
whether it is consistent with the requirements of the city code,
including the applicable performance standards and the purpose of
the zoning district in which the property is located. Following the
review, the planning commission shall recommend to the city
council that the site plan be approved, approved with conditions or
denied.
(d) The city council shall consider the recommendations of the
planning commission after receipt of its report and may consider
any additional information or conduct such additional review as it
determines would serve the public interest. The city council shall
make its decision to approve, approve with conditions or deny the
site plan. The city council may condition its approval in any manner
it deems reasonably necessary in order to promote the public
health, safety or welfare, to achieve compliance with applicable
laws and regulations, or to accomplish the purposes of the zoning
district in which the property is located. In the event that no permits
have been issued and no work has commenced on the site and one
year has passed from the date of final action by the city council, the
site plan approval by the city council shall expire. At that time, the
approval granted by the city council shall be null and void and no
permits may be issued. An extension, not to exceed one additional
year, to the expiration date may be granted by the city council for
good cause upon a written request by the applicant.
(e) An application to amend an approved site plan shall be
reviewed under this section in the same manner as an initial
application for a site plan review except that any change, addition
or expansion which qualifies as a minor change by the planning
department may be administratively reviewed and approved by city
staff. A “minor change” shall generally include only those
modifications which do not increase the size of the building or the
use by more than twenty-five percent. However, in these
instances, city staff has the discretion to require that the application
be reviewed by the planning commission and city council.
[Added 03/03/2008, Ordinance 321]
Subd. 7. Conditional Use Permits
(a) Intent. It is the intent of the city in establishing general and
specific criteria for conditional uses that such uses by subject to
careful evaluation to ensure that their location, size, and design are
consistent with the standards, purposes, and procedures of this
section and the comprehensive plan. The planning commission
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 103 of 301
may recommend and the city council may impose conditions on
such uses in order to effect the purpose of this section.
The city council may grant conditional use permits when such
permits are authorized by this section and may impose conditions
and safeguards in such permits to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the community and assure harmony with the
comprehensive plan of the city.
(b) Criteria. In acting upon an application for a conditional use
permit, the city will consider the effect of the proposed use upon the
health, safety, and general welfare of the city including but not
limited to the factors of noise, glare, odor, electrical interference,
vibration, dust, and other nuisances; fire and safety hazards;
existing and anticipated traffic conditions; parking facilities on
adjacent streets and land; the effect on surrounding properties,
including valuation, aesthetics and scenic views, land uses,
character and integrity of the neighborhood; consistency with the
city’s comprehensive plan; impact on governmental facilities and
services, including roads, sanitary sewer, water and police and fire;
effect on sensitive environmental features including lakes, surface
and underground water supply and quality, wetlands, slopes, flood
plains and soils; and other factors as found relevant by the city. The
city may also consider whether the proposed use complies or is
likely to comply in the future with all standards and requirements
set out in other regulations or ordinances of the city or other
governmental bodies having jurisdiction over the city. In permitting
a new conditional use or the alteration of an existing conditional
use, the city may impose, in addition to the standards and
requirements expressly specified by this section, additional
conditions which it considers necessary to protect the best interest
of the surrounding area or the community as a whole.
(c) Applications. Applications for conditional use permits will be
made by the owner or owners of the property and will be filed with
the zoning administrator. All applications will be accompanied by an
administrative fee as prescribed in the city’s fee schedule and will
include the following information:
(1) A description of the proposed use;
(2) A legal description of the property, including property
identification number;
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 104 of 301
(3) A site plan showing the location and extent of the
proposed building, parking, loading, access drives,
landscaping and any other improvements;
(4) A map or plot showing the property in question and all
property within 500 feet of the boundaries of the property in
question;
(5) The names and addresses of the owners of record of
all property within 500 feet of the boundaries of the property
in question;
(6) Any other information required by the zoning
administrator, planning commission or city council.
(d) Referral to planning commission. Before any conditional use
permit may be granted, the application therefore will be referred to
the planning commission for study and for its recommendation to
the city council for the granting of such conditional use permit and
the conditions thereof, if any, or for the denial of such conditional
use permit, based upon the standards set out in subdivision 2
above.
The planning commission may hold one or more hearings on the
application in the manner provided in section 505.05, subdivision 4.
If a public hearing is not held, a notice describing the property and
the request must be mailed to the adjacent property owners at least
seven days before the planning commission meeting. Failure of the
property owners to receive the notice will not invalidate the
proceedings.
(e) Issuance. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the
planning commission, the city council will consider the application
and may hold whatever public hearing it deems advisable in the
manner provided in section 505.05, subdivision 4. In considering
applications for conditional use permits under this section, the city
council will consider the recommendations and advice of the
planning commission and the standards set out in section 505.05
subdivision 7(b) above and may grant or deny the permit and may
impose conditions and safeguards therein. The permit is valid for
one year from date of issuance unless otherwise specified in the
resolution of approval and will be automatically renewed each year
unless objections or complaints are received from neighboring
property owners or city council or city staff requests review of it.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 105 of 301
(f) Denial. An application for a conditional use permit may be
denied by motion of the city council and such motion will constitute
a finding and determination by the city council that the conditions
required for approval do not exist.
(g) Action without planning commission recommendation. If no
recommendation is transmitted by the planning commission within
60 days after referral of the application for conditional use permit to
the commission, the city council may take action without further
awaiting such recommendation.
(h) Inspection and revocation. The city may at any time inspect
the conditionally permitted use to determine if the applicant is
strictly adhering to the conditional use permit and the conditions
thereof. If it is found that the permit and the conditions of the permit
are not being adhered to, the applicant will be notified in writing by
the city and given ten days to come into strict compliance. If
compliance is not achieved after that ten-day period, the city
council will hold a public hearing to consider the matter and may
revoke the conditional use permit.
(i) Vested rights. No conditional use permits will confer upon
any person or to the benefit of any property any vested right to that
use, but the use will remain subject to such regulations or
conditions of that permit as the city and other regulatory authorities
will find necessary from time to time in the public interest.
Subd. 8. Interim Use Permit
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to allow interim
uses under specific and regulated conditions. Interim uses may be
allowed by permit if the following conditions are met:
(1) the use conforms to the zoning regulations;
(2) the date or event that will terminate the use can be
identified with certainty;
(3) permission of the use will not impose additional costs on
the public if it is necessary for the public to take the property
in the future; and
(4) the user agrees to any conditions that the city council
deems appropriate for permission of the use.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 106 of 301

partly within 1500 feet of the property to which the
interim use relates;
(7) statement of the date or event terminating the use;
(8) application fee as set forth in the city’s fee schedule; and
(9) such other information as the city deems necessary or
desirable.
(c) City Staff Review. Upon receipt of an application for an
interim use permit, the city planner shall review the material
submitted and determine whether the application is complete. If
the application is not complete, the city planner shall notify the
applicant in writing and shall specify the additional documentation
or information that the applicant will be required to submit before
the application will be considered complete. When the application
is complete, the city planner shall refer the matter to the planning
commission for review and public hearing.
(d) Planning Commission Review; Public Hearing.
(1) The planning commission shall review the proposed
interim use permit on the basis of the information and
documentation submitted by the applicant and any other
information available to it. The planning commission
shall hold a public hearing on the proposed interim use.
Notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing
shall be published in the city’s official newspaper at least
10 days prior to the date of the hearing. Notice shall
also be mailed at least 10 days prior to the hearing to
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 107 of 301
each owner of affected property and property situated
wholly or partly within 1500 feet of the property to which
the interim use relates.
(2) The planning commission shall review the
proposed interim use to determine whether it is
consistent with the requirements of this ordinance.
Following the public hearing, the planning commission
shall recommend that the interim use be approved with
conditions or denied. The planning commission shall
forward its recommendation to the city council along with
a list of suggested conditions if it recommends approval
of the permit.
(e) City Council Review; Amendment.
(1) The city council shall consider the report of the city
planner and the recommendation of the planning
commission and may consider any additional
information or conduct such additional review as it
determines would serve the public interest. The city
council shall approve with conditions or deny the interim
use permit. The city council shall condition its approval
in any manner it deems reasonably necessary in order
to promote public health, safety or welfare and to
achieve compliance with this ordinance. The city council
may require the applicant to enter into an agreement
including such provisions as it deems reasonably
required to ensure compliance with this ordinance and
the terms and conditions of the city’s approval.
(2) An application to amend an approved interim
use permit shall be reviewed under this section in the
same manner as an initial application for an interim use
permit.
(f) Termination. An interim use shall terminate upon the date or the
occurrence of the event established in the permit or upon such other
condition specified by the city. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, an interim use may be terminated by a change in zoning
regulations applicable to the use or land upon which it is located.
Subd. 9. Variances
Pursuant to Minn. Stat. Sec. 462.357, subd. 6, as it may be
amended from time to time, the City, may issue variances from the
provisions of this zoning code. A variance is a modification or variation of
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 108 of 301
the provisions of this zoning code as applied to a specific piece of
property.
(a) A variance is only permitted when it is in harmony with the
general purposes and intent of this ordinance and when the variance is
consistent with the comprehensive plan. A variance may be granted when
the applicant establishes that there are practical difficulties in complying
with this ordinance. Practical difficulties, as used in connection with the
granting of a variance, means that the property owner proposes to use the
property in a reasonable manner not permitted by this ordinance, the
plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not
created by the landowner, and the variance, if granted, would not alter the
essential character of the locality. Economic considerations alone do not
constitute practical difficulties. Practical difficulties include, but are not
limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems.
(b) Variances shall be granted for earth sheltered construction
as defined in Minn. Stat., section 216C.06, subdivision 14, when in
harmony with the ordinance. The city may not permit as a variance any
use that is not allowed under the zoning ordinance for property in the zone
where the affected person’s land is located. The city may permit as a
variance the temporary use of a one family dwelling as a two family
dwelling. The city may impose conditions in the granting of a variance. A
condition must be directly related to and must bear a rough proportionality
to the impact created by the variance.
(c) An application for any such variance will be submitted in
writing by the applicant. The application will state fully the grounds and all
of the facts to justify the granting of a variance.
(d) Supporting data. No variance will be issued unless the
applicant, in support of the application, submits engineering data, surveys,
site plans and other information as the city may require in order to
determine the effects of such development on the affected land and water
areas.
(e) Fee. All applications for variances will be accompanied by a
fee in the amount prescribed by ordinance.
Subd. 10. UDetermination of Substantially Similar UseU
Any landowner may request a determination by the city council that a use
not included in this section is substantially similar to a use classified as permitted,
conditional or accessory. An application for such a determination will be filed with
the zoning administrator who will refer it to the planning commission. The
planning commission will consider the application and will file its
recommendations with the city council. If the city council determines that the use
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 109 of 301
is substantially similar to a use included in these regulations, such use will
thereafter be permitted whenever the similar listed use is authorized.
Subd. 11. Non-Conforming Uses and Structures
(a) Non-conforming uses and structures. Any legal structure or
legal use existing upon the effective date of the adoption of this section
and which does not conform to the provisions of this section may be
continued for a certain period of time subject to the following conditions:
(1) A nonconforming use or dwelling will not be
expanded, enlarged, or extended to occupy a greater height or area
of land except in conformity with the provisions of this section;
(2) If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of
one year, further use of the property will conform to this section;
(3) If a nonconforming use or structure is replaced by
another use or structure, the new use or structure will conform to
this section;
(4) If a nonconforming structure is destroyed by any
cause to an extent exceeding fifty percent of its fair market value,
as indicated by the records of the county assessor, the use of the
same thereafter will conform to this section;
(5) Normal maintenance of a building or other structure
containing or related to a lawful nonconforming use is permitted,
including necessary nonstructural repairs and incidental alterations
which do not extend or intensify the nonconforming use. Nothing in
this section will prevent the placing of a structure in a safe condition
after it has been declared unsafe by the building inspector of the
city;
(6) Alterations may be made to a residential building
containing nonconforming residential units when they improve the
livability of such units, provided that such alterations do not
increase the number of dwelling units in the building. Such
alterations will not change the amortization period set forth in
clause (g) below;
(7) Nonconforming structures and uses will be
discontinued within a reasonable period of amortization of the
building. A reasonable period of amortization will be construed to
begin after the date of adoption of this section and will be
considered to be 40 years for buildings of ordinary wood
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 110 of 301
construction, 50 years for buildings of wood and masonry
construction, and 60 years for buildings of fireproof construction.
(b) Nonconforming junkyards. No commercial junkyard may
continue as a nonconforming use for more than one year after the
effective date of this section except that a commercial junkyard may
continue as a nonconforming use in an industrial district if within that
period it is completely enclosed within a building, fence, screen planting or
other device of such height so as to screen completely the operations of
the commercial junkyard. Plans of such a building or device will be
approved by the city planning commission and the city council before it is
erected or put into place.
(c) Lots of record.
(1) A lot of record existing upon the effective date of this
section in the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, or R-5 residence zoning districts,
which does not meet the requirements of this section as to area or
width, may be utilized for one single-family detached dwelling or
manufactured single-family dwelling, provided the measurements of
such area and width are at least one-half of the requirements of this
section, but the use of said lot of record will not be extended or
more intensively developed unless the lot is combined with one or
more abutting lots or portions thereof so as to create a lot meeting
the requirements of this section.
(2) A lot of record existing upon the effective date of this
section in the R-2(DB) Douglas Beach single-family residence
district, which does not meet the requirements of this section as to
area or width, may be utilized for one single-family detached
dwelling or manufactured single-family dwelling, provided the
measurements of the width are at least 40 feet at the front yard
setback line, rear yard setback line, and lakeshore yard setback
line, but the use of said lot of record will not be extended or more
intensively developed unless the lot is combined with one or more
abutting lots or portions thereof so as to create a lot meeting the
requirements of this section.
(3) A lot of record existing upon the effective date of this
section in the RA-agriculture residence zoning district which does
not meet the requirements of this section as to lot area, width, or
dry buildable land as prescribed below, may be utilized for one
single-family detached dwelling, or one manufactured single-family
dwelling, or agricultural uses, provided that:
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 111 of 301
(i) The measurements of such lot area and width
are at least one-half of the requirements of this section;
(ii) The lot of record has a contiguous area of dry
buildable land equal to 10,000 square feet for a principal
structure; such 10,000 square feet must include an area
measuring at least 60 feet by 125 feet;
(iii) The lot of record has a contiguous area of dry
buildable land equal to 2,000 square feet for an accessory
structure; such 2,000 square feet need not be immediately
adjacent to the principal structure building site but must be
accessible over the subject lot;
(iv) The lot of record has 14,000 square feet of
contiguous possible drainfield area; such 14,000 square feet
will be located such that it will reasonably service the principal
structure for which the drainfield is intended; such 14,000
square feet of possible drainfield area may be situated so as
to have two separated sites of at least 7,000 square feet of
contiguous area each;
(v) Any area of the lot of record that meets the
definitions of both dry buildable land and possible drainfield
area may be used to meet the minimum requirements of
either, but may not be used to satisfy the minimum
requirements of both; and
(vi) Public and private rights-of-way, or vehicular or
pedestrian easements may not be used in order to meet any
portion of the minimum lot area, lot width, dry buildable land

Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 112 of 301
(ii) The lot of record has a contiguous area of dry
buildable land equal to 2,000 square feet for an accessory
structure; such 2,000 square feet need not be immediately
adjacent to the principal structure building site but must be
accessible over the subject lot;
(iii) The lot of record has 14,000 square feet of
contiguous possible drainfield area; such 14,000 square feet
will be located such that it will reasonably service the
principal structure for which the drainfield is intended; such
14,000 square feet of possible drainfield area may be
situated so as to have two separated sites of at least 7,000
square feet of contiguous area each;
(iv) Any area of the lot of record that meets the
definitions of both dry buildable land and possible drainfield
area may be used to meet the minimum requirements of
either, but may not be used to satisfy the minimum
requirements of both; and
(v) The lot of record meets all pertinent
requirements of section 505.05 subd.11 (c)
(d) Nonconforming signs.
(1) Nonconforming signs existing at the effective date of
this section or subsequent changes in this section will be
discontinued within a reasonable period of amortization of
the sign. The amortization period will be determined by the
city council based upon the age, type, value, condition and
degree of nonconformity of the sign, but in no case will the
amortization period be greater than three years.
(2) Lessees, owners, or owners of property having
nonconforming advertising signs existing at the effective
date of this section will within 90 days file for a conditional
sign use permit unless they have a valid special use permit
obtained prior to the passage of this section. If they have a
special use permit, they must apply for a conditional sign use
permit before the expiration of the special use permit. If after
the above time periods, an application for a conditional sign
use permit has not been filed, the sign will be assumed
abandoned, and the city zoning administrator will then order
its removal after first giving 30 days' written notice to the last
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 113 of 301
known lessee, or owner of property. The cost for such sign
removal will be levied against the owner of the property.
(3) Business signs on the premises of a nonconforming
building or use may be continued as long as the building or
use continues as a nonconforming use, but such signs will
not be increased in number, area, height, or illumination.
(4) No sign erected before the passage of this section will
be rebuilt, altered or moved to a new location without being
brought into compliance with the requirements of this
section.
Subd. 12. Abandonment of Conditional Use or Variance
(a) Abandonment. Whenever within one year after the granting
of a conditional use permit or a variance the owner or occupant will
not have substantially completed the erection or alteration of a
building or structure described, then the permit or variance will
become null and void unless a petition for extension of time in
which to complete the proposed construction of alterations has
been granted.
(b) Extension of time. A petition to extend time of a conditional
use permit or variance will be in writing and filed with the zoning
administrator more than 20 days before the expiration of one year
from the date the permit or variance was approved. It will state facts
showing a good faith attempt to use the permit or variance, and will
state the additional time requested to complete the construction or
alteration. Such petition will be presented to the board of appeals
and adjustments for hearing and decision in the same manner as
the original request.
In determining whether the petitioner has made a good faith
attempt to use the permit or variance, the board may consider such
factors as the design, size, expense and type of the proposed
construction or alteration.
(c) Two-year period. It will be within the power of the planning
commission or board of appeals and adjustments, at the time of
granting the original request for a conditional use permit or
variance, to grant a two-year period for the substantial construction
of the building or structure, but such two-year period may not
thereafter be extended.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 114 of 301
Subd. 13. Building Permit and Certificate of Occupancy
(a) No building permit or other permit pertaining to the use of
land or buildings will be issued unless such building is designed
and arranged to conform to the provisions of this section.
(b) No land will be occupied or used and no building hereafter
erected, reconstructed or structurally altered will be occupied or
used, in whole or in part, for any purpose whatsoever, until a
certificate of occupancy has been issued by the city, stating that the
building and the use appears to comply with all of the provisions of
this section applicable to the building or premises of the use in the
zoning district in which it is to be located.
Subd. 14. Violations
No person will use or occupy any lands or premises within the city
contrary to the terms of this section, or in any manner violate the terms
thereof or the terms of any condition imposed under its authority, and any
person so doing, upon conviction, will be guilty of a misdemeanor.
Subd. 15. Administrative fees
(a) Permit charges. No person will be issued a permit pursuant
to this section until each applicant will have paid to the
administrator the fixed and additional costs incurred by the city in
reviewing the application as provided for in this section.
(b) Fixed administrative costs. Each applicant will be charged
the fixed fee specifically provided in this section or in duly enacted
resolutions of this city as required to cover the costs incurred by the
city in administratively processing, reviewing and issuing, if granted,
each of the above permits.
(c) Variable additional costs. Each applicant will be charged an
amount equal to the additional costs incurred by the city in
processing and reviewing each application for each of the above
permits including, but not limited to, engineering, legal and planning
consultant costs when authorized by the city council.
(d) Initial payment. At the time of making application for each of
the above permits, each applicant will pay the fixed fee as
described in subsection (b) plus a deposit for the costs described in
subsection (c) which will equal the city administrator's estimate of
the additional costs the city will incur in processing and reviewing
the applicant's particular permit application if such an estimate can
be made.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 115 of 301
(e) Payment of costs. If no estimate of costs can be made by
the administrator, the applicant will receive a monthly statement of
costs incurred by the city which will be payable 15 days after
receipt by the applicant. Failure to pay such costs will result in a
suspension of action on the application. If a payment of estimated
costs has been made, such payment will be a credit against such
statements until the sum is exhausted in which event the excess
will be due upon receipt of the statement. Any unused portion of the
deposit will be refunded upon final action on the application. No
permits will be issued until an applicant will make payment in full of
costs billed to him.
(f) Unpaid costs. The city council will certify all unpaid costs
described in subsection (c) to the Hennepin County Auditor who will
enter them upon the tax records as a lien upon such land to be
collected in the same manner as other real estate taxes are
collected.
Subd. 16. Short-term rentals
(a) Definitions. In addition to the definitions contained in Section
501.01 of this Code, the following definitions shall apply to this
subdivision.
(1) Operator means the person or enterprise, or its agent,
who is the owner of the dwelling, which is being offered for
rent to transients, whether such person’s ownership interest
in the property is as the owner, lessor, lessee, sub-lessee,
mortgagee-in-possession, licensee, or any other interest.
Where the operator performs their functions through a rental
agent, the managing agency or the rental agent has the
same duties as the operator hereunder.
(2) Rent means the compensation, in money or other
consideration, given in exchange for the occupancy, use, or
possession of real property which is charged, whether or not
received, of property.
(3) Short-term rental means any temporary occupancy of
a dwelling that is offered for rent to a transient for fewer than
thirty (30) days consecutive calendar days.
(4) Transient means any person who, at their own
expense or at the expense of another, exercises occupancy
or possession, or is entitled to occupancy or possession, by
reason of any rental agreement, whether in writing or
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 116 of 301
otherwise, concession, permit, right-of-access, option to
purchase, license, time-sharing arrangement, or any other
type of agreement for a period of fewer than thirty (30)
consecutive calendar days.
(b) Short-term rentals prohibited.
(1) Purpose. The City finds that short-term rentals
constitute a commercial use of residential property, which
conflict with the fundamental character of residential zoning
districts, disrupt the residential character of neighborhoods,
and have a negative impact on the livability of residential
neighborhoods. The City further finds that, while short term
rentals are prohibited under the current provisions contained
in the City Code, an ordinance amendment clarifying those
regulations is necessary. The City has received complaints
from residents regarding short-term rentals, including but not
limited to complaints related to noise, over-occupancy, and
illegal parking. To ensure adequate housing options for
residents, preserve the residential character of the City’s
residential districts, preserve property values, and reduce
land use conflicts, the City determines, in furtherance of the
public health, safety and general welfare, that it is necessary
to limit short-term rentals to hotels, motels, lodging
establishments, and similar accommodations which are
appropriately licensed, zoned, and which have the
appropriate infrastructure and services for such short-term
use.
(2) Prohibition. Short-term rental of any dwelling to a
transient for less than thirty (30) consecutive calendar days
in a residential zoning district is prohibited. State licensed
hotels, motels, and lodging establishments located in areas
where permitted by the City’s land use regulations are
allowed, pursuant to all applicable law and rules.
(3) Enforcement.
a. An owner, operator, tenant, or occupant of any
building or property in violation of the provisions of this
section may be charged and found guilty of a misdemeanor
and may be held responsible for the cost of enforcement in
addition to penalties.
b. The City may exercise any and all remedies at
law or in equity to ensure compliance with this section. All
unpaid costs, charges and penalties may be certified as a
special assessment levy against the property.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 117 of 301
c. The City hereby further declares the short-term
rental of a dwelling may constitute a public nuisance
pursuant to Section 1510.07 of the Minnetrista City Code.
The City may take actions to abate such nuisance pursuant
to Section 1510 of the Minnetrista City Code and applicable
state law.
(c) Implementation. In an effort to minimize the disruption of the
adoption of this ordinance, the City shall not take any enforcement
actions related to short-term rentals until December 31, 2018.
[Added 05/21/2018; Ordinance 453]
505.07 General Regulations
Subd. 1. Area Regulations

Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 118 of 301
trees, shrubs, and similar vegetation within one year after issuance of the
certificate of occupancy. All areas shall be properly maintained in a sightly and
well-kept condition. Yards in business or industrial districts or adjoining residence
districts shall be landscaped with planting buffer screens. Plans for such screens
shall be submitted as a part of the application for building permit for allowed
uses, and shall be subject to acceptance by the Zoning Administrator for intent
and purpose. Screening required as part of a proposed subdivision or
conditional use permit shall be reviewed in conjunction with the applicable review
process. All yard landscaping shall be installed as a part of the initial
construction.
Subd. 5. Height Regulations
(a) Where the average slope of a lot within proposed building
lines is greater than one foot rise or fall in seven feet of horizontal
distance, one additional story will be permitted on the downhill side
of any building.
(b) A building may be allowed to exceed the maximum height
requirement called for by this code if a conditional use permit is
issued which successfully addresses the following criteria:

be so dissimilar to the existing neighboring buildings as to
cause impairments in property values or constitute a
blighting influence within a reasonable distance of the lot.
(2) For each additional one foot in allowable, actual, roof
height as calculated by the Building Code, which is above
the maximum building height allowed by the respective
zoning district; front and side yard setback requirements
shall be increased by one foot.
(3) The construction does not limit solar access to
abutting and/or neighboring properties.
(4) The provisions of section 505.05, subdivision 7,
Conditional Uses, are considered and satisfactorily met.

by licensed amateur radio operators in residential districts
and planned unit developments.
(d) Height limitations set forth in the R-3, R-4, R-5, C-1, C-2,
and I districts may be increased by conditional use permit to a
greater height for items specified in section 505.07, subdivision
5(c)(1)-(4) above, provided the following conditions are met:
(1) The building or portion thereof with increased height
shall not be adjacent to nor closer than 300 feet to any lot in
any AP, A, RDB, R-1 or R-2 residence districts;
(2) Where an increase in the height limitation is allowed
under this section, the building or portion thereof will be set
back from all side and rear lot lines an additional distance of
one foot for every one foot that the building exceeds the
height limitation of the district in which it is located;
(3) The building or portion thereof with increased height
will be set back from front yard lines an additional distance of
one foot for every one foot that it exceeds 45 feet;
(4) A site plan of the proposed building will be submitted
along with the application for conditional use permit as
regulated in paragraph (2) above;
(5) The provisions of clauses (2), (3) and (4) above may
be waived by the city council, in whole or in part, upon a
finding that such a waiver would not have a deleterious
effect upon surrounding properties.
(e) Radio towers and antennas approved under paragraph
(c)(5) above are subject to the following additional requirements:
(1) In addition to submitting the information required by
section 505.07, subdivision 5, an application for approval of
radio towers and antennas subject to section 505.07,
subdivision 5(c) shall include the following:
a. A certified survey acceptable to the city which
illustrates the relative size and visibility of the radio
tower or antenna from adjoining property.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 120 of 301
b. A sketch to illustrate the construction details
and construction materials.
c. A written statement indicating that the structure
is suitable for the purposes for which the applicant is
licensed by the Federal Communication Commission
("FCC") and documentation as necessary to support
this determination.
d. A copy of an FCC Amateur Radio License.
e. Other information as may be reasonably
required by the city.
(2) In addition to the factors listed under section 505.07,
subdivision 5, the city shall consider the following in
determining whether to issue a conditional use permit for a
radio tower and antenna subject to section 505.07,
subdivision 5(c) of this subdivision:
a. The suitability of structure placement and
design for amateur communications.
b. The appropriateness of the structure design.
c. The recommended hours of operation for those
times when the structure will be extended to more
than 25 feet above grade.
d. Maintenance requirements.
e. The distance of the structure from adjoining
property lines.
f. Other conditions as reasonable and necessary
to prevent the structure or its use from becoming a
nuisance to surrounding property owners.
(3) No part of any tower or antenna will be designed,
constructed, located, or maintained within a setback required
by the zoning ordinance for a principal or accessory
structure for the zoning district for which the antenna or
tower is located. The setback for the structure will be equal
to the total height of the structure so that the structure does
not create a potential hazard, should it collapse.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 121 of 301
(4) The city may reasonably require placement of the
structure at a different location on the proposed site in order
to minimize the visual impact of the structure, taking into
account the effect of structure placement on
communications.
(5) If the proposed height of the tower and antenna
exceeds 25 feet, the applicant must demonstrate why the
use of a retractable, crank-up tower would not be adequate.
(6) The structure will comply with all applicable building,
electrical, fire codes, and manufacturing standards.
(7) The applicant must provide any additional information
reasonably required by the city's building inspector.
(8) No person will erect more than one antenna or tower
on a residential parcel within the city.
(9) Structures may not be artificially lighted unless
required by law or by a governmental agency to protect the
public's health and safety. No signage or advertising is
permitted on the tower or antennas.
(10) The structure will be screened by vegetation to the
extent practicable.
(11) The yard in which the structure is located must be
enclosed by a fence between four and six feet in height, with
a self-latching and locked gate; or an anti-climbing device
must be present around the base of the structure to
discourage climbing by unauthorized persons.
(12) The conditional use permit is invalidated if property
ownership changes.
(13) All obsolete or unused structures must be removed by
the property owner within two months of cessation of
operations.
(14) Any person erecting an antenna or tower within the
city will show proof of liability insurance covering personal
injury or property damage in the event that such damage is
caused by the structure.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 122 of 301
(15) The applicant will agree to indemnify the city, its
officers and personnel against any claim, demand, damages,
actions or cause of action and from any fees, costs,
disbursements or expenses of defending the same.
(16) The applicant will agree to utilize the procedures
established by the FCC to resolve any complaints received
relating to interference allegedly caused by the structure.
(17) The provisions of clauses (1)-(16) above may be
waived by the city council, in whole or in part, upon a finding
that such a waiver would not have a harmful effect upon
surrounding properties.
(18) In order to protect the public welfare, the city may limit
the number of radio antennas and towers to be approved by
the city within a specified geographic area on a
determination that the number of antennas and towers
approved are sufficient to reasonably accommodate amateur
communications.
Subd. 6. Conditionally Buildable Slopes
Conditionally buildable slopes, as defined in section 505.01, may be used
to meet the minimum required amount of dry buildable land for a parcel or
lot of record only if the following provisions are satisfied:
(a) If the conditionally buildable slope is not to be disturbed by
construction, or otherwise directly affected, but the parcel or lot of
record must include any conditionally buildable slope area to meet
the minimum dry buildable land area requirement, then the city's
standard slope preservation easement, available at the city offices,
must be fully executed and submitted at the time of permit
application. This easement must encumber all conditionally
buildable slopes on the subject property.
(b) If the conditionally buildable slopes are to be disturbed by
any building or construction project, or otherwise directly affected,
then the following conditions must be satisfied:

Subd. 12. Residential Building Design Standards
(a) Purpose. The standards in this section are intended to promote
variety, diversity, lifestyle (rural, suburban and lakeshore) and
means for pedestrian movements in residential development in
keeping with the character of the city. No building permit, as
referenced in subsection 400.03 of this code, will be issued by the
city unless the requirements of this subsection have been met.
(b) Housing model variety. The following standards apply to
single-family detached dwelling units, two-family dwellings and
townhouses.
(1) Any new development of ten or more single-family
detached, single-family attached in groups of two, or twofamily
detached dwelling units will have at least four different
types of housing models (i.e. ramblers, split, colonial,
victorian, bungalows, craftsman, contemporary and et
cetera).
(2) Each housing model will have at least three variations
with differing characteristics which clearly and obviously
distinguish it from the other housing models, including
different floor plans, exterior materials, roof lines, garage
placement, and/or building face.
(3) The requirements provided in clauses (a) and (b)
above will not apply to a building permit for new structures or
expansions of single-family or two-family dwellings on lots
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 140 of 301
created pursuant to the zoning district and land use
regulations in effect on or before June 17, 2002.
(4) Except for planned unit developments and cluster
developments, the requirements provided in clauses (a) and
(b) above will not apply to a building permit of single-family
or two-family dwellings on land located within the Agriculture
Preservation district and Agriculture district created pursuant
to the zoning district and land use regulations.
(c) Relationship of dwellings to streets and parking. The following
standards apply to all residential buildings.
(1) Orientation to a connecting walkway. Every front
facade with a primary entrance to a dwelling unit shall face
the adjacent street to the extent reasonably practicable, with
no primary entrance more than three hundred (300) feet
from a street pedestrian way/trail or sidewalk.
(2) If a multiple-family building has more than one front
facade, and if one of the front facades faces and opens
directly onto a street pedestrian way/trail or sidewalk, the
primary entrances located on the other front facade(s) need
not face a street pedestrian way/trail, sidewalk or connecting
walkway.
(d) Garage doors. The following standards apply to single-family
detached dwelling units, two-family dwellings and townhouses. To
prevent residential streetscapes from being dominated by
protruding garage doors, and to allow the active, visually interesting
features of the house to dominate the streetscape, the following
standards shall apply:
(1) Street-facing garage doors must be recessed behind
either the front facade of the ground floor living area portion
of the dwelling or a covered porch (measuring at least six
feet by eight feet) by at least four feet. Any street-facing
garage doors that are recessed behind a covered porch may
not protrude forward from the front facade of the living area
portion of the dwelling by more than eight feet.
(2) Garage doors may be located on another side of the
dwelling ("side- or rear-loaded") provided that the side of the
garage facing the front street has windows or other
architectural details that mimic the features of the living
portion of the dwelling.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 141 of 301
(3) Garages will not comprise more than 55 percent of
the ground floor street-facing linear building frontage. This
standard is based on a measurement of the entire garage
structure, and not on a measurement of the garage door or
doors only. Alleys and corner lots are exempt from this
standard.
(4) The requirements provided in subparagraphs (a)
through (c) above shall not apply to a building permit for
expansions of single-family or two-family dwellings on lots
created pursuant to the zone district and land use
regulations in effect on or before June 17, 2002.
(5) Except for planned unit developments and cluster
developments, the requirements provided in subparagraphs
(1) through (3) above shall not apply to a building permit for
new structures or expansions of single-family or two-family
dwellings on land located within the Agriculture preservation
district and Agriculture district created pursuant to the zoning
district and land use regulations.
(e) Rear walls of multiple family garages. The following standards apply
to multiple family dwellings. To add visual interest and avoid the effect of
a long blank wall with no relation to human size, accessibility needs or
internal divisions within the building, the following standards for minimum
wall articulation will apply:
(1) Perimeter garages.
(i) Length. Any garage located with its rear wall along
the perimeter of the property and within 65 feet of a public right-ofway
or the property line of the development site will not exceed 55
feet in length. A minimum of seven feet of landscaping must be
provided between any two such perimeter garages.
(ii) Articulation. No rear garage wall that faces a street
or adjacent development will exceed 30 feet in length without
including at least one of the following in at least two locations:
a. Change in wall plane of at least six inches,
b. Change in material or masonry pattern,
c. Change in roof plane,
d. Windows,
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 142 of 301
e. Doorways,
f. False door or window openings defined by
frames, sills and lintels, or
g. An equivalent vertical element that subdivides
the wall into proportions related to human scale
and/or the internal divisions within the building.
(2) All garages.
(i) Access doors. Rear doorways will be provided as
reasonably necessary to allow direct access to living units
without requiring people to walk around the garage to
access their living units.
(ii) Articulation. At a minimum, a vertical trim detail that
subdivides the overall siding pattern will be provided at
intervals not to exceed two internal parking stalls
(approximately 20 to 24 feet). In addition, the articulation
described in clause (1) (ii) above is encouraged but will not
be required.
(f) Design standards for multiple family dwellings containing six or more
dwelling units. Each multiple family building containing six or more
dwelling units will feature a variety of massing proportions, wall plane
proportions, roof proportions and other characteristics similar in scale to
those of single-family detached dwelling units, so that such larger
buildings can be aesthetically integrated into a lower density
neighborhood. The following specific standards will also apply to such
multiple family dwellings:
(1) Roofs. Each multiple family building will feature a
combination of primary and secondary roofs. Primary roofs
will be articulated by at least one of the following elements:
(i) Changes in plane and elevation.
(ii) Dormers, gables or clerestories.
(iii) Transitions to secondary roofs over entrances,
garages, porches, bay windows.
(2) Facades and walls. Each multiple family dwelling will
be articulated with projections, recesses, covered doorways,
balconies, covered box or bay windows or other similar
features, dividing large facades and walls into human-scaled
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 143 of 301
proportions similar to the adjacent single-family dwellings,
and will not have repetitive, monotonous, undifferentiated
wall planes. Each multiple family building will feature walls
that are articulated by at least two of any of the following
elements within every 36 foot length of the facade:
(i) Recesses, projections or significant offsets in
the wall plane.
(ii) Distinct individualized entrances with
functional porches or patios.
(iii) Chimneys made of masonry, or other
contrasting material that projects from the wall plan.
(iv) Balconies.
(v) Covered bay or box windows.
(3) Variation among repeated buildings. For any
development containing at least 24 and not more than 48
dwelling units, there will be at least two distinctly different
building designs. For any such development containing more
than 48 dwelling units, there will be at least three distinctly
different building designs. For all developments, there will
be no more than two similar buildings placed next to each
other along a street or major walkway spine.
Distinctly different building designs will provide significant
variation in footprint size and shape, architectural elevations
and entrance features, within a coordinated overall theme of
roof forms, massing proportions and other characteristics.
To meet this standard such variation will not consist solely of
different combinations of the same building features.
(4) Color. Each multiple family building will feature a
broad array of colors, including earth tones, muted natural
colors found in the surrounding landscape or other colors
consistent with the adjacent neighborhood. For all
developments, there will be no more than two similarlycolored
structures placed next to each other along a street
or major walkway spine.
(5) Garages. No street-facing facade will contain more
than three garage bays.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 144 of 301
(g) An applicant for approval of a residential development containing ten
or more units must, prior to final plat or other plan approval, submit the
following:
(1) Colored illustrative Site Plan showing all buildings,
driveways, parking areas, access points and
adjacent public or private streets;
(2) Colored architectural rendering / perspective sketch;
(3) Colored building elevations with dimensions (1/8”
scale minimum);
(4) Partial, Enlarged, Colored Building Elevation (1/2”
scale minimum);
(5) Samples of exterior colors and materials
(6) Building floor plans;
(7) Colored building elevations showing proposed
buildings as viewed from surrounding properties;
(8) Plan with dimensions depicting proposed garages;
(9) Landscape Plan; and
(10) Other items required by the city council to ensure
compliance with this subsection.
The above-listed items shall be subject to the review process set forth in section
505.05, subd. 6.
(h) Waiver.
(1) An applicant subject to this subsection may request a
waiver of the requirements in this subsection. A waiver
request must be in writing to city staff and must include
information responding to the following factors for the city
council’s consideration:
(i) The nature and significance of the waiver;
(ii) Whether the waiver is the minimum necessary
to overcome the practical difficulty;
(iii) Whether the protection of environmental and
other sensitive features have been addressed;
(iv) The effect on adjacent properties;
(v) Whether the waiver will enhance or impair
good planning for the area; and
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 145 of 301
(vi) Such other factors as the council deems
relevant under the circumstances.
(2) Financial considerations alone shall not be sufficient
to justify a waiver.
(3) The city council may grant a waiver from any
requirements of this subsection based upon its review of the
information submitted by the owner or developer and if the
council determines that:
(i) The configuration of the lot or other existing
physical condition of the lot makes the application of
these standards impractical; or
(ii) The proposed design otherwise substantially
meets the intent of this code to line streets with active
living spaces, create pedestrian-oriented streetscapes
and provide variety and visual interest in the exterior
design of residential buildings.
(4) In granting a waiver, the city council may impose such
conditions or requirements as it deems reasonably
necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare.
Subd. 13. UMixed-use, Institutional and Commercial Design Standards.
(a) UPurpose.U These standards are intended to promote the design
of an urban environment that is built to human scale to encourage
functional street fronts and other connecting walkways that
accommodate pedestrians as the first priority, while also
accommodating vehicular movement. No building permit, as
referenced in subsection 400.03 of this code, will be issued by the
city unless the requirements of this subsection have been met.
(b) Relationship of buildings to streets, walkways and parking.
(1) Orientation to a connecting walkway. At least one main
entrance of any commercial or mixed-use building will face
and open directly onto a connecting walkway with pedestrian
frontage. Any building which has only vehicle bays and/or
service doors for intermittent/infrequent nonpublic access to
equipment, storage or similar rooms (e.g. self-serve car
washes and self-serve mini-storage warehouses) will be
exempt from this standard. See Figure 10.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 146 of 301
(2) Orientation to build-to lines for streetfront buildings.
Build-to lines based on a consistent relationship of buildings
to the street sidewalk will be established by development
projects for new buildings and, to the extent reasonably
feasible, by development projects for additions or
modifications of existing buildings, in order to form visually
continuous, pedestrian-oriented streetfronts with no vehicle
use area between building faces and the street.
(i) To establish "build-to" lines, buildings will be
located and designed to align or approximately align
with any previously established building/sidewalk
relationships that are consistent with this standard.
Accordingly, at least 30 percent of the total length of
the building along the street will be extended to the
build-to line area. If a parcel, lot or tract has multiple
streets, then the building will be built to at least two of
them according to b. through d. below, i.e. to a street
corner. If there is a choice of two or more corners,
then the building will be built to the corner that is
projected to have the most pedestrian activity
associated with the building.
(ii) Buildings will be located no more than 15 feet
from the right-of-way of an adjoining street if the street
is smaller than a collector or has on-street parking.
(iii) Buildings will be located at least ten and no
more than 25 feet behind the street right-of-way of an
adjoining street that is larger than a collector that
does not have on-street parking.
(iv) Exceptions to the build-to line standards will be
permitted:
a. In order to form an outdoor space such
as a plaza, courtyard, patio or garden between
a building and the sidewalk. Such a larger front
yard area will have landscaping, low walls,
fencing or railings, a tree canopy and/or other
similar site improvements along the sidewalk
designed for pedestrian interest, comfort and
visual continuity.
b. If the building is adjacent to a collector
street, and the city has determined that an
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 147 of 301
alternative to the street sidewalk better serves
the purpose of connecting commercial
destinations due to one or more of the
following constraints:
1. High volume and/or speed of
traffic on the adjacent street(s)
2. Landform
3. An established pattern of existing
buildings that makes a pedestrianoriented
street front infeasible
Such an alternative to the street sidewalk must
include a connecting walkway(s) and may
include internal walkways or other directly
connecting outdoor spaces such as plazas,
courtyards, squares or gardens.
c. In the case of large retail
establishments, supermarkets or other anchortenant
buildings that face internal connecting
walkways with pedestrian frontage in a
development that includes additional outlying
buildings adjacent to the street(s).
d. If a larger or otherwise noncompliant
front yard area is required by the city to
continue an established drainage channel or
access drive, or other easement.
(c) Variation in massing. A single, large, dominant building mass
will be avoided in new buildings and, to the extent reasonably
feasible, in development projects involving changes to the mass of
existing buildings.
(1) Horizontal masses will not exceed a height: width
ratio of 1:3 without substantial variation in massing that
includes a change in height and a projecting or recessed
elements.
(2) Changes in mass will be related to entrances, the
integral structure and/or the organization of interior spaces
and activities and not merely for cosmetic effect. False fronts
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 148 of 301
or parapets create an insubstantial appearance and are
prohibited.
(d) Character and image. In new buildings and, to the extent reasonably
feasible, in development projects involving changes to existing building
walls, facades or awnings (as applicable), the following standards will
apply:
(1) USite-specific design.U Building design will contribute to
the uniqueness of a zone district, and/or the Minnetrista
community with predominant materials, elements, features,
color range and activity areas tailored specifically to the site
and its context. In the case of a multiple building
development, each individual building will include
predominant characteristics shared by all buildings in the
development so that the development forms a cohesive
place within the zone district or community. A standardized
prototype design will be modified if necessary to meet the
provisions of this code.
(2) UFacade treatmentU. Minimum wall articulation. Building
bays will be a maximum of 30 feet in width. Bays will be
visually established by architectural features such as
columns, ribs or pilasters, piers and fenestration pattern. In
order to add architectural interest and variety and avoid the
effect of a single, long or massive wall with no relation to
human size, the following additional standards will apply:
(i) No wall that faces a street or connecting
walkway will have a blank, uninterrupted length
exceeding 30 feet without including at least two of the
following: change in plane, change in texture or
masonry pattern, windows, treillage with vines, or an
equivalent element that subdivides the wall into
human scale proportions.
(ii) Side or rear walls that face walkways may
include false windows defined by frames, sills and
lintels, or similarly proportioned modulations of the
wall, only when actual doors and windows are not
feasible because of the nature of the use of the
building.
(iii) All sides of the building will include materials
and design characteristics consistent with those on
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 149 of 301
the front. Use of inferior or lesser quality materials for
side or rear facades will be prohibited.
(3) UFacades.U Facades that face streets or connecting
pedestrian frontage will be subdivided and proportioned
using features such as windows, entrances, arcades, arbors,
awnings, treillage with vines, along no less than 50 percent
of the facade.
(4) UEntrances.U Primary building entrances will be clearly
defined and recessed or framed by a sheltering element
such as an awning, arcade or portico in order to provide
shelter from the summer sun and winter weather.
(5) UAwnings.U Awnings will be no longer than a single
storefront.
(6) UBase and top treatments.U All facades will have:
(i) A recognizable "base" consisting of (but
not limited to):
a. Thicker walls, ledges or sills;
b. Integrally textured materials such as
stone or other masonry;
c. Integrally colored and patterned
materials such as smooth-finished stone
or tile;
d. Lighter or darker colored materials,
mullions or panels; or
e. Planters.
(ii) A recognizable "top" consisting of (but
not limited to):
a. Cornice treatments, other than just
colored "stripes" or "bands," with
integrally textured materials such as
stone or other masonry or differently
colored materials;
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 150 of 301
b. Sloping roof with overhangs and
brackets;
c. Stepped parapets.
(7) UEncroachments.U Special architectural features, such
as bay windows, decorative roofs and entry features may
project up to three feet into street rights-of-way, provided
that they are not less than nine feet above the sidewalk.
Trellises, canopies and fabric awnings may project up to five
feet into front setbacks and public rights-of-way, provided
that they are not less than eight feet above the sidewalk. No
such improvements will encroach into alley rights-of-way.
Subd. 14. UPerformance standards in nonresidential districts.
(a) UIntentU. It is the intent of this subdivision to provide that
commercial, industrial and related activities will be
established and maintained with proper appearance from
streets and adjoining properties and to provide that such use
will be a good neighbor to adjoining properties by the control
of the items regulated in this section.
(b) UStandardsU.
(1) ULandscapingU. All required yards will either be
open landscaped and green areas or be left in a
natural state. If any yards are to be landscaped, they
will be landscaped attractively with lawn, trees,
shrubs, and similar vegetation within one year after
issuance of the certificate of occupancy. All areas will
be properly maintained in a sightly and well-kept
condition. Yards adjoining all residence districts will
be landscaped with buffer planting screens. Plans of
such screens will be submitted for approval as a part
of the site plan and installed prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for any tract in the district.
(2) UGlareU. Whether direct or reflected glare, such
as from floodlights or high temperature processes and
as differentiated from general illumination, will not be
visible at any property line.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 151 of 301
(3) UExterior lightingU. Any lights used for exterior
illumination will direct light away from adjoining
properties.
(4) UVibrationU. Vibration will not be discernible at
any property line to the human sense of feeling for
three minutes or more duration in any one hour.
Vibration of any kind will not produce at any time an
acceleration of more than 0.1 gravities or will result in
any combination of amplitudes and frequencies
beyond the "safe" range of Table VII United States
Bureau of Mines Bulletin No. 442, Seismic Effects of
Quarry Blasting, on any structure. The methods and
equations of said Bulletin No. 442 will be used to
compute all values for the enforcement of this
provision. Said bulletin is incorporated herein by
reference.
(5) UOdors, smoke, dust, fumes, water and wasteU.
The design, construction and performance of all
nonresidential uses will be in conformance with city,
county and state standards and regulations.
(c) UComplianceU. In order to ensure compliance with the
performance standards set forth above, the city council may
require the owner or operator of any use to have made such
investigations and tests as may be required to show
adherence to the performance standards. Such investigation
and tests as are required to be made will be carried out by
an independent testing organization as may be selected by
the city. The costs incurred in such investigation or testing
will be ordered by the owner or operator and shared equally
by the owner or operator and the city unless the investigation
and tests disclose noncompliance with the performance
standards; in which situation the investigation and testing will
be paid by the owner or operator.
Sub.15. Dwellings and manufactured single-family dwellings
(a) All dwellings and manufactured single-family dwellings
constructed or established after the adoption of this section will
meet the following criteria, except for manufactured single-family
dwellings in mobile home parks.
(1) The dwelling and manufactured single-family dwelling
will be placed on and secured to a permanent foundation of
concrete, masonry, or treated wood;
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 152 of 301
(2) The dwelling and manufactured single-family dwelling
will have a minimum length and width of 20 feet at all points,
providing that such measurements will not include
overhangs and other projections beyond the principal
exterior walls;
(3) The dwelling and manufactured single-family dwelling
will include an attached or detached private garage on the
lot;
(4) The dwelling will comply with the state building code
and the manufactured single-family dwelling will comply with
Minnesota Statutes, sections 327.31 to 327.35.
Subd. 16. Sober Houses
(a) It is the policy of the city, pursuant to the Federal Fair
Housing Amendments Act of 1988, to provide reasonable
accommodation in the application of its zoning regulations for
persons with a disability seeking fair and equal access to housing.
Reasonable accommodation means providing persons with a
disability or a developer of housing for persons with a disability
flexibility in the application of zoning regulations or policies,
including the modification or waiver of certain requirements, when
necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities. The
purpose of this subdivision is to establish a process for making and
acting upon requests for reasonable accommodation.
(b) Any person who requests reasonable accommodation in the
application of a zoning regulation which may act as a barrier to fair
housing opportunities due to the disability of existing or proposed
residents may do so on an application form provided by the
community development director. “Person” includes any individual
with a disability, his or her representative or a developer or provider
of housing for persons with a disability. The application shall
include a detailed explanation of why the accommodation is
reasonably necessary to make the specific housing available to the
person(s), information establishing that the existing or proposed
residents are disabled under applicable laws, and other information
reasonably required by the community development director to
evaluate the request. If the project for which the accommodation
request is being made also requires additional land use reviews or
approvals, the applicant shall file the accommodation request
concurrently with the additional land use reviews.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 153 of 301
(c) The community development director shall review the
accommodation request and make a recommendation to the city
council. The request shall be evaluated under the following factors:
1. whether there is a qualifying disability;
2. whether the request is needed to allow a disabled
person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling
or to live in a particular neighborhood as a person
without disabilities;
3. whether the request is reasonable, considering the
potential impact on surrounding uses, the extent to
which the accommodation meets the stated need,
and other alternatives that may meet that need;
4. the number, nature and extent of the requested
accommodation in relation to the physical limitations
of the building and site;
5. whether the request would constitute a fundamental
alteration of the city’s regulations, policies, or
procedures;
6. whether the request would impose an undue financial
or administrative burden on the city; and
7. any other factor that may have a bearing on the
request.
The community development director’s recommendation of
approval may include conditions reasonably necessary to ensure
that the facility does not constitute a fundamental alteration of the
city’s regulations, policies or procedures or impose an undue
financial or administrative burden on the city.
(d) No sober house shall be located within 1320 feet of another
sober house, as measured from the property lines closest to
another.
(e) The city council shall consider the request following receipt
of the recommendation of the community development director.
Notice of the meeting at which the city council will evaluate the
request shall be mailed at least 10 days before the meeting to the
owners of all properties located within 500 feet of the property
subject to the request.
(f) An approved accommodation is grated only to an applicant
and does not run with the land unless the city determines that the
accommodation is physically integrated into the residential structure
and cannot easily be removed or altered or the accommodation is
to be used by another individual with a disability.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 154 of 301
(g) If a facility is established following approval by the city of an
accommodation, the city may review the matter on its own initiative
or upon receipt of credible complaints regarding the operation of
the facility. The accommodation may be modified or revoked if the
city determines that the conditions of approval have been materially
violated or the facility is otherwise operating in such a manner that
the accommodation is no longer reasonable or no longer needed to
prevent barriers to fair housing opportunities to persons with
disabilities. Reviews under this subsection shall be conducted by
the community development director and, if a modification or

Antenna means a device used to transmit and/or receive radio or
electromagnetic waves.
Monopole is a self-supporting single pole to which at least one antenna
may be attached.
Public utility means any person, firm, corporation, municipal department,
or board fully authorized to furnish and furnishing under municipal
regulation to the public, electricity, gas, steam, communication services,
telegraph services, transportation, or water. For the purpose of this
section, commercial wireless telecommunication services will not be
considered an "essential public service and utility structure and use" and
are defined separately.
Tower means any ground or roof mounted pole, spire, structure, or
combination thereof taller than 15 feet, including supporting lines, cables,
wires, braces, and masts, intended primarily for the purpose of mounting
an antenna, meteorological device, or similar apparatus above grade
(except amateur radio antennas).

increase in its share of energy production as non-renewable sources increase in
costs. Furthermore, the city seeks to support and encourage such alternatives
by providing greener options in the provision of energy.
Subd. 2. UPermit Requirements.
All solar energy systems and building integrated solar energy systems are
subject to any and all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. A
building permit must be obtained from the city for any solar energy system or
building integrated solar energy system prior to installation. In certain zoning
districts, a conditional use permit is required for solar energy systems. In that
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 164 of 301
event, the conditional use permit application will be considered in accordance
with the general conditional use permit relations set forth in section 505.05,
subdivision 7 of this code. The city council reserves the right to add additional
reasonable conditions to the conditional use permit with respect to aesthetics,
height, setbacks, and location.
Subd. 3. UPerformance Standards.
All Solar energy systems shall be subject to the following performance
standards, regardless of whether or not a conditional use permit is required.

requirement in the applicable zoning district for an
accessory structure when oriented at maximum tilt.
(c) Setbacks. A ground-mounted solar energy system must
meet the setbacks required for an accessory structure in the
applicable zoning district when oriented at minimum tilt. A
roof-mounted solar system must comply with all structure
setback requirements in the applicable zoning district and
must not extend beyond the exterior perimeter of the
structure on which the system is mounted.
(d) Coverage. The total square footage of a ground-mounted
solar energy system when oriented at minimum tilt will be
included in the property’s impervious surface calculation.
(e) Screening. A ground-mounted solar energy system must be
screened from view to the extent possible without reducing
its efficiency. Screening may include, but is not limited to,
walls, fences, or landscaping.
(f) Aesthetics. A roof-mounted solar energy system should
match the structure to which it is mounted to the maximum
extent possible. A ground-mounted solar energy system
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 165 of 301
should match the principal structure to the maximum extent
possible.
(g) Feeder Lines. The electrical collection system for a solar
energy system must be placed underground within the
boundaries of the property. A collection system may be
placed overhead if it is near a substation or a point of
interconnection to the electric grid.
Subd. 4. UAbandonment.
A solar energy system that is not in proper working order, has ceased
functioning for a period of more than six months or has not been maintained
must be deconstructed and removed from the property. A demolition permit is
required for the removal of the solar energy system. Any person who fails to
deconstruct and remove a non-functioning solar energy system is guilty of a
misdemeanor. The city may require a surety or letter of credit be provided to the
city at the time of construction of the solar energy system in order to ensure
proper deconstruction and removal at such a time that the solar energy is no
longer in proper working order.

requirements of this subdivision; subdivision 4 above and
applicable provisions of section 500; and that for each such
two-acre lot, the subdivider must first grant to the city an
open space easement over an additional 40 acres of land, in
a form acceptable to the city attorney, to ensure that
the additional 40 acres of land is thereafter restricted to
agricultural uses, specifically excluding any residential uses,
dwellings or other uses involving structures which are not
incidental to commercial agriculture so as not to defeat the
purpose of this section. The additional 40 acres of land to be
so restricted will not contain any residential dwelling or nonMinnetrista
City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 201 of 301
farm buildings and will not have been already restricted by
an open space easement.
(5) The two acre lot will have at least 200 feet of frontage on a
publicly dedicated and maintained street and will have
adequate buildable area so as to not require a variance to
any section of the city code.
(d) UTen acre lots and cluster dwellings in AP agriculture preserve
districtU. Upon the request of an owner to change the zoning on the
owner's property, the city council will consider changing the AP
Agricultural Preserve District to A Agriculture District if the property
is located east of County Road 92.
(1) UPurposeU. The purpose of these regulations is to allow, in
certain instances, ten acre lots and to provide guidance,
criteria, and incentive for residential cluster development in
the agricultural preserve district east of County Road 92.
These regulations do not apply in any other zoning district.
(2) UDefinitionsU.
Agricultural use means the use of land for the growing
and/or production of field crops such as barley, soybeans,
corn, hay, oats, potatoes, rye, sorghum, or sunflowers.
Cluster development is a single-family residential
development in which single-family dwellings are grouped on
a portion of land with a significant amount of a site reserved
as open space.
Conservation easement means a legal agreement creating
an interest in real property created in a manner to impose
limitations or affirmative obligations regarding the use of
property including the retention, protection, and maintenance
of open space.
Open space/usable open space use means land, which is
preserved through the use of restrictive deed covenants,
public dedications, or other methods. Developments within
the agricultural preserve district must maintain fifty percent of
its overall site acreage as open space. A minimum of onehalf
of the open space required by this section must be
useable.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 202 of 301
Useable open space must comply with all the following
criteria:
a. Land area will be above the 100-year flood plain
elevation;
b. Land area will be above the ordinary highwater level
of "public waters" and "wetlands" as defined by
Minnesota Statutes 103G.005;
c. Land area will not contain hydric soils, surface or
subsurface hydrology, and hydrophytic vegetation;
d. Land area that satisfies criterion a, b, c, and e in this
section, in lieu of easements, may be owned by a
homeowners association; and
e. Area required by this district is in addition to (not in
lieu of) any public parkland dedication.
(3) UTwo optionsU. Instead of requiring lots in the agriculture
preserve district to be 40 acres the city council will consider
the following two options for lot sizes east of County Road
92.
a. UTen acre lotsU--The council may all allow lots with a
minimum of 10 acres
i. Depth, width, coverage, and setbacks will be
as set forth in the agriculture district.
b. UCluster development lotsU--For property located in the
agricultural preserve district east of County Road 92,
the city council may allow single-family dwelling
development at an overall density of six unit per 40
acres (One unit per 6.66 acres) provided all the
following criteria are met:
i. A maximum overall density of one single-family
dwelling unit per 6.66 acres must be
maintained.
ii. A minimum of 50 percent of the development
must be preserved as open space.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 203 of 301
iii. The preliminary plat must show a primary and
secondary individual sewage treatment site for
each dwelling unit and must be supported with
soil tests that demonstrate compliance with
Hennepin County Ordinance Number 19.
iv. Lots within the cluster development will not be
less than 2.5 acres nor more than five acres.
v. All lots within the cluster development must be
served by a single, city street which meets the
following standards:
? Must have a minimum width of 24 feet.
? Must be designed, properly graded and
improved with a base of Class 5
materials. A bituminous surface suitable
for carrying the anticipated traffic
load/volume is required.
vi. Open space must be designated in the
development as one or more outlots and must
be owned by a homeowners association.
vii. Open spaces will be protected by the
placement of a conservation easement over
them.
viii. Open space will be in a contiguous, connected
configuration including or adjacent to existing
natural areas or parks.
ix. Open space in long narrow corridors in back
yards does not qualify as open space for
conservation easements.
x. The homeowners association will maintain the
open space so that it is free of noxious weeds,
litter, or debris.
xi. A minimum of 50 percent of the open space
must be usable. Wetlands, streams, lakes,
ponds, and lands within the 100-year flood plain
elevation are not considered usable for
purposes of this section.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 204 of 301
xii. Residential properties must be buffered from
incompatible uses with buffer areas
aesthetically and functionally designed to
minimize land use conflicts.
xiii. A subdividers agreement must be entered into
with the city.
(4) ULot area, depth, width, coverage, setbacksU. Lot area, depth,
width, coverage, and setbacks will be subject to review and
approval of the city council. However, lot area will not be less
than 2.5 acres nor more than five acres.
(5) UHomeowners association criteriaU. A homeowners association
will be established to permanently maintain all preserved
open space. Homeowners association agreements will
include the following:
a. Legal description of the common lands or facilities.
b. Membership in the association is mandatory for all
purchasers of homes in the development and their
successors.
c. Restrictions placed upon the use and enjoyment of
the lands or facilities including the persons or entities
entitled to enforce the restrictions.
d. A mechanism for resolving disputes among the
owners or association members.
e. Provide standards for scheduled maintenance of open
spaces.
f. A mechanism to assess and enforce the common
expenses for the land or facilities including upkeep
and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, and
insurance premiums.
g. The conditions and timing of the transfer of ownership
and control of land or facilities to the association.
h. Any proposed change in the articles of association or
incorporation will require the prior written approval of
the city.

Subd. 3. UAdministrative procedure for development in the public/semipublic
facilities district.
(a) All new uses and developments within the public/semi-public
facilities district shall require site plan review prior to issuance of
any permits. If a proposed use is a conditional use, a conditional
use permit must be applied for pursuant to Section 505.05,
subdivision 7 of the city code.
Subd. 4. UPerformance standards in the public/semi-public facilities districtU.
(a) UIntentU. It is the intent of this subdivision to provide that
public/semi-public facilities and related activities will be established
and maintained with proper appearance from streets and adjoining
properties and to provide that such use will be a good neighbor to
adjoining properties by the control of the items regulated in this
section.
(b) UStandardsU.
(1) ULandscapingU. All required yards shall either be
landscaped or left in a natural state. If a yard is to be
landscaped, it shall be landscaped attractively using grass,
trees, shrubs, and similar vegetation. Landscaping shall be
completed within one year after the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy. All areas on the property shall be
maintained in a sightly and well-kept condition. Yards
adjoining residence districts must include a landscaped
buffer for screening purposes. Landscaping plans for buffers
shall be submitted to the city for approval as part of the site
plan application and installed prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy. Landscaping required by this
subdivision shall be in addition to the tree preservation
requirements of section 510.07 of city code.
(2) UGlare and HeatU. Any use requiring an operation
producing an intense heat or light transmission shall be
performed with the necessary shielding to prevent such heat
or light from being detectable at the lot line of the site.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 210 of 301
(3) UExterior lightingU. All exterior lighting shall be designed
and arranged so as not to direct any illumination upon or into
any contiguous residential districts. No exterior lighting shall
be arranged and designed so as to create direct viewing
angles of the illumination source by pedestrian or vehicular
traffic in the public right-of-way. Lenses, deflectors, shields,
louvers and prismatic control devices shall be used so as to
eliminate nuisance and hazardous lighting. Lighting
fixtures for outdoor sports and recreational facilities that
adjoin residential uses shall be designed to eliminate
reflected glare and spill light from the bottom one-third of the

selected by the city. The costs incurred in such investigation or testing must be
ordered by the owner or operator and will be shared equally by the owner or
operator and the city unless the investigation and tests disclose noncompliance
with the performance standards; in which situation the investigation and testing
costs shall be paid by the owner or operator.
[Added 03/03/2008, Ordinance 320]
505.45 PUD Planned Unit Development Zoning District
Subdivision 1. UPurpose
The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning district is to
provide greater flexibility in the development of neighborhoods and nonresidential
areas in order to maximize public values and achieve more creative
development outcomes while remaining economically viable and marketable.
This is achieved by undertaking a collaborative process that results in a
development outcome exceeding that which is typically achievable through the
conventional zoning district. If a development proposal does not demonstrate
significant public value benefits above and beyond those achievable under a
conventional zoning district, the City reserves the right to deny the PUD rezoning
and direct the developer to re-apply under the standard applicable zoning district.
Subd. 2. UDefinitions
Conventional development is defined as a development proposal that
meets the minimum requirement of the City’s ordinances regulating development.
Open space means land or common areas reserved for parks, walking
paths or other natural uses.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 212 of 301
Open space, useable means open space which will be publicly or privately
owned and maintained by a homeowners association, excluding wetlands
designated by federal or state agencies, areas below the 100-year ordinary high
water elevations (OHW) and streets and roadways.
[Revised 02/04/2008, Ordinance 319]
Life-cycle housing refers to the range of housing options that meet
people's preferences and circumstances at all of life's stages. Such options
include both rental and for-purchase homes that are affordable for low and
median-income buyers and for the move-up market.
Public values collaborative development is a process that results in a
development plan in which clearly defined public values are achieved in
exchange for greater flexibility on conventional development requirements.
Subd. 3. UReflection on the official zoning mapU
PUD provisions provide an optional method of regulating land use which
permits flexibility in the uses allowed and other regulating provisions.26T In some
circumstances, however, rules and regulations governing the underlying zoning
district may apply within the PUD. As such, a26Tpproval of a PUD and execution of
a PUD agreement shall require the property in question be rezoned to PUD, but
the denotation on the official zoning map shall also illustrate the underlying
zoning district. Once a PUD has been granted and is in effect for a parcel, no
building permit shall be issued for that parcel which is not in conformance with
the approved PUD plan, the building code, and with all other applicable city code
provisions.
All PUD rezonings approved prior to the effective date of this section shall
retain their zoning classifications of PUD, and shall continue to be governed by
the ordinance and resolutions which created these areas.
Subd. 4. UAppropriate Use of the PUD rezoningU
A rezoning to PUD may be requested for any residential or commercially
zoned area. PUDs are prohibited in the industrial districts.
(a) Rezonings to PUD will not be considered for areas less than 8
acres of land in single ownership or control, except in the following
circumstances:
(1) Natural features of the land are such that development under
standard zoning regulations would not be appropriate in
order to conserve such features;
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 213 of 301
(2) The land is intended to be developed in accordance with a
prior PUD adjacent to or across the street from the subject
property; or
(3) The PUD process is desirable to ensure compatibility and
careful consideration of the effect of a development on
surrounding land uses.
(b) Application for a PUD may be made only by the owner of the land
involved in the PUD application, or an option/contract holder provided the
application is accompanied by fully executed agreements or documents from the
owner in a form acceptable to the city.
Subd. 5. UPermitted usesU.
Uses within a PUD shall be governed by the ordinance establishing the
PUD and by the conditions, if any, imposed by the city in the approval process. If
a specific use is not established or addressed by a PUD ordinance, said use
shall be governed by the underlying zoning district regulations designated by the
comprehensive plan.
Subd 6. UExpectations of a development seeking a rezoning to PUD
The provisions of this section are intended to achieve the following public
values within a PUD zoning district and associated subdivision:
(a) Maintain the sense of open space character of the community.
Open space shall be of a size, shape, location, and usability for its proposed
purpose. Whenever possible, common open space shall be linked to the open
space areas of surrounding developments;
(b) Preserve natural open spaces for their aesthetic and ecological
values and provide buffering between developments and adjacent roadways;
(c) Maximize the use of ecologically-based approaches to stormwater
management, restore or enhance on-site ecological systems, and protect off-site
ecological systems including the application of Low Impact Development (LID)
practices;
(d) Provide high-quality park, open space, and trail opportunities that
meet or exceed the provisions of the Parks, Trails, and Open Space Plan;
(e) Minimize the extent of the development footprint and impervious
surfaces to the extent possible to reduce initial infrastructure costs and long-term
maintenance and operational costs;
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 214 of 301
(f) Ensure long-term stewardship of natural resources for all lands set
aside as parks, open spaces, and other forms of conservation lands;
(g) Provide a convenient and efficient multi-modal transportation
system to service the daily needs of residents at peak and non-peak use levels,
where possible;
(h) Foster economic and cultural diversity by providing a
complementary mix of lifecycle housing;
(i) Encourage conservation of energy and other resources to enhance
the prospects for creating a sustainable community;
(j) Promote aesthetically-pleasing design and high quality construction
consistent with the community’s desired sense of place and quality of life
expectations and harmonious with the natural setting. A PUD shall strive to
creatively integrate multiple structure types and land uses in a harmonious plan
that preserves, enhances, and protects natural features. The integrated design
shall include elements such as building orientation and materials, utilities, parking
areas, traffic and pedestrian circulation, and open spaces. A PUD which only
involves one building or housing type, such as all detached or all attached units,
shall not necessarily be considered as inconsistent with the stated purposes and
objectives of this section and shall not be the sole basis for denial or approval.
Architectural style of buildings shall not be the sole basis for denial or approval of
a plan. However, the overall appearance and compatibility of individual buildings
to other site elements or to surrounding development will be primary
considerations in the review stages of the planning commission and city council;
Subd. 7. UAreas of Flexibility
(a) The City shall consider an increase in the number of overall units
and associated reductions in lot width and size, if the PUD provides substantially
more site amenities and public values, as outlined in subdivision 6, than could be
achieved in a conventional residential development for the applicable zoning
district;
(b) The City shall consider a decrease in the amount of road width
required or right-of-way requirements if the PUD provides substantially more site
amenities, as outlined in subdivision 6, than are found in a conventional
residential development for the applicable zoning district. Specifications and
standards for streets, utilities, and other public facilities shall be at the discretion
of city council and must protect the health, safety, comfort, aesthetics, economic
viability, and general welfare of the city.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 215 of 301
(c) The City shall consider flexibility with regard to lot size, width, and
depth when reviewing a PUD rezoning request. Specifications and standards for
lots shall be at the discretion of city council, and shall encourage a desirable
living environment which assists in achieving the goals set out for PUDs.
(d) The City shall consider flexibility in the phasing of a PUD
development. Changes to the proposed staging or timing of a PUD may be
approved by the city council when necessary, or on the showing of good cause
by the developer.
Subd. 8. UPUD ProcedureU
All requests for rezoning to Planned Unit Development shall follow the
steps outlined below.
(a) Collaborative process and project goal setting
1) The applicant shall meet with the city staff for a preapplication
conference prior to submittal of a concept to the
city. The primary purpose of the conference is to allow the
applicant and staff an opportunity to review the
comprehensive plan and to make a preliminary
determination if the proposal is conducive to a PUD
rezoning.
2) City staff and the applicant shall work together to
schedule a concurrent work session with policymakers of the
city (planning commission, parks commission, and city
council) to discuss the public values on the site, using the
established public values in subdivision 6 of this section as a
guideline. The result of this meeting will be a public values
statement.
3) At an appropriate point during the process, the applicant shall
hold a neighborhood meeting. The city and all owners or property
within 1,000 feet of the PUD (or a larger area as determined by the
city) shall be given notice of the meeting. The purpose of the
meeting is to inform the neighborhood of the proposed PUD,
discuss the concepts and basis for the plan being developed and to
obtain information and suggestions from the neighborhood.
4) The applicant shall be responsible for the costs incurred by the
city for attorney, engineering, or other consultant fees during these
pre-application activities.
(b) PUD Concept Plan Review
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 216 of 301
1) Prior to formal application to the city, the applicant shall prepare
an Informal concept plan and present it to the planning and parks
commission and city council at a concurrent work session, as
scheduled by staff. The purpose of this meeting is to determine if all
parties are on a common track and if the development reflects the
stated public values;
2) Formal application shall be made to the city, and a thorough
review and staff report with a recommendation shall be forwarded
to the Planning and Parks Commission;

8) Create non-compliance with any special condition attached
to the approval of the final PUD plan.
(c) PUD Plan amendment. Any change not qualifying for an
administrative amendment or a PUD adjustment shall require a
PUD amendment. An application to amend a PUD shall be
administered in the same manner as that required for an initial PUD
beginning at preliminary plan. If such an amendment involves
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 221 of 301
changing a plat that has been through final plat approval, a new
final plat application must be made, per Section 500.19 subdivision
3(g).
Subd. 12. 26TUCancellationU.26T
A PUD shall only be cancelled and revoked upon the city council adopting
an ordinance rescinding the ordinance approving the PUD. In any event, it shall
not be necessary for the council to find the creation of a PUD district was in error.
Subd. 13. 26TUAdministrationU.
26TIn general, the following rules shall apply to all PUDs:
(a) No requirement outlined in the PUD process shall restrict the
city council from taking action on an application if necessary to meet
state mandated time deadlines;
(b) The city may require that PUD plans be certified at the time
of submittal and/or upon completion of construction;
(c) No building permit shall be granted for any building on land
for which a PUD plan is in the process of review, unless the
proposed building is allowed under the existing zoning and will not
impact, influence, or interfere with the proposed PUD plan;
(d) In the event any real property in the approved PUD
agreement is conveyed in total, or in part, the buyers thereof shall be
bound by the provisions of the approved final PUD plan constituting
a part thereof; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be
construed to create non-conforming lots, building sites, buildings or
uses by virtue of any such conveyance of a lot, building site, building
or part of the development created pursuant to and in conformance
with the approved PUD.
505.47 Six Mile Marsh Overlay District
Subdivision 1. UAffected propertiesU.
This section shall affect properties within the identified Six Mile Marsh
Protection Zone established by ordinance 274.
Subd. 2. UProtection from future developmentU.
The city recognizes that limiting development along Six Mile Marsh is
critical to realizing the purposes outlined in section 600.01 of this code. For
those purposes, lots within the Six Mile Marsh protection zone legally in
existence on June 6, 2003, will be subject to the following:
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 222 of 301
(a) No subdivision will result in more than one riparian lot with legal
access to the marsh;
(b) Legal access to a permitted dock on the riparian lot will be provided
for inland parcels which are assigned rights to watercraft storage;
(c) If an outlot is created to coordinate marsh access, the outlot and
dock must be owned and maintained by a homeowner’s
association.
Subd. 3. UProtection from overuseU.
The city recognizes that limiting use of Six Mile Marsh is critical to
realizing the purposes outlined in section 600.01 of this code. Furthermore, while
a general channel exists within the marsh, continual changes in water level and
wetland vegetation dictate that uses which may be appropriate given current
conditions may be inappropriate as those conditions change. Given this fact and
the city’s stated goal of protecting Six Mile Marsh, lots with legal riparian access
within the Six mile Marsh protection zone legally in existence on June 6, 2003,
are subject to the following:
(a) Only one dock or mooring area is allowed;
(b) No dock or mooring areas may be constructed or established which
provides space for or are used for mooring or docking of more than
two watercraft;
(c) Subsequent subdivision of any legal lot on Sox Mile Marsh must
required that watercraft storage right on the single dock be
assigned to individual lots, and a yearly multiple dock license be
obtained in accordance with provisions in chapter VI of this code.
505.49 Shoreland Overlay District
Subdivision 1. UStatutory authorizationU.
This section is adopted pursuant to the authorization and policies
contained in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 103F, Minnesota Regulations, Parts
6120.2500-6120.3900.
Subd. 2. UPurposeU.
The uncontrolled use of shorelands of the city affects the public health,
safety and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution of public waters,
but also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the
public health, safety and welfare to provide for the wise development of
shorelands of public waters. The legislature of Minnesota has delegated
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 223 of 301
responsibility to the municipalities of the state to regulate the subdivision, use
and development of the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and
enhance the quality of surface waters, preserve the economic and natural
environmental values of shorelands, and provide for the wise utilization of waters
and related land resources, and to protect these areas from encroachment by
commercial and industrial establishments.
Subd. 3. UConflict with pre-existing zoning regulationsU.
The shoreland district will be considered an overlay zoning district to all
existing land use regulations of the community. The uses permitted in subdivision
7 below will be permitted only if not prohibited by any established, underlying
zoning district. The requirements of this section will apply in addition to other
legally
established regulations of the community and where this section imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this section will apply.
Subd. 4. UNotification proceduresU.
(a) Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances,
amendments, or conditional uses under local shoreland
management controls must be sent to the DNR commissioner or
the commissioner’s designated representative, and be postmarked
at least ten days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to
consider proposed subdivisions/plats must include copies of the
subdivision/plat.
(b) A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats, and final
decisions granting variances or conditional uses under local
shoreland management controls must be sent to the DNR
commissioner or the commissioner’s designated representative and
postmarked within ten days of final action.
Subd. 5. UShoreland classificationU.
(a) In order to guide the wise development and utilization of shoreland,
certain protected waters in the city have been given a shoreland
management classification.
(b) These protected waters of the city have been classified by the
commissioner of natural resources as follows:

covenants, public dedications, permanent easement, or other
equally effective or permanent means. PUD's within the shoreland
district must maintain 50 percent of its overall site acreage as open
space. Open space areas should contain areas with physical
characteristics unsuitable for development in their natural states, or
historical sites. Open Space may include recreational facilities,
subsurface sewage treatment system, water-oriented accessory
structures or other similar facilities.
(d) A minimum of 70% of the shore impact zone, based on normal
structure setbacks, must be preserved in their natural vegetative
state. Invasive species are permitted to be removed, with the
submittal of a vegetation management plan;
(d) The following procedures and standards to determine the suitable
density of a development in the shoreland district shall be utilized:
(1) The shoreland overlay district shall be divided into tiers by
locating a line approximately parallel to a line that identifies the
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 231 of 301
ordinary high water level at the following intervals, proceeding
landward, per the DNR chart:
The tier area is calculated by determining the net area within
each tier, deducting wetlands, bluffs, and any areas below the
ordinary high water mark.
(2) The suitable net areas within each tier is divided by the single
residential lot size standard for the shoreland district, which
results in the number of units permitted within each tier.
(3) Increases to the dwelling unit densities are allowed under the
following circumstances, and are subject to the discretion of the
city, but shall under no means by increased by more than 50%
in the first tier and 100% in the second tier, 200% all additional
tiers:
a. Structure setbacks are increased by 50 percent; or
b. Structure setbacks are increased by 25 percent and the
impact on the waterbody is reduce an equivalent amount
through vegetative management, topography, or
additional means acceptable to the city.

Section 510: Environmental Protection Regulations
510.01 Marshes and Wetlands
Subdivision 1. UPolicyU.
(a) It is in the public interest to protect against uncoordinated and
unplanned land development which affects marshes, swamps, wetlands,
drainage ways, lakes and watercourses within the city, which
development, if allowed to continue, will result in loss and damage to
public and private improvements through inundation by flood waters and
subsequent expensive construction of storm sewers and other public
projects, in the permanent destruction of these natural resources, loss of
water retention facilities, open space and wildlife habitats, and impairment
of public and private water supplies. The objectives of this section are to
permit and encourage a coordinated land and water management
program and the retention of open land uses which will locate permanent
structures and artificial obstructions so as to not obstruct the passage of
waters nor destroy the natural public water areas, marshes and wetlands
within the city. The council has in mind its statutory obligation to adopt a
flood plain ordinance pursuant to Minnesota Statutes chapter 103, the
proposed regulations and model ordinances of the Lake Minnetonka
Conservation District and the particular watershed district, the open space
policies of the metropolitan council and its guidelines encouraging
protection of marshes, wetlands and the flood plain area, and the public
interest in preventing irreparable destruction of valuable natural resources
as expressed by numerous persons.
(b) In addition to these general purposes, the specific intent of this
section is to:
(1) Reduce danger to health by protecting surface and ground
water supplies from the impairment which results from
incompatible land uses by providing safe and sanitary
drainage;
(2) Reduce the financial burdens imposed both on this city and
on communities within the watershed districts and the
individuals therein by frequent floods and overflow of water
on lands;
(3) Permit and encourage planned development land uses
which will not impede the flow of flood water or cause danger
to life or property;
(4) Permit and encourage land uses compatible with the
preservation of the natural vegetation and marshes which
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 236 of 301
are a principal factor in the maintenance of constant rates of
water flow through the year and which sustain many species
of wildlife and plant growth;
(5) Avoid fast runoff of surface waters from developed areas to
prevent pollutional materials such as animal feces, motor
oils, paper, sand, salt and other debris, garbage and foreign
materials from being carried directly into the nearest natural
stream, lake or other public waters;
(6) Encourage a suitable system of ponding areas to permit the
temporary withholding of rapid water runoff which presently
contributes to downstream flooding and general water
pollution giving preference to areas which contribute to
groundwater infiltration and recharge, thereby reducing the
need for public projects to contain, store and control such
runoff;
(7) Provide sufficient land area to carry abnormal flows of storm
water in periods of heavy precipitation, and to prevent
needless expenditures of public funds for storm sewers and
flood protection devices which proper planning could have
avoided;
(8) Prevent the development of structures in areas unfit for
human usage by reason of danger from flooding, unsanitary
conditions or other hazards;
(9) Prevent the placement of artificial obstructions which restrict
the right of public passage and use of the bed, bank and
water of any creeks, marshes or watercourses within the
city.
Subd. 2. UDefinitionsU.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, will
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning:
Artificial obstruction means any obstruction which is not a natural
obstruction.
Flood plain means the land area adjacent to a watercourse, drainage way
or creek which has been or may be covered by flood waters.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 237 of 301
Natural obstruction means any rock, tree, gravel or analogous natural
matter that is an obstruction and has been located within the flood plain by a
nonhuman cause.
Obstruction means any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile,
abutment, projection, excavation, bridge, conduit, pole, culvert, building, wire,
fence, fill, other structure or matter in, along, across or projecting into the flood
plain and wetlands conservation area.
Protected area means the area defined and established in section 510.01.
Subd. 3.UDefinition and establishment of protected areaU.
The flood plain and wetlands conservation area within the city is defined
and established to be the low areas and flood plain adjoining and including any
watercourse or drainage way or body of water subject to periodic flooding or
overflow; and those areas designated and shown as marsh, wooded marsh,
submerged marsh, inundation area, intermittent lake or intermittent streams by
the United States Department of the Interior, through the Geological Survey on
maps and supporting data designated as Mound Quadrangle, Minnesota, (7.5
minute series, (1958)) and Watertown Quadrangle Minnesota (7.5 minute series,
(1981)). Those maps are hereby made a part of this section and two copies
thereof will remain on file in the office of the city administrator for public
inspection. For purposes of defining the application of this map to any specific
area, the maps, data and other available source material for this survey will be on
file in the office of the city administrator and will be proof of the intended limits of
the flood plain and wetlands conservation area. Any change in the flood plain and
wetlands conservation area as may from time to time be determined to be proper
will be reflected on those maps.
Subd. 4. UDevelopment prohibitedU.
No filling, grading, dredging, excavation or construction will be allowed
within the flood plain and wetlands conservation area; nor on lands abutting,
adjoining or affecting such area if such activity properly upon those adjacent
areas is incompatible with the policies expressed in this section and the
preservation of those wetlands in their natural state; nor will land within the
protected area be used in determining minimum area requirements for building
sites except as provided in section 510.01, subd. 11.
Subd. 5. UPermitU.
To specifically further define the specific boundaries of the flood plain and
wetlands conservation area as described in the official maps thereof, and to
insure the policies in this section are implemented, any persons undertaking
improvements to or on any land abutting or adjacent to the protected area will,
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 238 of 301
prior to commencing the work, obtain a permit therefore from the city. Approval
may be expressly given in conjunction with other permits applied for, but no
approval will be implied from the grant of such permits nor from the necessity to
apply for a permit as described herein. The granting of a permit will in no way
affect the owner's responsibility to obtain the approval required by any other
statute, ordinance or regulation of any state agency or any subdivision thereof.
Subd. 6. UPublic nuisanceU.
Any filling, alteration, construction or artificial obstruction of the flood plain
and wetlands conservation area is declared to be and to constitute a public
nuisance unless a permit to construct and maintain the obstruction has been
obtained in the manner provided herein.
Subd. 7. ULand development and plattingU.
No part of any lot within the flood plain and wetlands conservation area
will be platted for residential occupancy or for other uses which will increase the
danger to health, life, property or the public welfare. Whenever a portion of the
flood plain and wetlands conservation area is located within or adjoins a land
area that is being subdivided, the subdivider will dedicate an adequate easement
over the land within the protected area and along each side of such area for the
purpose of improving or protecting the area for drainage or other purposes
expressed in this section and other recreational uses, as determined by the
council. Public or private streets, driveways, drainage openings and culverts will
not be constructed unless the design thereof has been approved by the city, and
such structures will be designed so as not to restrict the flow of water.
Subd. 8. UCredits under other ordinancesU.
When land to be developed is within the Municipal Utility Service Area
(MUSA) and contains flood plains or wetlands, the owner will receive credit for
flood plains or wetlands for purposes of complying with the city’s land
development and zoning regulations relating to land use density, open space,
building unit to land area ratios or other similar requirements, with the exception
of park dedication, in an amount equal to but not to exceed the amount of land
that qualifies for development. This section shall not apply to open space
requirements for planned unit developments.
[Revised 02/04/2008, Ordinance 319]
Subd. 9. USpecial assessmentsU.
The land area in the flood plain and wetlands conservation area which is
not to be developed and which is dedicated as an easement will not be subject to
special assessments to defray the cost of other municipal improvement projects,
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 239 of 301
including but not limited to trunk sanitary sewer and water mains and storm
sewer improvements.
Subd. 10. URemoval of artificial obstructionsU.
If an artificial obstruction is found after investigation by the city, an order
will be issued to the owner, following ten days' written notice and hearing
thereon, for removal within a reasonable time as may be prescribed by the
condition and type of artificial obstruction. If the owner will fail to remove the
artificial obstruction or if the owner cannot be found or determined, the city will
have the power to make or cause such removal to be made, the cost of which will
be borne by the owner or specially assessed against the lands in the same
manner as prescribed by law for the levy of special assessments for municipal
improvements notwithstanding section 510.01 subd. 9. The special assessment
will be certified to the county auditor for collection in the same manner as the ad
valorem real property tax of the city.
Subd. 11. URecovery of wetland enforcement costsU.
Reasonable and necessary costs including but not limited to consulting
fees incurred by the city as a result of wetland violations under M.S. § 103G.2242
will be billed directly to the responsible party. If the responsible party is different
from the property owner, the city will notify the property owner of the charges. If
the responsible party or property owner does not pay the applicable charges, the
city may assess any unpaid fees to the respective property or recover the unpaid
fees by any other legal means.
510.03 Wetland Buffering and Setbacks
Subdivision 1. UPurposeU.
The purpose of this section is to protect the wetlands and maintain
buffering around wetlands to ensure the quality and functionality of the natural
resources within the city. Wetlands maintain water quality, serve to reduce
flooding and erosion, act as sources of food and habitat for a variety of fish and
wildlife and are an integral part of the community’s natural landscape. The city
has adopted the Wetland Conservation Act and Shoreland Management
Ordinance to further protect the natural resources in the city. When applying this
section, if in conflict with other ordinances, the more restrictive requirement
applies. In an effort to avoid overlapping or conflicting regulations, this section
shall defer to the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District rules for wetland buffering
in areas of the city included in that watershed district.
Subd. 2. UAreas affectedU.
Any property which contains a wetland as identified by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service maps; contains soils, vegetation, or hydrology that define a
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 240 of 301
wetland, or has been protected by the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources. The section will affect all subdivisions and properties that apply for
permits that may impact wetlands as identified by U.S. Fish and Wildlife and MN
DNR.
Subd. 3. USetbacks requiredU.
Zoning District Distance setback from
delineated edge of
wetland

PUD 35 feet to 50 feet
C1, C2, C3, PI, I 75 feet
Setbacks must be verified with wetland delineation information provided on a
certified certificate of survey. The requirement for delineation shall be applied in
cases where the wetland exists within 150 feet of the proposed project.
Subd. 4. UBuffer strips requiredU.
A buffer strip is an area of non-disturbed ground cover abutting a wetland
left undisturbed to filter sediment, materials, and chemicals. Wetland buffer
strips abutting all wetlands will be maintained. The required buffer widths are as
follows:
Size of Wetland Width of Buffer Zone
0 - 1 acre 16.5 feet
1 - 2.5 acres 20 feet
2.5 - 5 acres 25 feet
>5 acres 35 feet
For subdivisions, an acceptable buffer strip will have the following
qualities:
(a) Continuous dense layer of perennial grasses that have been
uncultivated or unbroken for at least 10 consecutive years, or
(b) Has an over story of trees and/or shrubs with at least eight percent
canopy closure that have been uncultivated or unbroken for at least
ten consecutive years, or
(c) Contains a mixture of the plant communities described above, that
have been uncultivated or unbroken for at least ten consecutive years.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 241 of 301
(d) If none of these qualities are in existence, establishment of a buffer is
required, in accordance with subd. 6.
Subd. 5. UUnacceptable buffer stripsU.
A buffer strip is unacceptable if:
(a) It is composed of undesirable plant species (including, but not
limited to reed canary grass, common buckthorn, purple loosestrife,
leafy spurge and noxious weeds, or any other undesirable species
as determined by a natural resource specialist), or
(b) It is lacking a layer of organic thatch or duff, or
(c) It has topography that tends to channelize the flow of surface
runoff, or
(d) For some other reason it is unlikely to retain nutrients and
sediment.
Subd. 6. UBuffer areasU.
Buffer areas not meeting the criteria in subd. 5 must be planted and
maintained according to each of the following:
(a) Buffer zones will be planted with a seed mix containing 100 percent
perennial native plant species, except for a one-time planting of an
annual nurse or cover crop such as oats or rye.
(b) The seed mix to be used will consist of at least 12 pounds pure live
seed (PLS) per acre of native prairie grass seed and five pounds
PLS per acre of native forbs. Native prairie grass and native form
mixes will contain no fewer than four and five species respectively.
(c) The annual nurse or cover crop will be applied at rate of 20 pounds
per acre.
(d) Native shrubs may be substituted for forms. Such shrubs may be
bare root seedling and will be planted at a rate of 60 plants per
acre. Shrubs will be distributed so as to provide a natural
appearance and will not be planted in rows.
(e) Native prairie grasses and forms will be planted by a qualified
contractor.
(f) No fertilizer will be used in establishing new buffer zones, except on
highly disturbed sites when deemed necessary to establish
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 242 of 301
acceptable buffer vegetation and then limited to amounts indicated
by an accredited soil testing laboratory.
(g) All seeded areas will be mulched immediately with clean straw at a
rate of one and one-half tons per acre. Mulch will be anchored.
(h) Buffer zones (both natural and created), will be protected by silt
fence during construction and the fence will remain in place until
the area crop is established.

Ordinance 442]
Start of Construction includes substantial improvement, and means the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement that occurred before the permit’s expiration
date. The actual start is either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of
piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation;
or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory
buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of
the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
building. [Added 09/19/2016; Ordinance 442]
Structure means anything constructed or erected on the ground or
attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings,
factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, travel
trailers/vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in section 510.05
subd. 14 (a) and other similar items.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 246 of 301
equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation
(including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or
other improvement of a structure within any consecutive 365-day period, the cost
of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
(a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions.
(e) Any alteration of an “historic structure,” provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
“historic structure.” For the purpose of this section, “historic
structure” shall be as defined in Code of Federal Regulations, Part
59.1.
Subd. 2. UStatutory authorization, findings of fact, and purpose.
(a) Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Minnesota
has, in Minnesota Statutes Chapters 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the
responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of Minnetrista,
Minnesota does ordain as follows.
(b) Purpose.
(1) This ordinance regulates development in the flood hazard areas of
the City of Minnetrista. These flood hazard areas are subject to
periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the
purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions.
(2) National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This ordinance is
adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National
Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal
Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to maintain the
community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(3) This ordinance is also intended to preserve the natural
characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 247 of 301
order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water
quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and
enhance community and economic development.
[Replaced 09/19/2016; Ordinance 442]
Subd. 3. UGeneral provisions.
(a) How to Use This Ordinance. This ordinance adopts the floodplain
maps applicable to the City of Minnetrista and includes three floodplain
districts: Floodway, Flood Fringe, and General Floodplain.
(1) Where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are delineated on the
floodplain maps, the standards in Subd. 5 or 6 will apply, depending
on the location of a property.
(2) Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are not
delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the
General Floodplain district. Within the General Floodplain district,
the Floodway District standards in Subd. 5 apply unless the
floodway boundary is determined, according to the process outlined
in Subd. 7. Once the floodway boundary is determined, the Flood
Fringe District standards in Subd. 6 may apply outside the
floodway.
(b) Lands to Which Ordinance Applies. This ordinance applies to all
lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Minnetrista shown on the Official
Zoning Map and/or the attachments to the map as being located within the
boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Floodplain Districts.
(1) The Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Floodplain Districts are
overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning
districts. The standards imposed in the overlay districts are in
addition to any other requirements in this ordinance. In case of a
conflict, the more restrictive standards will apply.
(c) Incorporation of Maps by Reference. The following maps together
with all attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to
be a part of the Official Zoning Map and this ordinance. The attached
material includes the Flood Insurance Study for Hennepin County,
Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas, dated November 4, 2016 and the
Flood Insurance Rate Map panels enumerated below, dated November 4,
2016, all prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
These materials are on file in the office of the City Clerk.

Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 248 of 301
(d) Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. The regulatory flood
protection elevation (RFPE) is an elevation no lower than one foot above
the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation
caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of
a floodway.
(e) Interpretation. The boundaries of the zoning districts are
determined by scaling distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(1) Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on
the official zoning map and actual field conditions, the flood
elevations shall be the governing factor. The Zoning Administrator
must interpret the boundary location based on the ground
elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first National
Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the
regulatory floodplain, and other available technical data.
(2) Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be
given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Board of
Appeals and Adjustment) and to submit technical evidence.
(f) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this
ordinance to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or other private agreements. However, where this ordinance
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance prevail. All
other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
(g) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. This ordinance does not imply
that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within
such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance
does not create liability on the part of the City of Minnetrista or its officers
or employees for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
(h) Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the
remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected and shall remain in full
force.
(i) Annexations. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by
reference into Subd. 3(c) above may include floodplain areas that lie
outside of the corporate boundaries of the City of Minnetrista at the time of
adoption of this ordinance. If any of these floodplain land areas are
annexed into the City of Minnetrista after the date of adoption of this
ordinance, the newly annexed floodplain lands will be subject to the
provisions of this ordinance immediately upon the date of annexation.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 249 of 301
(j) Detachments. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by
reference into Subd. 3(c) above will include floodplain areas that lie inside
the corporate boundaries of municipalities at the time of adoption of this
ordinance. If any of these floodplain land areas are detached from a
municipality and come under the jurisdiction of the City of Minnetrista after
the date of adoption of this ordinance, the newly detached floodplain lands
will be subject to the provisions of this ordinance immediately upon the
date of detachment.

Subd. 4. Establishment of Zoning Districts.
(a) Districts:
(1) Floodway District. The Floodway District includes those areas
within Zones AE that have a floodway delineated as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in Subd. 3(c). For lakes,
wetlands and other basins within Zones AE that do not have a
floodway delineated, the Floodway District also includes those
areas that are at or below the ordinary high water level as defined
in Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.005, subdivision 14.
(2) Flood Fringe District. The Flood Fringe District includes areas
within Zones AE that have a floodway delineated on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map adopted in Subd. 3(c), but are located outside
of the floodway. For lakes, wetlands and other basins within Zones
AE that do not have a floodway delineated, the Flood Fringe District
also includes those areas below the 1% annual chance (100-year)
flood elevation but above the ordinary high water level as defined in
Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.005, subdivision 14.
(3) General Floodplain District. The General Floodplain District
includes those areas within Zones A or AE that do not have a
delineated floodway as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
adopted in Subd. 3(c).
(b) Applicability: Within the floodplain districts established in this
ordinance, the use, size, type and location of development must comply
with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. In no
cases shall floodplain development adversely affect the efficiency or
unduly restrict the capacity of the channels or floodways of any tributaries
to the main stream, drainage ditches, or any other drainage facilities or
systems. All uses not listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in Subd.
5, 6, and 7 are prohibited. In addition, critical facilities, as defined in Subd.
1, are prohibited in all floodplain districts.

flood elevations and must not involve structures, obstructions, or
storage of materials or equipment.
(3) Any facility that will be used by employees or the general public
must be designed with a flood warning system that provides
adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and
velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in
feet per second) would exceed a product of four upon occurrence
of the regional (1% chance) flood.
(c) Conditional Uses: The following uses may be allowed as
conditional uses following the standards and procedures set forth in Subd.
12 of this ordinance and further subject to the standards set forth in Subd.
5(d), if otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district or any applicable

(d) Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses:
(1) All Uses. A conditional use must not cause any increase in the
stage of the 1% chance or regional flood or cause an increase in
flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
(2) Fill; Storage of Materials and Equipment:
(i) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to
human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
(ii) Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials deposited or
stored in the floodplain must be protected from erosion
by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable
method. Permanent sand and gravel operations and
similar uses must be covered by a long-term site
development plan.
(iii) Temporary placement of fill, other materials, or
equipment which would cause an increase to the stage of
the 1% percent chance or regional flood may only be
allowed if the City Council has approved a plan that
assures removal of the materials from the floodway
based upon the flood warning time available.
(3) Accessory Structures. Accessory structures, as identified in Subd.
5(c)(1), may be permitted, provided that:
(i) structures are not intended for human habitation;
(ii) structures will have a low flood damage potential;
(iii) structures will be constructed an placed so as to offer a
minimal obstruction to the flow of flood waters;
(iv) Service utilities, such as electrical and heating
equipment, within these structures must be elevated to or
above the regulatory flood protection elevation or
properly floodproofed;
(v) Structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with the FP1 or FP2
floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code.
All floodproofed structures must be adequately anchored

walls.
(vi) As an alternative, an accessory structure may be
internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4
floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code,
provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 252 of 301
investment and does not exceed 576 square feet in size.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or
exceed the following criteria:
a. To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic
pressure, there must be a minimum of two
“automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure, with a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding; and
b. There must be openings on at least two sides of
the structure and the bottom of all openings must
be no higher than one foot above the lowest
adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding
will not satisfy this requirement for automatic
openings.
(4) Structural works for flood control that will change the course,
current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters are
subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245.
(5) A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must not
cause an increase to the 1% chance or regional flood. The
technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss
on both sides of a stream.
(6) Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary
watercourse or drainage system.
[Replaced 09/19/2016; Ordinance 442]
Subd. 6. Flood Fringe District (FF).
(a) Permitted Uses: Permitted uses are those uses of land or structures
allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the standards in
Subd. 6(b). If no pre-existing, underlying zoning districts exist, then any
residential or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land is a
permitted use provided it does not constitute a public nuisance.
(b) Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
(1) All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory
flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures
must be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill must extend at the same elevation
at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure.
(2) Accessory Structures. As an alternative to the fill requirements of
Subd. 6(b)(1), structures accessory to the uses identified in Subd.
6(a) may be permitted to be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 253 of 301
or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code,
provided that:
(i) the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment,
does not exceed 576 square feet in size, and is only used for
parking and storage.
(ii) All portions of floodproofed accessory structures below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation must be: (i)
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls, (ii) be constructed with materials resistant
to flood damage, and (iii) must have all service utilities be
water-tight or elevated to above the regulatory flood
protection elevation
(iii) Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the
following criteria:
a. To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure,
there must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings
in the outside walls of the structure, with a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and
b. There must be openings on at least two sides of the
structure and the bottom of all openings must be no
higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade
to the structure. Using human intervention to open a
garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this
requirement for automatic openings.
(3) The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel must
not exceed 1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended
to elevate a structure in accordance with Subd. 6(b)(1) of this
ordinance, or if allowed as a conditional use under Subd. 6(c)(3)
below.
(4) The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(5) All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or watertight
to prevent infiltration of floodwaters.
(6) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding,
flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
(7) All fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method.
(8) All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood
protection elevation, or must have a flood warning /emergency
evacuation plan acceptable to the City Council.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 254 of 301
(9) Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots
may be at an elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection
elevation. However, any facilities used by employees or the general
public must be designed with a flood warning system that provides
adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and
velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in
feet per second) would exceed a product of four upon occurrence
of the regional (1% chance) flood.
(10) Interference with normal manufacturing/industrial plant operations
must be minimized, especially along streams having protracted
flood durations. In considering permit applications, due
consideration must be given to the needs of industries with
operations that require a floodplain location.
(11) Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the
standards of Subd. 16 of this ordinance.
(c) Conditional Uses: The following uses and activities may be allowed as
conditional uses, if allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any
applicable overlay district, following the procedures in Subd. 12 of this
ordinance.
(1) Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in
accordance with Subd. 6(b)(1) – (2) of this ordinance.
(2) Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
(3) The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill
when the fill is not being used to elevate a structure in accordance
with Subd. 6(b)(1) of this ordinance.
(4) The use of methods to elevate structures above the regulatory flood
protection elevation, including stilts, pilings, parallel walls, or abovegrade,
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages,
shall meet the standards in Subd. 6(d)(6).
(d) Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:
(1) The standards listed in Subd. 6(b)(4) – (10) apply to all conditional
uses.
(2) Basements, as defined by Subd. 1 of this ordinance, are subject to
the following:
(i) Residential basement construction is not allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
(ii) Non-residential basements may be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement
is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with Subd.
6(d)(3) of this ordinance.
(3) All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation must be
floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing
classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry
floodproofing must meet the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classification
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 255 of 301
in the State Building Code, which requires making the structure
watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
(4) The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar
material on a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a
structure to the regulatory flood protection elevation) must comply
with an approved erosion/sedimentation control plan.
(i) The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize
the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the regional
(1% chance) flood event.
(ii) The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable
to the City Council.
(iii) The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal
of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning
time exists.
(5) Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood
protection elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan
providing for removal of such materials within the time available
after a flood warning.
(6) Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory
flood protection elevation. The base or floor of an enclosed area
shall be considered above-grade and not a structure’s basement or
lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one
side of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally flood and is
constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted
alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional
standards:
(i) Design and Certification - The structure’s design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional
engineer as being in compliance with the general design
standards of the State Building Code and, specifically, that
all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be
at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be
designed to prevent flood water from entering or
accumulating within these components during times of
flooding.
(ii) Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas -
Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or
tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and
the design plans must stipulate:
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 256 of 301
a. The minimum area of openings in the walls where
internal flooding is to be used as a floodproofing
technique. There shall be a minimum of two openings
on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom
of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum
net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
unless a registered professional engineer or architect
certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The
automatic openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices
provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters without any form of human
intervention; and
b. That the enclosed area will be designed of flood
resistant materials in accordance with the FP3 or FP4
classifications in the State Building Code and shall be
used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or
storage.

Subd. 7. General Floodplain District (GF).
(a) Permitted Uses:
(1) The uses listed in Subd. 5(a) of this ordinance, Floodway
District Permitted Uses, are permitted uses.
(2) All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation
criteria specified in Subd. 7(b) below. Subd. 5 applies if the
proposed use is determined to be in the Floodway District.
Subd. 6 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the
Flood Fringe District.
(b) Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations:
(1) Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval
within the General Floodplain District, the Zoning Administrator
must obtain, review and reasonably utilize any regional flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or
other source.
(2) If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily
available, the applicant must furnish additional information, as
needed, to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation
and whether the proposed use would fall within the Floodway or
Flood Fringe District. Information must be consistent with
accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards and
the standards in Subd. 7(b)(3) below.
(3) The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the
following components, as applicable:
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 257 of 301
(i) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance)
flood.
(ii) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood
based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel
and overbank areas.
(iii) Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the
regional flood without increasing flood stages more than
one-half (0.5) foot. A lesser stage increase than 0.5 foot
is required if, as a result of the stage increase, increased
flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the
reach must be assumed in computing floodway
boundaries.
(4) The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information
and assess the technical evaluation and the recommended
Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary. The
assessment must include the cumulative effects of previous
floodway encroachments. The Zoning Administrator may seek
technical assistance from a designated engineer or other expert
person or agency, including the Department of Natural
Resources. Based on this assessment, the Zoning
Administrator may approve or deny the application.
(5) Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have
been determined, the Zoning Administrator must process the
permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of
Subd. 5 and 6 of this ordinance.

Subd. 8. Public Utilities, Railroads, Roads, and Bridges.
(a) Public Utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas,
electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain
must be floodproofed in accordance with the State Building Code or
elevated to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(b) Public Transportation Facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges
to be located within the floodplain must comply with Subd. 5 and 6 of this

Subd. 9. Land Development Standards.
Recognizing that flood prone areas may exist outside of the designated
floodplain districts, the requirements of this section apply to all land within the
City of Minnetrista.
(a) Subdivisions. No land may be subdivided which is unsuitable for
reasons of flooding or inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage
treatment facilities. Manufactured home parks and recreational vehicle
parks or campgrounds are considered subdivisions under this
ordinance.
(1) All lots within the floodplain districts must be able to contain a
building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
(2) All subdivisions must have road access both to the subdivision
and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below
the regulatory flood protection elevation, unless a flood warning
emergency plan for the safe evacuation of all vehicles and
people during the regional (1% chance) flood has been
approved by the City Council. The plan must be prepared by a
registered engineer or other qualified individual, and must
demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out
the evacuation.
(3) For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood
Fringe District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection
elevation and the required elevation of all access roads must be
clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting
documents.
(4) In the General Floodplain District, applicants must provide the
information required in Subd. 7(b) of this ordinance to determine
the regional flood elevation, the Floodway and Flood Fringe
District boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation
for the subdivision site.
(5) If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is
in a flood prone area, any such proposal must be reviewed to
assure that:
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 259 of 301
(i) All such proposals are consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage within the flood prone area,
(ii) All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems are located and constructed
to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and
(iii) Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of
flood hazard.
(b) Building Sites. If a proposed building site is in a flood prone area, all
new construction and substantial improvements (including the
placement of manufactured homes) must be:
(1) Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
floatation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy;
(2) Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage;
(3) Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damage; and
(4) Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and
air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are
designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.

Subd. 10. Administration.
The Zoning Administrator or other official designated by the City Council
must administer and enforce this ordinance.
Permit Requirements:
(a) Permit Required. A permit must be obtained from the Zoning
Administrator prior to conducting the following activities:
(1) The erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation, or alteration of
any building, structure, or portion thereof. Normal maintenance and
repair also requires a permit if such work, separately or in
conjunction with other planned work, constitutes a substantial
improvement as defined in this ordinance.
(2) The use or change of use of a building, structure, or land.
(3) The construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system,
although a permit is not required for a farm fence as defined in this
ordinance.
(4) The change or extension of a nonconforming use.
(5) The repair of a structure that has been damaged by flood, fire,
tornado, or any other source.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 260 of 301
(6) The placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of
materials or equipment within the floodplain.
(7) Relocation or alteration of a watercourse (including new or
replacement culverts and bridges), unless a public waters work
permit has been applied for.
(8) Any other type of “development” as defined in this ordinance.
(b) Application for Permit. Permit applications must be submitted to
the Zoning Administrator on forms provided by the Zoning Administrator.
The permit application must include the following as applicable:
(1) A site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, existing or proposed
buildings, structures, and significant natural features having an
influence on the permit.
(2) Location of fill or storage of materials in relation to the stream
channel.
(3) Copies of any required municipal, county, state or federal permits
or approvals.
(4) Other relevant information requested by the Zoning Administrator
as necessary to properly evaluate the permit application.
(c) Certificate of Zoning Compliance for a New, Altered, or
Nonconforming Use. No building, land or structure may be occupied or
used in any manner until a certificate of zoning compliance has been
issued by the Zoning Administrator stating that the use of the building or
land conforms to the requirements of this ordinance.
(d) Certification. The applicant is required to submit certification by a
registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land
surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in
compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. Floodproofing measures
must be certified by a registered professional engineer or registered
architect.
(e) Record of First Floor Elevation. The Zoning Administrator must
maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement)
of all new structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in
the floodplain. The Zoning Administrator must also maintain a record of
the elevation to which structures and alterations or additions to structures
are floodproofed.
(f) Notifications for Watercourse Alterations. Before authorizing any
alteration or relocation of a river or stream, the Zoning Administrator must
notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to
work in public waters pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245,
this will suffice as adequate notice. A copy of the notification must also be
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 261 of 301
submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
(g) Notification to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase or
Decrease Base Flood Elevations. As soon as is practicable, but not later
than six months after the date such supporting information becomes
available, the Zoning Administrator must notify the Chicago Regional
Office of FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy of the relevant
technical or scientific data.

Subd. 11. Variances.
(a) Variance Applications. An application for a variance to the
provisions of this ordinance will be processed and reviewed in accordance
with applicable state statutes and Section 505.05 Subd. 9 of the zoning
ordinance/code.
(b) Adherence to State Floodplain Management Standards. A variance
must not allow a use that is not allowed in that district, permit a lower
degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for
the particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state
law.
(c) Additional Variance Criteria. The following additional variance
criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
(1) Variances must not be issued by a community within any
designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
(2) Variances may only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing
of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant
the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant,
and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
(3) Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(d) Flood Insurance Notice. The Zoning Administrator must notify the
applicant for a variance that: 1) The issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and 2) Such construction below the base or regional flood level
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 262 of 301
increases risks to life and property. Such notification must be maintained
with a record of all variance actions.
(e) General Considerations. The community may consider the
following factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on
variances and conditional uses in floodplains:
(1) The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments;
(2) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others;
(3) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the
ability of these systems to minimize the potential for disease,
contamination and unsanitary conditions;
(4) The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(5) The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use
to the community;
(6) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
(7) The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding;
(8) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
(9) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Land
Use Plan and flood plain management program for the area;
(10) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
(f) Submittal of Hearing Notices to the Department of Natural
Resources (DNR). The Zoning Administrator must submit hearing notices
for proposed variances to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at
least ten days’ notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic
mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist.
(g) Submittal of Final Decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions
granting variances must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such
action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the
respective DNR area hydrologist.
(h) Record-Keeping. The Zoning Administrator must maintain a record
of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and must
report such variances in an annual or biennial report to the Administrator
of the National Flood Insurance Program, when requested by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.

(f) If the percentage of trees to be removed is greater than 30
percent as calculated in (e)(8) above, a second matrix shall be
provided which sorts the significant trees by caliper inch and
identifies all trees for which replacement trees are required (in
accordance with section 510.07 subd. 8 of this code). This matrix
should conclude with a tabulation of the following:
(1) Total number of caliper inches for which replacement
trees are required;
(2) Calculation of the required caliper inches of trees to
be replaced and shown as required replacement trees within
the tree preservation plan.
Subd. 7. UTree Inventory updates.U
Tree inventories may need to be updated due to changes in grading plans,
construction-related events, or the passage of significant amount of time between
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 272 of 301
the initial inventory and the submittal of preliminary or final plat application. Tree
inventory updates shall include the following information:
(a) All significant trees on the site shall be re-examined by a
Forestry Specialist. The tree inventory must identify all impacted
trees. Impacted trees shall be identified as trees to be removed on
the updated tree inventory;
(b) Updated tree inventories shall be subject to the same
requirements and submitted in the same format as the original tree
inventory required by this section;
(d) If an updated tree inventory indicates that trees actually
removed exceeded the planned trees to be removed as previously
approved by the city, the applicant shall be required to provide
additional replacement trees;
(e) If the revised inventory indicates fewer trees have been
removed than originally stated in the tree preservation plan, the
applicant shall receive a credit for the additional caliper inches of
trees that were preserved. The credit may only be used towards
planned future removal of trees on the property. Under no
circumstances may this credit be used to eliminate required
plantings for the development that are required by other city code
provisions or standards (i.e., shade trees), nor may the creditSsS be
used to avoid the applicant’s existing obligations to ongoing or
completed construction (i.e., expected replacement trees required
in conjunction with a building permit).
Subd. 8. UProtection during development.U
Both the applicant and the builder shall be responsible for all trees on an
individual lot until the as-built survey is approved,, and for the trees on the
remainder of the property until all public improvements are accepted regardless
of whether the applicant is constructing the homes within the subdivision or
planned unit development or is selling the proposed lots to individual builders.
Subd. 9. UProtection timeline.U
Trees identified on the tree preservation plan shall be protected by the
applicant throughout the development process. Upon approval of an as-built
survey indicating the location of existing and newly planted trees, the city’s
enforcement of the tree preservation plan shall cease. For lots and outlots that
are not intended to be built upon, the tree preservation work shall be reviewed
and accepted from the applicant upon acceptance of the required improvements.
For developments containing homeowners’ associations, the homeowners’
association shall be responsible for further enforcement of the preservation of
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 273 of 301
significant trees and this obligation shall be reflected in the homeowners’
association’s declaration.
Subd. 10. UReplacement Tree Rate RequirementsU
Planned and unplanned removal of trees shall be subject to the following
requirements:
(a) Caliper inches planned for removal beyond the allowed 30
percent shall be subject to a required replacement as defined in this
section. For every caliper inch of trees to be removed beyond the
allowed 30 percent, replacement trees shall be required at a rate of
one caliper inch for every one caliper inch of trees lost.
(b) In the event a tree to be preserved is later identified for
removal in conjunction with an activity authorized by the city, the
replacement trees shall be required at a rate of one caliper Inch for
every one caliper inch of trees lost.
(c) If a tree to be preserved is subject to unplanned removal, the
replacement trees shall be required at a rate of two caliper inches
for every one caliper inch of trees lost.
(d) Tree replacement required under this ordinance shall be in
addition to shade tree or other plantings required by other code
provisions.
(e) Alternatives to Tree Replacement:
(1)In cases in which it can be demonstrated that a property
cannot accommodate additional trees on site and
replacement trees are required, the city council, at its sole
discretion, may also allow an applicant to contribute $100.00
per Caliper Inch city’s Tree Replacement and Environmental
Enhancement Fund.
(2) In the case of unplanned tree removal, the City
Planner, or his or her designees, may allow an applicant to
contribute $100.00 per caliper inch of unplanned tree removal
to the City’s Tree Replacement and Environmental
Enhancement Fund.
(3) The City may use the funds paid to the Tree
Replacement and Environmental Enhancement Fund for the
following activities:
i. Planting additional trees on public property;

request of the applicant. The applicant shall utilize a variety of
species, and one species shall not consist of more than 25 percent
of a replacement schedule.
Subd. 12.U Security for Tree preservation and Replacement Trees.U
To ensure tree preservation and that replacement tree efforts are
successful, the following are required:
(a) Applicants subject to this section maybe required to provide
the city with a financial security consisting of a letter of credit, cash,
or escrow, in favor of the city, in an amount of 150 percent of the
estimated cost of the tree replacement and any required
landscaping work.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 275 of 301
(b) All replacement trees, required shade trees and landscaping
shall be planted during the ideal planting season unless otherwise
authorized by city staff. Upon completion of planting, the applicant
shall submit to the city a useable inventory of the trees planted.
(c) All trees, required shade trees and landscaping material
planted shall be warranted by the applicant through two complete
growing seasons. During this time, the city shall inspect the trees
and landscaping material in order to ensure that they are healthy
and do not need to be replaced. If any tree or landscaping material
needs to be replaced, the city shall notify the applicant in writing. If
the applicant does not replace the trees or landscaping material
within the specified time in the notice, the city may replace them
and draw from the financial security for its expenses incurred in
performing the work.
(d) If trees are declared to be healthy trees by the city upon inspection and
any required landscaping material is also healthy, the applicant may request a
reduction to the financial security, provided that adequate funds remain equal to
150 percent of the cost to complete any remaining work.

complying with the standards of this section;
(g) Dynamic Displays existing on the effective date of this section must
comply with the operational standards listed above. An existing
Dynamic Display that does not meet the structural requirements as
stated above may continue as a non-conforming Sign subject to
Section 405.31. An existing Dynamic Display that cannot meet
minimum font size requirements as stated in Section 405.11 must
use the largest size possible for one line of copy to fit in the
available space.

515.29 Non-conforming Signs
Any Sign legally existing at the time of the passage of this section that does not
conform to the provisions of this section shall be considered a legal nonconforming
Sign and may be continued through repair, replacement, restoration,
maintenance, or improvement, but not including expansion. “Expansion” shall be
defined as any structural alteration, change or addition that is made outside of
the original Sign structure, Display Surface Area or design.
(a) Nothing in this section shall prevent the return to a safe condition of
a Sign structure that has been declared to be unsafe by the zoning
administrator or building official.
(b) When any legal non-conforming Sign is discontinued for a period of
more than one year, or is changed to a conforming Sign, any future
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 295 of 301
Sign shall be in conformity with the provisions of this section.
(c) Any legal non-conforming Sign shall be removed and shall not be
repaired, replaced or rebuilt if it is damaged by fire or other similar
peril to the extent of greater than 50 percent of its market value at
the time of destruction and no conditional Sign permit or building
permit (if applicable) has been applied for within 180 days of the
date of destruction. The city’s building official shall be responsible
for making the determination of whether a non-conforming Sign has
been destroyed greater than 50 percent of its market value at the
time of the destruction. In making this determination, the building
official shall consider the market value of the entire Sign at the time
prior to the destruction and the replacement value of the existing
Sign. In the event a building permit or conditional Sign permit is
applied for within 180 days of the date of destruction and the Sign
did not withstand damage greater than 50 percent of its market
value at the time of the destruction, the city may impose reasonable
conditions upon the building permit and conditional Sign permit in
order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent properties.
(d) A lawful non-conforming Sign shall not be changed to a similar nonconforming
Sign or to a more restrictive non-conforming Sign.

notice.
Subd. 2. Penalties. Any person convicted of violating this section shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine or imprisonment as
specified by state statute. Each day in which a violation continues to occur shall

515.37 Severability and Conflict
This section and its parts are declared to be severable. If any section,

declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this
decision shall not affect the validity of this section as a whole. All parts of this
section not declared invalid or unconstitutional shall remain in full force and effect
as if such portion so declared or adjudged unconstitutional or invalid was not
originally part of this section, even if the surviving parts of the section result in
greater restrictions after the unconstitutional or invalid provisions are stricken. If
any part of this section is found to be in conflict with any other provision of this
section or any other provision of the city code or other applicable law or
regulation, the most restrictive or highest standard shall prevail. If any part of this
section is explicitly prohibited by federal or state law, that part shall not be

Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 297 of 301
Section 520: Official Maps
520.01. Purpose.
Land that is needed for future streets, parks, utilities and other necessary
public facilities and services, is frequently diverted to nonpublic uses which could
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 298 of 301
have been located on other lands without hardship or inconvenience to the
owners. When this occurs, public uses of land may be denied or may be obtained
only at prohibitive costs or at the expense of dislocating the owners and
occupants of the land. Identification on an official map of land needed for future
public uses permits both the public and private property owners to adjust their
building plans equitably and conveniently before investments are made which
would otherwise make such adjustments difficult to accomplish. It is the purpose
of this section to provide a uniform procedure for the proper use of official maps
as authorized by law.
520.03. Official maps.
Definition. In this section "official map," means a map adopted in
accordance with this section showing existing streets, proposed future streets,
and the area needed for widening of existing streets of the city; existing and
proposed parks and trails and areas necessary for their proper development;
existing and proposed utilities; and the location of existing and future land and
facilities within the city. An official map may cover the entire city or any portion of
the city.
520.05. Initiation of proceedings.
Proceedings for adoption, amendment or repeal of an official map or any
part thereof, may be initiated by a recommendation of the planning commission
or the parks and recreation commission, action by the city council on its own
initiative, request of an outside governmental body, or a petition of the owners of
the affected properties. The fee to be charged to file a petition will be as
established by resolution.
520.07. Sketch maps and reports.
Every proposal or request for an official map or its amendment or repeal,
however initiated, will be accompanied by a sketch map or plat showing the lands
proposed to be included and the public purpose to be served. The council may
request a report of the city engineer as to the feasibility of any construction
involved.
520.09. Reference to planning commission or parks and recreation
commission.
Except when proceedings have been initiated by recommendation of the
planning commission or the parks and recreation commission, every proposed
official map or change in the map will be referred to the planning commission
and/or the parks and recreation commission for advice and recommendations
thereon, and such recommendations will be submitted to the city council within
120 days after reference to the planning commission and/or parks and recreation
commission along with the report of the commission on the effect of the proposal
on the city comprehensive plan. If no recommendations are received from the
planning commission and/or parks and recreation commission within 120 days
after reference of the proposal to the commission by the council, the council may
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 299 of 301
take such action as it may deem proper upon the proposal without further action
by the planning commission and/or parks and recreation commission.
520.11. Notice.
Upon receiving the recommendations of the planning commission and/or
parks and recreation commission, or after 120 days from the submission of the
proposal to the planning commission and/or parks and recreation commission
without recommendations from those commissions, the council will call a public
hearing on the proposal. The notice of time, place, purpose of the hearing and a
description of the property to be included in the official map will be published in
the official newspaper at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. At least
ten days prior to the date of the hearing, the city administrator will also mail a
copy of the notice to each owner of land situated within or abutting the
boundaries of the official map. For purposes of this notice, the owner will be
determined by the records of the county auditor and the notice will be addressed
to the last known address as shown by the auditor's records. Failure to serve any
such notice will not invalidate the proceedings.
520.13. Hearing.
At the time and place specified in the notice, the council will hear evidence
and arguments concerning the proposal. The hearing may be continued from
time to time. Upon closing of the public hearing, the council may vote on the
proposal.
12T520.15. Adoption12T.
Official maps will be prepared in sufficient detail to permit the
establishment of future acquisition lines on the ground. In unplatted areas a
minimum of a centerline survey will be made prior to the preparation of the final
draft of the official map. The accuracy of the future acquisition lines shown on the
official map will be attested to by a registered land surveyor. The official map or
an amendment or repeal of a previous official map, will be adopted in ordinance
form by a majority vote of the city council. The ordinance will include a legal
description of the area included in the official map. A certified copy of the official
map together with an attached copy of the ordinance, will be filed with the county
recorder.
520.17. Effect.
USubdivision 1.
After an official map has been adopted and filed, the issuance of building
permits by the city will be subject to the provisions of this section. The building
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 300 of 301
inspector will deny every application for a permit to construct a new building or
structure or expand an existing building or structure within an area designated on
the official map. Whenever any street is widened, improved, or any new street is
opened, any park or trail is acquired or developed, any land is acquired or
developed for utilities, or any interest in lands for other public purposes is
acquired by the city, the city will not be required in such proceedings to pay for
any building or structure placed without a permit or in violation of conditions of a
permit within the limits of the mapped street, park or trail or outside of any
building line or building envelope that may have been established upon the
existing street, park or trail, or within any area thus identified for utilities or other
public purposes. The adoption of an official map does not give the city any right,
title, or interest in areas identified for public purposes thereon, but the adoption of
the map does authorize the city to acquire such interest without paying
compensation for buildings or structures erected in such areas without a permit
or a violation of the conditions of a permit.
USubd. 2.
After an official map has been adopted and filed, the approval of
subdivisions by the city will be subject to the provisions of this section. The city
council may deny a proposed subdivision or a portion thereof which lies within
any area designated on the official map for streets, parks or trails, utilities, or
other public purposes.
12T520.19. Appeals12T.
USubdivision 1.
Whenever a building permit or subdivision is denied pursuant to this
section, the city council may, upon appeal filed with it by the owner of the land
and after receiving the advice and recommendations of the planning commission
and/or parks and recreation commission, grant a permit for building or approve a
subdivision or apportion thereof in an area designated on the official map for a
street, park or trail, utilities or any public purpose in any case in which the council
finds, upon evidence in the arguments presented to it by the applicant:
(a) That the entire property of the applicant, of which the area
designated for public purposes forms a part, cannot yield a
reasonable return to the owner unless such a permit is
granted; and
(b) That balancing the interest of the city in preserving the
integrity of the official map and of the city comprehensive
plan and the interest of the property owner in the use of the
owner’s property and in the benefits of ownership, the
granting of such permit or approval of such subdivision or
portion thereof, is required by considerations of justice and
equity.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter V – Planning and Land Use Page 301 of 301
USubd. 2.
Failure of the planning commission and/or parks and recreation
commission to report on the appeal within 120 days after referral of the matter to
it, is deemed to mean that there is no recommendation and advice from the
planning commission and/or parks and recreation commission. The city council
will hold a public hearing upon the appeal after notice of the hearing has been
published in the official newspaper once at least ten days before the hearing. If
the city council authorizes issuance of a permit or approval of a subdivision or
portion thereof, it will specify the exact location, ground area, height, and other
details as to the extent and character of the building for which the permit is
granted or for which a building permit may be granted in a subdivision. If the city
council so authorizes issuance of a permit, or approval of a subdivision or portion
thereof, the council will have six months from the date of the decision to institute
proceedings to acquire such land or interest therein and if no proceedings are
started within that time, the building inspector will issue the permit if the
application otherwise conforms to all local ordinances.

CHAPTER VI - BOATS, DOCKS AND WATERWAYS
Section 600: General provisions
600.01. Intent.
The waters within the city and their associated shoreline are unique, highly valued and
limited resources which offer much to the citizens of the city and surrounding communities. The
waters and shoreline provide recreational opportunities, natural beauty, increased valuation, and
important environmental functions. Yet, these many benefits are threatened and may be
ultimately lost if the use of waters and shoreline is not regulated. Uncontrolled activities
diminish the aesthetic and recreational qualities of the waters and shoreline, increase congestion
along the shoreline, endanger the safety of users of the waters, reduce the total area of water
surface available for public use, adversely affect wildlife and their habitats on the waters and
along the shoreline, pollute the waters and their shoreline, decrease valuation, and cause
conflicting water and land uses. These existing problems will be further aggravated by more
intense shoreline development, unless properly controlled.
To conserve and use water resources in the city in the best interest of its citizens, and to
promote the public health, safety, and welfare, it is the intent of the city to establish regulations
which will eliminate the negative impacts on the waters and shoreline and thus allow for the safe,
enjoyable, attractive, and environmentally sound use of them. The objectives of this chapter are
to promote safety, prevent overuse of the waters and shoreline, protect the environmental quality
of the waters and shoreline, promote attractive shoreline, maintain and enhance existing
valuations, promote the character and preserve and enhance the stability of neighborhoods,
regulate structures in the waters and on the shoreline, avoid conflicting water and land uses, and
promote the enjoyable use of the waters and shoreline.
600.03. Harbor limits.
The geographical and jurisdictional limits of this city in, on and over navigable waters in or
adjacent to it will extend to the harbor limits of any adjoining municipality or other
governmental unit. The area within 300 feet of the water line on the shore of any lake or other
body of water in or adjacent to the city will be known as the "primary harbor limit". The area
extending from 300 feet to the water line on the shore of any lake or other body of water in or
adjacent to the city and to the harbor limits of an adjoining municipality or another governmental
unit will be known as the "secondary harbor limit". The harbor limits of the city will be deemed
not to extend beyond a point half way between the shores of the body of water over which it has
jurisdiction and the shores of the body of water located in another municipality or governmental
unit.

Section 605: Docks and other structures
605.01. Multiple docks and joint docks policy.
The city will encourage the clustering of boat slips in joint docks and a few multiple docks
rather than scattering those boat slips at a variety of locations throughout many individual docks.
Though the city has encountered problems with multiple docks in the past, joint docks and
multiple docks offer a distinct advantage to the city, if properly controlled. Multiple docks and
joint docks encourage creative and innovative planned unit development designs, promote
aesthetics since they preserve more public and private open space and greenery, offer an
attractive amenity to residents, increase valuations, and provide for better security. Multiple and
joint docks also offer many environmental benefits, including the preservation of sensitive
environmental features, such as steep slopes and wetlands, protection of wildlife habitats,
preservation of vegetation, and the improvement of water quality. Multiple and joint docks,
however, will be carefully controlled by the city by limiting their density. The minimum length
of shoreline per boat slip will be the minimum residential lot width in the applicable zoning
district. The city will also use easements, covenants and restrictions, homeowner's associations,
and other tools to regulate a variety of issues.
605.03. Docks and mooring areas.
Subdivision 1. Construction and maintenance.
A dock or mooring area, whether temporary or permanent, must be constructed and
maintained in a safe, clean, attractive, and environmentally sound manner and must not
constitute a hazard to the public. A lot on which or in front of which a dock or mooring area is
placed must be maintained in a safe, clean, attractive and environmentally sound manner,
including the construction and maintenance of proper erosion control measures, and must not
constitute a hazard to the public.
Subd. 2. Timing of construction.
The construction of a dock or mooring area on or in front of a lot shall be allowed prior to
construction of a dwelling or other structure on that same lot.
Subd. 3. Winter storage.
Winter storage of a dock or mooring materials on shoreline will be allowed providing they:
(a) Are stored in a safe, proper and neat manner;
(b) Are stored above the ordinary high water level; and
(c) Have setbacks of at least 15 feet from side lot lines.
Subd. 4. Lighting.
No oscillating, rotating, flashing or moving light may be used on a dock or mooring area.
Dock and mooring area lighting must not be directed toward the water in such a manner that it
impairs the vision of or confuses operators of watercraft. No lighting in the area of a lake will be
installed or directed so as to affect adjoining dock use areas or create a hazard to navigation.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VI- Boats, Docks and Waterways Page 6 of 28
Subd. 5. Signs.
No sign will be displayed from any dock or mooring area except an area identification sign
which must not exceed two square feet in area.
Subd. 6. Dimension limits for docks.
A dock may exceed six feet, excluding posts, in either its length or width, but not both.
Subd. 7. Extensions.
No multiple dock or mooring area will extend across the extended zone line between lots
zoned differently by the city.
Subd. 8. Shoreline requirements.
(a) No docks or mooring areas shall be constructed or established which provide
space for or are used for mooring or docking a greater number of watercraft than
one for each 50 feet of continuous shoreline. When measurements determining the
number of watercraft allowed result in the provision of a fractional watercraft, any
fraction up to and including one-half will be disregarded, and fractions over onehalf
will allow one additional watercraft.
(b) Two or fewer watercraft may be kept at any dock or mooring area which is
otherwise in compliance with all city ordinances.
(c) Three or four watercraft may be kept at any dock or mooring area which is
otherwise in compliance with all city ordinances providing watercraft storage
permit is obtained in accordance with section 610.03 of this chapter and the
number of watercraft does not exceed one per 50 feet of continuous shoreline in
accordance with clause (a) above.
Subd. 9. Unusual configurations.
Where the provisions of this section would cause the authorized dock use area of two or more
lots to overlap, or where there is any other unusual configuration of shoreline or extended lot
lines, which causes a conflict between the owners of two or more adjacent or nearby lots as to
the use of the same area of the water for docks, mooring areas or structures or for reasonable
access to the water, the owner of any of the affected lots may apply to the city for a variance
pursuant to this chapter. A variance may permit the applicant to locate a dock, mooring area or
structure in a location different from that permitted by this chapter or to permit or require the
owner of any adjacent or nearby lot to do so.
Subd. 10. Space between boats.
Reasonable space must be provided in mooring areas to allow navigation freely between
moored boats.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VI- Boats, Docks and Waterways Page 7 of 28
605.05. Nonconforming docks and mooring areas.
Subdivision 1. Generally.
Any docks or mooring areas existing upon May 3, 1983, which do not conform to the
provisions of this section must immediately comply with all provisions of this section, except
that specific existing docks and mooring areas are allowed to continue as is with variances being
hereby granted to specific docks and mooring areas as in accordance with resolutions No. 25-83,
26-83, 27-83, 28-83, 29-83, 30-83, and 31-83. The variances must be automatically renewed
each year subject to the conditions in this section.
Subd. 2. Inspection.
Upon construction of the nonconforming multiple dock or mooring area, the applicant will
notify the city. Upon such notification, the city must inspect the dock or mooring area and the
land on which or in front of which the dock or mooring area is located to assure compliance with
this section and variances.
Subd. 3. Expansion.
The nonconforming multiple dock or mooring area must not be expanded, enlarged, or
extended to occupy a greater height or area of land or water or involve a greater number of boat
slips or storage of watercraft, except in conformance with the provisions of this section.
Subd. 4. Maintenance.
Normal maintenance of a nonconforming multiple dock or mooring area is permitted,
including necessary nonstructural repairs and incidental alterations which do not extend the
nonconforming use. Nothing in this section will prevent the placing of a structure in a safe
condition after it has been declared unsafe by the building official of the city.
Subd. 5. Future regulations.
The use of the nonconforming multiple dock or mooring area will remain subject to such
regulations and conditions and restrictions as the city and other regulatory authorities from time
to time will find necessary in the public interest.
605.07. Authorized dock use area.
Subdivision 1. Limits.
An authorized dock use area is described as follows:
(a) The authorized dock use area for lots bordering on the water extends into the
water a distance equal to the lot water frontage to be measured at right angles to
the side lot lines and, except as provided herein, must not extend into the water a
distance of greater than 100 feet to be measured on a line parallel to the side lot
lines as extended into the water.
(b) The authorized dock use area for lots bordering on the water is limited in width by
the setback limitations prescribed in this section. The setback from side lot lines
as extended in a water must be as follows:
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VI- Boats, Docks and Waterways Page 8 of 28
For that portion of the
length of the authorized
dock use area which
extends from the shore
Side Setback (Feet)
Zero to 50 feet 10
50 to 100 feet 15
Where boat slips open toward a side lot line, the side setback provided must be at
least equal to the slip depth, but must not be less than 20 feet. In any case, side
setbacks will be doubled for all multiple docks or mooring areas on each side
where such multiple docks or mooring areas are not located adjacent to another
multiple dock or mooring area.
(c) The authorized dock use area must be measured from the point which forms the
shoreline when the body of water is at its ordinary high water mark. During
periods when water level falls below the ordinary high water mark and when so
declared by resolution of the city council, the city may issue permits for
temporary dock extensions beyond the authorized dock use area subject to the
following limitations:
(1) Need for the temporary dock extension must be demonstrated by the
applicant.
(2) The extension must be a temporary, seasonal type dock. No extensions
may be on pile driven or permanent year-round docks.
(3) The extension must meet all requirements of this section other than
the length limitation described in section 605.03, subdivision 6.
(4) The extension must only be permitted during the time a water level is
below the ordinary high water mark and, at any given time, must be
permitted only to the extent of the equivalent dockage and comparable
depth existing at a water elevation of the ordinary high water mark.
(5) The extension, together with the original dock, must not be used to
provide storage space for a greater number of watercraft than are
authorized under this section or for a greater number of watercraft than are
licensed or permitted, if a license or permit for the dock is required under
this section.
(d) A joint dock or mooring area does not have to maintain side setbacks from the
common side lot line shared by the two adjoining lots, but in any event must
observe side setbacks at the outer lines of the combined lots involved in such a
joint use.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VI- Boats, Docks and Waterways Page 9 of 28
(e) A lot which has a water frontage of 40 feet or more, but less than 60 feet, may
have a dock extending up to 60 feet into the water. Any such lot which has a
water frontage of less than 40 feet may have a dock which extends beyond the
authorized dock use area to the point necessary to reach a water depth of three
feet, and no further; provided that no such dock will be located or extended more
than 60 feet into the water. Side setback requirements must be observed unless a
variance is granted by the city council under section 610.05 of this chapter or the
conditions set forth in clause (f) below are met.
(f) The authorized dock use area, in the case of lots 50 feet in width or less, may be
expanded to a side setback of five feet, provided that such side setback in no way
impairs access to neighboring docks.
(g) The length limitations prescribed by this section may be adjusted under the
variance provisions of section 610.05 to allow the construction and maintenance
of a dock in a water to a water depth of three feet at the outer end of such dock to
provide adequate water depth for navigation and to protect the environmental
quality or natural habitat of the water adjacent to the dock.
Subd. 2. Water use restrictions.
No person will use any area of a body of water outside an authorized dock use area, for
docks, mooring areas or watercraft storage, unless such use is specifically permitted by this
section. No person will use any area of a body of water within any authorized dock use area for
docks, mooring areas or watercraft storage, without the consent of the riparian owner. No person
who is in charge or control of any property on a body of water whether as owner, tenant,
occupant, lessee, or otherwise, will allow any sunken, wrecked, junked, or discarded watercraft
within any dock use area for a period of longer than one week.
Subd. 3. Selling, renting, or leasing of space.
No person will sell, rent, or lease for the storage of watercraft any space within dock use
areas. Such space may only be rented or leased at docks of apartments or planned unit
developments solely for the storage of watercraft owned by residents of the apartment or planned
unit development and providing an annual dock license is obtained in accordance with section
610.01.
605.09. Boat slips and slip structures.
Subdivision 1. Permitted.
Boat slips or slip structures may be erected in a water. Such structures must be of no greater
height, area, volume or mass than is necessary to secure and protect the number of watercraft
which it is designed to shelter. The structure must be so constructed to permit the use of a fabric
canopy in conjunction with necessary poles, rigging and appurtenances necessary to support the
canopy.
Subd. 2. Setback.
A slip structure must have a side setback of at least 20 feet.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VI- Boats, Docks and Waterways Page 10 of 28

of controlled access lots;
(b) The number of allowed slips allowed on a multiple dock will be determined by
standards established in this section;
(c) The public waters access lots must be jointly owned by all purchasers of lots in
the subdivision or by all purchasers of nonriparian lots in the subdivision who are
provided riparian access rights on the access lot; and
(d) The city council must approve protective covenants regulating recreational use of
said lot, maintenance and multiple dock configuration. The covenants must also
require all parking areas, storage buildings, and other facilities to be screened by
vegetation or topography as much as practical from view from the public water,
assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
605.13. Fish houses, warming houses.
(a) No person will place any fish house, warming house, or other similar structure on

605.17. Structures not to obstruct.
No dock, mooring area, or structure will be so located as to obstruct a navigable channel, or
so as to obstruct reasonable access to any other dock, mooring area or structure authorized under
this section. No dock, mooring area or structure shall be located or designed so that it requires or
encourages watercraft using it to encroach into any other authorized dock use area. A dock,
mooring area or structure is "authorized" if it is automatically permitted under this chapter or if a
variance has been granted under section 610.05.
605.19. Retaining walls, steps, decks, and other structures.
The construction of retaining walls, steps, stairways, decks, and other similar structures on
land relating to docks, mooring areas, and general shoreline use, must meet the conditions of all
city ordinances.
605.21. Storage.
Unless otherwise specifically permitted by this section, no structure on the water may be
used for the storage of any materials or items other than watercraft except for throw-out life
preservers and fire extinguishers which must be properly stored in an orderly manner on racks
provided for that purpose.
605.23. No vested rights.
Nothing in this section or any license, permit, or variance related thereto will confer upon
any person or to the benefit of any property any vested right to use the water and the shoreline in
the manner permitted by this section or any license, permit, or variance. The use of the water and
shoreline must remain subject to such regulations and conditions and restrictions of any license,
permit, or variance as the city and other regulatory authorities will find necessary from time to
time in the public interest.

use and maintenance of the dock or mooring area and the lots on which or in front
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VI- Boats, Docks and Waterways Page 15 of 28
of which the dock or mooring area is to be located. In case that the annual dock
license involves the transfer of dock or mooring rights or the clustering of docks
or mooring areas at a density exceeding the standard of one watercraft per each 50
feet of continuous shoreline, the city must require a restrictive easement and
covenants and restrictions over a portion of the shoreline which is not to be used
for docking or mooring, with such easements and covenants assuring the
continued open space of that shoreline, the exclusion of docking or mooring from
that area, and the preservation of an overall density of one watercraft per 50 feet
of continuous shoreline. Restrictive easements and covenants and restrictions may
also be required to address other conditions, such as dock configuration, setbacks,
number of boats, winter storage, boat storage, screening, accessory structures,
amount of hard-cover, size of boats, noise, fire protection, pollution control, sale
of gas and fuel, dock design, erosion control, and launching and retrieving of

control devices.
Subd. 8. Expiration.
The annual dock license shall expire on December 31 of the year for which it is issued.
Subd. 9. No vested rights.
It may become necessary in the future for the city to make an allocation or apportionment of
multiple dock and mooring area privileges on and within a water, on an equitable basis, in order
to avoid overcrowding, and in order to balance the many conflicting demands upon the water. In
order to give notice to applicants that the annual dock license does not create any vested rights
and that future regulatory actions by the city may necessitate modifying or discontinuing the
facility for which the license is granted, each annual dock license must state that the multiple
dock or mooring area is subject to existing and future policies and regulations adopted by the
city.
610.03. Permit.
Subdivision 1. Required.
A permit under this section is required for the following structures:

will be in compliance with city ordinances. The city review must include, but not be limited to,
setbacks, boat densities, size and configuration of the dock or mooring area, road and pedestrian
access, environmental constraints, and impact on neighboring properties. If the city refuses to
issue the permit, the city must state the reasons for refusal to the applicant in writing.
Subd. 4. Expiration.
A watercraft storage permit will expire on December 31 of the year for which the permit is
issued. A joint dock permit or permanent dock permit will expire upon a change in ownership of
the lot or lots on which or in front of which the dock or mooring area is located.

Minnetrista City Code Chapter VI- Boats, Docks and Waterways Page 24 of 28
Section 625: Water surface use
625.01. Little Long Lake.
Subdivision 1. Identification of body of water.
The body of water to which the regulations of this subsection shall be applied is located
wholly within the city of Minnetrista. The body of water is known locally as "Little Long Lake"
and is located partially within Sections 9, 10, 15 and 16, Township 117 North, Range 24 West of
the 5th Principal Meridian. The body of water is identified by the Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources as 27-179P.
Subd. 2. Intent.
Little Long Lake is located within a relatively small but deep basin, which is bounded by
ridges and hills. The 104-acre lake is separated into two basins by a shallow area of cattail
growth. The northern basin contains a public access and an informal swimming area. This basin
consists only of about 45 acres of open water, but is up to 73 feet deep. The water quality and
clarity is excellent and the environment is quite natural.
These physical characteristics have encouraged a variety of low-profile uses such as
canoeing, swimming, scuba diving and small-craft fishing. It is the city's intention to encourage
the continued serenity and purity of the lake, as well as its existing mixture of low-profile uses.
The ridges and hills surrounding the basin create a natural amphitheater. Any sound within
the basin is amplified. Therefore, the existing quietude of canoes, swimming, scuba diving and
small fishing craft will be negatively impacted by the loud noise associated with larger gasoline
motors.
The speed associated with larger gasoline engines is unnecessary on a body of water the size
of Little Long Lake. Furthermore, large boats and motors using the public access will likely
conflict with the existing uses near the access. Both swimming and scuba diving occur within
several hundred feet of the access.
Subd. 3. Permitted motor types.
In order to further the stated intent of the city, only motors of ten horsepower or less may be
used on Little Long Lake.
Subd. 4. Exemptions.
Enforcement, resource management and emergency personnel when in performance of their
official duties are exempt from the provisions of subdivision 3 of this section.
625.03. Ox Yoke Lake.
Subdivision 1. Identification of body of water.
The body of water to which the regulations of this section will be applied is located wholly
within the city of Minnetrista and is known as Ox Yoke Lake. The body of water is identified by
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VI- Boats, Docks and Waterways Page 25 of 28
the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources as 27-178P and is located in Section 5 and
Section 6, Township 117, Range 24.
Subd. 2. Intent.
Ox Yoke Lake is located within the city of Minnetrista. The natural environment lake, as
defined by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, is approximately one mile in length
by 900 feet at the widest expanse. The lake is very shallow and has a marsh like shoreline.
Access is gained to Ox Yoke Lake from Judicial Ditch No. 20 that extends from Carver County
No. 20 through Ox Yoke Lake and particularly in the fall of the year for the purpose of hunting
game on the lake. The residents of Ox Yoke Lake have expressed concern that by allowing the
access of boats with large motors, eurasian milfoil will be brought into the lake and infest a lake
that at this time is free of eurasian milfoil.
Subd. 3. Permitted motor types.
In order to further the stated intent of the city, only boat motors of five horsepower or less
may be used on Ox Yoke Lake.
Subd. 4. Exemptions.
Enforcement, resource management and emergency personnel when in performance of their
official duties are exempt from the provision of subdivision 3 of this section.
625.04. Six Mile Marsh
Subdivision 1. Purpose, intent and application.
The city is authorized by Minnesota Statutes Sections 86B.201, 86B.205, and 459.20, and
Minnesota Rules 6110.3000 - 6110.3800, to enact ordinances to control and regulate the surface
use of the waters of Six Mile Marsh. In enacting this ordinance regarding Six Mile Marsh, it is
the purpose of the city to protect the environment of the marsh and the lands and waters
surrounding it in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan; to ensure the safety of persons and
property in connection with the use of its waters; to harmonize and integrate the varying uses of
its waters; and to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Minnetrista.
This ordinance is adopted in recognition that Six Mile Marsh is a shallow body of water located
within a fragile ecosystem and that it has experienced only limited development to date.
Regulation of the use of watercraft and docks on Six Mile Marsh is necessary to protect the
environment of the waters and lands surrounding the marsh.
Subd. 2. Identification of Six Mile Marsh.
Six Mile Marsh is the body of water identified by the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources as public water wetland 27-960W, and is located entirely within the City of
Minnetrista. In general terms, Six Mile Marsh is by and large the water body between State
Highway 7 and Lake Minnetonka. Six Mile Marsh is divided into two areas based on historical
use of the waters within Six Mile Marsh, and based on the historical ability to utilize such waters
due to environmental conditions. The portions of Six Mile Marsh located east of a north/south
line between Sections 27 & 28 and 33 & 34, T177N-R24W, shall be known as the Lower Marsh
as the area west of this point is generally inaccessible to motorized boats without severe impact
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VI- Boats, Docks and Waterways Page 26 of 28
to vegetation. The portion of Six Mile Marsh located west of a north/south line between
Sections 27 & 28 and 33 & 34, T177N-R24W, shall be known as the Upper Marsh.
Subd. 3. Regulation of the Lower Marsh.
(a) The Lower Marsh shall be a slow-no wake area for all watercraft. For purposes of
this Section, the terms “slow-no wake” and “watercraft” shall have the meanings
given to them in Minnesota Statutes Section 86B.005. The slow no-wake
restriction shall not apply to authorized law enforcement personnel or
governmental resource management personnel in performance of their duties.
(b) The sheriff or public safety director shall provide for the placement of signs at
appropriate areas of Six Mile Marsh and Lake Minnetonka to inform operators of
watercraft of the speed and use limitations established by this section.
Subd. 4. Regulation of the Upper Marsh.
(a) No person shall operate a motorboat on the waters of the Upper Marsh. The
prohibition against the use of motorboats on the Upper Marsh shall not apply to
authorized law enforcement personnel or governmental resource management
personnel in performance of their duties.
(b) The sheriff or public safety director shall provide for the placement of signs at
appropriate areas of Six Mile Marsh to inform operators of watercraft of the
motorboat prohibition established by this section.
625.05. Enforcement.
The primary responsibility for enforcement of this section will be the Minnetrista Public
Safety Department. Other enforcement agencies, including the Hennepin County Sheriff’s
Department are also authorized to enforce this section.
625.07. Notification.
It will be the responsibility of the city to provide for adequate notification to the public,
including the placement of necessary signs at access points, within the city and any buoying or
signs in the water.
625.09. Penalties.
Any person who will violate any of the provisions of this section will be guilty of a
misdemeanor.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VI- Boats, Docks and Waterways Page 27 of 28
Section 630: Public water access
630.01 Purpose.
The city enacts this section for the purpose of facilitating the sage and orderly flow of traffic
through public lake accesses and to promote the clean-up of such accesses for the benefit of the
citizens of the city.
630.03. Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, will have the meaning ascribed to them in this
section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning.
Public lake access means boat launching areas to public waters that we owned by the city.
Vehicle includes, but not limited to, vehicles and trailers used for launching boats or other
recreational watercraft, and any vehicles used for commercial or construction activities or
deliveries.
630.05. No obstruction of traffic.
No vehicle may unreasonably obstruct the flow of traffic to any public lake access. In no
case may any vehicle remain within any public lake access for more than ten minutes, regardless
of the purpose for which the public lake access is being used.
630.07. Weight limitation.
Vehicles in excess of three tons gross axle weight are prohibited in any public lake access.
630.09. Clean-up of access area.
All persons using a public lake access for any purpose must remove after each use all debris,
including, but not limited to, paper litter, construction materials, dirt and rock.
630.11. Penalty.
Failure to comply with any provision of this section is a misdemeanor and is punishable as
such under state law.

CHAPTER VII - PUBLIC UTILITIES
Section 700 - City water system
700.01. Consent to article.
Every person applying for water service from the city system, and every
user of water or owner of property for which such application is made, will be
deemed by such application to consent to all the rules, regulations and rates
contained in the ordinances of the city, as amended, and all new rules,
regulations or rates duly adopted.
700.03. Private water supplies.
No water pipe of the city's water supply system may be connected by any
pump, well or tank that is connected with any other source of water supply and
when such are found the city administrator will notify the owner of the water
supply to immediately disconnect from the city’s water supply. If not done
immediately, the city will turn off the city’s water supply.
700.05. Water deficiency.
The city is not liable to consumers for any deficiency or failure in the
supply of water, whether occasioned by shutting water off for the purpose of
making repairs or connections, or from any other cause. The city may shut off
the water in cases of (1) fire or alarm of fire to ensure a supply for fire fighting;
(2) repairs or constructing new works; or, (3) an emergency. The water may be
shut off at any time as long as necessary for completion of the project or until the
cessation of the emergency.
700.07. Access to buildings.
City officials and employees must have free access at reasonable hours of
the day to all parts of every building and premises connected with the city water
supply system for reading of meters and inspections.
700.09. Water service connections.
Subdivision 1. Permit required.
No connection or service tapping will be made with a city service tap or
water main without a permit issued by the city upon application by a master
plumber.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VII: Public Utilities Page 4 of 32
Subd. 2. Application.
An application for a permit must be made in writing and signed by the
owner or owner’s agent duly authorized to do the work. The application must
state clearly the kind of service for which the connection is intended, the size and
kind of pipe to be used, the street and number, which side of the street, if on a
corner, on which street to be tapped, with a diagram of the property to be
supplied, showing the streets, the boundary, the block on which it is situated, with
the distance from the nearest corner, the full name and address of the owner, the
purpose for which the water is to be used, and what plumbing work in the
premises, if any, has been done by an unlicensed plumber; and the application
must show all other particulars necessary to the full understanding of the subject.
No permit will authorize anything not stated in the application.
Subd. 3. Permit revocation or suspension.
For any misrepresentation in the permit application the permit may be
suspended; and if the misrepresentation appears to be willful, the permit will be
revoked.
Subd. 4. Connection size.
Permits must describe the location and size of each connection, and size
must not be departed from in any degree. Water connections to the service tap
for ordinary domestic supply will be three-quarters inch unless permission of the
city is obtained for the desired change.
700.11. Tapping and connection fees and charges.
Subdivision 1. Permit fees.
Before any permit will be issued, the permit applicant must pay a fee for
water main tapping or connecting in the amount established by a resolution of the
city council and any other sums that may be required under this section.
Subd. 2. Assessment charges.
No permit will be issued to tap or connect with any water main of the city
either directly or indirectly from any lot or tract of land unless the city
administrator will have certified:
(a) That such lot or tract of land to be served by such connection or tap
has been assessed for the cost of construction of the water main with
which the connection is made; or
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VII: Public Utilities Page 5 of 32
(b) If no assessment has been levied for such construction cost, that
proceedings for levying such assessment have been or will be
commenced in due course; or
(c) If no assessment has been levied, and no assessment proceedings will
be completed in due course, but a sum equal to the portion of cost of
constructing the water main which would be assessable against the lot or
tract has been paid to the city.
If no such certificate can be issued by the city administrator, no such
permit to tap or connect to any water main will be issued unless the applicant
pays an additional connection fee which must be equal to the portion of the cost
of construction of the said main which would be assessable against said lot or
tract to be served by such tapping or connection. The assessable cost is to be
determined by the city administrator upon the same basis as any assessment
previously levied against other property for that main.
Subd. 3. Fee disbursement.
Any sum received by the city under subdivision 1 above will be paid into a
special suspense account until it is determined by the council whether the
property served by the connection under permit will be assessable for any other
water main. If it is determined that no other main will be so assessable, then the
fee will be credited to the fund for the water main to which the connection was
made, but if the tract or lot served by the connection is subsequently assessed
for another water main, such sum will be transferred to the fund for said main and
credited against the amount assessable against the tract or lot.
700.13. Connections beyond city boundaries.
In all cases where water mains of the city have been or will be extended to
or constructed in any road, street, alley or public highway adjacent to or outside
the corporate limits of the city, the administrator is authorized to issue permits to
the owners or occupants of properties adjacent to, or accessible to, such water
mains to tap and make proper water service pipe connections with such water
mains of the city in conformity with and subject to all the terms, conditions and
provisions of this section relating to the tapping of the city water mains and
making water service pipe connections, and to furnish and supply water from the
water works system of the city to such owners and occupants of properties
adjacent or accessible to such water mains of the city through and by means of
water meters duly installed.
Water service rendered to such persons will be subject to all provisions of
this section, and persons accepting such service will agree to be bound and
obligated by same.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VII: Public Utilities Page 6 of 32
700.15. Excavation permits required.
No person except city personnel and its contractors will excavate in a
public street to service a water main, make connection or for any purpose which
will expose a water main, unless given a permit to do so by the city in
accordance with the provisions of this section, and the filing of a bond in the
amount of $5,000 guaranteeing satisfactory performance of such work.
700.17. Turning on water.
No person will turn on any water supply at the stop box without a permit
from the city administrator. No permit will be issued unless the house number,
as given by the building inspector, is prominently displayed, and no such permit
will be given to anyone but a master plumber. The city reserves the right to turn
off any water supply if said number is not displayed after a written notice has
been sent to the owner as appearing on its books.
700.19. Supply from one corporation cock or stop box.
No more than one house or building will be supplied from one corporation
cock, except by special permission of the city administrator. Whenever two or
more parties are supplied from one pipe, connecting with the distribution main,
each building or part of building must have a separate stop box at the property
line unless other provisions are made by agreement with the city administrator.
700.21. Repair of leaks.
In case of failure upon the part of any consumer or owner to repair any
leak occurring upon their water service pipe within 24 hours after verbal or written
notice has been given, the water will be shut off and will not be turned on until the
defect is corrected and a sum in the amount established by resolution has been
paid. The city may act without such notice to repair or correct an emergency
situation resulting from malfunction of the water system.
700.23. Use confined to premises.
No person will permit water from the city water supply system to be used
for any purpose except upon their own premises without prior approval of the
city.
700.25. Water meters.
(a) Except for extinguishment of fires, or when authorized by special
permit from the city administrator and for temporary purposes only, no
person will use water from the water supply system of the city, or permit
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VII: Public Utilities Page 7 of 32
water to be drawn from it, except the same be metered by passing through
a meter supplied or approved by the city.
(b) No person unless authorized by the city administrator will connect,
disconnect, take apart, or in any manner change, or cause to be changed,
or interfere with any such meter or its function.
(c) The council will by resolution fix the charge to be paid by customers for
new water meters in original connection installations and payment of such
charges will be made before delivery for installation.
(d) Whenever any meter becomes obstructed or out of order, the city will
cause it to be repaired. The cost of such repairs must be paid out of the
water fund unless the meter had been damaged by freezing or willful
neglect by someone outside of the city employ. On request of any
customer and payment to the city administrator of a fee in the amount
established by resolution, the city will test such water meter. All water
meters obtained from the city will remain the property of the city and may
be replaced at any time by the city if found to be worn or defective beyond
repair. Such replacement will be paid for by the property owner or agent.
(e) No person will damage or knowingly or negligently permit damage to
be done to a water meter on their premises or elsewhere. Any person
damaging any such meter or knowingly or negligently permitting the same
to be damaged must pay all costs of making the required repairs to the
meter upon demand by the city.
700.27. Cost of installations borne by consumer.
The cost of original installation of all plumbing between the water service
tap and the meter, as well as all repairs to the same, will be borne entirely by the
consumer. Such plumbing will be subject to inspection by the city. Any repairs
found to be necessary by such representatives must be made promptly or the
city will be authorized to discontinue service.
700.29. Fire hydrants.
(a) It will be unlawful for any person, except when authorized by the city
administrator, or except members of the city fire, street or water
departments performing their official duties, to open or interfere with any of
the hydrants or gates of the city water supply system. Such permit will be
granted by the city administrator only upon application in writing, subject to
such regulations as may be prescribed by the council, upon payment of a
deposit fee in the amount established by resolution.
(b) Any person withdrawing water from a fire hydrant or other outlet of the
city water supply, except for extinguishment of a fire or other city
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VII: Public Utilities Page 8 of 32
purposes, will be obligated to pay the city a fee in the amount established
by resolution.
(c) No person will be granted a permit to withdraw water from a hydrant or
gate without a meter for a period in excess of 20 days.
(d) Upon return of any equipment furnished by the city and deduction of
charges, any balance of the deposit must be returned to the depositor.
(e) In case of withdrawal of water from a hydrant or other outlet without
permit the above charge will be in addition to other penalties provided for
violation of this section.
700.31. Discontinuance of service.
Water service may be discontinued at any time if:
(a) The owner or occupant of the premises served, or any person working
on any pipes or equipment which are connected with the city water supply
system, has intentionally violated any of the requirements of this section.
(b) Any charge for water, service, meter, meter parts or any other similar
financial obligations imposed on the present or former owner or occupant
of the premises served by the provisions of this section is unpaid.
(c) There has been fraud or misrepresentation by the owner or occupant in
connection with an application for service.
Water will not be turned off from any service pipe between the hours of 9:00
a.m. on Friday and 9:00 a.m. on the following Monday.
700.33. Water Conservation.
Subdivision 1. Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to promote outdoor water consumption
conservation measures, to conserve water resources, and to assist the city in
effective utilization of its annual Water Appropriation Permit limits as established
by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. A reduction in the level of
outdoor water consumption demand during peak demand periods will assist in
maintaining sufficient amounts of water for fire fighting, and reduce the urgency
for the construction of additional storage and wells.
Subd. 2. Definitions.
Irrigate/Irrigation means the watering of shrubs, trees, sod, seeded areas,
gardens, lawns, or any other outdoor vegetation.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VII: Public Utilities Page 9 of 32
Odd/Even Basis means the limitation on Irrigation in relation to calendar
dates and odd/even street addresses. If a property’s address ends in an even
number, Irrigation shall only take place on even numbered days of the week. If
the property’s address ends in an odd number, Irrigation shall only take place on
odd numbered days of the week.
Time of Day Restriction means the certain hours of the day when Irrigation
is prohibited.
Subd. 3. Water Conservation Measures.
(a) Time of Day Restriction. In order to conserve water resources and
prevent wasteful and harmful effects of Irrigation during the midday hours,
no person shall Irrigate using the public water supply between the hours of
10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on any day of the week from May 1st until
September 30th. This Time of Day Restriction applies to established
lawns, vegetation, shrubs, trees and gardens and also applies to new sod
and seed unless written permission to Irrigate during the restricted times is
obtained from the city administrator or his or her designee.
(b) Odd/Even Restriction. To reduce demand on the city’s water supply,
no person shall Irrigate using the public water supply except on an
Odd/Even Basis unless written permission to Irrigate during the restricted
days is obtained from the city administrator or his or her designee.
(c) Rainfall Sensors. All commercial, industrial, institutional and residential
automatic sprinkling systems shall have rainfall sensors installed in
accordance with Minnesota Statutes Section 103G.298, as amended.
Subd. 4. Emergency Reduction Measures.
The city administrator or his or her designee, is authorized to implement
additional water conservation measures at such times where water demand
exceeds supply capabilities or the public water reserve capacities are insufficient
to protect the community. Such emergency reduction measures may include, but
are not limited to, changes to the Time of Day Restriction or a complete ban on
Irrigation. Notice of such emergency reduction measures may be given by
publication, posting, mail or hand-delivered pamphlets.
Subd. 5. Exceptions.
The Water Conservation Measures required by this section do not apply to
the following situations:
(a) Hoses that are being hand held by a person;

children are present and actively playing with the toys or sprinklers; and
(e) Properties that contain new sod or seed, new trees or other new
vegetation. Written permission must be obtained from the city
administrator or his or her designee.
Subd. 6. Enforcement.
Any person violating the provisions of this section will be guilty of a
misdemeanor and upon conviction must be punished in accordance with the
provisions in Section 609.03 of Minnesota Statutes.
700.35 Rates and charges.
Subdivision 1. Water rates.
(a) The rate due and payable to the city by each water user within the city
for water taken from the city water supply system will be set by resolution
of the city council, which may be amended from time to time. In case the
meter is found to have stopped, or to be operating in a faulty manner, the
amount of water used will be estimated in accordance with the amount
used previously.
(b) The owner or contractor must make an application to the city when
water is desired for construction purposes and, if for any reason the meter
cannot be installed at that time, the charges for the water will be set forth
under water rates. When the building is completed the meter will be set in
the regular way.
(c) Water bills must be mailed to customers quarterly and must specify the
water consumed and the charge in accordance with the established rates,
and in addition a penalty of 15 percent will be added to the amount due if
not paid within 45 days after the date of the bill. Payments received by
mail postmarked on or before the 45th day will be deemed as paid within
such period.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VII: Public Utilities Page 11 of 32
(d) Rates due and payable to the city by each water user located beyond
the territorial boundaries of the city will be on the same basis as specified
in this section plus a percentage to be determined at the discretion of the
council.
Subd. 2. Connection charges.
Connection charges for connection with the city water system will be set
by resolution of the council for each project.
Subd. 3. Service charges.
(a) Charges will be collected for tapping and making connections with the
city water system at the service lead. Such charges will be paid at the
time of application for connection in the amount established by resolution
of the city council.
(b) In all cases where a connection to a water main is required, the
charges will be established by the city administrator and the work will be
subject to the supervision and specifications of the city engineer. In each
case, a separate bond of $5,000 will be required to guarantee satisfactory
performance.
Subd. 4. Delinquent accounts.
It will be the duty of the city administrator to promptly collect delinquent
accounts and in all cases where satisfactory arrangements for payment have not
been made, service may be discontinued. All delinquent accounts will be
certified by the administrator who will prepare an assessment roll each year
providing for assessment of the delinquent amounts against the respective
properties served, which assessment roll will be delivered to the city council for
adoption on or before October 1 of each year.
Subd. 5. Adjustments.
The city administrator will be authorized to make adjustments in water
charges where, in administrator’s opinion, the amount billed was erroneous due
to meter deficiency or other mistake.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VII: Public Utilities Page 12 of 32
Section 705 – Municipal sewage disposal system
705.01. Compliance with other laws.
All persons must comply with all sewage disposal rules of the applicable
waste control agency and all other governmental agencies.
705.03. Inspections.
The city engineer and other duly authorized employees of the city bearing
proper credentials and identification will be permitted to enter upon all properties
for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing,
in accordance with the provisions of this section.
705.05. Damaging sewage works.
No person will maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy,
uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or equipment which
is part of the municipal sewage works.
705.07. Unauthorized connections or tampering.
No connections will be made with any public sewer except by a plumber
licensed by the city. No unauthorized person will uncover, make any connection
with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or its appurtenance.
705.09. Sewer availability charge (SAC).
Subdivision 1. Sewer availability charge (SAC) established.
Pursuant to the policy and regulations adopted by the metropolitan sewer
board to allocate among local government units the debt service costs of unused
capacity in the metropolitan sewer disposal system for each year and for the
purpose of paying the costs of reserve capacity allocated to the city each year by
the metropolitan sewer board, there is established a sewer availability charge
(SAC) to pay for:
(a) The availability of treatment works and interceptors comprising the
metropolitan disposal system; and
(b) Connections, direct and indirect, to the metropolitan disposal system.
Subd. 2. Imposition of SAC charge.
The SAC charge is imposed where connection to a municipal sewer
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VII: Public Utilities Page 13 of 32
system is possible.
Subd. 3. Computation of SAC charge.
The SAC charge, which is determined by the Metropolitan Waste Control
Commission annually, must be equal to the number of units of sewage volume
which the building will discharge. A unit of sewage volume will be sewage
discharge up to 100,000 gallons per year and will be assigned as per the
schedule prepared by the Metropolitan Waste Control Commission. The number
of units assignable to each structure or connection will be computed and the SAC
charge collected by the city before issuance of a building or sewer connection
permit. If upon filing a report covering such permit with the metropolitan sewer
board, the board determines that a greater number of units is assignable to the
building or structure in question, any additional amount of cost allocated to the
city as a result must be paid by the person or company to whom the permit was
granted.
Subd. 4. Delinquent accounts.
The council will certify all unpaid costs described in subdivision 1 to the
county auditor who must enter them upon the auditor’s tax records as a lien upon
such land to be collected in the same manner as other real estate taxes are
collected.
705.11. Connection required.
(a) The owners of all houses, buildings or improved properties where
public sewer becomes available must connect to said public sewer within
24 months after the sewer has become available.
(b) If the owner of any such property does not connect to the public sewer
system on or before the due date, the city administrator, or administrator’s
designee, will serve a notice on the owner or agent of the owner of such
property to connect with the public sewer system within ten days after the
service of such notice. Such notice will also state that, in the event of
noncompliance, connection will be done by the city at the owner's
expense. When no owner or agent of the owner can be found, notice will
be sent by registered mail to the person who is listed on the records of the
county auditor or county treasurer as the owner. Service will be complete
upon mailing.
(c) If such person fails to comply with the notice within ten days after
service, the city administrator, or administrator’s designee, will have such
property connected to the public sewer system. A record showing the cost
of such work attributable to each separate lot or parcel will be delivered to
the city administrator. Any such cost and expenses will be charged and
billed to the owner of such property. If payment is not received within ten
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VII: Public Utilities Page 14 of 32
days after such billing to either the owner or agent of the owner, the
amount so charged against said lot or parcel of land, together with a
description of the premises and the name of the owner will be certified to
the county auditor and will be collected in the same manner as taxes and
special assessments against said premises. The charge will be a
perpetual lien on the premises until paid. No clerical error or informality in
such tax bill, or in the proceedings leading up to its issuance, will
invalidate or be a defense thereto.
705.13. Property not within city.
Property lying outside of the city may be connected to the municipal
sanitary sewer system if there is a proper contract between the city and the
municipality containing the building served.
705.15. Sewer connection permits.
Subdivision 1. Permit required.
No authorized person will uncover, make any connection with or opening
into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or its appurtenance without first
obtaining a written sewer connection permit from the city and otherwise
complying with the terms of this and other applicable ordinances. Such a permit
will be issued only to a plumber licensed by the city.
Subd. 2. Permit application.
Permit applications must state:
(a) The location and description of the property to be connected;
(b) The name of the owner;
(c) The number of buildings and how occupied.
The application must be accompanied by the permit fee and a sketch plan
showing the location of the proposed work, the manner in which it is to be done,
and such other information as may be required by the city.
Subd. 3. Inspection.
The building inspector must inspect the plan and if the building inspector
finds that the work provided for does not conform to the provisions of all city

sum required by resolution and any applicable ordinance, statute or regulation.
Subd. 2. Assessment charges.
No permit will be issued to tap or connect with any sewer of the city either
directly or indirectly from any lot or tract of land unless the city administrator will
have certified:
(a) That such lot or tract of land to be served by such connection or tap
has been assessed for the cost of construction of the sewer with which the
connection is made, and if payment of any assessment was deferred for
any reason, that the assessment has been either certified to the county
auditor for payment or that the assessment has been added as a part of
the regular connection charge established by this section; or
(b) If no assessment has been levied for such construction cost, that
proceedings for levying such assessment have been or will be
commenced in due course; or
(c) If no assessment has been levied, and no assessment proceedings will
be completed in due course, that a sum equal to the portion of cost of
constructing said sewer which would be assessable against said lot or
tract has been paid to the city.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VII: Public Utilities Page 16 of 32
Subd. 3. Additional connection fee.
If no such certification can be made by the city administrator because no
assessment has been levied, or is to be levied, or its equivalent has been paid to
the city, no such permit will be issued to tap or connect with any sewer of the city
unless the applicant will pay an additional connection fee which will be equal to
the portion of the cost of construction of the said main which would be
assessable against the lot or tract to be served by such tapping or connection.
The assessable cost is to be determined by the city engineer and city assessor
as being a benefit received by the property from the sewer, as related to either
the same basis as any assessment previously levied against other property for
said main, or, if no such assessment has been levied, upon the basis of the
assessments levied which may have been, or which will be, charged for similar
tapping or connections.
Subd. 4. Fee disbursement.
Any sum received by the city under this section will be credited to the fund
for the sewer to which the connection was made, or to any fund, including the
general fund, from which amounts have been paid for sewer projects, but if the
tract or lot served by the connection is to be subsequently assessed for another
lateral sewer, such sum will be transferred to the fund for said sewer and credited
against the amount assessable against said tract or lot.
705.19. Connections to public sewer.
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer must be made
at the "Y" branch designated for that property, if such branch is available at a
suitable location. Any connection not made at the designated "Y" branch in the

CHAPTER VIII - STREETS, ALLEYS AND PUBLIC WAYS
Section 800 - Driveways
800.01. Driveway construction requirements.
In addition to such rules, regulations and specifications as may be required by
the city for specific projects, the following requirements shall be met with respect to
driveways:
(a) Shared driveways shall not be permitted unless the city council grants a
waiver from this prohibition. The property owners sharing the driveway
will also be required to provide the city with copies of an executed
maintenance agreement and an executed reciprocal easement for the
driveway; and
(b) All driveways must connect directly to an open and improved public or
private right-of-way.
800.11. Waiver.
The city council may grant a waiver from any requirement of this ordinance
if there exists a practical difficulty in complying and if the council determines that
such requirement is not necessary for protection of the public health, safety or
welfare. If the applicant wishes to request a waiver, the applicant shall make that
request to city staff in writing. The applicant shall include information in the waiver
request that responds to the following factors. No waiver shall allow conditions in
violation of regulations applicable to fire apparatus access roads. The council shall
take the following factors into consideration in determining whether to grant a
waiver from the requirements of this ordinance:
(a) The nature and significance of the waiver;
(b) Whether the waiver is the minimum necessary to overcome the practical
difficulty;
(c) Whether the protection of environmental and other sensitive features
have been addressed;
(d) The effect on adjacent properties;
(e) Whether the waiver will enhance or impair good planning for the area;
and
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VIII - Streets, Alleys and Public Ways Page 3 of 33
(f) Such other factors as the council deems relevant under the
circumstances.
Financial considerations alone shall not be sufficient to justify a waiver. In
granting a waiver, the city council may impose such conditions or requirements as
it deems reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare.

encumbrances.

permits and administration. This Section imposes reasonable regulation on
the placement and maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within the
City’s rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to
complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this Section,

governing applicable rights of the City and users of the right-of-way. This Section
shall also be interpreted consistent with Minnesota Rules 7819.0050 – 7819.9950
where possible. To the extent that any provision of this Section cannot be
interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, the interpretation most
consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and case law is intended.
Unless otherwise provided, this Section shall be interpreted to complement
other sections of the City Code; provided, however, that if a provision of this
Section conflicts with another section of the City Code, this Section shall prevail.
810.02. Election to Manage the Public Rights-of-Way.

statutory, administrative and common law, the City elects pursuant to Minnesota
Statutes, section 237.163 subdivision 2(b), to manage rights-of-way within its

810.13. Right-of-Way Patching and Restoration.
Subd. 1. Timing.
The work to be done under the Utility Permit, and the Patching and
Restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the
dates specified in the Permit, increased by as many days as work could not be
done because of circumstances beyond the control of the Permittee or when
work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under Section 810.16,
subd. 2 or if the Permittee is granted a new Permit.
Subd. 2. Patch and Restoration.
Permittee must Patch its own work. The City may choose either to have the
Permittee Restore the surface and subgrading portions of right-of-way or to
Restore the surface portion of right-of-way itself.
(a.)Permittee Restoration. If the Permittee Restores the right-of-way itself, it
shall at the time of application for a Utility Permit post a Construction
Performance Bond in accordance with the provisions of Section 810.09,
subd. 1E. and Minnesota Rules 7819.3000.
(b.)City Restoration. If the City Restores the surface portion of right-of-way,
Permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If,
following such Restoration, the right-of-way settles or otherwise fails for
reasons not caused by City’s failure to properly Restore, the Permittee
shall pay to the City, within 30 days of billing, all costs associated with
correcting the defective work.
(c.) Degradation Fee in Lieu of Restoration. In lieu of right-of-way
Restoration, a Right-of-Way User may elect to pay a Degradation Fee.

and compacting the subgrade and aggregate based material in the
excavation and the Degradation Fee shall not include the cost to
accomplish these responsibilities.
Subd. 3. Standards.
The Permittee shall perform Patching and Restoration according to the
standards and with the materials specified by the City and shall comply with
Minnesota Rule 7819.1100. In exercising authority over Restoration, the
Director shall be guided by the following standards and considerations:
(a.)The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions or
damage to the right-of-way;
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VIII - Streets, Alleys and Public Ways Page 20 of 33
(b.)The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way; the character of the
neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way;
(c.) The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; the remaining life
expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation;
(d.)Whether the relative cost of the method of Restoration to the Permit
holder is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated
depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the
exaction, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way; and
(e.)The likelihood that the particular method of Restoration would be
effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would
otherwise take place.
Subd. 4. Duty to Correct Defects.
The Permittee shall correct defects in Patching, or Restoration performed
by Permittee or its agents. Upon notification from the City, Permittee shall
correct all Restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required
by the City. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Director, said work shall be
commenced within two days of receipt of the notice from the City and shall be
completed within 14 days of commencement of work, not including days during
which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force
majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal.
Subd. 5. Failure to Restore.
If the Permittee fails to Restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the
condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all
Restoration required by the City, the City shall notify the Permittee in writing of
the specific alleged failure or failures and shall allow the Permittee five days
from receipt of said written notice to cure said failure or failures, unless
otherwise extended by the Director. In the event the Permittee fails to cure, the
City may at its option perform the necessary work and Permittee shall pay to
the City, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If
Permittee fails to pay as required, the City, in addition to other remedies
provided by law, may exercise its rights under the Construction Performance
Bond.

of the previous Permit. This Supplementary Application must be submitted
before the permit end date.
810.16 Other Obligations.
Subd. 1.Compliance With Other Laws.
Obtaining a Right-of-Way Permit does not relieve Permittee of its duty to
obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees
required by the City or other applicable rule, law or regulation. A Permittee
shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws, including but
not limited to Minnesota Statutes, Section 216D.01-.09 (Gopher One Call

right-of-way.
810.18. Installation Requirements.
The excavation, backfilling, Patching and Restoration, and all other work
performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minnesota Rules

810.20 Work Done Without a Permit.
Subd. 1. Emergency Situations.
Each Registrant shall immediately notify the Director of any event regarding
its Facilities that it considers to be an Emergency. The Registrant may proceed
to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the Emergency.
Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an Emergency

of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition
of the Permit the City shall make a written demand upon the Permittee to
remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may
be cause for revocation of the Permit. A substantial breach, as stated above,
will allow the City to place additional or revised conditions on the Permit to
mitigate and remedy the breach.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VIII - Streets, Alleys and Public Ways Page 27 of 33
Subd. 3. Response to Notice of Breach.
Within a time established by the Director following Permittee’s receipt of
notification of the breach, Permittee shall provide the City with a plan to cure
the breach, acceptable to the City. Permittee's failure to submit a timely and
acceptable plan, or Permittee’s failure to timely implement the approved plan,
shall be cause for immediate revocation of the Permit.

the Permittee’s use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal
locations of installed Service Laterals, and the Service Lateral vertical locations
in those cases where the Director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their
subcontractors shall submit to the Director evidence satisfactory to the Director
of the installed Service Lateral locations. Compliance with this subdivision 2
and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing
Service Laterals installed after December 31, 2007, shall be a condition of any
City approval necessary for (a) payments to contractors working on a public
improvement project including those under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 429
and (b) City approval of performance under development agreements or other

subdivision or site plan approval under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 462. The
Director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such
information to the City. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on
the Service Laterals installed may result in the revocation of the Permit issued
for the work or for future permits to the offending Permittee or its
subcontractors.
810.24 Undergrounding.
Subd. 1. Purpose.
The purpose of this section 810.24 is to promote the health, safety and
general welfare of the public and is intended to foster (a) safe travel over the
right-of-way, (b) non-travel related safety around homes and buildings where
overhead feeds are connected and (c) orderly development in the City.
Location and relocation, installation and reinstallation of Facilities in the right-ofway
or in or on other public ground must be made in accordance with this
section 810.24 and is intended to be enforced consistently with state and
federal law regulating right-of-way users, specifically including but not limited to
Minnesota Statutes, Sections 161.45, 237.162, 237.163, 301B.01, 222.37,
238.084 and 216B.36 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Title 47,
U.S.C. section 253.
Subd. 2. Undergrounding of Facilities.
Facilities newly installed, constructed or otherwise placed in the Public
Right-of-Way or in other public property held in common for public use must be
located and maintained underground pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this section and in accordance with applicable construction standards, subject
to the exceptions below. Above-ground installation, construction, modification,
or replacement of meters, gauges, transformers, street lighting, pad mount
switches, capacitor banks, re-closers and service connection pedestals shall be
allowed. These requirements shall apply equally outside of the corporate limits
of the City coincident with City jurisdiction of platting, subdivision regulation or
comprehensive planning as may now or in the future be allowed by law.
Subd. 3. Undergrounding of Permanent Replacement, Relocated or
Reconstructed Facilities.
If the City finds that one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 810.24
subd. 1 would be promoted, the City may require a permanent replacement,
relocation or reconstruction of a Facility to be located, and maintained
underground, with due regard for seasonal working conditions. For purposes of
this subdivision, reconstruction means any substantial repair of or any
improvement to existing Facilities. Undergrounding may be required whether a
replacement, relocation or reconstruction is initiated by the Right-of-Way User
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VIII - Streets, Alleys and Public Ways Page 29 of 33
owning or operating the Facilities, or by the City in connection with (a) the
present or future use by the City or other local government unit of the right-ofway
or other public ground for a public project, (b) the public health or safety, or
(c) the safety and convenience of travel over the right-of-way. Subject to
Subdivision 4 below, all relocations from previously placed underground
Facilities shall be to another underground location.
Subd. 4. Exceptions to Undergrounding.
The following exceptions to the strict application of this Subdivision shall be
allowed upon the conditions stated:
a) Technical/Economic Feasibility; Promotion of Policy. Above-ground
installation, construction, or placement of Facilities shall be allowed in
residential, commercial and industrial areas where the council, following
consideration and recommendation by the planning commission, finds
that:
1) Underground placement would place an undue financial burden upon
the landowner, ratepayers, or Right-of-Way User or would deprive
the landowner of the preservation and enjoyment of substantial
property rights;
2) Underground placement is impractical or not technically feasible due
to topographical, subsoil or other existing conditions which adversely
affect underground Facilities placement; or
3) Failure to promote the purposes of undergrounding. The Right-of-
Way User clearly and convincingly demonstrates that none of the
purposes under Section 810.24, Subd. 1 would be advanced by
underground placement of Facilities on the project in question, or the
City determines on its own review that undergrounding is not
warranted based on the circumstances of the proposed
undergrounding.
b) Temporary Service. Above-ground installation, construction, or
placement of temporary service lines shall only be allowed:
1) During new construction of any project for a period not to exceed
three months;
2) During an Emergency in order to safeguard lives or property within
the City; or
3) For a period of not more than seven months when soil conditions
make excavation impractical.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VIII - Streets, Alleys and Public Ways Page 30 of 33
Subd. 5. Developer Responsibility.
All owners, platters, or developers are responsible for complying with the
requirements of this Subdivision, and prior to final approval of any plat or
development plan, shall submit to the Director written instruments from the
appropriate Right-of-Way Users showing that all necessary arrangements with
said users for installation of such Facilities have been made.
810.25 Location and Relocation of Facilities.
Subd. 1. Rule.
Placement, location, and relocation of Facilities must comply with the Act,
with other applicable rights of the City under its police power, and with
Minnesota Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules
do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
(a.) Relocation Notification Procedure: The Director shall notify the utility
owner at least three months in advance of the need to relocate existing
Facilities so the owner can determine if relocation or replacement is
required and plan any required work. The City should provide one
notification, provide the date work will start on the City’s project, and if
different, provide the date by which the relocation must be completed.
To the extent technically feasible and limited by seasonal constraints, all
utilities shall be relocated within one month or in a time frame
determined by the Director. The Director may allow a different schedule
if it does not interfere with the City’s project. The utility owner shall
diligently work to relocate the Facilities within the above schedule.
(b.) Delay to City Project: If the owner fails to meet the relocation schedule
due to circumstances within the utility’s control, the City may charge the
utility owner for all costs incurred by the City because the relocation is
not completed in the scheduled timeframe.
(c.) Joint Trenching: All Facilities shall be placed in appropriate portions of
right-of-way so as to cause minimum conflict with other underground
Facilities. When technically appropriate and no safety hazards are
created, all utilities shall be installed, constructed or placed within the
same Trench. Notwithstanding the foregoing, gas and electric lines
shall be placed in conformance with Minnesota Rules pt. 7819.5100,
subd. 2, governing safety standards.
Subd. 2. Corridors.
The City may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any particular
segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities that is or,
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VIII - Streets, Alleys and Public Ways Page 31 of 33
pursuant to current technology, the City expects will be located within the rightof-
way. All utility, obstruction, or other permits issued by the City involving the
installation or replacement of Facilities shall designate the proper corridor for
the Facilities at issue. A typical crossing section of the location for utilities may
be on file at the Director’s office. This section is not intended to establish “High
Density Corridors”.
Any Registrant who has Facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance
with the corridors established by the City may remain at that location until the
City requires Facilities relocation to the corridor pursuant to relocation authority
granted under Minnesota Rules part 7819.3100 or other applicable law.
Subd. 3. Limitation of Space.
To protect the public health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to
protect the right-of-way and its current use, the City shall have the power to
prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right-ofway.
In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for
the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year
with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the rightof-
way, and future City plans for public improvements and development
projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.
810.26 Pre-excavation Facilities Location.
In addition to complying with the requirements of Minn. Stat. 216D.01-.09
(“One Call Excavation Notice System”) before the start date of any right-of-way
excavation, each Registrant who has Facilities or Equipment in the area to be
excavated shall be responsible to mark the horizontal placement of all said
Facilities, to the extent technically feasible. To the extent its records contain such
information, each Registrant shall provide information regarding the approximate
vertical location of their Facilities, at the time of installation, to excavators upon
request. Nothing in this subsection is meant to limit the rights, duties and
obligations of the Facility owners or excavators as set forth in Minnesota Statutes,
Section 216D.01-.09.
810.27 Interference by Other Facilities.
When the City does work in the right-of-way in its governmental right-of-way
management function and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a
Registrant's Facilities to carry out the work without damaging Registrant’s
Facilities, the City shall notify the Local Representative as early as is reasonably
possible. The City’s costs associated therewith will be billed to that Registrant and
must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each Registrant shall be
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VIII - Streets, Alleys and Public Ways Page 32 of 33
responsible for the cost of repairing any Facilities in the right-of-way which it or its
Facilities damages.
810.28 Right-of-Way Vacation – Reservation of Right.
Subd. 1 Reservation of Right.
If the City vacates a right-of-way which contains the Equipment of a
Registrant, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of Registrant
Facilities and Equipment, the City shall reserve, to and for itself and all
Registrants having Facilities and Equipment in the vacated right-of-way, the
right to install, maintain and operate any Facilities and Equipment in the
vacated right-of-way and to enter upon such right-of-way at any time for the
purpose of reconstruction, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.
Subd. 2. Relocation of Equipment.
If the vacation requires the relocation of Registrant Facilities and
Equipment; and (a) if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the Registrant,
the Registrant must pay the relocation costs; or (b) if the vacation proceedings
are initiated by the City, the Registrant must pay the relocation costs unless
otherwise agreed to by the City and the Registrant; or (c) if the vacation
proceedings are initiated by a Person or Persons other than the Registrant or
Permit holder, such other Person or Persons must pay the relocation costs.
810.29 Indemnification and Liability.
By registering with the City, or by accepting a Permit under this Section, a
Registrant or Permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the City in accordance
with the provisions of Minnesota Rule 7819.1250.
810.30 Abandoned Facilities.
Subd. 1. Discontinued Operations.
A Registrant who has decided to discontinue all or a portion of its operations
in the City must provide information satisfactory to the City that the Registrant's
obligations for its Facilities in the right-of-way under this Section have been
lawfully assumed by another Registrant.
Subd. 2. Removal.
Any Registrant who has Abandoned Facilities in any right-of-way shall
remove them from that right-of-way pursuant to Minnesota Rule Part
7819.3300, unless the requirement is waived by the Director. A Facility is not
abandoned unless declared so by the operator. Any Registrant that has
Minnetrista City Code Chapter VIII - Streets, Alleys and Public Ways Page 33 of 33
Abandoned Facilities that have not been removed shall provide the City with
maps detailing the type, size, and depth of the Abandoned Facility.
810.31 Appeal.
A Right-of-Way User that: (a) has been denied registration; (b) has been
denied a Permit; (c) has had a Permit revoked; (d) believes that the fees imposed
are not in conformity with Minnesota Statutes Section 237.163, Subd. 6, or (e)
disputes a determination of the Director regarding Section 1.23 subd. 2 of this
ordinance may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision reviewed,
upon written request, by the City council. The City council shall act on a timely
written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A decision by the City
council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and
supported by written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
810.32 Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers.
A Permittee’s or Registrant’s rights are subject to the regulatory and police
powers of the City to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect
the health, safety and welfare of the public.
810.33 Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
Section is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory body or a court of
competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order that any
permit, right or registration issued under this Section or any portions of this Section
is illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit, right or registration granted or
deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a
mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving 60 days’ written
notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit
shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in the permit, right or
registration, respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of the permit
and the right of termination. Nothing in this Section precludes the City from
requiring a franchise agreement with the Applicant, as allowed by law, in addition
to requirements set forth herein.

than 48 hours on public property illegally or lacking vital component parts, or has
remained for a period of more than 48 hours on private property without the
consent of the person in control of such property or has been in an inoperable
condition for more than 48 hours, such that it has no substantial potentially
further use consistent with its usual functions, whether located on private or
public property. It will also mean a motor vehicle voluntarily surrendered by its
owner to and accepted by a unit of government or its agent. A classic car, as
defined in this section, will not be considered an abandoned vehicle for purposes
of this section.

owner, tenant, occupant, lessee or otherwise will allow any partially
dismantled inoperable wrecked, junked, dismantled or discarded vehicle to
remain on such property longer than 96 hours.
925.07. Declaration of public nuisance.
The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, junked, partially
dismantled or inoperative motor vehicles on private or public property is found to
create an unsightly condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to
invite plundering, to create fire hazards and to constitute an unattractive nuisance
creating hazard to the health and safety of the community. The accumulation and
outside storage of such vehicles is further found to promote blight and
deterioration in the community and to violate zoning regulations of the city in
many instances. It is further found that such wrecked, junked, abandoned or
partially dismantled or inoperative vehicles are in the nature of rubbish, litter and
unsightly debris which adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of
the community. Therefore, the accumulation and storage of such vehicles on
private or public property, except as hereinafter expressly permitted, is hereby
declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated in the manner
provided by this section or other ordinances of the city or other lawful actions as
may be provided by state law.

abandoned vehicle or junked car and contents at a public auction pursuant
to section 925.17.
The notice must be sent by mail to the registered owner, if any, of the

and not reclaimed under section 925.15, is sold at public auction or sale, it must
be sold the highest bidder following reasonable published notice of such auction
or sale. The purchaser must be given a receipt in a form prescribed by the
registrar or motor vehicles, which will be sufficient title to dispose of the vehicle.

certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and claims of ownership. Before such
a vehicle is issued a new certificate of title it must receive a motor vehicle safety
check.

or other methods of disposal.
(b) Where the city enters into a contract with a person duly licensed by the
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the agency must review the contract
to determine whether it conforms to the agency's plan for solid waste
disposal. A contract that does so conform may be approved by the
agency. Where a contract has been approved, the agency may reimburse
the city for the costs incurred under the contract which have not been
reimbursed.
(c) If the city utilizes its own equipment and personnel for disposal of the
abandoned motor vehicle, it must be entitled to reimbursement for the cost
Minnetrista City Code Chapter IX Motor Vehicles and Traffic Page 19 of 19
thereof along with its other costs as herein provided.

CHAPTER X - PUBLIC HEALTH
Section 1000 – Mobile homes and mobile home parks
1000.01. Purpose.
The city enacts this section recognizing the need for properly developed low-cost
housing, but it does so mindful of the extraordinary problems associated with mobile
homes if not properly regulated. This section attempts to mitigate the effects on the
public health, safety and welfare from mobile homes and to encourage high quality and
orderly development, placement and use of mobile homes for residential purposes,
while recognizing that the public health, safety and welfare may require the restriction of
both the type and number of mobile home parks within the city.

Minnetrista City Code Chapter X - Public Health Page 3 of 19
occupied dwelling or any lot which is not a part of the premises of any occupied
dwelling, either of which is situated outside of an approved mobile home park.
Subd. 2. Exception.
One and only one unoccupied mobile home may be parked in an accessory
private garage building or in a rear yard in any district for a period not exceeding 30
days, providing no living quarters will be maintained or any business practiced in the
mobile home while such mobile home is so parked or stored.
Subd. 3. Temporary permit.
A temporary special permit may be issued for the temporary use of a mobile
home as an office for a period not to exceed 90 days in connection with legal
construction of a continuing nature in accordance with a valid building permit on that
site. Not more than two such permits will be issued for the same location or site,
except upon a showing of good cause and upon special permission of the city
council.
Subd. 4. Occupancy.
A mobile home must not be occupied for dwelling purposes unless it is properly
placed on a mobile home stand and connected to water, sewerage and electrical
utilities.
Subd. 5. Transient mobile homes and travel trailers.
It is unlawful for any person to operate or allow to exist any area for the use of
transient mobile homes, travel trailers or campers.

recommendations to the city council approving or disapproving the application in
whole or in part, including detailed comments.
Subd. 5. Standards of review.
The following standards will be considered in reviewing the application:
(a) Site planning should adapt to individual site conditions, reflect advances
Minnetrista City Code Chapter X - Public Health Page 5 of 19
in site planning techniques, and be adapted to the trends in design of the
mobile home itself. An informal park type of site planning which conforms
to existing terrain, existing trees, shrubs and rock formations is preferred
and other natural site features will be preserved to the extent practical.
Favorable views or outlooks should be emphasized by the plan;
(b) Adoption of a stylized pattern should be avoided and this objective is
achieved by variations in the street pattern, block shapes and location of
mobile home stands. Excessive repetition of the principal elements of the
plan is undesirable;
(c) The site, including mobile home stands, patios, structures and all site
improvements will be Harmoniously and efficiently organized in relation to
topography, the shape of the plot and the shape, size and position of
structures and common facilities and with full regard to use, appearance
and livability. Special attention should be given to new mobile home
designs and the common appurtenances that are available;
(d) The city council must review the recommendation of the planning
commission and must grant or deny the permit and may attach whatever
conditions it deems necessary to the granting of such permit;
(e) Any person whose application for a permit has been denied may request
and must be granted a hearing on the matter under the procedure
provided by subsection 1000.23.
1000.09. Design and environmental requirements for mobile parks.
Subdivision 1. General requirements.
Condition of soil, ground water level, drainage and topography must not create
hazards to the property or the health or safety of the occupants. The site must not be
exposed to objectionable smoke, noise, odors or other adverse influences, and no
portion subject to unpredictable or sudden flooding, subsidence or erosion will be
used for any purpose which would expose persons or property to hazards.
Subd. 2. Site standards.
(a) Density. There will be a maximum of five mobile homes per gross acre of
mobile home park, or 5,500 square feet of land per acre covered by
mobile homes including additions and accessory structures and accessory
service buildings, whichever is less.
(b) Area. There will be a minimum area requirement of 30 acres, with a minimum
width of 600 feet for any mobile home park, and a maximum of 60 acres
for any mobile home park. No mobile home park will be contiguous to or
abutting another mobile home park.
Minnetrista City Code Chapter X - Public Health Page 6 of 19
Subd. 3. Setbacks, buffer strips and screening.
(a) All mobile homes will be located at least 30 feet from any boundary line,
including one abutting upon a public street or highway.
(b) There will be a minimum distance of 30 feet between an individual mobile
home and adjoining pavement of a park street, or common parking area or
other common areas.
(c) All mobile home parks must be provided with landscape screening such as
fences or natural growth along any property boundary line sufficient to
permit complete privacy for the residents of the park and to protect

persons and the use of property during emergencies, the repair, maintenance, and

The city council may rescind any such regulation by resolution at any time. If not
sooner rescinded, every such regulation will expire at the end of 30 days after its
effective date or at the end of the emergency to which it relates, whichever comes
first. Any resolution, rule or regulation inconsistent with an emergency regulation
promulgated by the council must be suspended during the period of time and to the
extent such conflict exists.
Subd 4. Powers of the director during a declared emergency.
During a declared emergency, the director is, notwithstanding any statutory
provision on the contrary, empowered through its governing body acting within or
without the corporate limits of the city, to enter into contracts and incur obligations
necessary to combat such disaster by protecting the health and safety of persons
and property and providing emergency assistance to the victims of such disaster.
The director may exercise such powers in the light of the exigencies of the disaster
without compliance with the time-consuming procedures and formalities prescribed
by law pertaining to the performance of public work, entering rental equipment
agreements, purchase of supplies and materials, limitations upon tax levies, and the
appropriation and expenditure of public funds including, but not limited to, publication

of any such person to receive any benefits or compensation under any act of congress.
1100.17. Participation in labor dispute or politics.
The emergency management organization must not participate in any form of
political activity, nor will it be employed directly or indirectly for political purposes, nor
will it be employed in a labor dispute. The director may express professional opinions on
legislative or other legal regulations consistent with the provisions found in Minnesota
Statutes Chapter 12.
1100.19. Authorizing dispatch and use of city equipment and services by
the director in emergency situations (mutual aid).

equipment and personnel to local communities who request aid to combat their
emergency, disaster, or major incident consistent with this section.

The director must evaluate the internal needs of the city, and dispatch
appropriate available aid. The director must immediately recall, order and terminate
the use of any dispatched equipment and personnel when the need for their use no
longer exists, or earlier, when it appears in the best interest of the city. Aid
requested from outside the Lake Minnetonka Regional area, or extended local aid
within the Lake Minnetonka Regional area, will require mutual agreement between
the director and the city administrator or their designee.

compensation of personnel, rental of equipment, liability insurance coverage,

1115.11. Permit issuance.
Subdivision 1. Permitted areas.
Because of the predominantly residential character of the city and the relatively
small size of the commercially zoned areas resulting in the potential for conflicting
uses, Special Events will be permitted within the city only after a finding by the city
that the character of the proposed Special Event is compatible with the character of
the surrounding neighborhood considering the possible creation of problems
including noise, lighting, traffic, sanitation, congestion and other factors affecting the
public health, safety and welfare of such areas in addition to compliance with all
ordinances of this city and applicable statutes and regulations.

The city may condition the issuance of a Special Event permit by imposing
reasonable conditions concerning the time, place and manner of the Special Event,
and such conditions as are necessary to protect the safety of persons and property,
and the control of traffic; provided that such conditions shall not unreasonably
restrict the right of free speech. The city may inspect the property upon which the
Special Event is to be held prior to the event in order to make certain there is
compliance with all permit conditions. Such conditions may include, but are not
limited to:
(a) Alteration of the date(s), time(s), route(s) or location of the Special Event
proposed;

necessary as determined by the city’s department heads.
Subd. 2. User Fee.
Upon completion of the Special Event, the city may prepare a detailed account of
all Special Services provided for the Special Event and in such cases, will set the
final user fee using the rates, fees and charges established as provided in this
section. The city will then provide the authorized and responsible person identified

Special Services and an invoice for the user fee, less the fee deposit. The balance
of the user fee will then become due and payable immediately upon its receipt.

following circumstances:
(a) The applicant or officer of the sponsoring organization signs a verified

CHAPTER XII - LIQUOR
Section 1200 – General provisions
1200.01. State law adopted.
The provisions of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 340A, as they may be amended
from time to time, with reference to the definition of terms, conditions of operation,
restrictions on consumption, provisions relating to sales, hours of sale, and all other
matters pertaining to the retail sale, distribution, and consumption of intoxicating liquor
and 3.2 percent malt liquor are hereby adopted by reference and are made a part of this
Ordinance as if set out in full. It is the intention of the city council that all future
amendments to Minnesota Statutes, chapter 340A are hereby adopted by reference or
referenced as if they had been in existence at the time this Ordinance is adopted. In the
event that provisions in this chapter are more stringent than similar provisions in
Minnesota Statutes, chapter 340A the provisions in this chapter will be controlling.
1200.03 Definitions.
The definitions contained in Minnesota Statutes, section 340A.101, as it may be
amended from time to time, are hereby adopted except the following words, terms, and
phrases, when used in this chapter, will have the meanings ascribed to them in this
section:
Liquor. As used in this ordinance, without modification by the words an
“intoxicating” or a “3.2 percent malt” includes both intoxicating liquor and 3.2 percent
malt liquor.
Restaurant. An eating facility, other than a hotel, under the control of a single
proprietor or manager, which is open on at least four days per week, where meals are
regularly prepared on the premises, where full waitress/waiter table service is provided,
where a customer orders food from printed menus and where the main food course is
served and consumed while seated at a single location. Notwithstanding the
requirement that a restaurant allow guests to order from a printed menu, an
establishment which serves a pre-determined multi-course meal to guests, such as a
tasting menu, shall also be considered a restaurant. To be a restaurant as defined by
this section, an establishment shall have a license from the state as required by
Minnesota Statutes, section 157.16, as it may be amended from time to time, and meet
the definition of either a “small establishment,” “medium establishment” or “large
establishment” as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 157.16, subd. 3(d), as it may
be amended from time to time. An establishment which serves prepackaged food that
receives heat treatment and is served in the package or frozen pizza that is heated and
served shall not be considered to be a restaurant for purposes of this ordinance unless
City of Minnetrista City Code Chapter XII - Liquor Page 3 of 19
it meets the definitions of a “small establishment”, “medium establishment” or “large
establishment”.
[Revised 5-18-15, Ordinance 427]
1200.05. Nudity on the premises of licensed establishments prohibited.
Subdivision 1. The city council finds that it is in the best interests of the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that nudity is prohibited
as provided in this section on the premises of any establishment licensed under this
ordinance. This is to protect and assist the owners, operators, and employees of the
establishment, as well as patrons and the public in general, from harm stemming
from the physical immediacy and combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The
Council especially intends to prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual
harassment or activities likely to lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct,
including prostitution, sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds
that the prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed under
this ordinance, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing community
standards of the city.
Subd. 2. It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person or persons
on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her buttocks, anus,
breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent material. It is unlawful for any
person to be on the licensed premises when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent material.
Subd. 3. A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by
law, and is justification for revocation or suspension of any liquor, wine, or 3.2
percent malt liquor license or any other license issued under this ordinance or the
imposition of a civil penalty under the provisions of sections 1215.07 and 1215.09.
1200.07. Consumption in public places.
No person shall consume intoxicating liquor or 3.2 percent malt liquor in a city
park, on any city street, sidewalk, trail, or parking lot, or in any public place other than
on the premises of an establishment licensed under this ordinance or where the
consumption and display of liquor is lawfully permitted.
1200.09. Gambling prohibited.
No retail establishment licensed to sell liquor may keep, possess, operate or
permit the keeping, possession, or operation on the licensed premises of dice or any
other gambling device as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 349.30 without the
approval of the city council and unless authorized to do so under Minnesota Statutes,
section 349.166.
City of Minnetrista City Code Chapter XII - Liquor Page 4 of 19
1200.11. Raffles and silent auctions of wine, beer, or intoxicating liquors.
No person shall conduct a silent auction, raffle or other fund raising event
pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 340A.707, Minnesota Statutes, section 349.165
and Minnesota Statutes, section 349.166 with prizes or awards of wine, beer or
intoxicating liquors without notifying the city clerk of the event at least thirty days prior to
the occurrence of the event and obtaining all required licenses and permits including but
not limited to a special event permit if required. The event holder shall provide the city
with the following information: the person or organization holding the event, the day,
time and location of the event, type of fund raising event (silent auction, raffle or
otherwise), type and amount of wine, beer, intoxicating liquor to be awarded as prizes,
and the charitable purposes to which the event proceeds will be donated.
1200.13. Tampering or refilling bottles.
Subdivision 1. No person shall sell, offer for sale or keep for sale, liquor in any
original package, which has been refilled or partially refilled.
Subd. 2. No person may directly or through another person dilute or in any
manner, tamper with the contents of any original package so as to change the
composition or alcohol content while in the original package. Possession on the
licensed premises by a licensee of alcoholic beverages in the original package or bottle,
differing in composition or alcoholic content from when it was received from the
manufacturer or wholesaler from whom it was purchased, is prima facie evidence that
the contents of the original package or bottle has been diluted, changed or tampered
with in violation of this section.
City of Minnetrista City Code Chapter XII - Liquor Page 5 of 19
Section 1205 – Licenses
1205.01. License Required.
No person may directly or indirectly, on any pretense or by any device, sell,
barter, keep for sale, or otherwise dispose of alcoholic beverages as part of a
commercial transaction without having obtained the required license or permit.

responsibility is a cause for revocation of the license. A liability insurance policy
required by this section must provide that it may not be cancelled for any cause by
either the insured or the insurer unless the canceling party has first given ten days’
notice in writing to the issuing authority of intent to cancel the policy.
1210.03. Applicant Eligibility.
No liquor license may be issued to:
(a.) A person not a citizen of the United States or a resident alien;
City of Minnetrista City Code Chapter XII - Liquor Page 11 of 19
(b.) A person under 21 years of age;
(c.) A person who, within five years of the license application, has been
convicted of a willful violation of a federal or state law or local
ordinance governing the manufacture, sale, distribution, or
possession for sale or distribution, of an alcoholic beverage;
(d.) A person who has had a liquor license revoked within five years of
the license application, or to any person who at the time of the
violation owns any interest, whether as a holder of more than five
percent of the capital stock of a corporation licensee, as a partner or
otherwise, in the premises or in the business conducted thereon, or to
a corporation, partnership, association, enterprise, business, or firm
in which any such person is in any manner interested;
(e.) A person not of good moral character and repute; or
(f.) A person who is not the proprietor of the establishment for which the
license is sought.
1210.05. Description of premises.
The application shall specifically describe the compact and contiguous premises
within which liquor may be dispensed and consumed. The description may not include
any parking lot or sidewalk.
(a.) The license shall be effective only for the licensed premises specified
in the approved application.
(b.) No license will be granted for operation on any premises on which
state, city or county taxes, assessments, or other financial claims of
the state, city, or county are delinquent and unpaid.
(c.) No liquor license may be granted within the same block of any school
or within 1000 feet of any school or church. The distance will be
measured as provided in section 1210.13, subdivision 6.
(d.) The erection of a school or church within the prohibited area after the
original license application has been granted will not, in and of itself,
render such premises ineligible for renewal of the license.
(e.) No intoxicating liquor license of any kind will be issued unless the
applicant provides adequate off-street parking and exterior lighting
and complies with Minnetrista city code Chapter V: Planning and
Land Use Regulation.
City of Minnetrista City Code Chapter XII - Liquor Page 12 of 19
1210.07. Applications for renewal.
At least 90 days, but not more than 120 days, before a license issued under this
ordinance is to be renewed, an application for renewal shall be filed with the city. The
decision whether or not to renew a license rests within the sound discretion of the
council. No licensee has a right to have the license renewed.
1210.09. Transfer of license.
Subdivision 1. No license issued under this ordinance may be transferred
without the approval of the council. Any transfer of stock of a corporate licensee is
deemed to be a transfer of the license, and a transfer of stock without prior council
approval is a ground for revocation of the license. Any change of ownership or
beneficial interest in shares of stock entitled to be voted at a meeting of the
stockholders of a corporate licensee which results in a change of voting control of
the corporation by the persons owning shares of stock will be deemed to be
equivalent to a transfer of the license issued to the corporation and any such change
in ownership or beneficial interest of shares without prior council approval is a
ground for revocation of the license.
Subd. 2. The council may at any reasonable time examine the stock transfer
records and minute books of any corporation licensee in order to verify the names of
stockholders and persons holding beneficial interests and persons holding meetings
of the corporation. The council may examine business records of any other licensee
to the extent necessary to disclose the interest that others than the licensee have in
the licensed business.
Subd. 3. An application to transfer a license shall be treated the same as an
application for a new license, and all of the provisions of this code applying to
applications for a license shall apply.
1210.11. Investigation.
Subdivision 1. Preliminary background and financial investigation.
On an initial application for a license, on an application for transfer of a license
and, in the sound discretion of the council that it is in the public interest to do so, on
an application for renewal of a license, the city shall conduct a preliminary
background and financial investigation of the applicant or it may contract with the
Commissioner of Public Safety for the investigation. The applicant shall pay with the
application an investigation fee as found in the Ordinance Establishing the City’s Fee
Schedule which shall be in addition to any license fee. If the cost of the preliminary
investigation is less than the fee listed in the Ordinance Establishing the City’s Fee
Schedule, the unused balance shall be returned to the applicant. The results of the
City of Minnetrista City Code Chapter XII - Liquor Page 13 of 19
preliminary investigation shall be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if the
application is for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine license.
Subd. 2. Comprehensive background and financial investigation.
If the results of a preliminary investigation warrant, in the sound discretion of the
council, a comprehensive background and financial investigation, the city may either
conduct the investigation itself or contract with the Commissioner of Public Safety for
the investigation. The investigation fee for this comprehensive background and
financial investigation to be paid by the applicant shall be $500, less any amount
paid for the initial investigation if the investigation is to be conducted within the state,
and $10,000, less any amount paid for the initial investigation, if the investigation is
required outside the state. The unused balance of the fee shall be returned to the
applicant whether or not the application is denied. The fee shall be paid in advance
of any investigation and the amount actually expended on the investigation shall not
be refundable in the event the application is denied. The results of the
comprehensive investigation shall be sent to the Commissioner of Public Safety if
the application is for an on-sale intoxicating liquor license or an on-sale wine license.
1210.13. Hearing and Issuance.
The city shall investigate all facts set out in the application and all facts
investigated in the preliminary or comprehensive background and financial
investigations. Opportunity shall be given to any person to be heard for or against the
granting of the license. After the investigation and hearing, the council shall in its sound
discretion grant or deny the application. No license shall become effective until the proof
of financial security has been approved by the Commissioner of Public Safety.
1210.15. Restrictions on Issuance.
Subdivision 1. Each license shall be issued only to the applicant for the premises
described in the application.
Subd. 2. Not more than one license shall be directly or indirectly issued within the
city to any one person.
Subd. 3. No license shall be granted or renewed for operation on any premises
on which taxes, assessments, utility charges, service charges, or other financial
claims of the city are delinquent and unpaid.
Subd. 4. No license shall be issued for any place or any business ineligible for a
license under state law.
Subd. 5. No license shall be issued to any person who is not a resident of the
City of Minnetrista City Code Chapter XII - Liquor Page 14 of 19
state. If the applicant is a corporation, all of the shareholders shall be residents of
the state. The provisions of this subdivision (5) shall not apply to any license existing
on the effective date of this ordinance or to the renewal of an existing license.
Subd. 6. No license shall be granted within the same block of any school or
within 1000 feet of any school or church. The distance is to be measured from the
closest side of the school or church to the closest side of the structure on the
premises within which liquor is to be sold.
Subd. 7. An intoxicating liquor license may not be issued to a person in
connection with the premises of another to whom a license could not be issued
under the provisions of this chapter. This subdivision does not prevent the granting
of a license to a proper lessee because the person has leased the premises of a
minor, a noncitizen who is not resident alien, or a person who has been convicted of
a crime other than a violation of this chapter.
1210.17. Conditions of License.
The failure of a licensee to meet any one of the conditions of the license
specified below shall result in a suspension of the license until the condition is met.
(a.) Within 90 days after employment, every person selling or serving
liquor in an establishment which has an on-sale license shall receive
training regarding the selling or serving of liquor to customers. The
training shall be provided by an organization approved by the council.
Proof of training shall be provided by the licensee.
(b.) Every licensee is responsible for the conduct of the place of business
and the conditions of sobriety and order in it. The act of any
employee on the licensed premises is deemed the act of the licensee
as well, and the licensee shall be liable to all penalties provided by
this ordinance and the law equally with the employee.
(c.) Every licensee shall allow any peace officer, health officer, city
employee, or any other person designated by the council to conduct
compliance checks and to otherwise enter, inspect, and search the
premises of the licensee during business hours and after business
hours during the time when customers remain on the premises
without a search warrant.
(d.) Every intoxicating liquor licensee must keep on file with the city clerk
a current list of all persons having an interest in the licensed business
and the extent of such interest. If the licensee is a corporation, the
list must show all stockholders and the number of shares held by
each stockholder either individually or beneficially for others. It will be
City of Minnetrista City Code Chapter XII - Liquor Page 15 of 19
the duty of each licensee to notify the city clerk of any change in legal
or beneficial ownership or interest in such business or in such shares.
(e.) No on-sale establishment shall display liquor to the public during
hours when the sale of liquor is prohibited.
(f.) Compliance with financial responsibility requirements of state law and
of this ordinance is a continuing condition of any license.
(g.) Failure by on off-sale intoxicating liquor licensee who has received a
fee reduction pursuant to section 1205.09, subd. 6 of this ordinance
to abide with the provisions of section 1205.09, subd.6.

consumption of intoxicating liquor or 3.2 percent malt liquor in on-sale licensed

time when a sale can legally occur.
Subd. 4. No person, other than the licensee and any employee, shall remain on
the on-sale licensed premises more than 30 minutes after the time when a sale can
legally occur.

revocation or suspension of the license.

rooms constituting the place in which intoxicating liquors or 3.2 percent malt liquor are

1215.05. Restrictions on Purchase and Consumption.
No person shall mix or prepare liquor for consumption in any public place of
business unless it has a license to sell on-sale, or a permit from the Commissioner of
Public Safety under the provisions of Minnesota Statutes section 340A.414, as it may
be amended from time to time, which has been approved by the council, and no person
shall consume liquor in any such place.
1215.07. Suspension and Revocation.
Subdivision 1. The council shall either suspend for a period not to exceed 60
days or revoke any liquor license upon finding that the licensee has failed to comply
with any applicable statute, regulation, or provision of this ordinance relating to

revocation shall take effect until the licensee has been afforded an opportunity for a
hearing pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, Minnesota Statutes sections
14.57 to 14.70, as it may be amended from time to time. The council may act as the
hearing body under that act, or it may contract with the Office of Hearing Examiners
for a hearing officer.
Subd. 2. The following are the minimum periods of suspension or revocation
which shall be imposed by the council for violations of the provisions of this
ordinance or Minnesota Statutes, chapter 340A, as it may be amended from time to

time to time:
(a) For commission of a felony related to the licensed activity, sale of

Subd. 3. Lapse of required proof of financial responsibility shall affect an
immediate suspension of any license issued pursuant to this ordinance or state law
without further action of the council. Notice of cancellation or lapse of a current liquor
liability policy shall also constitute notice to the licensee of the impending
suspension of the license. The holder of a license who has received notice of lapse
of required insurance or of suspension or revocation of a license may request a
hearing thereon and, if a request is made in writing to the Clerk, a hearing before the

Statutes, chapter 340A as it may be amended from time to time or any rules

Subd. 2. The council may impose a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each violation
of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 340A, as it may be amended from time to time, and
of this ordinance. Conviction of a violation in a court of law is not required in order for
the council to impose the civil penalty. A hearing under the Administrative
Procedures Act, Minnesota Statutes, sections 14.57 to 14.69, as it may be amended
from time to time, is not required before the penalty is imposed, but the council may
hold a hearing on the proposed violation and the proposed penalty and hear any
person who wishes to speak. Non-payment of the penalty is grounds for suspension
or revocation of the license. The following is the minimum schedule of presumptive
civil penalties which must be imposed in addition to any suspension unless the
license is revoked:
(a.) For the first violation within any three-year period, $500.

violations of the provisions in this section, or of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 340A,

determined on the basis of the history of violations for the preceding three-year
period. Revocation shall occur within 60 days following a violation for which
revocation is imposed.

Section 1410 – Adult establishments
1410.01. Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose of this section to regulate adult establishments to promote the
health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations to:
a) Prevent additional criminal activity within the city;
b) Prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequent adverse effect on
real estate values of properties within the neighborhood; and
c) Locate adult establishments away from residential areas, schools, churches,
parks and playgrounds.
The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a
limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adultoriented
materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this section to restrict
or deny access by adults to adult-oriented materials protected by the First Amendment
or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented entertainment to their
intended market.
1410.03. Findings of the city council.
Minnesota Attorney General, the American Planning Association and cities such as
St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Alexandria, Minnesota; Rochester,
Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California; and Seattle, Washington have
studied the impacts that adult establishments have in those communities. These
studies have concluded that adult establishments have adverse impact on the
surrounding neighborhoods.
The city council makes the following findings regarding the need to establish location
requirements for adult establishments. These findings are based upon the experiences
of other cities where such businesses have located, as studied by city staff:
(a.) Adult uses have an impact on the neighborhoods surrounding them, which is
distinct from the impact caused by other commercial uses;
(b.) Residential neighborhoods located within close proximity to adult theaters,
bookstores and other adult uses experience increased crime rates (sex-related
crimes in particular), lower property values, increased transiency, decreased
stability of ownership, neighborhood blight and potential health risks;
(c.) The adverse impacts that adult uses have on surrounding areas diminish as
the distance from the adult use increases;
Minnetrista City Code Chapter 14 - Business and Trade Regulations Page 12 of 18
(d.) Studies of other cities show that among the crimes which tend to increase
either within or in the near vicinity of adult uses are rapes, prostitution, child
molestation, indecent exposure and other lewd and lascivious behavior;
(e.) Many members of the public perceive areas within which adult uses are
located as less safe than other areas that do not have such uses;
(f.) Studies of other cities have shown that the values of both commercial and
residential properties either are diminished or fail to appreciate at the rate of
other comparable properties when located in proximity to adult uses;
(g.) It is not the intent of the city council to prohibit adult establishments from
having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city;
(h.) Section 462.357 of Minnesota Statutes allows the city to adopt regulations to
promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare;
(i.) The public health, safety, morals and general welfare will be promoted by the
city adopting regulations governing adult establishments.
