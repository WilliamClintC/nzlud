notice sent to the licensee. The council in that case must consider the presumptive penalty for each violation under the first appearance column in
subsection B of this section. The occurrence of multiple violations is grounds for deviation from the presumed penalties in the council's discretion.
D. Subsequent Violations: Violations occurring after the notice of hearing has been mailed, but prior to the hearing, must be treated as a separate violation
and dealt with as a second appearance before the council, unless the city administrator and licensee agree in writing to add the violation to the first
appearance. The same procedure applies to the second, third, or fourth appearance before the council.
E. Subsequent Appearances: Upon a second or subsequent appearance before the council by the same licensee, the council must impose the
presumptive penalty for the violation or violations giving rise to the subsequent appearance without regard to the particular violation or violations that
were the subject of the prior appearance. However, the council may consider the amount of time elapsed between appearances as a basis for deviating
from the presumptive penalty imposed by this section.

products through vending machines and the regulation of sales through self-service merchandising will thereby promote the health, safety and welfare of
the residents of the city, particularly those residents under eighteen (18) years of age. (Ord. 777, sec. 1, 12-20-2004; amd. Ord. 870, 9-20-2010)

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
3-10-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
A. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the
city, to guard against the inception and transmission of disease, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first
amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.
B. The city council further finds that experience from other cities demonstrates that sexually oriented businesses conducted in private by members of the
same or the opposite sex, and employing personnel with no specialized training, are susceptible to operation in a manner contravening, subverting or
endangeringthe health, safety and welfare of members of the community by being the sites of acts of prostitution, illicit sex, and occasions of violent
crimes, thus requiring close inspection, licensing, and regulation. (Ord. 685, sec. 1, 5-21-2001)

A. Grantee shall design, construct and maintain the cable television system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit in the service area, subject to
any service area line extension requirements of the franchise agreement.
B. After service has been established by activating trunk and/or distribution cables for any service area, grantee shall provide cable service to any
requesting subscriber within that service area within thirty (30) days from the date of request, provided that the grantee is able to secure all rights of
way necessary to extend service to such subscriber within such thirty (30) day period on reasonable terms and conditions.
C. No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual circumstances such as the existence of more than one hundred fifty feet (150')
of distance from distribution cable to connection of service to subscribers, or a density equivalent of less than forty (40) homes per mile, service may be
made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor and easements. For the purpose of
determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by the grantee and subscribers in the area in which service may be
expanded, the grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the
actual number of residences per mile, and whose denominator equals forty (40) residences. Subscribers who request service hereunder, will bear the
remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. The grantee may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of
construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance.
D. Grantee shall bury all drops to subscribers dwellings when required by local construction standards. In the event the ground is frozen or otherwise
unsuitable to permit immediate burial, grantee shall be permitted to delay such burial until the ground becomes suitable for burial which in no event
shall be later than June 30. (Ord. 636, sec. 1, 11-2-1998)

PAWNBROKERS/PRECIOUS METAL DEALERS
3-15-1: PURPOSE:
The city council finds that the use of services provided by pawnbrokers and precious metal dealers potentially provides an opportunity for the commission
of crimes and their concealment because such businesses have the ability to receive and transfer stolen property easily and quickly. The city council also
finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers and precious metal dealers. The purpose of this chapter is to
prevent pawn and precious metal businesses from being used as facilities for the commission of crimes and to assure that such businesses comply with
basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city.
To help the police department better regulate current and future pawn businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the pawn
industry, and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawn industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transaction information, this
chapter also implements and establishes the required use of the automated pawn system (APS). (Ord. 716, sec. 1, 7-1-2002)

required to control and regulate other business activities licensed by the city. This concentrated use of city services tends to detract from and reduce
the level of service available to the rest of the community and thereby diminishes the ability of the city to promote the general health, welfare, morals
and safety of the community.

given in the field and limited to the face, neck and scalp for beautification purposes only; and

Trees provide many environmental, economic and aesthetic benefits to the public. The health of the trees in the City of Lakeville is threatened by shade
tree pests of an epidemic nature. The loss or poor health of trees growing upon public and private property substantially depreciates the value of property
within the City and impairs the safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of the public. The Council intends to address pests of an epidemic
nature, defined as having a widespread occurrence directly associated with a high mortality of a tree species. In addition to and in accordance with
Minnesota Statutes sections 89.001, 89.01, and 89.51 - .64, the provisions of this section are adopted as an effort to prevent, control and/or slow the

Minnesota Department of Agriculture or the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources; or other reliable means.
B. The City shall notify the entire community by two (2) means of communication such as the City website and official newspaper when seasonal
inspections for shade tree pests are about to commence. In addition, the tree inspector shall knock on the door before entering private property for the
purpose of inspecting or abating nuisances. If the owner, resident, or other person in control of the property does not answer the door, the property
owner shall be provided with the opportunity to schedule an inspection or abatement within a reasonable time period. If the inspection or abatement is
not authorized by the property owner within such reasonable time period, the tree inspector may take appropriate legal measures to gain authorization
for entry.
C. No person, firm, or corporation shall interfere with the tree inspector or with anyone acting under the City Forester's authority while engaged in activities

Except as provided in sections 4-4-12 and 4-4-14 of this chapter, whenever a tree inspector determines with reasonable certainty that a public nuisance,
as described by this chapter, is being maintained or exists on premises in the City, the tree inspector is authorized to abate a public nuisance according to
the procedures in this chapter.
A. The tree inspector will notify in writing the owner of record of the premises that a public nuisance exists and order that the nuisance be terminated or
abated. The notice may be given in person or by mail. Failure of any party to receive the mail does not invalidate the service of the notice. A copy will
be on file at the City offices.
B. The notice of abatement shall state that unless the public nuisance is abated by the owner, it will be abated by the City at the expense of the owner. The
notice shall specify the control measures to be taken to abate the nuisance and provide a reasonable amount of time to abate the nuisance. The notice
will also state that the owner has the right to appeal the determination that a public nuisance exists by submitting a request in writing to the City Clerk
within seven (7) days after service of the notice, or before the date by which abatement must be completed, whichever comes first.
C. If no timely appeal is submitted, and the control measures prescribed in the notice of abatement are not complied with within the time provided by the
notice or any additional time granted, the tree inspector or designated person shall have the authority to obtain permission from the owner or individual
in control of the property or other legal authorization, enter the property and carry out abatement in accordance with the notice of abatement. (Ord.
1004, 11-19-2018)

fourteen (14) calendar days following receipt by the Clerk of the written request. At least three (3) days' notice of the hearing shall be given to the
individual who made the written request for the hearing. The Council may modify the abatement notice or extend the time by which abatement must be
completed. Each owner, agent of the owner, occupant, and lienholder of the subject property or properties in attendance, if any, shall be given the
opportunity to present evidence at the hearing. After holding the hearing, the City Council may issue an order requiring abatement of the nuisance. (Ord.
1004, 11-19-2018)
4-4-14: ABATEMENT PROCEDURE IN EVENT OF IMMINENT DANGER:

safety, or welfare in immediate danger, the tree inspector may provide for abatement without following section 4-4-11 or 4-4-12 of this chapter. The tree
inspector must reasonably attempt to notify the owner of the affected property of the intended action and the right to appeal the abatement and any
cost recovery at the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting.
B. Nothing in this section shall prevent the City, without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition that poses an imminent and

4-4-15: RECOVERY OF COST OF ABATEMENT; LIABILITY AND ASSESSMENT:
A. The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been abated by the City shall be personally liable for the cost to the City of the abatement, including
administrative costs. As soon as the work has been completed and the cost determined, the City Clerk or other official shall prepare a bill for the cost
and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the Office of the City Clerk.

hereby declared to be a public nuisance and a public health and safety hazard for purposes of Minnesota statutes section 429.101, subdivision 1(c)

dangerous dog or within ten (10) days of the dog's location within the city, whichever occurs first; and
(2) Provide the city animal control authority with written notice of any intended relocation of the dog from its current residence and provide any new
owner's full name, address, daytime and evening telephone numbers and the relocation address at least ten (10) days prior to any such

requested the hearing or a person of suitable age at the residence of such owner. The decision of the hearing examiner is final without any
further right of administrative appeal. An aggrieved party may obtain review thereof by petitioning the Minnesota court of appeals for a writ of
certiorari not more than thirty (30) days after service of the hearing examiner's written decision.

thousand dollars ($1,000.00) will be the responsibility of the dog's owner.
g. Dangerous Dogs Requirements: Upon a determination after a hearing that the dog is dangerous under this code or state law, or upon the
expiration of the fourteen (14) day appeal period where no owner serves upon the city animal control authority a timely and proper request for
appeal of the dangerous dog designation, or upon the relocation of a dog to this city from another location where the dog was previously declared
dangerous under either state law or a local law substantially similar to this subsection, it shall be the joint and several responsibility of each owner

dangerous dog on the property;

(5) Cause the dog to be sterilized at the owner's expense and provide the city animal control authority with proof thereof, including the name,
address and telephone number of the veterinarian who performed the procedure, within thirty (30) days of the date the dog was determined to
be dangerous. If the owner does not have the dog sterilized within thirty (30) days, the city animal control authority shall seize the dog and have
it sterilized at the owner's expense;
(6) Provide the city animal control authority with written notice of the death of the dog within thirty (30) days thereof and if requested execute an
affidavit under oath setting forth the circumstances of the dog's death and disposition;

name, address, daytime and evening telephone numbers and acknowledging that the city animal control authority has identified the dog as
dangerous and provide a copy thereof to the city animal control authority;

liability insurance issued by an insurance company authorized to conduct business in this state in the amount of at least three hundred thousand
dollars ($300,000.00), insuring the owner for any personal injuries inflicted by the dangerous dog.
h. Confiscation Of Dangerous Dogs:
(1) Seizure: The city animal control authority shall immediately seize any dangerous dog if:
(A) After fourteen (14) days after the owner has notice that the dog is dangerous, the dog is not validly registered;
(B) After fourteen (14) days after the owner has notice that the dog is dangerous, the owner does not secure the property liability insurance or
surety coverage;
(C) The dog is not maintained in a proper enclosure; or
(D) The dog is outside the proper enclosure and not under physical restraint of a responsible person.
(2) Subsequent Offenses; Seizure: In addition, if the dog's owner is convicted of violating this subsection or state laws regulating dangerous dogs,
the court as a part of its sentence may order that the dog be confiscated and destroyed in a proper and humane manner and that the owner pay
the costs incurred in confiscating, confining and destroying the dog. Where an owner is convicted of violating this subsection or state laws
regulating dangerous dogs and is thereafter charged with a subsequent such violation relating to the same dog, the dog must be summarily
seized and impounded by the animal control authority. Upon conviction of that subsequent offense, the court shall order as part of its sentence
that the dog be destroyed in a proper and humane manner and that the owner pay the cost of confiscating, confining and destroying the dog. If
the owner is not convicted and the dog is not reclaimed by the owner within seven (7) days after the owner has been notified that the dog may
be reclaimed, the dog may be disposed of in a proper and humane manner. Any person who harbors, hides or conceals or aids and abets the
harboring, hiding or concealment of a dog determined to be dangerous under this code or state laws regulating dangerous dogs shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor.
i. Reclaiming Seized Dog: A confiscated dangerous dog not subject to destruction under this subsection may be reclaimed by an owner upon
payment of impoundment and boarding fees and presenting proof of compliance with all of the requirements of this subsection or state laws
regulating dangerous dogs. A confiscated dog not reclaimed under this subsection within seven (7) days may be destroyed in a proper and
humane manner with the owner being responsible for the costs of confiscation, boarding and destruction.
j. Destruction Of Dog In Certain Circumstances: Where the city animal control authority seeks to destroy a dog it has designated as dangerous, it
must provide the owner with specific notice, in writing, of its intent to destroy the animal and provide the owner with a full and fair opportunity for a
hearing on this issue in the context of the appeal of the dangerous dog designation in subsection B2f of this section. The city animal control
authority may destroy a dog in a proper and humane manner, with the owner being responsible for the costs of confiscation, boarding, and
destruction, if:
(1) The dog inflicted substantial or great bodily harm on a human on public or private property without provocation;
(2) The dog inflicted multiple bites on the victim or bites on multiple victims on public or private property without provocation;
(3) The dog bit multiple human victims on public or private property in the same attack without provocation;
(4) The dog bit a human on public or private property without provocation in an attack where more than one dog participated in the attack;
(5) The owner of the dog has demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to control the animal in order to prevent injury to persons or other
animals; and
(6) Unless the animal is destroyed another unprovoked attack on a human being is likely and that therefore the destruction of the animal is
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
k. Review Of Dangerous Dog Designation: Beginning six (6) months after a dog is declared dangerous hereunder, an owner may request annually
that the city animal control authority review the designation by serving upon it a written request for review that includes the full name, address and
telephone numbers of the requestor, a list of the names and addresses of all owners of the dog, the requestor's ownership interest, and a
summary of the basis for the claimed change in the dog's behavior. The owner must provide evidence that the dog's behavior has changed due to
the dog's age, neutering, environment, completion of obedience training that includes modification of aggressive behavior, or other factors. Within
fourteen (14) days of the receipt of the request, the animal control authority shall make a determination in writing as to whether or not to rescind
the dangerous dog designation. Should the designation be rescinded, the dog shall nonetheless continue to be considered potentially dangerous
and subject to the requirements of this code.

control authority may consider such facts as the seriousness of the violation or violations that led to the prohibition, any criminal convictions, or
other facts that the animal control authority deems appropriate. The animal control authority may rescind the prohibition entirely or rescind it with
limitations. The city animal control authority also may establish conditions a person must meet before the prohibition is rescinded, including, but

7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

CHIEF OF POLICE: The Police Chief of the City of Lakeville or the Chief's designee.
PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR: The Public Works Director of the City or the Director's designee.
TRAFFIC SIGNAL PREEMPTION SYSTEM (TSPS) (OPTI-COMM): A traffic-control system designed for use by emergency vehicles to improve traffic
movement by temporarily controlling signalized intersections. The TSPS is comprised of four (4) separate components: an emitter, a detector, an indicator,
and a phase selector. The emitter (a high-intensity light source) is attached to the emergency vehicle and functions like a strobe light, pulsating at a
frequency in excess of ten (10) "beats" per second. As an emergency vehicle approaches the intersection, this pulsating light is received by a detector that
is located at or near the traffic signal. The detector relays the coded message to the phase selector, located in the traffic-control box, which then either
holds the existing green light in favor of the approaching emergency vehicle or accelerates the normal cycle of a signal change to provide green by the
time the vehicle reaches the intersection. The indicator is a light source located near the detector which is directed toward the oncoming emergency
vehicle to indicate to the driver whether or not the traffic light has been preempted in their favor. (Ord. 456, sec. 1, 2-3-92)
6-1-10-2: PURPOSE:
The purpose for using the traffic signal preemption system (TSPS) in Lakeville is to allow emergency vehicles to perform emergency services in a safer
and more timely manner by temporarily controlling motorized vehicle traffic flow at signalized intersections. The City Council deems it advisable to
formulate policies and procedures for the use of the TSPS emitters so that both pedestrians and drivers of motorized vehicles have adequate warning that
emergency vehicles are changing normal traffic control timing at signalized intersections. (Ord. 456, sec. 1, 2-3-92)

B. Police Department: City owned Police Department vehicles may use the TSPS while on emergency response. Unless otherwise provided for herein, or
as approved by the Chief of Police, all other use by the Department is prohibited. Conditions for the use of TSPS hereby become a part of the Police

C. ALF Ambulance: ALF Ambulance may use the TSPS while on emergency response.
D. Maintenance Personnel: City of Lakeville, Dakota County, State of Minnesota maintenance personnel, or their contractors under written agreement,

exceed the posted speed limits. If an emergency vehicle is to be used for the test, the Chief of Police shall be notified prior to the test activation.
E. Emergency Vehicles Not Owned Or Operated By The City: The use of TSPS within the City by non-City emergency vehicles may be authorized in
writing by the Chief of Police.

7-5-15-1: RECITALS:
The metropolitan waste control commission, a metropolitan commission organized and existing under the laws of the state of Minnesota (the
"commission"), in order to receive and retain grants in compliance with the federal water pollution control act amendments of 1972 and regulations
thereunder (the "act"), has determined to impose an industrial user sewer strength charge upon users of the metropolitan disposal system (as defined in
Minnesota statutes section 473.121, subdivision 24) to recover operation and maintenance costs of treatment works attributable to the strength of the
discharge of industrial waste, such sewer strength charge being in addition to the charge based upon the volume of discharge. In order for the city to pay
such costs based upon strength of industrial discharge and allocated to it each year by the commission, it is hereby found, determined and declared to be
necessary to establish sewer strength charges and a formula for the computation thereof for all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within
or served by the city. Furthermore, Minnesota statutes section 444.075, subdivision 3, empowers the city to make such sewer charge a charge against the
owner, lessee, occupant or all of them and certify unpaid charges to the county auditor as a tax lien against the property served. (Ord. 105, sec. 1, 2-7-
1977)
7-5-15-2: ESTABLISHMENT OF STRENGTH CHARGES:
For the purpose of paying the costs allocated to the city each year by the commission that are based upon the strength of discharge of all industrial users
receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, there is hereby approved, adopted and established, in addition to the sewer charge based
upon the volume of discharge, a sewer charge upon each company or corporation receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, based
upon strength of industrial waste discharged into the sewer system of the city (the "strength charge" in section 7-5-15-3 of this chapter). (Ord. 105, sec. 2,
2-7-1977)
7-5-15-3: ESTABLISHMENT OF STRENGTH CHARGE FORMULA:
For the purpose of computation of the strength charge established by section 7-5-15-2 of this chapter, there is hereby established, approved and adopted
in compliance with the act the same strength charge formula designated in resolution 76-172, adopted by the governing body of the commission on June
15, 1976, such formula being based upon pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of the sewage produced through an evaluation of pollution qualities
and quantities in excess of an annual average base and the proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of waste treatment services provided by the
commission. (Ord. 105, sec. 3, 2-7-1977)
7-5-15-4: STRENGTH CHARGE PAYMENT:
It is hereby approved, adopted and established that the strength charge established by section 7-5-15-2 of this chapter shall be paid by each industrial
user receiving waste treatment services and subject thereto before the twentieth day next succeeding the date of billing thereof to such user by or on
behalf of the city, and such payment thereof shall be deemed to be delinquent if not so paid to the billing entity before such date. Furthermore, it is hereby
established, approved and adopted that if such payment is not paid before such date, an industrial user shall pay interest compounded monthly at the rate
of two-thirds of one percent (2/3%) per month on the unpaid balance due. (Ord. 105, sec. 4, 2-7-1977)
7-5-15-5: ESTABLISHMENT OF TAX LIEN:
As provided by Minnesota statutes section 444.075, subdivision 3, it is hereby approved, adopted and established that if payment of the strength charge
established by section 7-5-15-2 of this chapter is not paid before the sixtieth day next succeeding the date of billing thereof to the industrial user by or on
behalf of the city, said delinquent sewer strength charge, plus accrued interest established pursuant to section 7-5-15-4 of this chapter, shall be deemed to
be a charge against the owner, lessee and occupant of the property served, and the city or its agent shall certify such unpaid delinquent balance to the
county auditor with taxes against the property served for collection as other taxes are collected; provided, however, that such certification shall not
preclude the city or its agents from recovery of such delinquent sewer strength charge and interest thereon under any other available remedy. (Ord. 105,
sec. 5, 2-7-1977)
7-5-16: INDIVIDUAL SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEMS STANDARDS:
A. Subject to the amendments set forth in this section, Dakota County subsurface sewage treatment system ordinance 113, as amended, is hereby
adopted by reference. A copy of the ordinance shall be kept on file in the city offices.

informing the affected applicants in writing of such extension.
2. The applicant fails to submit all required documents or information and the City provides written notice of incompleteness to the applicant within thirty
(30) business days of receipt of the application, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information. Information delineated in
the notice is limited to documents or information publicly required as of the date of application and reasonably related to the City's determination
whether the proposed equipment falls within the definition of a small wireless facility and whether the proposed deployment satisfies all health,
safety, and welfare regulations applicable to the small wireless facility permit request. Upon applicant's submittal of additional information in response
to a notice of incompleteness, the City has ten (10) days to notify the applicant in writing of any information requested in the initial notice of
incompleteness that is still missing. Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify documents or information that were delineated
in the original notice of incompleteness. Requests for information not requested in the initial notice of incompleteness do not toll the ninety (90) day
deadline for action.
3. The City and applicant may agree in writing to toll the review period. (Ord. 990, 12-4-2017)

7-15-13: RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION:
A. Timing: The work to be done under the right-of-way permit, and the patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed
within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or
when work was prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under section 7-15-16 of this chapter.
B. Temporary Surfacing, Patch And Restoration: Permittee shall patch its own work, restore the right-of-way and assume all costs therefor unless
otherwise agreed upon.
1. City Restoration: If the City restores any part of the right-of-way, permittee shall pay the costs thereof within thirty (30) days of billing. If the City
restores only the surface of the right-of-way and during the twenty four (24) months following such restoration, the pavement settles, the permittee
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 163/480
shall pay to the City, within thirty (30) days of billing, all costs related to restoring the right-of-way or associated with having to correct the defective
work, which may include removal and replacement of any or all work done by the permittee. These costs shall include administrative, overhead
mobilization, material, labor and equipment.
2. Permittee Restoration: If the permittee restores the right-of-way, the City may require, and the permittee shall provide at the time of application for
the right-of-way permit, a City specified type of security, in accordance with PUC rules, to cover the cost of repair and restoration.
C. Standards: To the maximum extent possible, restoration must return the right-of-way to the same condition that existed before excavation. Subject to
this standard, plates 1 to 13, shown in Minnesota Rules parts 7819.9900 to 7819.9950, indicate the maximum limits of restoration methods and area
requirements the City can impose when a right-of-way user excavates in the right-of-way. Subject to commission rules, the City shall have the authority
to prescribe additional restoration procedures and standards on a case by case basis based on the following considerations:
1. The number, size, depth and duration of the excavation, disruption or damage to the right-of-way;
2. The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way;
3. The character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way;
4. The pre-project condition of the right-of-way;
5. The remaining life expectancy of the right-of-way due to the project;
6. Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of
the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way; and
7. The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take
place.
D. Duty To Correct Defects: The permittee shall guarantee its work and restoration of the right-of-way and maintain it for twenty four (24) months following
its completion. The obligation is limited to twelve (12) months for plantings and turf establishment. During this twenty four (24) month period, the
permittee shall, upon notification from the City, correct all defects in patching or restoration to the extent necessary, using the method required by the
City. Said work shall be completed within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the City, not including days during which work cannot
be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or when work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under section 7-15-16 of
this chapter.
E. Failure To Restore: If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the City, the City shall notify the permittee in writing of the specific alleged failure or failures and shall allow the
permittee at least five (5) calendar days from receipt of the notice to cure the failure or failures, or to respond with a plan to cure. In the event the
permittee fails to cure or fails to respond to the notice, the City may, at its option, perform or cause to be performed the necessary work and the
permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty (30) days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If permittee fails to pay as required, the City may
exercise its rights and draw from the City specified security. (Ord. 990, 12-4-2017)

B. Shared Fees: Registrants who apply for permits for the same excavation, obstruction, or small wireless facility permit action, which the City does not
perform, may share in the payment of the excavation, obstruction, or small wireless facility permit fee. Registrants must agree among themselves as to
the portion each will pay and indicate the same on their applications.
C. With City Construction Projects: Registrants who join in a scheduled excavation or obstruction permit action coordinated with a City construction project
by the City, whether or not it is a joint application by two (2) or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the excavation or
obstruction portions of the permit fee, but a permit is still required. (Ord. 990, 12-4-2017)
7-15-15: SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS:
A. Limitation On Area: A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the
area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the permit must be
excavated or obstructed must before working in that greater area: 1) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required
thereby, and 2) be granted a new permit or permit extension. The City may orally waive the requirement for a permit extension or the payment of an
additional fee. The City shall maintain a written record of any waivers granted.
B. Limitation On Dates: A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date
or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply for a
new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the
previous permit. This supplementary application must be done before the permit end date. The City may orally waive the requirement for a permit
extension for the payment of an additional fee. The City shall maintain a written record of any waivers granted. (Ord. 990, 12-4-2017)

repair is caused by another permittee's work in the right-of-way. If the City becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the City
will attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the City may take
whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
B. Nonemergency Situations: Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, excavates, obstructs, or
collocates in a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, deposit with the City the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and
comply with all of the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 990, 12-4-2017)

B. Corridors: The City may assign specific corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, as a Best
Management Practice for each type of facility or equipment that is, or, pursuant to current technology, the City expects will someday be located, within
the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the City involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the
proper corridor for the facilities at issue. In new subdivisions, the subdivider's engineer shall indicate all utility crossings associated with the subdivision
in the construction plan submittal to the City and small utility companies. Conduits shall be required and installed in accordance with the current City of
Lakeville Utility and Street Construction Standard Specifications. Installation of dual mains by a single company shall be required for all new
subdivisions.
Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the City shall, no later than at the time of
the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way, to
prevent interference with City use of the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the City for good cause shown, upon consideration of such
factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the registrant.
C. Limitation Of Space: To protect health, safety and welfare or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the City shall have the
power to use Best Management Practices to prohibit or limit the placement and location of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making
such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided
primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's need for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with
respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future City plans for public improvements and development
projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.
D. Relocation Of Facilities: A right-of-way user shall promptly and at its own expense, with due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently
remove and relocate its facilities in the right-of-way when it is necessary to prevent interference, and not merely for convenience of the City, in
connection with: 1) a present or future City use of the right-of-way for a public improvement, 2) the public health or safety, or 3) the safety and
convenience of travel over the right-of-way. The right-of-way user shall restore any rights-of-way in accordance with this chapter.
A right-of-way user is not required to remove or relocate its facilities from a right-of-way that has been vacated in favor of a nongovernmental entity
unless and until the reasonable costs to do so are first paid to the right-of-way user.
E. Undergrounding: Unless otherwise permitted by an existing franchise, or unless existing aboveground equipment is repaired or replaced, or unless
infeasible such as in the provision of electric service at certain voltages, new construction, the installation of new equipment and the required relocation
of old equipment in the right-of-way must be located or relocated and maintained underground in accordance with chapter 6 of this title. The permittee
shall comply with the following requirements when installing underground facilities:
1. Underground facilities shall, where reasonably possible, be installed outside the paved or surfaced area. If unable to install outside the surfaced
area, the installation shall be as close to the edge of the roadway surface as possible to allow access thereto without unnecessarily disturbing paved
areas of the roadway;
2. Right-of-way alignment and grade shall be maintained;
3. Fiber facilities shall be buried in a proper conduit and at a depth of no less than three feet (3') deep and no more than four feet (4') deep; copper

4. All underground facilities which cross streets or hard surfaced driveways shall be bored and installed in conduit when requested by the City. Gas
does not need to be installed in conduit;
5. When required, the permittee shall excavate an observation hole over a City utility to ensure that a City utility is not damaged;
6. If the project work involves an open cut, the permittee shall install visual tracers twelve inches (12") over buried facilities. If other construction
methods are used, substitute location methods may be used upon approval by the City;
7. During plowing or trenching of facilities, a warning tape shall be placed at a depth of twelve inches (12") above copper cables with over two hundred
(200) pairs and fiber facilities and a locating wire or conductive shield shall be installed above buried telecommunication facilities, except for dielectric
cables;
8. Restoration of areas disturbed by facilities will include returning the right-of-way to the same condition that existed before excavation as per
Minnesota Rules 7819.1100. Subject to this standard, plates 1 to 13, shown in parts 7819.9900 to 7819.9950, indicate maximum limits of restoration
methods and area requirements the City can impose when a right-of-way user excavates in the right-of-way. The City and right-of-way user may
agree to a lesser requirement. The right-of-way user is responsible for all of its work done in the right-of-way, whether by employees, agents or
independent contractors. All levels of restoration include compaction of the materials placed in the excavation of the subgrade and aggregate base,
plus pavement replacement, in-kind. If required by the City, all work must be performed according to the City's specifications and drawings;
9. All facilities shall be located so as to not interfere with existing and potential future traffic signals and signs;
10. Unless approved by the City, all aboveground appurtenances shall be located no closer than ten feet (10') to City hydrants, waterline valves,
manholes, lift stations and catch basins; not in front of or within usual sightlines of any City sign, monument or amenity for facilities or parks; and no
closer than two feet (2') from sidewalks and trails;
11. Underground facilities shall not be installed between a hydrant and an auxiliary valve;
12. Where utility easements exist beyond the roadway surface area of the right-of-way and space is available therein, underground facilities shall not
be installed within five feet (5') of hydrants, waterline valves, lift stations, manholes or catch basins. In those areas in which no utility easement
exists, placement of an underground facility shall be between the edge of pavement and no closer than three feet (3') to an existing City utility
appurtenance, unless approved by the City;

Chapter 7
OFFICIAL MAP
9-7-1: PURPOSE:
Land that is needed for future street purposes and as sites for other necessary public facilities and services is frequently diverted to nonpublic uses which
would have been located on other lands without hardship or inconvenience to the owners. When this happens, public uses of land may be denied or may
be obtained only at prohibitive cost or at the expense of dislocating the owners and occupants of the land. Identification on an official map of land needed
for future public uses permits both the public and private property owners to adjust their building plans equitably and conveniently before investments are
made which will make such adjustments difficult to accomplish. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a uniform procedure for the proper use of official
maps as authorized by the Minnesota municipal planning act, Minnesota statutes chapter 462. (Ord. 760, sec. 1, 3-15-2004)
9-7-2: OFFICIAL MAP DEFINED:
"Official map", as used in this chapter, means a map adopted in accordance with this chapter showing existing streets, proposed future streets, and the
area needed for widening of existing streets of the city. An official map may also show the location of existing and future land and facilities within the city.
An official map may cover the entire city or any portion of the city. (Ord. 760, sec. 1, 3-15-2004)
9-7-3: INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS:
Proceedings for adoption, amendment, or repeal of an official map or any part thereof may be initiated by:
A. A recommendation of the planning commission; or
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 182/480
B. Action by the city council on its own initiative, recommendation of an advisory commission, or request of an outside governmental body. (Ord. 760, sec.
1, 3-15-2004)
9-7-4: SKETCH MAPS AND REPORTS:
Every proposal or request for an official map or its amendment or repeal, however initiated, shall be accompanied by a sketch map or plat showing the
lands proposed to be included and the public purpose to be served. (Ord. 760, sec. 1, 3-15-2004)
9-7-5: REFERENCE TO PLANNING COMMISSION:
Except when proceedings have been initiated by recommendation of the planning commission, every proposed official map or change in a map shall be
referred to the planning commission for advice and recommendation thereon, and such recommendation shall be submitted to the city council within forty
five (45) days after reference to the planning commission along with the report of the commission on the effect of the proposal on the comprehensive plan
of the city. If no recommendation is received by the council from the planning commission within forty five (45) days after reference of the proposal to the
commission by the council, the council may take such action as it may deem proper upon the proposal without further action by the planning commission.
(Ord. 760, sec. 1, 3-15-2004)
9-7-6: NOTICE AND HEARING:
A. Notice: Upon receiving the recommendation of the planning commission or after forty five (45) days from the submission of the proposal to the planning
commission without a recommendation from the commission, the council may call a public hearing on the proposal. A notice of the time, place and
purpose of the hearing and a description of property to be included in the mapped streets and public grounds shall be published in the official
newspaper at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing. At least ten (10) days prior to the hearing the clerk shall also mail a copy of the notice
to each owner of land situated within or abutting any street or other public ground shown on the official map. For purposes of this notice, the owners
shall be determined by the records of the city's geographic information system (GIS) and the notice shall be addressed to the last known address as
shown by the auditor's records. Failure to serve any such notice shall not invalidate the proceedings.
B. Hearing: At the time and place specified in the notice, the council shall hear evidence and arguments concerning the proposal. The hearing may be
continued, from time to time, without further notice. The council may direct the planningcommission to conduct a hearing and following the hearing to
report its recommendation to the council. (Ord. 760, sec. 1, 3-15-2004)
9-7-7: PREPARATION AND FILING OF MAPS:
The official map or maps shall be prepared in sufficient detail to permit the establishment of future acquisition lines on the ground. In unplatted areas a
minimum of a centerline survey shall be made prior to the preparation of the final draft of the official map. After enactment of any ordinance adopting an
official map or amending or repealing a previous official map ordinance, a certified copy of the official map or section to which the ordinance relates
together with an attached copy of the ordinance shall be filed with the county recorder. (Ord. 760, sec. 1, 3-15-2004)
9-7-8: EFFECT:
After an official map has been adopted and filed, the issuance of building permits by the city shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. The city shall
deny every application for a permit to construct a new building or structure or expand an existing building or structure within an area designated on the
official map for street or other public purposes. Whenever any street or highway is widened or improved or any new street is opened, or any interest in
lands for other public purposes is acquired by the city, the city is not required in such proceedings to pay for any building or structure placed without a
permit or in violation of conditions of a permit within the limits of the mapped street or outside of any building line that may have been established upon the
existing street or within any area thus identified for public purposes. The adoption of an official map does not give the city any right, title, or interest in
areas identified for public purposes thereon, but the adoption of the map does authorize the city to acquire such interest without paying compensation for
buildings or structures erected in such areas without a permit or in violation of the conditions of a permit. (Ord. 760, sec. 1, 3-15-2004)
9-7-9: APPEALS:
Whenever a building is denied pursuant to this chapter, the board of appeals and adjustments shall, upon appeal filed with it by the owner of the land,
grant a permit for building in an area designated on the official map for a street or other public purpose in any case in which the board finds, upon the
evidence and the arguments presented to it:
A. The entire property of the appellant of which the area designated for public purposes forms a part cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless
such a permit is granted, or
B. Balancing the interest of the city in preserving the integrity of the official map and of the city's comprehensive plan and the interest of the property owner
in the use of his property and in the benefits of ownership, the grant of such permit is required by consideration of justice and equity.
The board of appeals and adjustments shall hold a public hearing upon the appeal after notice of the hearing has been published in the official
newspaper once at least ten (10) days before the hearing. If the board authorizes issuance of a permit, it shall specify the exact location, ground area,
height and other details as to the extent and character of the building for which the permit is granted. If the board authorizes issuance of a permit, the
council or other board or commission having jurisdiction shall have six (6) months from the date of the decision of the board to institute proceedings to
acquire such land or interest therein, and if no such proceedings are started within that time, the city shall issue the permit if the application otherwise
conforms to local ordinances. (Ord. 760, sec. 1, 3-15-2004)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 190/480
10-2-4-1: CONDITION ESTABLISHING PREMATURE SUBDIVISIONS:
A subdivision may be deemed premature should any of the provisions that follow exist:
A. Lack Of Adequate Drainage: A condition of inadequate drainage shall be deemed to exist if:
1. Surface or subsurface water retention and runoff are such that it constitutes a danger to the structural security of the proposed structures.
2. The proposed subdivision will cause pollution of water sources or damage from erosion and siltation on downhill or downstream land.
3. The proposed site grading and development will cause harmful and irreparable damage from erosion and siltation on downhill or downstream land.
4. Factors to be considered in making these determinations may include: average rainfall for the area; the relation of the land to floodplains; the nature
of soils and subsoils and their ability to adequately support surface water runoff and waste disposal systems; the slope of the land and its effect on
effluents; and the presence of streams as related to effluent disposal.
B. Lack Of Adequate Water Supply: A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack an adequate water supply if the proposed subdivision does not have
adequate sources of water to serve the proposed subdivision if developed to its maximum permissible density without causing an unreasonable
depreciation of existing water supplies for surrounding areas.
C. Lack Of Adequate Roads Or Highways To Serve The Subdivision: A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack adequate roads or highways to
serve the subdivision when:
1. Roads which serve the proposed subdivision are of such a width, grade, stability, vertical and horizontal alignment, site distance and surface
condition that an increase in traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create a hazard to public safety and general welfare, or
seriously aggravate an already hazardous condition, and when, with due regard to the advice of Dakota County and/or the Minnesota department of
transportation, said roads are inadequate for the intended use.
2. The traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create unreasonable highway congestion or unsafe conditions on highways existing
at the time of the application or proposed for completion within the next two (2) years.
D. Lack Of Adequate Waste Disposal Systems: A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack adequate waste disposal systems if in subdivisions for
which sewer lines are proposed, there is inadequate sewer capacity in the present system to support the subdivision if developed to its maximum
permissible density after reasonable sewer capacity is reserved for schools, planned public facilities, and commercial and industrial development
projected for the next five (5) years; or if in subdivisions where sewer lines are neither available nor proposed, there is inadequate on site sewer
capacity potential to support the subdivision if developed to the maximum permissible density indicated in the Lakeville comprehensive plan, as may be
amended.
E. Inconsistency With Comprehensive Plan: A proposed subdivision shall be deemed inconsistent with the city's comprehensive plan when the subdivision
is inconsistent with the purposes, objectives and recommendations of the adopted Lakeville comprehensive plan, as may be amended. Subdivisions
that do not follow planned public improvement corridors or that do not constitute an infilling of development shall be deemed inconsistent with the city's
growth strategies as outlined in the Lakeville comprehensive plan. (Ord. 673, sec. 1, 7-17-2000)
F. City Service Capacity: A proposed subdivision shall be determined to lack necessary city service capacity when services such as recreational facilities,
police and fire protection, and other city services, which must be provided at public expense, cannot reasonably be provided for within the next two (2)
years. (Ord. 703, sec. 1, 2-4-2002)
G. Metropolitan Council Environmental Services (MCES) Policies: The proposed subdivision is inconsistent with the policies of MCES, and could adversely
impact critical environmental areas or potentially disrupt or destroy historic areas, which are designated or officially recognized by the city council, in
violation of federal and state historical preservation laws.
H. Inconsistency With Capital Improvement Plans: A proposed subdivision shall be deemed inconsistent with capital improvement plans when
improvements and/or services necessary to accommodate the proposed subdivision have not been programmed in the Lakeville, Dakota County or
other regional capital improvement plans. The city council may waive this criterion when it can be demonstrated that a revision to capital improvement
programs can be accommodated. (Ord. 673, sec. 1, 7-17-2000)
10-2-4-2: BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING:
The burden shall be upon the applicant to show that the proposed subdivision or development is not premature. (Ord. 673, sec. 1, 7-17-2000)
10-2-4-3: REGIONAL SYSTEM SERVICE INADEQUACIES:
A. Existing Conditions: An approved preliminary plat or building permit within an approved final plat may be deemed as premature developments if any of
the following conditions set forth are found to exist:
1. The regionally controlled metropolitan sanitary sewer interceptors or wastewater treatment facilities are classified as having inadequate capacity to
provide service within the standards of recognized public health and safety.
2. Responsible metropolitan units of government prohibit the city from issuing building permits.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 191/480
3. Regional transportation systems are deemed as inadequate to provide service levels within standards of recognized public safety.
4. Storm drainage systems under the jurisdiction of regional watershed districts, the army corps of engineers, the Minnesota department of natural
resources, or other such responsible jurisdictions are inadequate to provide service levels within standards of recognized public health and safety.
B. City Liability Exemption: All preliminary and final plat approvals and related formal development agreements shall stipulate and shall exempt the city
from any liability associated with platting or building permit denial based upon factors and conditions related to regional governmental agency and unit
jurisdictions and related service inadequacies. (Ord. 673, sec. 1, 7-17-2000)

7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 202/480
A. The development shall conform to the natural limitations presented by topography and soil so as to create the least potential for soil erosion.
B. Erosion and sediment control measures shall be consistent with best management practices (BMPs) for erosion and sedimentation control as specified
in the "Minnesota Stormwater Manual" (MPCA 2005), as amended, and shall be sufficient to retain sediment on site.

activity under the national pollutant discharge elimination system/state disposal system permit program permit MN R100001 (NPDES general
construction permit) issued by the Minnesota pollution control agency, as amended. Final stabilization of the site must be completed in accordance with
the NPDES construction permit requirements.
D. Land shall be developed in increments of workable size such that adequate erosion and siltation controls can be provided as construction progresses.
The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one period of time. When soil is exposed, the exposure shall be for the shortest feasible
period of time, as specified in the development agreement.
E. Where the topsoil is removed, sufficient topsoil shall be set aside for respreading over the developed area. Topsoil shall be restored or provided to a
minimum depth of six inches (6") and shall be of a quality at least equal to the soil quality prior to development.
F. Natural vegetation shall be protected wherever practical.

agricultural site that is being developed), areas that will not be graded as part of the development and areas that will not be stabilized according to the
time frames specified in the NPDES general construction permit part IV.B.S. shall be seeded with a temporary or permanent cover before commencing
the proposed land disturbing activity. (Ord. 847, sec. 2, 11-17-2008)
10-4-6: STORM DRAINAGE:
All subdivision design shall incorporate adequate provisions for stormwater runoff consistent with the WRMP, water resources management plan as
amended, and with established city policies, and conform to the following standards:
A. Plan Required: The proposed provisions for stormwater runoff shall be documented in a runoff water management plan including a narrative, prepared
by a Minnesota licensed engineer to the minimum standards described in subsection B of this section.
B. Minimum Standards For Runoff Water Management Plans: A runoff water management plan shall include the following items:
1. A map containing a delineation of the subwatershed contributing runoff from off site, and proposed and existing subwatersheds on site. The
delineation shall conform to the nomenclature of the water resources management plan and shall indicate any significant departures from the
watershed delineation of the water resources management plan.
2. Delineation of existing on site "wetlands", as defined in the wetland conservation act, lakes, watercourses, shoreland, and/or floodplain areas.
3. For water bodies and channels, a listing of normal (runout) and calculated 10-year and 100-year elevations on site for both existing and proposed
conditions.
4. Stormwater runoff volumes and rates for existing and proposed conditions.
5. All hydrologic and hydraulic computations completed to design the proposed stormwater management facilities. Reservoir routing procedures and
critical duration runoff events shall be used for design of water storage areas and outlets.
6. A checklist of best management practices to demonstrate that, to the maximum extent practical, the plan has incorporated the structural and
nonstructural best management practices described in the book "Protecting Water Quality In Urban Areas", published by the Minnesota pollution
control agency or the applicable publications.
7. A grading plan identifying stormwater overflow routes along streets or drainage easements designed to protect structures from damage due to:
a. Storms in excess of the design storm, or
b. Clogging, collapse or other failure of the primary drainage facilities.
8. An assessment of the potential for construction or contribution to regional detention basins, as opposed to the construction of on site stormwater
basins. The water resources management plan identifies potential regional stormwater basins for control of rate and nutrient loading. The following
criteria shall be used to determine whether on site storage is required within the subdivision:
a. If the runoff water management plan indicates construction or enlargement of a storage site or water quality storage in a wetland or other water
body, the facility or its equivalent shall be constructed to meet the goals of the water resources management plan.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 203/480
b. If a proposed subdivision is indirectly tributary to a water body and intervening regional detention storage is inadequate, in the opinion of city staff,
to meet the water quality goals for downstream water bodies as described in the water resources management plan, additional on site stormwater
basin construction will be required to meet these goals.
c. If a proposed subdivision will increase rates of runoff and where downstream stormwater storage or conveyance facilities are inadequate to protect
downstream riparian owners from effects of these increases, then on site stormwater storage must be constructed to restrict stormwater rates to
the predevelopment rates.
9. Where on site water quality detention basins are required, copies of the calculations determining the design of the basins. The size and design
considerations will be dependent on the receiving water body's water quality category, the imperviousness of the development and the degree to
which on site infiltration of runoff is encouraged. Design of on site detention basins, as described in the site's runoff water management plan, shall
incorporate recommendations from the nationwide urban runoff program (NURP) and "Protecting Water Quality In Urban Areas", published by the
Minnesota pollution control agency, as adopted by the city, or the applicable publications, as adopted by the city. The following design considerations
are required for on site water quality detention basins based on the receiving water's water quality category. These designs include permanent
detention for water quality treatment; extended detention designs may be substituted provided that they provide treatment equivalent to the
requirements below:
a. A permanent pool (dead storage) volume below the normal outlet shall be greater than or equal to the runoff from a two and one-half inch (2.5")
24-hour storm over the entire contributing drainage area assuming full development.
b. A permanent pool average depth (basin volume/basin area) which shall be greater than four feet (4'), with a maximum depth of less than ten feet
(10').
c. An emergency spillway (emergency outlet) adequate to control the 100-year frequency critical duration rainfall event.
d. Basin side slopes above the normal water level should be no steeper than three to one (3:1) when possible, and preferably flatter. A basin shelf
with a minimum width of ten feet (10') and a maximum slope of ten to one (10:1) below the normal water level is recommended to enhance wildlife
habitat, reduce potential safety hazards, and improve access for long term maintenance.
e. To prevent short circuiting, the distance between the major inlets and normal outlet shall be maximized.
f. A flood pool (temporary storage) volume above the principal outlet spillway shall be adequate so that the peak discharge rate from the 1-, 10- and
100-year frequency critical duration storm is not greater than the peak discharge for a similar storm and predevelopment watershed conditions.
g. Extended detention of runoff from the more frequent (1-year to 5-year) storms shall be achieved through a principal spillway design which shall
include a perforated vertical riser, a small orifice outlet or a compound weir. The spillway must be constructed of a limited maintenance material.
The use of treated or naturally decay resistant timber shall not be allowed.
h. Effective energy dissipation devices which reduce outlet velocities to four feet (4') per second or less shall consist of riprap, stilling pools or other
such measures to prevent erosion at all stormwater outfalls into the basin and at the detention basin outlet.
i. Trash and floatable debris skimming devices shall be placed on the outlet of all on site detention basins to provide treatment up to the critical
duration 10-year storm event. These devices can consist of baffled weirs, submerged inlets or other such measures capable of restricting the
overflow of floatable materials, including litter, oil and grease. The skimming device must be constructed of a limited maintenance material. The
use of treated or naturally decay resistant timber shall not be allowed. Computations for the design of such devices shall be included. The
maximum velocity through the skimming device shall be less than one foot (1') per second (fps) on the 2-year 24-hour event.
j. For purposes of erosion control, vegetation protection and wildlife habitat enhancement, the 10-year flood level of the basin shall be no more than
two feet (2') above the normal level of the basin.
10. For subdivisions that create one or more acres of new impervious surface, the following volume control practices shall apply:
a. Postconstruction Water Quality Criteria:
(1) Postconstruction stormwater runoff quality measures shall meet the standard for the general permit authorization to discharge stormwater
associated with construction activity under the national pollutant discharge elimination system/state disposal system permit program permit MN
R100001 (NPDES general construction permit) issued by the Minnesota pollution control agency, August 1, 2008, as amended; except where
more specific requirements are provided in subsections B10a(2), B10a(3) and B10a(4) of this section.
(2) Infiltration/filtration options, and credits described under runoff volume control criteria are the preferred approach to satisfying the water quality
treatment requirements of the NPDES general construction permit in areas that drain to the trout stream portions of the Vermillion River and its

(3) The water quality control volumes necessary to meet the NPDES general construction permit that are satisfied using infiltration or filtration
technologies can count toward the volume control requirements of this section.
(4) Stormwater basins with permanent wet pools are allowed if the applicant demonstrates:

decreasing preference:
(i) The wet stormwater basin is designed with a combination of measures such as shading, filtered bottom withdrawal, vegetated swale
discharges, or constructed wetland treatment cells that will limit temperature increases.
(ii) Additional volume control measures and credits are used beyond that required to meet the runoff volume standards as a means of limiting
the frequency and duration of discharges from the stormwater basin.

7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 205/480
(8) Infiltration facilities must be designed so that volumes in excess of the design volume are safely conveyed into the downstream stormwater
system.
(9) Volume control may be waived by the city for sites with impermeable soils or where a shallow water table prevents construction of infiltration
systems. If the applicant claims that infiltration is not feasible on site, the applicant must provide supporting documentation to the city. If the city
agrees that infiltration is not feasible, the applicant shall design alternative stormwater runoff treatment methods including the following in order

flowage, and drainage purposes over hydrologic features such as water bodies and stormwater basins. The easements or outlots shall include the right
of reasonable access for inspection, monitoring, maintenance, and enforcement purposes.
D. Drainage Alterations: No person or political subdivision shall artificially drain surface water, or obstruct or divert the natural flow of runoff so as to affect
a drainage system, or harm the public health, safety, or general welfare, unless the drainage plan complies with the following:
1. Outlets from landlocked basins with a tributary drainage area of one hundred (100) acres or more will be allowed, provided such outlets are
consistent with the Lakeville water resources management plan, this code, state and federal regulations, and the downstream impacts, riparian
impacts, and habitat impacts of such outlets have been analyzed and no detrimental impacts result. The analysis and determination of detrimental

10-4-7: PROTECTED AREAS:
Where land proposed for subdivision is deemed environmentally sensitive by the city due to the existence of wetlands, drainageways, watercourses,
floodable areas, significant trees, steep slopes or wooded areas, the design of said subdivision shall clearly reflect all necessary measures to ensure
against adverse environmental impacts. (Ord. 847, sec. 4, 11-17-2008)
Based upon the necessity to control and maintain certain sensitive areas, the city shall determine whether said protection will be accomplished through lot
enlargement and redesign or dedication of those sensitive areas in the form of outlots.
In general, measures of protection shall include design solutions that allow for construction and grading involving a minimum of alteration to sensitive
areas. Such measures, when deemed appropriate by the city, may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
A. The establishment of buffers designed consistent with adopted management plans, easements and/or outlots over wetlands, drainageways and
watercourses. (Ord. 673, sec. 1, 7-17-2000)
B. The implementation of flood control measures, including stormwater basins and infiltration design standards as specified in adopted management plans.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 207/480
G. Private Open Space: Where private open space for park and recreation purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision, such areas may be used for
credit, at the discretion of the city council, against the land or cash dedication requirement for park and recreation purposes, provided the city council
finds it is in the public interest to do so. (Ord. 673, sec. 1, 7-17-2000)
H. Request For Change: The dedication and cash contribution requirements are presumptively appropriate. A subdivider may request a deviation from the
presumptive requirements based upon the anticipated impact of that particular subdivision or average land values for the category of land being
subdivided. The request must be made before final subdivision approval by the city.
I. Residential Subdivisions: In residential subdivisions where a land dedication is required, the following formula will be used to determine the dedication
requirement:
Category Units Per Acre Percentage Park Dedication/Acres Of Development
Low density residential Less than 3.0 12 percent
Medium density residential More than 3.0 to 9.0 14 percent
High density residential More than 9.0 17 percent
In commercial or industrial subdivisions where a land dedication is required the following formula will be used to determine the dedication: Six
percent (6%) of the buildable land being subdivided. (Ord. 890, 6-4-2012, eff. retroactive to 10-17-2011)
J. Cash Contribution: In lieu of land dedication the city may require the cash contribution as adopted by ordinance by the city council. (Ord. 915, 12-16-
2013)
K. Contribution Combination: The city may elect to receive a combination of cash, land and development of the land. The fair market value of the land the
city wants and the value of the development of the land shall be calculated. That amount shall be subtracted from the cash contribution required by
subsection J of this section. The remainder shall be the cash contribution requirement.
L. Fair Market Value: "Fair market value" shall be determined as of the time of final subdivision approval in accordance with the following:
1. The city and the developer may agree as to the fair market value, or
2. The fair market value may be based upon a current appraisal submitted to the city by the subdivider at the subdivider's expense. The appraisal shall
be made by appraisers who are approved members of the SREA or MAI, or equivalent real estate appraisal societies.
3. If the city disputes such appraisal the city may, at the subdivider's expense, obtain an appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser,
which appraisal shall be conclusive evidence of the fair market value of the land.
M. Planned Developments: Planned developments with mixed land uses shall make cash and/or land contributions in accordance with this section based
upon the percentage of land devoted to the various uses.
N. Calculation Of Cash Contributions: Cash contributions are to be calculated at the time of final subdivision approval. The council may require the
payment at the time of final subdivision approval or at a later time under terms agreed upon in the development agreement. Delayed payment shall
include interest at a rate set by the city.
O. Park Dedication Fund: Cash contributions shall be deposited in the park dedication fund and shall only be used for the acquisition of land for the
purposes set forth in subsection A of this section, and the planning and development of land for such purposes.
P. Exemption: Property being subdivided without an increase in the number of lots shall be exempt from park and trail dedication requirements if similar
requirements were satisfied in conjunction with an earlier subdivision. If the number of lots is increased, then the dedication shall be based on the
additional lots created. (Ord. 673, sec. 1, 7-17-2000)
Q. Specialized Housing Uses:
1. Independent living facilities for age restricted senior residents shall be considered the same as multiple-family residential dwellings for the purpose of
park dedication requirements based on the number of proposed units at the time of final plat approval.
2. Housing with services defined in accordance with Minnesota statutes chapters 144A and 144D as may be amended:
a. Facilities with less than 24/7 care programs shall be considered the same as multiple-family residential dwellings for the purpose of park
dedication requirements except that each dwelling unit shall be calculated for the purpose of density and/or cash fees in lieu of land paid on a per
unit basis at a rate of one equals 0.25 (1 = 0.25).
b. Facilities providing 24/7 care programs and nursing home facilities shall be exempt from park dedication requirements.
3. Facilities with a combination of senior independent living and/or various levels of housing with services shall make cash and/or land contributions in
accordance with this subsection based upon the number of units designated for the various uses. (Ord. 839, sec. 1, 5-19-2008)

from the centerline of the flow path
These buffer standards may be altered by the city's approval of a variance and the Vermillion River joint powers organization's approval of a variance.
D. Buffer Standards: The following standards apply to all required buffers adjacent to wetlands and watercourses:
1. Acceptable Vegetation: Buffers shall be staked and protected in the field prior to construction. Where acceptable natural vegetation exists in buffer
areas, the retention of such vegetation in an undisturbed state is required unless approval to replace such vegetation is received. A buffer has
acceptable vegetation if it:
a. Has a continuous, dense layer of perennial grasses that has been uncultivated or unbroken for at least five (5) consecutive years; or
b. Has an overstory of trees and/or shrubs that has been uncultivated or unbroken for at least five (5) consecutive years; or
c. Contains a mixture of the plant communities in subsections D1a and D1b of this section that has been uncultivated or unbroken for at least five (5)
years.
2. Unacceptable Vegetation: Topography or sparse vegetation that tends to channelize the flow of surface water or vegetation that is unlikely to retain
nutrients and sediment are not considered acceptable vegetation for buffer purposes.
3. Replanting Vegetation: Where buffer vegetation and conditions are unacceptable, or where approval has been obtained to replant, buffers shall be
replanted and maintained according to the following standards:
a. Buffers shall be planted with a native seed mix approved by MnDOT, BWSR, NRCS or the Dakota SWCD, with the exception of a onetime planting
with an annual nurse or cover crop. Plantings of native forbs and grasses may be substituted for seeding. All substitutions must be approved by
the city. Groupings or clusters of native trees and shrubs, of species and at densities appropriate to site conditions, shall also be planted
throughout the buffer area.
b. The seed mix and planting shall be broadcast/installed according to MnDOT, BWSR, NRCS or Dakota SWCD specifications. The selected seed
mixes and plantings for permanent cover shall be appropriate for the soil site conditions and free of invasive species.
c. Buffer vegetation (both natural and created) shall be protected by erosion and sediment control measures during construction.
d. During the first five (5) full growing seasons, except where the city has determined vegetation establishment is acceptable, the owner or applicant
must replant buffer vegetation where the vegetative cover is less than ninety percent (90%). The owner or applicant must assure reseeding or

4. Alterations Prohibited: Alterations, including building, storage, paving, routine mowing, burning, plowing, introduction of noxious vegetation, cutting,
dredging, filling, mining, dumping, grazing livestock, agricultural production, yard waste disposal, or fertilizer application are prohibited within any
buffer. Periodic mowing or burning, or the use of fertilizers and pesticides for the purpose of managing and maintaining native vegetation is allowed.
Noxious weeds may be removed and mechanical or spot herbicide treatments may be used to control noxious weeds. Aerial or broadcast spraying is
prohibited. Prohibited alterations do not include plantings that enhance the natural vegetation or selective clearing or pruning of trees or vegetation
that are dead, diseased or pose similar hazards, or as otherwise clarified in subsection D5 of this section.
5. Alterations Permitted: The following activities may be permitted within any required buffer:
a. The following activities are allowed within both the minimum and average buffer width areas:
(1) Use and maintenance of an unimproved access strip through the buffer, not more than ten feet (10') in width, for recreational access to the
major waterway or wetland and the exercise of riparian rights.
(2) Structures that exist when the buffer is created.
(3) Placement, maintenance, repair, or replacement of public roads and utility and drainage systems that exist on creation of the buffer or are
required to comply with any subdivision approval or building permit obtained from the city, so long as any adverse impacts of public road, utility,
or drainage systems on the function of the buffer have been avoided or minimized to the extent practical.
(4) Clearing, grading, and seeding is allowed if part of an approved wetland replacement plan, or approved stream restoration plan.
(5) Construction of a multipurpose trail, including boardwalks and pedestrian bridges, provided it is constructed to minimize erosion and new
impervious surface, and has an undisturbed area of vegetative buffer at least ten feet (10') in width between the trail and the wetland or public
waters wetland edge, or the bank of the major waterway; or where needed to cross the major waterway, the minimum impact alignment is used.
(6) The construction of underground utilities such as water, stormwater, and sanitary sewers and pipelines, provided the minimum impact
alignment is used and the area is stabilized.
b. The following activities are allowed within those portions of the average buffer width that exceed the minimum buffer width:

(2) The area of shallow vegetated infiltration and biofiltration facilities, and stormwater basins not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the basin area,
adjacent to wetlands and major waterways may be included in buffer averaging, provided the facilities do not encroach into the minimum buffer
width, and the land areas are stabilized. (Ord. 847, sec. 5, 11-17-2008; amd. Ord. 866, sec. 10, 5-17-2010)
E. Conservation Easement/Outlot: A conservation easement or a dedicated outlot is required for all buffer areas as part of platting and subdivision
approval, except where the buffer is located in a public transportation right of way. Buffers shall be marked to clearly designate the boundaries of all
new buffers within new residential subdivisions. A monument shall consist of a post and a buffer strip sign approved by the city. Property owned by the
city of Lakeville shall be exempted from establishing an outlot or conservation easement for required buffer areas. (Ord. 847, sec. 5, 11-17-2008)

notification. The planning commission shall conduct the hearing and report its findings and make recommendations to the city council. Notice of said
hearing shall consist of a legal property description, description of request and property location, and be published in the official newspaper at least
ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Written notification of said hearing shall be mailed at least ten (10) days prior to all property owners of land within
five hundred feet (500') of the boundary of the property in question.

exist in the review process and thus the final determination of the city council may differ from that of the planning commission, the city council may,
before taking final action, refer the matter back to the planning commission for further consideration. The city council shall provide the planning
commission with a written statement detailing the specific reasons for referral. This procedure shall be followed only one time on a singular action.
11. The city council shall make findings of fact and approve or deny a request for variance within thirty (30) days after the close of the public hearing on
the request.
12. A variance of this title shall be by four-fifths (4/5) vote of the full city council.

opinion, secure substantially the objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the adjustment or variance is granted, as to light, air, and the
public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. (Ord. 673, sec. 1, 7-17-2000)

equivalent assurance to the city and which are approved by the zoning administrator.

D. The time allowed for completion of the required improvements shall be set out in the site improvement performance agreement. The agreement and the
financial guarantee shall provide for forfeiture to the city to cure a default or reimburse the city the cost of enforcement measures. As various portions
of such required work are completed by the applicant, are in compliance with city requirements, and are approved by the city, the zoning administrator
may release such portion of the financial guarantee as is attributable to such completed work. Landscaping improvements shall not be deemed
complete until the city has verified survivability of all required plantings through one "winter season" which is defined for the purpose of this section as
the period October 31 through April 30.
E. The applicant shall notify the zoning administrator in writing when all or a portion of the required improvements have been completed in accordance with
the approved plan and may be inspected. Upon receipt of such notice, the zoning administrator shall be responsible for the inspection of the
improvements to determine that the useful life of all work performed meets the standards for the particular industry, profession, or material used in the
performance of the work. Any required work failing to meet such standards shall not be deemed to be complete and the applicant shall be notified in
writing as to required corrections. Upon determination that the work has been completed, including the winter season survivability of all landscape
improvements, a notice of the date of actual completion shall be given to the applicant and appropriate action, to release or to reduce the amount of the
financial guarantee shall be taken by the zoning administrator. (Ord. 674, sec. 1, 7-17-2000)

NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES
11-15-1: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures and uses and to specify those requirements,
circumstances and conditions under which nonconforming buildings, structures and uses will be operated and maintained. This zoning title establishes
separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of uses which are permitted in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the
establishment of these districts that nonconforming buildings, structures and uses not be permitted to continue without restriction. Furthermore, it is the
intent of this chapter that all nonconforming uses shall be eventually brought into conformity. (Ord. 674, sec. 1, 7-17-2000)
11-15-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. Conditional Uses/Interim Uses/Uses By Administrative Permit: Any legal nonconforming structure or use that is herein classified as a conditional use,
interim use, or use by administrative permit may be continued in like fashion and activity and shall automatically be considered as having received the
applicable approval. Any change to such a use, including, but not limited to, building and/or site alteration, shall however require a new permit be
processed according to this title. (Ord. 867, sec. 18, 5-17-2010)
B. Moving Nonconforming Buildings: Subject to section 11-17-25 of this title, no nonconforming building, structure or use shall be moved to another lot or
to any other part of the parcel of land upon which the same was constructed or was conducted at the time it became a legal nonconformity, unless such
movement will reduce the nonconformity. (Ord. 867, sec. 19, 5-17-2010)
C. Subdivision: No parcel of land or portion thereof shall be subdivided if such action results in buildings and/or uses becoming nonconforming. (Ord. 674,
sec. 1, 7-17-2000)
D. Continuance Of Legal Nonconformity: Any legal nonconformity, including the lawful use or occupation of land or premises existing at the time of the
adoption of an additional control under this chapter, may be continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance, or
improvement, but not including expansion, except as specifically provided in this chapter, unless:
1. The nonconformity or occupancy is discontinued for a period of more than one year; or
2. Any nonconforming use is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater than fifty percent (50%) of its market value, and no building permit
has been applied for within one hundred eighty (180) days of when the property is damaged. In this case, the city of Lakeville may impose
reasonable conditions upon a building permit in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent property.
3. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the land or premises shall be a conforming use or occupancy. (Ord. 867, sec. 20, 5-17-2010)
E. Definitions: For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall be defined as follows:
EXPANSION, ENLARGEMENT, OR INTENSIFICATION: Any increase in a dimension, size, area, volume, or height, any increase in the area of use,
any placement of a structure or part thereof where none existed before, any addition of a site feature such as a deck, patio, fence, driveway, parking
area, or swimming pool, any improvement that would allow the land to be more intensely developed, any move of operations to a new location on the
property, or any increase in intensity of use based on a review of the original nature, function or purpose of the nonconforming use, the hours of
operation, traffic, parking, noise, exterior storage, signs, exterior lighting, types of operations, types of goods or services offered, odors, area of
operation, number of employees, and other factors deemed relevant by the city.
IMPROVEMENT: Making the nonconforming use better, more efficient, or more aesthetically pleasing, including any change that does not replicate
what preexisted, but does not include an expansion, enlargement, or intensification.
REPLACEMENT, RECONSTRUCTION OR RESTORATION: Construction that exactly matches preexisting conditions. (Ord. 867, sec. 21, 5-17-2010)
11-15-5: NONCONFORMING USES:
A. Effective Date: (Rep. by Ord. 815, sec. 2, 12-18-2006)
B. Changes To Nonconforming Uses:
1. When a legal nonconforming use of any structure or parcel of land in any district has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be
changed to any nonconforming use.
2. A legal nonconforming use of a structure or parcel of land may be changed to reduce the nonconformity of use. Once a nonconforming structure or
parcel of land has been changed, it shall not thereafter be so altered to increase the nonconformity. (Ord. 867, sec. 22, 5-17-2010)

granted prior to the effective date of the amendment, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans; provided construction is started within
sixty (60) days of the effective date of the amendment, is not abandoned for a period of more than one hundred twenty (120) days, and continues to
completion within two (2) years. The structure shall thereafter be a legal nonconforming structure.
B. Alterations: Alteration and normal maintenance to a legal nonconforming building or structure may be made through the building permit process
provided:
1. The alterations do not expand the foundation and/or building size (including deck additions), unless specifically allowed by this title.

1. Administrative Approvals: Except in the environmental protection districts, the following expansions of legal nonconforming single- and two-family
residential buildings may be approved through the administrative permit process by the zoning administrator subject to the provisions of chapter 8 of
this title. The zoning administrator shall make a determination that the building expansion will comply with the intent and purpose of this chapter and
this title.
a. Expansion of principal buildings found to be nonconforming only by reason of height and yard setback may be allowed provided the expansion
complies with the performance standards of this title.
b. Expansion of nonconforming detached accessory structures shall not be allowed.
2. Conditional Use Permit: Legal nonconforming commercial, industrial, public, semipublic, and multiple-family residential principal structures may be

this chapter for a deviation from other requirements of this title unless variances are also approved.
c. The request for conditional use permit shall be evaluated based on standards and criteria set forth in subsection 11-4-3E and section 11-4-7 of this

b. The building shall be required to be faced with Grade A, B, C or D material on wall surfaces abutting public rights-of-way, a nonindustrial zoning
district, an adjacent industrial building with brick, wood, stone or decorative concrete wall surfaces, residential uses, or public areas. The required
wall surface treatment may allow a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of the metal or fiberglass wall to remain exposed if it is coordinated into the
architectural design and is similar to the building frontage.
F. Other Requirements:
1. One Grade A Material: Buildings may be constructed primarily of one (1) specific Grade A material provided the design is obviously superior to the
general intent of this title, provides variation in detailing, footprint of the structure or deviations in long wall sections to provide visual interest.

7. Definitions: For the purposes of this section, the allowed building materials or finishes shall be defined as:
ACID ETCH: A finish achieved by casting concrete against a smooth, hard surface. After removal from the form the element is allowed to harden
to a uniform hardness. The element is then washed with an acid solution and scrubbed to remove the cement surface to a sand level resulting in a
smooth, sand textured surface.
BRICK: The conventional molded rectangular block of baked clay, nominal four inch (4") width. Thin brick veneer, faux brick, or decorative brick
shall not be permitted as a building material for nonresidential structures.
BRICK FACE: A precast panel with a cavity cast in, or a plate cast in if the brick runs to the bottom of the edge so that the brick can be set in the
panel after its removal from the form.
CAST STONE: A finish achieved by ramming moist zero slump concrete against smooth rigid formwork until the product is densely compacted and
ready for removal from the form. After curing, the panel may be hand rubbed or acid etched.
EXPOSED AGGREGATE: A finish achieved by:
a. Casting against a form surface that has been painted with retarder that retards the set of the concrete at its surface.
b. Application of a chemical retarder to the surface of the form. The retarder prevents the matrix from hardening at the surface of the panel to a
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 262/480
specific depth, controlled by the strength of the retarder. After curing, the unhardened layer of matrix at the surface of the panel is removed by a
high pressure water washing, thus, exposing the aggregate used in the concrete.
c. Casting concrete against a smooth hard surface. After removal from the form, the finished surface is sandblasted to remove the matrix and
expose, as well as etch, the coarse aggregate.
FORM LINERS: A finish achieved by the use of plaster, rubber, grained wood, rope or other material as a liner in the casting form to impart a
particular finish to the face of the panel.
LIGHT SANDBLAST: A finish achieved by casting concrete against a smooth, hard surface. After removal from the form, the element is given a
light sandblasting removing the cement skin from the surface resulting in a smooth, sand textured surface.
NATURAL STONE VENEER: A finish achieved by placing natural stone pieces into a form and casting concrete behind it resulting in a precast
panel having a natural stone face.
SMOOTH AS CAST: Concrete placed against a hard, smooth formwork to achieve a smooth "as cast" finish on the precast element.
TOOLED: A finish achieved by casting concrete against a smooth or specifically textured or patterned formwork. After removal from the form, the
hardened surface is treated mechanically to create the desired effect such as "fractured fin" or "bush hammered". (Ord. 867, sec. 30, 5-17-2010)
8. Painting Brick Or Stone: Grade A brick or stone exteriors of multiple family residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional buildings shall not be
painted during the life of the exterior materials. (Ord. 996, 5-7-2018)
9. Accessory Structures:

residential dwelling units shall be constructed with a design and exterior building materials consistent with the general character of the principal
structure on the lot.
b. Accessory buildings for nonresidential uses, including those allowed in the residential districts, shall be of a similar character, design, and facade
as the principal structure.
10. Expansions:
a. Remodeling or maintenance of existing buildings that do not increase the floor area of the existing structure shall be regulated by chapter 15 of
this title.
b. Additions of less than fifty percent (50%) of the floor area of the existing building may use the same or higher grade materials as the existing
structure.
c. Not more than one exterior wall designed for removal to allow future building expansion may be allowed to use grade D materials notwithstanding
other applicable provisions of this section provided that the wall does not face a public street.
G. Exceptions: Exceptions to the provisions of this section may be granted as a conditional use subject to the following criteria:
1. The use is an essential service as defined by this title; or

SIGNS
11-23-1: FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND EFFECT:
A. Findings: The city finds:
1. Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and quality of the environment.
2. Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages.
3. Signs can create traffic hazards and aesthetic concerns, thereby threatening the public health, safety and welfare.
4. The city's zoning regulations have, since as early as 1970, included the regulation of signs in an effort to provide adequate means of expression and
to promote the economic viability of the business community, while protecting the city and its citizens from a proliferation of signs of a type, size,
location and character that would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and threaten the health, safety and welfare of the
community. The regulation of the physical characteristics of signs within the city has had a positive impact on traffic safety and the appearance of the
community.
B. Purpose And Intent: It is not the purpose or intent of this sign ordinance to regulate the message displayed on any sign; nor is it the purpose or intent of
this chapter to regulate any building design or any display not defined as a sign, or any sign which cannot be viewed from outside a building. The
purpose and intent of this chapter is to:
1. Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination and other physical characteristics of signs within the city in order to promote the public health,
safety and welfare.
2. Maintain, enhance and improve the aesthetic environment of the city by preventing visual clutter that is harmful to the appearance of the community.
3. Improve the visual appearance of the city while providing for effective means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees and the
city's goals of public safety and aesthetics.
4. Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations set forth herein under the zoning authority of the city.
C. Effect: A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed or maintained in the city if it is in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. The effect of this
chapter, as more specifically set forth herein, is to:
1. Allow a wide variety of sign types in commercial zones, and a more limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards set forth in this
sign ordinance.
2. Allow certain small, unobtrusive signs incidental to the principal use of a site in all zones when in compliance with the requirements of this sign
ordinance.
3. Prohibit signs whose location, size, type, illumination or other physical characteristics negatively affect the environment and where the
communication can be accomplished by means having a lesser impact on the environment and the public health, safety and welfare.
4. Provide for the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this sign ordinance. (Ord. 816, sec. 4, 2-5-2007)
11-23-3: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this sign ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remaining portions of this sign ordinance. The City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted the sign ordinance in each
section, subsection, sentence, or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases be
declared invalid. (Ord. 816, sec. 4, 2-5-2007)
11-23-5: PERMIT REQUIRED:
No sign shall be erected or existing sign structure expanded without first securing a permit from the City, except when changing only the face of the sign
without altering the area, height or location of the sign.

including wireless equipment within public rights of way under the jurisdiction of the city. The city holds the rights of way within its geographical
boundaries as an asset in trust for its citizens. The city strives to keep its rights of way in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary
encumbrances. The uncontrolled and unregulated placement of telecommunication equipment in the right of way may cause obstruction to pedestrian
and vehicular traffic; thereby endangering the public health and safety. This section establishes the minimum requirements for locating
telecommunication facilities within the city's public rights of way in a manner that does not jeopardize the public health, safety and general welfare.
B. Administrative Permit Required: The placement of any telecommunication equipment in the public right of way shall require an administrative permit

search radius, subject to the criteria and standards provided in section 11-30-3 of this chapter.
e. Wireless antennas and equipment located in the right of way abutting residentially zoned property shall be prohibited, unless the applicant
demonstrates by providing a coverage or capacity analysis prepared by a professional engineer that location of the antennas as proposed is
necessary to meet the frequency reuse and spacing needs of the wireless system and to provide adequate coverage and capacity to areas which
cannot be adequately served by locating the antennas in the right of way abutting a less restrictive zoning district.

4. The zoning administrator may deny a permit or attach conditions to the permit approval to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right of way, or when necessary to protect the right of way and its users. The
zoning administrator may consider one or more of the following factors:
a. The extent to which right of way space where the permit is sought is available.
b. The competing demands for the particular space in the right of way.
c. The availability of other locations in the right of way or in other rights of way for the equipment of the permit application.
d. The preservation of the right of way for uses that, due to their physical nature, do not have the option of locating on private property.

PUD, PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
11-96-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the PUD district is to provide comprehensive procedures and standards intended to allow flexibility in the development of residential
neighborhoods and/or nonresidential areas than would be possible under a conventional zoning district. The decision to zone property to PUD is a public
policy decision for the city council to make in its legislative capacity. The intent of this chapter is to:
A. Provide for the establishment of PUD districts in appropriate settings and situations to create or maintain a development pattern that complies with the
comprehensive plan.
B. Allow for the mixing of land uses within a development when such mixing of land uses could not otherwise be accomplished under this title.
C. Provide for variations to the strict application of the land use regulations in this title in order to improve site design and operation, while at the same time
incorporating design elements (e.g., construction materials, landscaping, lighting, etc.) that exceed the city's standards to offset the effect of any
variations.
D. Promote a more creative and efficient approach to land use within the city, while at the same time protecting and promoting the health, safety, comfort,
aesthetics, economic viability, and general welfare of the city.
E. Preserve and enhance natural features and open spaces.
F. Maintain or improve the efficiency of public streets and utilities.
G. Ensure the establishment of appropriate transitions between differing land uses. (Ord. 867, sec. 116, 5-17-2010)

FP, FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT
11-101-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE:
The legislature of the state has, in Minnesota statutes chapters 103F and 462, as may be amended, delegated the responsibility to local government units
to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city does ordain as follows:
A. Findings Of Fact:
1. Periodic Inundation: The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures on flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
2. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards: This chapter is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the
standards established by the Minnesota department of natural resources.
3. National Flood Insurance Program Compliance: This chapter is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the national flood insurance
program codified as 44 code of federal regulations parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the national flood
insurance program.
B. Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described
in subsection A of this section by provisions contained herein. (Ord. 883, 9-19-2011)
11-101-3: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
This chapter does not imply that areas outside the FP floodplain overlay district boundaries or land uses allowed within this district will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages which
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 883, 9-19-2011)
11-101-5: DISTRICT APPLICATION:
The FP, floodplain overlay district shall be applied to and superimposed upon all districts as existing or amended by the text and map of this chapter. The
FP, floodplain overlay district regulations shall not be construed to allow any use or structure otherwise not allowed in the underlying zoning district where
the property is located. The regulations and requirements imposed by the FP floodplain overlay district shall be in addition to those established by all other
districts of this title. The FP floodplain overlay district shall be established based upon the specific information contained in the flood insurance rate map
and the flood insurance study for the city as adopted in subsection 11-101-7B of this chapter. All aforementioned official road maps and documents are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be an integral part of this chapter. (Ord. 883, 9-19-2011)
11-101-7: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. Lands To Which This Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the official zoning map and the
flood insurance rate map attached thereto as being located within the boundaries of the floodway, flood fringe, or general floodplain districts.
B. Establishment Of Official Zoning Map:
1. Adoption: The official zoning map together with all materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
chapter. The attached material shall include the "Flood Insurance Study For Dakota County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas", flood insurance
rate map panels therein numbered 27037C0179E, 27037C0183E, 27037C0184E, 27037C0191E, 27037C0192E, 27037C0193E, 27037C0194E,

index (map numbers 27037CIND1A, 27037CIND3A and 27037CIND4A), all dated December 2, 2011, and prepared by the federal emergency
management agency. The official zoning map shall be on file in the office of the city clerk and the zoning administrator.
C. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot (1') above the elevation of
the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of floodway.
D. Regional Flood Elevation For Lakes: The regional flood elevation for lakes shall be as defined in the current "Flood Insurance Study For Dakota County,
Minnesota And Incorporated Areas" or the Lakeville water resources management plan, as amended to reference the NAVD88 vertical datum, for those
lakes for which no base flood elevation has been determined. These elevations are as follows:
Lake Regional Flood Elevation
Crystal Lake 936.1
Goose Lake 1,083.8
Kingsley Lake 982.5
Lake Marion 984.6
Lee Lake 953.2
Orchard Lake 978.5

E. Rules For Interpretation Of District Boundaries:
1. The boundaries of the floodplain overlay district shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map.
2. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official zoning map, as for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the city engineer shall make the necessary interpretation.
3. The decision of the city engineer will be based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at
the time the city adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the date of the first national flood insurance program map showing the area in the
floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data.
4. The persons appealing the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case and to submit their own
technical evidence if they so desire in accordance with chapter 7 of this title.
F. Annexation: The flood insurance rate map adopted by reference may include floodplain areas that lie outside the boundaries of the city as of December
2, 2011. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed to the city after December 2, 2011, the newly annexed floodplain lands shall be subject to the
provisions of this chapter immediately upon the date of annexation. (Ord. 883, 9-19-2011)
11-101-9: ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS:
A. Floodway Subdistricts: The area within the FP floodplain overlay district is further divided into three (3) districts:
1. FW, Floodway District: The floodway district shall include those areas designated as floodway on the flood insurance rate map adopted in subsection
11-101-7B of this chapter.
2. FF, Flood Fringe District: The flood fringe district shall include those areas designated as floodway fringe on the flood insurance rate map adopted in
subsection 11-101-7B of this chapter as being within zone AE but being located outside of the floodway.
3. GFD, General Floodplain District: The general floodplain district shall include those areas designated as zone A and zone AE without a floodway on
the flood insurance rate map adopted in subsection 11-101-7B of this chapter.
B. Compliance: No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be constructed, located, extended, converted, or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter. Within
the FW, floodway; FF, flood fringe; and GFD, general floodplain districts, all uses not listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in sections 11-101-11,
11-101-13 and 11-101-15 of this chapter, shall be prohibited. In addition:
1. New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain recreational vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this chapter
and specifically section 11-101-21 of this chapter.
2. Modifications, additions, structural alterations, normal maintenance and repair or repair after damage to existing nonconforming structures and
nonconforming uses of structures or land are regulated by the general provisions of this chapter and specifically, section 11-101-29 of this chapter.
3. As built elevations for elevated or floodproofed structures must be certified by ground surveys and floodproofing techniques must be designed and
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as specified in the general provisions of this chapter and specifically as stated in
subsection 11-101-23G of this chapter. (Ord. 883, 9-19-2011)
11-101-11: FW, FLOODWAY DISTRICT:
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 462/480

5. Public utilities, sanitary sewer, public water, storm sewer, and street and bridge improvements.
B. Standards For Floodway Permitted Uses:
1. The use shall have a low flood damage potential.
2. The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and shall not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of
materials or equipment.
C. Permitted Accessory Uses: None.
D. Conditional Uses:
1. Structures accessory to the uses listed in subsection A of this section, and the uses listed in subsections D2 through D8 of this section.
2. Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials.
3. Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water control structures.
4. Railroads, utility transmission lines, and pipelines.

6. Placement of fill and construction of fences that obstruct flood flows.
7. Recreational vehicles either on individual lots of record or in existing or new subdivisions or commercial or condominium type campgrounds, subject
to the exemptions and provisions of subsection 11-101-21C of this chapter.
8. Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual structures
and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the 10-year frequency flood
event.
E. Standards For Floodway Conditional Uses:
1. All Uses: Except in areas designated for stormwater management and deeded in drainage and utility easements or as outlots to the city, no structure
(temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be
allowed as a conditional use which, acting alone or in combination with existing or anticipated future uses, adversely affect the capacity of the
floodway, or increase flood heights. Consideration of the effects of a proposed use shall be based upon the reasonable assumption that there will be
an equal degree of encroachment extending for a significant reach on both sides of the stream. All conditional use applications shall be accompanied
by a floodway impact statement drafted by a registered professional engineer. The city engineer shall be responsible for submitting the proposal and
application to the department of natural resources and any other governmental unit having jurisdiction over the area for review and comment.
2. Fill:
a. Fill, dredge spoil and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching,
riprap or other acceptable method.
b. Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a long term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
c. As an alternative, and consistent with subsection E2b of this section, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary,
on site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the city
council has approved an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time
available. The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the office of the county recorder.
3. Accessory Structures:
a. Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
b. Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of
floodwaters.
(1) Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow.
(2) So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
c. Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in
the state building code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification in the state
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 463/480
building code provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed five hundred (500) square feet in size at its
largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All
floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards:
(1) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; and
(2) Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
floodproofed.
(3) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two (2) automatic openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be
openings on at least two (2) sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot (1') above the lowest adjacent
grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
4. Storage Of Materials And Equipment:
a. The storage or processing of materials that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant
life, is prohibited.
b. Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or readily
movable from the area within the time available after a flood warning in accordance with a plan approved by the city council.
5. Garbage And Solid Waste Disposal: No conditional use permits for garbage and waste disposal sites shall be issued for floodway areas. There shall
be no further encroachment upon the floodway at existing sites.
6. Structural Works:
a. Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the
applicable provisions of Minnesota statutes chapter 103G. Communitywide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the
regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
b. A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must
assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
7. Floodway Alterations And Filling:
a. Any floodway alteration or filling shall not cause a net decrease in flood storage capacity below the regulatory flood protection elevation unless it is
shown that the proposed alteration or filling, together with an equal degree of flood storage reduction on all other land in the affected reach of the
water body or watercourse, will not cause high water or aggravate flooding on other land and will not unduly restrict flood flows.
b. Any alteration or filling that alters floodplain boundaries, including bridge crossings and/or regional ponds, and increases the regional flood level
due to an encroachment or obstruction in the floodway may be allowed provided that:
(1) The applicant submits easements or other documentation in a form acceptable to the city demonstrating and recording the consent of the
owner of any land affected by the increase in the regional flood level;
(2) The upstream impacts, riparian impacts and habitat impacts of the proposed action are analyzed and no detrimental impacts result, or adverse
impacts are mitigated;
(3) The action is consistent with this chapter and state and federal regulations and a conditional and final letter of map revision is approved from
the federal emergency management agency.
8. Drainage And Utility Easements: Drainage and utility easements shall be dedicated over areas in the floodway below the regulatory flood protection
elevation of any water body, watercourse, or wetland or deeded to the city in an outlot in conjunction with subdivision of the land. (Ord. 883, 9-19-
2011)
11-101-13: FF, FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT:
A. Permitted Uses: Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s). If no
preexisting, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in
the flood fringe district provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood fringe
district "permitted uses" listed in subsection B of this section and the "standards for all flood fringe uses" listed in subsection E of this section.
B. Standards For Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
1. Elevation: All principal and accessory structures shall be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor (including basement) is at or above the regulatory
flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot (1') below the regulatory flood protection elevation
and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least fifteen feet (15') beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon. For detached residential
accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed five hundred (500) square feet at its largest projection, the fill shall
extend at such elevation at least five feet (5') beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
2. Accessory Structures: As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed five
hundred (500) square feet at its largest projection may be internally floodproofed in accordance with subsection 11-101-11E3c of this chapter.
3. Storage: The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
C. Conditional Uses: Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with subsections B1 and B2 of this section or any use of land
that does not comply with the standards in subsection B3 of this section shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a conditional
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 464/480
use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in subsections D and E of this section and section 11-101-27 of
this chapter.
D. Standards For Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:
1. Structural Floodproofing Standards: Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above
the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above grade,
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above grade and not a
structure's basement or lowest floor if:
a. The enclosed area is above grade on at least one side of the structure;
b. Is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and
c. Is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following
additional standards:
(1) Design And Certification: The structure's design and as built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as
being in compliance with the general design standards of the state building code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed
to prevent floodwater from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
(2) Specific Standards For Above Grade, Enclosed Areas: Above grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
(A) A minimum area of automatic openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a
minimum of two (2) openings on at least two (2) sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1') above
grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be
equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters
without any form of human intervention; and
(B) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the state building
code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.
2. Basements: Basements as defined in section 11-2-3 of this title shall be subject to the following:
a. Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
b. Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in
accordance with subsection D3 of this section.
3. Nonresidential Structures: All areas of nonresidential structures including basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the state building code. Structurally dry floodproofing must
meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the state building code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.
4. Erosion Control: When at any one time more than one thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such
activities as on site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an
erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the respective floodplain area falls within a designated shoreland overlay district and
shoreland regulations will be applied. In the absence of a state approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to
stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineering or other qualified individual acceptable to the governing body. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal
of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
5. Storage Of Materials And Equipment:
a. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is
prohibited.
b. Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in
accordance with a plan approved by the city council.
E. Standards For All Flood Fringe Uses:
1. Vehicular Access: All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet (2') below the regulatory
flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the board of adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or
occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response
procedures exist.
2. Commercial Uses: Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a
flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying
the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four (4) upon occurrence of the regional flood.
3. Manufacturing And Industrial Uses: Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having
protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
subsection E2 of this section. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires
that it be located in floodplain areas.
7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 465/480
4. Fill For Construction: Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other
acceptable method. The federal emergency management agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area
designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill
compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
5. Flood Capacity: Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary
watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map.
6. Waste Treatment And Waste Disposal:
a. No new construction, addition, or modification to existing waste treatment facilities shall be permitted within the flood fringe unless emergency
plans and procedures for action to be taken in the event of flooding are prepared, filed with, and approved by the Minnesota pollution control
agency. The emergency plans and procedures must provide for measures to prevent introduction of any pollutant or toxic material into the
floodwaters.

11-101-15: GFD, GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT:
A. Permitted Uses:
1. The uses listed as permitted uses in section 11-101-11 of this chapter are permitted uses in the general floodplain district.
2. All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria pursuant to subsection B of this section. Section 11-101-11 of this
chapter shall apply if the proposed use is in the floodway district and section 11-101-13 of this chapter shall apply if the proposed use is in the flood
fringe district.
B. Procedures For Floodway And Flood Fringe Determinations Within The General Floodplain District: Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other
approval within the GFD district:
1. The applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary for the determination of the regulatory flood
protection elevation and whether the proposed use is in the FW, floodway or the FF, flood fringe district:
a. Typical valley cross section(s) showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross sectional areas
to be occupied by the proposed development, high water information and peak discharge of the regional flood as identified in the Lakeville water
resources management plan.
b. Plan (surface view) showing the nature, locations, dimensions, and elevation of the lot, contours of the ground, fill; storage of materials;
floodproofing measures; the arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site; locations and elevations of streets; existing and
proposed utilities, septic tanks or water wells; existing land uses and vegetation upstream and downstream; soil type, and the relationship of the
above to the location of the channel.
c. Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and downstream, and soil types.
d. Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least five hundred feet (500') in either direction from the
proposed development.
2. The city engineer shall determine whether the proposed use is located within a floodway or flood fringe area by computing the floodway necessary to
convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 feet. A lesser stage increase than 0.5 feet shall be required if, as a
result of the additional stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within
the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. Upon such determination, the applicable conditions, provisions and restrictions shall
be imposed.
3. Procedures consistent with Minnesota regulations 1983, parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 code of federal regulations part 65 shall be followed by
the city engineer in this evaluation. (Ord. 883, 9-19-2011)
11-101-17: SUBDIVISIONS:
A. Review Criteria: No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment
facilities. All lots within the floodplain districts shall be able to contain a building site outside of the floodway district at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this title and have road access
both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet (2') below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions
in the floodplain, the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access
roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
B. Floodway/Flood Fringe Determinations In The General Floodplain District: In the general floodplain district, applicants shall provide the information
required in subsection 11-101-15B of this chapter to determine the 100-year flood elevation, the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries and the
regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site.
C. Removal Of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation: FEMA has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain
structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope
protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments.

D. Easements: Flood storage, flowage and drainage easements shall be dedicated over areas in the floodway below the regulatory flood protection
elevation of any water body, watercourse, or wetland or deeded to the city in an outlot in conjunction with the subdivision of land. (Ord. 883, 9-19-2011)
11-101-19: PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, STREETS, AND BRIDGES:
A. Public Utilities: All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain shall be
floodproofed in accordance with the state building code or elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation and comply with the following
setbacks:
1. Where a watercourse has a sinuous flow pattern and a meander belt can be identified, the setback for new underground utilities shall be set back
fifteen feet (15') from the outer edge of the meander belt.
2. Where a sinuous flow pattern and meander belt are not readily identifiable because of past channel alterations and/or the geomorphology of the
channel, the setback established for new underground utilities shall provide for the potential for restoration and a sinuous flow pattern as follows:
a. Where there are existing encroachments that limit full restoration of the watercourse to the meander widths appropriate for the watercourse type,
the setback shall be fifteen feet (15') from the reasonably achievable restoration width as determined by the city engineer for the meander belt
given the existing encroachments.
b. Where full restoration is possible, the setback shall be fifteen feet (15') from a meander belt width defined as ten (10) times the bankfull channel
width. The bankfull channel width of a stream, creek, or river is its width at bankfull stage; the water level in a watercourse where the flow just
begins to leave the main channel and enter the active floodplain.
c. An assessment of the watercourse type may be completed, and meander belt widths established according to the stream type, in place of using
the above formula as approved by the city engineer.
3. Utilities that require reaching or crossing the watercourse, are exempted from this section provided the minimum impact alignment is used.
B. Public Transportation Facilities: Railroad tracks, streets, and bridges to be located within the FW floodway and FF flood fringe districts shall comply with
this chapter. All railroad tracks, streets, bridges, and major transportation facilities must be constructed at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are
essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Local streets or minor railroads may be constructed at an elevation two feet (2') below the regulatory
flood protection elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety.

7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 468/480
A. Requirements: In addition to the procedures and requirements for amendments and variances as established in chapters 3 and 6 of this title, the
commissioner of natural resources shall be given at minimum ten (10) days' notice of any public hearing, and a review and written report must be
obtained from the Minnesota department of natural resources and any other governmental body or commission having jurisdiction for such changes,
additions or modifications affecting an FP, floodplain overlay district. The commissioner of natural resources shall be advised in writing of all decisions
made regarding variances and amendments within ten (10) days of the final decision.
B. Minimum Standards: No variance or amendment shall have the effect of allowing a prohibited use within an FP district, permit a lesser degree of flood
protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation, and/or permit standards lower than those required under applicable state law.
C. Amendments:
1. The floodplain designation on the official zoning map shall not be removed from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in
error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the
floodplain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the commissioner of natural resources if he determines that, through other measures,
lands are adequately protected for the intended use.
2. Changes in the official zoning map must meet the FEMA technical conditions and criteria and must receive prior FEMA approval before adoption.
The commissioner of natural resources must be given ten (10) days' written notice of all hearings to consider an amendment to this chapter and said
notice shall include a draft of the amendment or technical study under consideration.
D. Variances:
1. In addition to the criteria established by section 11-6-5 of this title, the variance criteria of the federal emergency management agency must be
satisfied:
a. Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
b. Variances shall only be issued by a community upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause,
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
c. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
2. The zoning administrator shall notify the applicant for a variance that: a) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage, and b) such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such
notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. A community shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification
for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its annual or biannual report submitted to the administrator of the national flood insurance
program. (Ord. 883, 9-19-2011)

7/1/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=418 478/480
4. Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by owners of dwelling units or sites.
5. The appearance of open space areas, including topography, vegetation, and allowable uses, shall be preserved by use of restrictive deed
covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and permanent means.
6. The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks, shall be included as open space. At least fifty percent (50%) of the shore impact zone
area of existing developments or at least seventy percent (70%) of the shore impact zone area of new developments must be preserved in its natural
or existing state.
D. Residential Density Evaluation:
1. Procedures And Standards: Proposed new or expansions to existing planned shoreland developments shall be evaluated using the following
procedures and standards to determine the suitable area for the dwelling unit/dwelling site density evaluation in subsection D2 of this section.
a. The project parcel shall be divided into tiers by locating one or more lines approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high water
level at the following intervals, proceeding landward:
SHORELAND TIER DIMENSIONS
Unsewered
(Feet)
Sewered
(Feet)
Recreational development lakes 267 267
Natural environment lakes 400 320
All rivers 300 300
b. The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high water level
of public waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are then subjected to the residential planned shoreland development density
evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites.
2. Residential Base Density Evaluation: The procedures for determining the base density and density increase multipliers are as follows. Allowable
densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier further from the water body, but must not be transferred to any other tier closer.
a. Formula: The suitable area within each tier is divided by the single residential lot size standard for lakes and rivers. Proposed locations and
numbers of dwelling units or sites for the residential planned shoreland developments are then compared with the tier, density, and suitability
analysis herein and the design criteria in this subsection D.
b. Increases: Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities previously determined are allowable if the dimensional standards for the
various zoning districts established by chapter 45 of this title are met or exceeded and the design criteria in this subsection D are satisfied. The
allowable density increases in subsection D2c of this section will only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high water level are
increased to at least fifty percent (50%) greater than the minimum setback, or the impact on the water body is reduced an equivalent amount
through vegetative management, topography, or additional means acceptable to the local unit of government and the setback is at least twenty five
percent (25%) greater than the minimum setback.
c. Allowable Dwelling Unit Or Dwelling Site Density Increases For Residential Planned Shoreland Developments:
Density Evaluation Tiers Within Each Tier
First 50 percent
Second 100 percent
Third 200 percent
Fourth 200 percent
Fifth 200 percent
d. Residential Shoreland Density Reserve:
(1) The change in classification of that portion of Lake Marion from recreational development to natural environment described in subsection 11-
102-9C of this chapter results in a net decrease in potential development density of two hundred nine (209) dwelling units.
(2) Subject to establishment of a PUD district as set forth by chapter 96 of this title and the criteria established by this section, the city may transfer
based on policies of the comprehensive plan at its discretion and without inference that such transfer is allowed by right not more than two
hundred nine (209) dwelling units from the shoreland overlay district of Lake Marion to other recreational development, natural environment or
tributary shoreland overlay district areas within the city identified in section 11-102-9 of this chapter.
(3) Development of a lot or lots receiving density transferred from the density reserve shall comply with all regulations established by this chapter
specifically and the zoning ordinance generally unless exempted by this section or other provisions of this title.
(4) The transfer of dwelling units from the density reserve shall be in addition to the density allowed by the evaluation provided for by this
subsection D subject to compliance with the requirements for density increases in subsection D2b of this section.
(5) The zoning administrator shall maintain a record of approved dwelling unit transfers from the density reserve and provide notices to the DNR as
required by section 11-102-27 of this chapter.

E. Erosion Control And Stormwater Management: Erosion control and stormwater management plans shall be prepared for all planned shoreland
developments and shall be consistent with subsection 11-102-17G of this chapter.
F. Centralization And Design Of Facilities: Centralization and design of facilities and structures shall be done according to the following standards:
1. Dwelling units or sites shall be clustered into one or more groups and located on suitable areas of the development. They shall be designed and
located to meet or exceed the following dimensional standards for the relevant shoreland classification. Setback from the ordinary high water level,
elevation above the surface water features, and maximum height. Setbacks from the ordinary high water level shall be increased in accordance with
subsection D2 of this section for developments with density increases.
2. Structures, parking areas, and other facilities shall be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from the public waters and adjacent shorelands by
vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color, or other means acceptable to the local unit of government, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
Vegetative and topographic screening shall be preserved, if existing, or may be required to be provided.
3. Accessory structures and facilities shall meet the required principal structure setback and must be centralized.
G. Evaluation Of Factors: The following factors are carefully evaluated to ensure that the increased density of development is consistent with the resource
limitations of the public water:
1. Suitability of the site for the proposed use.
2. Physical and aesthetic impact of increased density.
3. Level of current development.
4. Amount of ownership of undeveloped shoreland.
5. Levels and types of water surface use and public access.
6. Possible effects on overall public use.
H. Facilities: Any recreational or community facility allowed as part of the planned shoreland development conforms to all applicable federal and state
regulations including, but not limited to, the following:
1. Waste disposal regulations.
2. Water supply regulations.
3. Building codes.
4. Safety regulations.
5. Regulations concerning the appropriate use of "public waters" as defined in Minnesota statutes section 103G.245.
6. Applicable regulations of the Minnesota environmental quality board.
7. Storm sewer.
I. Alteration Approval: The final planned shoreland development shall not be modified or altered in any way without written approval from the department of
natural resources.
J. Central Shoreline Facilities: Planned shoreland developments incorporating shoreline recreational facilities such as beaches, docks, or boat launching
facilities, etc., shall be designed such that said facilities are centralized for common utilization. (Ord. 867, sec. 118, 5-17-2010)
11-102-23: VARIANCES:
Variances may be granted by the city council upon application as required in chapter 6 of this title in extraordinary cases, but only when the proposed use
is determined to be in the public interest and no variance shall be granted which the council determines will or has a tendency to:
A. Result in the placement of an artificial obstruction which will restrict the passage of storm and flood water in such a manner as to increase the height of
flooding, except obstructions approved by the watershed districts in conjunction with sound floodplain management.
B. Result in incompatible land uses or which would be detrimental to the protection of surface and ground water supplies.
C. Be not in keeping with land use plans and planning objectives for the city or which will increase or cause damage to life or property.
D. Be inconsistent with the objectives of encouraging land uses compatible with the preservation of the natural landforms, vegetation and the marshes and
wetlands within the city.
E. No permit or variance shall be issued unless the applicant has submitted a shoreland impact plan as required and set forth in this chapter. In granting
any variance, the council may attach such conditions as they deem necessary to ensure compliance with the purpose and intent of this chapter. (Ord.
