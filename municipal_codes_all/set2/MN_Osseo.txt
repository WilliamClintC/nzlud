codes, titles, chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the
“city code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,” “codified

      (1)   AND or OR.  Either conjunction shall include the other
as if written “and/or,” whenever the context requires.



      (2)   Acts by assistants.  When a statute, code provision, or

well may do as the principal, that requisition shall be satisfied by the
performance of the act by an authorized agent or deputy.



      (3)   Gender; singular and plural; tenses.  Words denoting
the masculine gender shall be deemed to include the feminine and neuter
genders; words in the singular shall include the plural, and words in the

enumeration of terms is not to be limited to the class enumerated unless
expressly so limited.

different meaning.

at any time.  If not sooner rescinded, every emergency regulation shall

repair, or adjustment of any meter is necessary because of damage from hot
water backup, damage from freezing water, or damage from any act,
carelessness, or negligence of the owner or occupants of any premises, any
expense incurred by the city to repair that damage shall be charged against
and collected from the water user, and water service may be discontinued
until the cause is corrected and the amount charged collected.



      (4)   Testing of meters.  When a user makes a complaint that
the bill for any past services has been excessive, the city shall, upon
written request, have the meter re-read.  If the user remains dissatisfied
and desires that the meter be tested, the user shall then make a deposit and
the city shall test the meter.  The amount of the deposit shall be
established by the Council by resolution from time to time.  The user shall,
if he or she so desires, be present when the test is made.  In case a test
should show an error of more than 5% higher than actual usage, the deposit
will be refunded to the user, and a correctly registering meter will be
installed.  In case the test shows an accurate measurement of water or an
error of 5% or less higher than actual usage, the amount deposited shall be
retained by the city to cover the expenses of making the test.



      (5)   Meters are city property. All water meters shall be and
remain the property of the city, and may be removed or replaced or changed as
to size and type by the city whenever deemed necessary.  The city shall
notify the owner of a property if it deems it necessary to replace or change
the property’s water meter, and shall schedule an appointment with the
owner or resident or manager of the property to enter the property and
replace or change the water meter.  If a property owner fails to respond to
such notice, the city shall send a second notice, certified mail - return
receipt requested, to the owner giving the owner 30 days to schedule the
appointment for replacing or changing the water meter.  If the owner fails
to respond to such second notice within the time allowed, then a surcharge of
$75 per quarter shall be charged to such owner’s account, continuing until
such owner’s water meter has been replaced or changed.

MS4 or waters of the state.  If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
state, or to minimize danger to persons.



      (2)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. 
Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this section may have their
MS4 access terminated if the termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge.  The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of
its MS4 access.

additional duties as defined by state and federal law.



      (3)   The city has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.  All devices used
to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy per manufacturer's recommendations.



      (4)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with
this section or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance
of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.



   (J)   Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater
pollutants by the use of best management practices.  Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit shall be deemed compliant with
the provisions of this section.  The city will adopt requirements
identifying BMPs for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm sewer
system, or waters of the state.  The owner or operator of the activity,
operation or facility shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the storm sewer system or waters of the state through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs.  These BMPs shall be part of a
stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the NPDES permit.  Any person responsible for a property or
premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at their expense, additional BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the city's MS4.



   (K)   Watercourse protection.  Every person owning property through
which a watercourse passes, or the person's lessee, shall keep and maintain
that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris,
excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or
significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse.  In
addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned
structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that the structures will
not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the
watercourse.



   (L)   Notification of spills.  Notwithstanding other requirements
of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or
responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has
information of any known or suspected release of materials which are
resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into
the storm sewer system, or waters of the state, this person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of a
release.  In the event of a release of hazardous materials this person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services.  In the event of a release of non-hazardous
materials, this person shall notify the city in person or by phone or
facsimile no later than the next business day.  Notifications in person or
by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the
city within three business days of the phone notice.  If the discharge of
prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of the establishment shall also retain an on-site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence.  The records shall be retained for at least three years.



   (M)   Enforcement.



      (1)   Notice of violation.  Whenever the city finds that a

§ 90.01  POLICY.



   (A)   The city deems it necessary to provide for the regulation of
alarm systems which are designed to signal the presence of a hazard requiring
urgent attention to which public safety personnel are expected to respond, in
order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.



   (B)   The Council finds that the regulation of alarms is necessary
in order to reduce the increasing frequency of false alarms in the city. 
The great number of and increasing frequency of these false alarms requires
intensive, time-consuming efforts by the Police Department and Fire
Department and thereby distracts from and reduces the level of the ability of
the city to promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the
community.  In consideration for the necessity on the part of the city to
provide numerous public safety services to all segments of the community,
without an undue concentration of public services in one area to work to the
detriment of members of the general public, it is hereby decided that the
alarm systems shall be regulated through the permit process described below.



(1997 Code, § 40.01)



§ 90.02  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   ALARM SYSTEM.  An assembly of equipment and devices (or a single
device such as a solid state unit) arranged to signal the presence of a
hazard.  For the purposes of this chapter the ALARM, when triggered, must be
directly connected to a central monitoring agency which then notifies the
Police and/or Fire Department of an emergency to which public safety
personnel must respond, or may emit an audible signal which will require
urgent attention and to which public safety personnel are expected to respond.



   ALARM USER.  The person, firm, partnership, association, corporation,
company, or organization of any kind on whose premises an alarm system is
maintained.  ALARM USER shall include persons occupying dwelling units for
residential purposes.  ALARM USER shall not include persons maintaining
alarm systems in automobiles.



   FALSE ALARM.  The activation of an alarm system through mechanical
failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the owner
or lessee of an alarm system or of his or her employees or agents.  It does
not include activation of the alarm by climatic conditions such as tornadoes,
lightning, earthquakes, other violent conditions of nature, or any other
conditions which are clearly beyond the control of the alarm manufacturer,
installer, or owner.



   PERSON.  Any individual, partnership, corporation, association,
cooperative, or other entity.



(1997 Code, § 40.02)



§ 90.03  PERMITS; ISSUANCE; EXEMPTIONS.



   (A)   Permits.  Every alarm user who, within a 12-month period,
incurs more than two false alarms shall be required to obtain an alarm user
permit.



   (B)   Review of permit.  The Chief of Police, Fire Chief, or
Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer shall review the issuance of all police and
fire alarm permits, respectively.



   (C)   Process for issuance of permit.  Upon receipt and
determination of the third false police or fire alarm report at an address
within a 12-month period, the Chief of Police or Fire Chief, after review,
shall notify the Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer who shall then assess the
alarm user for an alarm user’s permit.  The assessment invoice shall be
sent by certified mail.  The alarm user must submit the required permit fee
to the Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer within ten working days after receipt of
the assessment invoice in order to continue to use his or her alarm system. 
Any subsequent false police or fire alarms at that address within a period of
12 months from the date of issuance of the permit shall automatically revoke
the permit; the process must then be repeated and a new permit obtained.



   (D)   Duration of permit.  All permits, unless otherwise revoked,
will expire 12 months from the date of issue.



   (E)   Exemptions.  The provisions of this chapter are not
applicable to audible alarms affixed to automobiles.



(1997 Code, § 40.03)



§ 90.04  FALSE ALARMS; REPORTS.



   (A)   False alarm reports.  The Chief of Police or Fire Chief may,
at his or her discretion, require a false alarm report to be filed by the
alarm user with the Police or Fire Department, within a time period to be
specified by the Chief of Police or Fire Chief.  If the Chief of Police or
Fire Chief determines that a false alarm has occurred at an address, the
alarm user at that address may submit a written report to the Chief of Police
or Fire Chief to explain the cause of the alarm activation.  If the Chief of
Police or Fire Chief determines that the alarm was caused by conditions
beyond the control of the alarm user, the alarm will not be counted as a
false alarm at that address.



   (B)   Installation and testing.  False alarms will be excused if
they are the result of an effort or order to upgrade, install, test, or
maintain an alarm system and if the Police or Fire Department is given notice
in advance of that upgrade, installation, test, or maintenance.



(1997 Code, § 40.04)



§ 90.05  PROHIBITED SYSTEMS.



   No person shall install, monitor, use, or possess an operative alarm
which utilizes taped or pre-recorded messages which deliver a telephone alarm
message to the Police or Fire Department.



(1997 Code, § 40.05)  Penalty, see § 90.99



§ 90.06  PERMIT FEES; EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL.



   (A)   The fee for an alarm user’s permit shall be as from time to
time set by resolution of the Council.



   (B)   After expiration of an alarm user’s permit, no subsequent
permit shall be required until the time when the alarm user incurs more than
two false police alarms, or more than two false fire alarms within a 12-month
period.



(1997 Code, § 40.06)



§ 90.07  PERMIT REVOCATION AND SUSPENSION.



   (A)   Basis for revocation or suspension.  In addition to the
automatic revocation process described in § 90.03 of this code, the Chief of
Police or Fire Chief may suspend or revoke any alarm user’s permit issued
pursuant to this chapter if he or she finds that any of the following occur:



      (1)   Any provision or condition of this chapter has been
violated by an alarm user or his or her agents;



      (2)   An alarm system has actuated an excessive number of
false alarms;



      (3)   The alarm user has knowingly made false statements in or
regarding his or her application for an alarm user’s permit;



      (4)   The alarm user has failed to correct or remove, within a
reasonable period, violations of this chapter after receipt of notice to do
so; or



      (5)   The continued effectiveness of the alarm user’s permit
constitutes a substantial threat to the public peace, health, safety, or
welfare.



   (B)   Violations; investigation and enforcement.  All alleged
violations defined above shall be investigated by the Chief of Police or Fire
Chief.  The alarm user shall be given notice of the proposed revocation or
suspension and be provided an opportunity to informally present evidence to
the Chief of Police or Fire Chief prior to the final decision on revocation
or suspension.  Anyone aggrieved by the decision of the Chief of Police or
Fire Chief may appeal that decision to the Council.



(1997 Code, § 40.07)



§ 90.99 PENALTY.



   (A)   Any alarm user who continues to use an alarm system without
obtaining a permit as required by this chapter or after receiving notice of
revocation or suspension of the alarm user’s permit by the Chief of Police
or Fire Chief shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.



   (B)   Any person required by this chapter to obtain an alarm
user’s permit who knowingly fails to do so shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

officer shall have the power to inspect private premises and take all
reasonable precautions to prevent the commission and maintenance of public
nuisances.  Except in emergency situations of imminent danger to human life
and safety, no police officer shall enter private property for the purpose of
inspecting or preventing public nuisances without the permission of the
owner, resident or other person in control of the property, unless the
officer has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction authorizing the entry.



§ 93.23  ABATEMENT.



   (A)   Notice.  Written notice of violation; notice of the time,
date, place and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of
City Council order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing
shall be given as set forth in this section.



      (1)   Notice of violation.  Written notice of violation shall
be served by a peace officer on the owner of record or occupant of the
premises either in person or by certified or registered mail.  If the
premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the owner of
record or occupant refuses to accept notice of violation, notice of violation
shall be served by posting it on the premises.



      (2)   Notice of City Council hearing.  Written notice of any
City Council hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the
owner of record and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified
or registered mail.  If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is
unknown, or the owner of record or occupant refuses to accept notice of the
City Council hearing, notice of City Council hearing shall be served by
posting it on the premises.



      (3)   Notice of City Council order.  Except for those cases
determined by the city to require summary enforcement, written notice of any
City Council order shall be made as provided in M.S. § 463.17 (Hazardous and
Substandard Building Act), as it may be amended from time to time.



      (4)   Notice of motion for summary enforcement.  Written
notice of any motion for summary enforcement shall be made as provided for in
M.S. § 463.17 (Hazardous and Substandard Building Act), as it may be amended

   (B)   Procedure.  Whenever a peace officer determines that a public
nuisance is being maintained or exists on the premises in the city, the
officer shall notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the
premises of such fact and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. 
The notice of violation shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the
nuisance and the time within which the nuisance is to be abated.  If the
notice of violation is not complied with within the time specified, the
officer shall report that fact forthwith to the City Council.  Thereafter,
the City Council may, after notice to the owner or occupant and an
opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition identified in the
notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if the nuisance is
not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the city may seek
injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and notice of
motion for summary enforcement.



   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement.  In cases of
emergency, where delay in abatement required to complete the notice and
procedure requirements set forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this section
will permit a continuing nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health
safety or welfare, the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate
the nuisance.  To proceed with summary enforcement, the officer shall
determine that a public nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in
the city and that delay in abatement of the nuisance will unreasonably
endanger public health, safety or welfare.  The officer shall notify in
writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance
and of the city's intention to seek summary enforcement and the time and
place of the City Council meeting to consider the question of summary
enforcement.  The City Council shall determine whether or not the condition
identified in the notice to the owner or occupant is a nuisance, whether
public health, safety or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in
abatement required to complete the procedure set forth in division (A) of
this section, and may order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or
abated.  If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or abated, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.



   (D)   Immediate abatement.  Nothing in this section shall prevent
the city, without notice or other process, from immediately abating any
condition which poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.



Penalty, see § 93.99



§ 93.24  RECOVERY OF COST.



   (A)   Personal liability.  The owner of premises on which a
nuisance has been abated by the city shall be personally liable for the cost
to the city of the abatement, including administrative costs.  As soon as
the work has been completed and the cost determined, the
Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer or other official shall prepare a bill for the
cost and mail it to the owner.  Thereupon the amount shall be immediately
due and payable at the office of the Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer.



   (B)   Assessment.  After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. §
429.061, as it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public
health or safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice
on public sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the
traveled portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the
Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer shall, on or before November 30 next following
abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with all other
the charges as well as other charges for current services to be assessed
under M.S. § 429.101, as it may be amended from time to time, against each
separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable.  The City
Council may then spread the charges against the property under that statute
and other pertinent statutes for certification to the County Auditor and

citizens, and to ensure the integrity of its streets and the appropriate use
of the rights-of-way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state
of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances.



   (B)   Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this
code relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This chapter
imposes reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of facilities
and equipment currently within its rights-of-way, or to be placed therein at
some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state
and federal agencies. Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing
the rights-of-way will bear financial responsibility for their work. Finally,
this chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from
persons using the public rights-of-way.



   (C)   This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997
Session Laws, Chapter 123, substantially codified in M.S. §§ 237.16,

Laws, Ch. 94, Art. 9, amending the Act, and the other laws governing
applicable rights of the city and users of the right-of-way. This chapter
shall also be interpreted consistent with Minn. Rules, Parts 7819.0050
through 7819.9950 and Minn. Rules, Ch. 7560 where possible. To the extent any
provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the
Minnesota Rules, the interpretation most consistent with the Act and other
applicable statutes and case law is intended. This chapter shall not be
interpreted to limit the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt
and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the public.

the particular wireless support structure, under those attachment
specifications, and at the height indicated in the applicable permit
application.



      (2)   No new wireless support structure installed within the
right-of-way shall exceed 50 feet in height without the city's written
authorization, provided that the city may impose a lower height limit in the
applicable permit to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, or to
protect the right-of-way and its current use, and further provided that a
registrant may replace an existing wireless support structure exceeding 50
feet in height with a structure of the same height, subject to such
conditions or requirements as may be imposed in the applicable permit.



      (3)   No wireless facility may extend more than ten feet above
its wireless support structure.



      (4)   Where an applicant proposes to install a new wireless
support structure in the right-of-way, the city may impose separation
requirements between such structure and any existing wireless support
structure or other facilities in and around the right-of-way.



      (5)   Where an applicant proposes collocation on a decorative
wireless support structure, sign, or other structure not intended to support
small wireless facilities, the city may impose reasonable requirements to
accommodate the particular design, appearance, or intended purpose of such
structure.



      (6)   Where an applicant proposes to replace a wireless
support structure, the city may impose reasonable restocking, replacement, or
relocation requirements on the replacement of such structure.



   (D)   Small wireless facility agreement.



      (1)   A small wireless facility shall only be collocated on a
small wireless support structure owned or controlled by the city, or any
other city asset in the right-of-way, after the applicant has executed a
standard small wireless facility collocation agreement with the city. The
standard collocation agreement may require payment of the following:



         (a)   Up to $150 per year for rent to collocate on the

over 100 maximum watts; or



            3.   The actual costs of electricity, if the
actual costs exceed the foregoing.



      (2)   The standard collocation agreement shall be in addition
to, and not in lieu of, the required small wireless facility permit,
provided, however, that the applicant shall not be additionally required to
obtain a license or franchise in order to collocate. Issuance of a small
wireless facility permit does not supersede, alter, or affect any
then-existing agreement between the city and the applicant.



(Ord. 2018-6, passed 11-26-2018)



§ 95.11  ACTION ON SMALL WIRELESS FACILITY PERMIT APPLICATIONS.



   (A)   Deadline for action. The city shall approve or deny a small
wireless facility permit application within 90 days after filing of such

permit application, shall be deemed approved if the city fails to approve or
deny the application within the review periods established in this section.



   (B)   Consolidated applications.



      (1)   An applicant may file a consolidated small wireless
facility permit application addressing the proposed collocation of up to 15
small wireless facilities, or a greater number if agreed to by the city,
provided that all small wireless facilities in the application:



         (a)   Are located within a two-mile radius;



         (b)   Consist of substantially similar equipment; and



         (c)   Are to be placed on similar types of wireless
support structures.



      (2)   In rendering a decision on a consolidated permit
application, the city may approve some small wireless facilities and deny
others, but may not use denial of one or more permits as a basis to deny all
small wireless facilities in the application.



   (C)   Tolling of deadline. The 90-day deadline for action on a small
wireless facility permit application may be tolled if:



      (1)   The city receives applications from one or more
applicants seeking approval of permits for more than 30 small wireless
facilities within a seven-day period. In such case, the city may extend the
deadline for all such applications by 30 days by informing the affected
applicants in writing of such extension.



      (2)   The applicant fails to submit all required documents or
information and the city provides written notice of the incompleteness to the

(Ord. 2018-6, passed 11-26-2018)



§ 95.13  RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION.



   (A)   Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and
the patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under §
95.16.



   (B)   Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The
city may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to
restore the right-of-way itself.



      (1)   City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way,
permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If,
following such restoration, the pavement settles due to permittee's improper
backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing,
all costs associated with correcting the defective work.



      (2)   Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the
right-of-way itself, it shall, at the time of application for an excavation
permit, post a construction performance bond in accordance with the
provisions of Minn. Rules, Part 7819.3000.



      (3)   Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of
right-of-way restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation
fee. However, the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for patching,
and the degradation fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these
responsibilities.



   (C)   Standards. The permittee shall perform excavation,
backfilling, patching, and restoration according to the standards, and with
the materials, specified by the city, and shall comply with Minn. Rules, Part
7819.1100.



   (D)   Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects
in patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents. The
permittee, upon notification from the city, shall correct all restoration
work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said
work shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the
notice from the city, not including days during which work cannot be done
because of circumstances constituting force majeure, or days when work is
prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under § 95.16.



   (E)   Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the
right-of-way to a condition reasonably required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration reasonably required by the
city, the city, at its option, may do such work. In that event the permittee
shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the
right-of-way. If permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise
its rights under the construction performance bond.



(Ord. 2018-6, passed 11-26-2018)



§ 95.14  JOINT APPLICATIONS.



   (A)   Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits
to excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time.



   (B)   Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same
obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the
payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a
joint permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each
will pay and indicate the same on their applications.



   (C)   City projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction
or excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application
by two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay
the excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but
a permit would still be required.



(Ord. 2018-6, passed 11-26-2018)



§ 95.15  SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.



   (A)   Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for
the area of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any
work outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any
permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the
permit must be obstructed or excavated, must, before working in that greater
area,  make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees
required thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension.



   (B)   Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for
the dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the
permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the
end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it
must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the
new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end
date of the previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted
before the permit end date.



(Ord. 2018-6, passed 11-26-2018)



§ 95.16  OTHER OBLIGATIONS.



   (A)   Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit
does not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits,
licenses, and authority, and to pay all fees required by the city or other
applicable rule, law, or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all
requirements of local, state, and federal laws, including, but not limited
to, M.S. §§ 216D.01 through 216D.09 (Gopher One-Call Excavation Notice
System) and Minn. Rules, Ch. 7560. A permittee shall perform all work in
conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations,
and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its
permit, regardless of who does the work.



   (B)   Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval
of the city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.



   (C)   Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so
obstruct a right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water
through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with unless
conditions dictate otherwise. Private vehicles of those doing work in the
right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a permit area, unless such
parking is reasonably necessary to exercise the rights granted to the
permittee, and the work is performed with due regard for the safety of
others. The loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the
defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the permit.



   (D)   Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable
permits, permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including, but
not limited to horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements
set forth in M.S. Ch. 216D and Minn. Rules, Ch. 7560, and shall require

§ 95.17  DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT.



   (A)   Reasons for denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to
meet the requirements and conditions of this chapter, or if the city
determines that the denial is necessary to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the public, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its
current use.



   (B)   Procedural requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit
must be made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city
must notify the applicant or right-of-way user in writing within three
business days of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If an application
is denied, the right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial
identified by the city and resubmit its application. If the application is
resubmitted within 30 days of receipt of the notice of denial, no additional
application fee shall be imposed. The city must approve or deny the
resubmitted application within 30 days after submission.

   The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other
work performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn.
Rules, Parts 7819.1100 and 7819.5000, and other applicable local
requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the M.S. §§
237.162 and 237.163. Installation of service laterals shall be performed in
accordance with Minn. Rules, Ch 7560 and this code. Service lateral
installation is further subject to those requirements and conditions set
forth by the city in the applicable permits and/or agreements referenced in
§ 95.23.



(Ord. 2018-6, passed 11-26-2018)



§ 95.19  INSPECTION.



   (A)   Notice of completion. When the work under any permit hereunder
is completed, the permittee shall furnish a completion certificate in
accordance Minn. Rules, Part 7819.1300.



   (B)   Site inspection. Permittee shall make the work site available
to the city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of the work.



   (C)   Authority of Director.



      (1)   At the time of inspection, the Director may order the
immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life,
health, safety, or well-being of the public.



      (2)   The Director may issue an order to the permittee for any
work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable
standards, conditions, or codes, so long as the nonconformance constitutes a
"substantial breach" as set forth in M.S. § 237.163, Subd. 4(c)(1)-(5). The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the permit. Within a reasonable time after issuance of the
order, the permittee shall present proof to the Director that the violation
has been corrected, within a time set forth by the city in the order. If such
proof has not been presented within the required time, the Director may
revoke the permit pursuant to § 95.22.

   (A)   Emergency situations.



      (1)   Each registrant shall notify the Director of any event
regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency in a
reasonably, timely manner. The registrant may proceed to take whatever
actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Excavators' notification
to Gopher State One-Call regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill
this requirement. Within two business days after the occurrence of the
emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees
associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to
bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in
response to the emergency.



      (2)   If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a
registrant's facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local
representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever reasonable action it
deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne
by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the emergency.



   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person
who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or
excavates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty,
pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees
required by this code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct
any damage to the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of
this chapter.



(Ord. 2018-6, passed 11-26-2018)



§ 95.21  SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.



   If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or
ends sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the
city of the accurate information as soon as this information is known.

§ 95.22  REVOCATION OF PERMITS.



   (A)   Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided
herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance,
rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial
breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:



      (1)    The violation of any material provision of the
right-of-way permit;



      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of
the right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any
fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens;



      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the
application for a right-of-way permit;



      (4)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner,
unless a permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work
is due to reasons beyond the permittee's control; and/or



      (5)   The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that
does not conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to §
95.19.



   (B)   Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the
permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any
statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or any condition of the permit, the
city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation.
The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation
of the permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at
its discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to
mitigate and remedy the breach.



   (C)   Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving
notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan,
acceptable to the Director, that will cure the breach. Permittee's failure to
so contact the city, permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan,
or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit, provided that no plan will be
unreasonably denied.



   (D)   Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the
permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable management
costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection, and
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

provide mapping information as requested by the city in accordance with Minn.
Rules, Parts 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within 90 days following completion of
any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the Director
accurate maps and drawings certifying the location of all equipment
installed, owned, and maintained by the permittee in accordance with Minn.
Rules, Parts 7819.4000 through 7819.4100.



   (B)   Trade secret information. At the request of any registrant,
any information requested by the registrant that qualifies as a "trade
secret" under M.S. § 13.37, Subd. 1(b), shall be treated as trade secret
information by the city.



   (C)   Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or
repair of service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn.
Rules, Part 7560.0150, Subp. 2, shall require the permittee's use of
appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed
service laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases
where the Director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors
shall submit to the Director evidence satisfactory to the Director of the
installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this division, with
applicable Gopher State One-Call law, and Minnesota Rules governing service
laterals installed after Dec. 31, 2005, shall be a condition of any city
approval necessary for:



      (1)   Payments to contractors working on a public improvement
project, including those under M.S. Ch. 429; and



      (2)   City approval under development agreements or other
subdivision or site plan approval under M.S. Ch. 462. The Director shall
reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such information to
the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service
laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the
work or future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.

relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other applicable law,
and with Minn. Rules, Parts 7819.3100, 7819.5000, and 7819.5100, to the
extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.



   (B)   Undergrounding. Unless otherwise agreed in a franchise or
other agreement between the applicable right-of-way user and the city,
facilities in the right-of-way must be located or relocated, and maintained
underground, in accordance with regulations to be adopted by the city.



   (C)   Corridors.



      (1)   The city may assign a specific area within the
right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each
type of facility that is, or pursuant to current technology, the city expects
will someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction,
or other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement
of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.



      (2)   Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in
a position at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no
later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area
where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned
position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the
city for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the
remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service
needs, and hardship to the registrant.



   (D)   Limitation of space. To protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the public, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its
current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement
of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making such
decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all
existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided
primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for
the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time
of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing
facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements
and development projects which have been determined to be in the public
interest.

of any right-of-way excavation, each registrant who has facilities or
equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal and vertical
placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities are less
than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work
closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact location of its
facilities and the best procedure for excavation.

maintain, support, or move a registrant's facilities to protect it, the city
shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The
costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid
within 30 days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible
for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which it or its
facilities damage. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of
repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during
the city's response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant's
facilities.

§ 96.06  CERTAIN PRIVATE IMPROVEMENTS.



   (A)   Private improvement. The city realizes that in certain
instances a private property owner may wish to erect, place, or plant certain
private improvements within the boulevard or unopened right-of-way abutting
the owner's land. Such private improvements include, but are not limited to,
ornamental fences, hedges, berms, sidewalks, driveways, pavement, planters,
statues, irrigation systems, rock, and landscaping (hereinafter "private
improvement"). Private improvements shall not include any permanent features
such as a concrete foundation or other feature requiring major removal
efforts.



   (B)   Permit required. No person shall erect, place, or plant any
private improvement within a boulevard or unopened right-of-way abutting
their private property without first obtaining a permit from the Public Works
Director. In addition, any existing feature which does not hold a valid
permit shall require a permit at the time of any reconstruction or repair, or
earlier if required by the city. If the abutting boulevard is owned by
Hennepin County or the Minnesota Department of Transportation, a permit may
also be required by such jurisdiction.



   (C)   Application and fee. A person requesting a permit under this
chapter shall submit an application on forms provided by the city, together
with the fee established by Council resolution. The application shall be
accompanied with scale drawings of the boulevard or unopened right-of-way and
the proposed private improvement, as well as a written description of the
materials and construction methods to be used.



   (D)   Review of application; appeal.



      (1)   The Director may deny any application if the Director
determines that the private improvement would cause, or could cause in the
future, any inconvenience to the public. In review of an application, the
Director considers factors including, but not limited to, the following:



         (a)   Effect of the private improvement on snow plowing
and snow storage;



         (b)   Effect of the private improvement on public
safety, including traffic visibility and pedestrian safety;



         (c)   Effect of the private improvement on public land
and public or private utilities; and



         (d)   The public necessity and utility of the private
improvement and the availability of alternate locations for the private
improvement.



      (2)   To appeal the denial of a permit application, the
aggrieved applicant must submit a written request for hearing to the City
Administrator within seven days following receipt of the decision of denial.
Appeals will be processed under the procedures established for right-of-way
users in § 95.30 of this code.



   (E)   Permit revocation. The city reserves the right to revoke any
permit at any time and for any reason. If the permit is revoked, the property
owner has 60 days to remove the private improvement.



   (F)   Maintenance of private improvement. The abutting landowner
shall be responsible for the maintenance of any private improvement located
within the boulevard or unopened right-of-way. Any unmaintained private
improvements shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to,
abating the nuisance or taking possession of the facilities and restoring the
right-of-way to a useable condition.



   (G)   Damage to or by private improvement. The city and any other
persons authorized by Chapter 95 of this code for installation and
maintenance of facilities in the right-of-way shall not assume any
responsibility, and the abutting landowner shall assume all responsibility
for any damage caused to or by any private improvement located within the
boulevard or unopened right-of-way.



   (H)   Removal requirement. Any private improvement not holding a
valid permit is deemed to be a public nuisance and is subject to abatement
according to Chapter 93 of this code. The city may bill the property owner
for the cost of abatement or assess the cost of abatement against the
abutting property in accordance with M.S. Ch. 429, or other applicable law.



   (I)   Conditions. A person requesting a permit under this chapter
must:



      (1)   Accept all of the terms of this section;



      (2)   Commence and complete the private improvement within the
time specified in the application; and



      (3)   Make such private improvement at the person's own sole
expense without any expense of any kind to the city.

§ 111.01  DEFINITIONS.



   Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by context, all
terms shall be given their commonly accepted definitions.  For the purpose
of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   PEDDLER.  A person who goes from house-to-house, door-to-door,
business-to-business, street-to-street, or any other type of place-to-place,
for the purpose of offering for sale, displaying or exposing for sale,
selling or attempting to sell, and delivering immediately upon sale, the
goods, wares, products, merchandise or other personnel property that the
person is carrying or otherwise transporting.  The term peddler shall mean
the same as the term hawker.



   PERSON.  Any natural individual, group, organization, corporation,
partnership or association.  As applied to groups, organizations,
corporations, partnerships and associations, the term shall include each
member, officer, partner, associate, agent or employee.



   REGULAR BUSINESS DAY.  Any day during which the city hall is normally
open for the purpose of conducting public business.  Holidays defined by
state law shall not be counted as regular business days.



   SOLICITOR.  A person who goes from house-to-house, door-to-door,
business-to-business, street-to-street, or any other type of place-to-place,
for the purpose of obtaining or attempting to obtain orders for goods, wares,
products, merchandise, other personal property or services of which he or she
may be carrying or transporting samples, or that may be described in a
catalog or by other means, and for which delivery or performance shall occur
at a later time.  The absence of samples or catalogs shall not remove a
person from the scope of this provision if the actual purpose of the person's
activity is to obtain or attempt to obtain orders as discussed above.  The
term shall mean the same as the term “canvasser.”



   TRANSIENT MERCHANT.  A person who temporarily sets up business out of
a vehicle, trailer, boxcar, tent, other portable shelter, or empty store
front for the purpose of exposing or displaying for sale, selling or
attempting to sell, and delivering, goods, wares, products, merchandise or
other personal property and who does not remain or intend to remain in any
one location for more than 14 consecutive days.



§ 111.02  EXCEPTIONS TO DEFINITIONS.



   (A)   For the purpose of the requirements of this chapter, the terms
PEDDLER, SOLICITOR, and TRANSIENT MERCHANT shall not apply to any person
selling or attempting to sell at wholesale any goods, wares, products,
merchandise or other personal property to a retailer of the items being sold
by the wholesaler.  The terms also shall not apply to any person who makes
initial contacts with other people for the purpose of establishing or trying
to establish a regular customer delivery route for the delivery of perishable
food and dairy products such as baked goods and milk, nor shall they apply to
any person making deliveries of perishable food and dairy products to the
customers on his or her established regular delivery route.



   (B)   In addition, persons conducting the type of sales commonly
known as garage sales, rummage sales, or estate sales, as well as those
persons participating in an organized multi-person bazaar or flea market,
shall be exempt from the definitions of PEDDLERS, SOLICITORS, and TRANSIENT
MERCHANTS, as shall be anyone conducting an auction as a properly licensed
auctioneer, or any officer of the court conducting a court-ordered sale. 
Exemption from the definitions for the scope of this chapter shall not excuse
any person from complying with any other applicable statutory provision or
local ordinance.



   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prohibit or
restrict door-to-door advocacy. Persons engaging in door-to-door advocacy
shall not be required to register as solicitors under § 111.07. The term
DOOR-TO-DOOR ADVOCACY includes door-to-door canvassing and pamphleteering as
vehicles for the dissemination of religious, political and other ideas.

notified in writing of the decision, the reason for denial, and of the
applicant's right to appeal the denial by requesting, within 20 days of
receiving notice of rejection, a public hearing before the City Council. 
The City Council shall hear the appeal within 20 days of the date of the

      (2)   Fund raisers working on behalf of an otherwise exempt
person or group shall not be exempt from the licensing requirements of this
chapter.

§ 112.01  PURPOSE.



   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess, and use tobacco, tobacco products, and
tobacco-related devices, and these sales, possession, and use are violations
of both state and federal laws; and because studies have shown that most
smokers begin smoking before they have reached the age of 18 years and that
those persons who reach the age of 18 years without having started smoking
are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and because smoking has been
shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently
place a financial burden on all levels of government; this chapter shall be
intended to regulate the sale, possession, and use of tobacco, tobacco
products, and tobacco-related devices for the purpose of enforcing and
furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious effects
associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products, and
tobacco-related devices, and to further the official public policy of the
state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated
in M.S. § 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.

of their employees in regard to the sale of tobacco, tobacco products, or
tobacco-related devices on the licensed premises, and the sale of this type
of item by an employee shall be considered a sale by the license holder. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the city from also
subjecting the employee to whatever penalties are appropriate under this
chapter, state or federal law, or other applicable law or regulation.



(1997 Code, § 27.09)  Penalty, see § 112.99

minor used in compliance checks shall attempt to use a false identification
misrepresenting the minor’s age, and all minors lawfully engaged in a
compliance check shall answer all questions about the minor’s age asked by
the licensee or his or her employee and shall produce identification, if any

of a particular state or federal law.

(1997 Code, § 27.14)

§ 113.01  ADOPTION OF STATE LAW BY REFERENCE.



   The provisions of M.S. Ch. 340A, as they may be amended from time to
time, with reference to the definition of terms, conditions of operation,
restrictions on consumption, provisions relating to sales, hours of sale, and
all other matters pertaining to the retail sale, distribution, and
consumption of intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt liquor are hereby adopted by
reference and are made a part of this chapter as if set out in full. It is
the intention of the City Council that all future amendments to M.S. Ch. 340A
are hereby adopted by reference or referenced as if they had been in
existence at the time this chapter is adopted.



(Ord. 2018-2, passed 6-11-2018)



§ 113.02  CITY MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN STATE LAW.



   The Council is authorized by the provisions of M.S. § 340A.509, as it
may be amended from time to time, to impose additional restrictions on the
sale and possession of alcoholic beverages within its limits beyond those
contained in M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended from time to time.



(Ord. 2018-2, passed 6-11-2018)



§ 113.03  DEFINITIONS.



   In addition to the definitions contained in M.S. § 340A.101, for the
purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   LIQUOR.  Without modification by the words “intoxicating” or
“3.2% malt,” includes both intoxicating liquor and 3.2% malt liquor.



(Ord. 2018-2, passed 6-11-2018)



§ 113.04  NUDITY ON THE PREMISES OF LICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS PROHIBITED.



   (A)   The Council finds that it is in the best interests of the
public health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city that
nudity is prohibited as provided in this section on the premises of any
establishment licensed under this chapter. This is to protect and assist the
owners, operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and
the public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and
combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The Council especially intends to
prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely
to lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including
prostitution, sexual assault, and disorderly conduct. The Council also finds
that the prohibition of nudity on the premises of any establishment licensed
under this chapter, as set forth in this section, reflects the prevailing
community standards of the city.



   (B)   It is unlawful for any licensee to permit or allow any person
or persons on the licensed premises, when the person does not have his or her
buttocks, anus, breasts, and genitals covered with a non-transparent material.



   (C)   A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable as
provided by law, and is justification for revocation or suspension of any
liquor, wine, or 3.2% malt liquor license, any other license issued under
this chapter, or the imposition of a civil penalty under § 113.99.



(Ord. 2018-2, passed 6-11-2018)  Penalty, see § 113.99



§ 113.05  CONSUMPTION IN PUBLIC PLACES.



   No person shall consume intoxicating liquor or 3.2% malt liquor in a
public park, on any public street, sidewalk, parking lot or alley, or in any
public place other than on the premises of an establishment licensed under
this chapter, or where the consumption and display of liquor is lawfully
permitted.

§ 113.06  RAFFLES, SILENT AUCTIONS, AND FUND RAISING EVENTS FOR CHARITABLE
PURPOSES OF WINE, BEER, OR INTOXICATING LIQUORS.



   Notwithstanding M.S. §§ 340A.401, 340A.414, and 340A.505, a nonprofit
organization conducting a silent auction, raffle, or other fund raising event
may conduct live, on premises auctions or raffles of wine, beer, or
intoxicating liquors, provided that funds from the auction or raffle are
dedicated to the charitable purposes of the nonprofit organization, such
auctions or raffles are limited to not more than six occasions per year, and
the alcohol may only be auctioned or raffled to persons who demonstrate that
they are 21 years of age or older and do not show signs of obvious
intoxication. Nothing in this section authorizes on-premises consumption of
alcohol. The organization conducting the event must notify the City Clerk at
least ten days prior to the occurrence of the event.

unless another date is specified in the license. Temporary licenses expire
according to their terms. Consumption and display permits issued by the
Commissioner of Public Safety, and the accompanying city consent to the
permit, shall expire on March 31 of each year.

proposed license will operate and its location, a description of the
premises, whether the applicant is owner and operator of the business, how
long the applicant has been in that business at that place, and other
information as the Council may require from time to time. An application for

responsibility under this section shall conform to M.S. § 340A.409.

marijuana, or other controlled substances, regardless of whether the person
hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol, marijuana, or other
controlled substances. The Council finds that:



      (1)   Events and gatherings held on private or public property
where alcohol, marijuana, or other controlled substances are possessed or
consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and
constitute a potential threat to public health and public safety requiring
prevention or abatement;



      (2)   Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect
underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to
alcohol, marijuana, or other controlled substances consumption, such as
alcohol overdose or alcohol/drug-related traffic crashes;



      (3)   Alcohol, marijuana, and other controlled substances are
addictive drugs which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on
those who use them as well as those who are affected by the actions of an
irresponsible user;



      (4)   Often, events or gatherings involving underage
possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However,
there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and condone the activity,
and in some circumstances provide the alcohol, marijuana, or other controlled
substances;



      (5)   Even though giving or furnishing alcohol, marijuana, or
other controlled substances to an underage person is a crime, it is difficult
to prove, and local regulation is necessary to help further combat underage
consumption; and



      (6)   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person
criminally responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage
possession or consumption occurs.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 116.01  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe licensing requirements for
sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the general health, safety,
and welfare.



(1997 Code, § 33.01)



§ 116.02  FINDINGS; INTENT.



   (A)   Findings of the Council.  The City Council makes the
following findings regarding the need to license sexually oriented
businesses.  The findings are based upon the experiences of other cities
where these types of businesses have located, as studied by city staff.



      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses can contribute to an
increase in criminal activity in the area in which these businesses are
located, taxing crime-prevention programs and law enforcement services.



      (2)   Sexually oriented businesses can be used as fronts for
prostitution and other criminal activity.  The experience of other cities
indicates that the proper management and operation of these businesses can,
however, minimize this risk, provided the owners and operators of the
facilities are regulated by licensing or other procedures.



      (3)   Sexually oriented businesses can increase the risk of
exposure to communicable diseases including but not limited to Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) for which currently there is no cure. 
Experiences of other cities indicate that these businesses can facilitate the
spread of communicable diseases by virtue of the design and use of the
premises, thereby endangering not only the patrons of the establishments but
also the general public.



      (4)   Sexually oriented businesses can cause or contribute to
public health problems by the presence of live adult entertainment in
conjunction with food or drink on the same premises.



      (5)   A licensing and regulatory scheme as prescribed herein
can aid in monitoring sexually oriented businesses for adverse secondary
effects on the community.



      (6)   The risk of criminal activity and public health problems
can be minimized through a licensing and regulatory scheme as prescribed
herein.



(1997 Code, § 33.02)



   (B)   Intent.  In direct furtherance of the substantial goals of
public health, safety, and welfare, the Council adopts the following
licensing regulations, recognizing that it has a great interest in the
promotion of health and the prevention of criminal activity.



(1997 Code, § 33.03)

§ 117.01  INTENT.



   It is the purpose of the City Council to regulate the time, place, and
manner of special events when the event's impact upon the health, sanitary,
fire, police, transportation, and utility services exceeds those regularly
provided to that property. This chapter is enacted in order to promote the
health, safety, and welfare of all residents and visitors of the city by
ensuring that special events do not create disturbances, become nuisances,
menace or threaten life, health, or property, disrupt traffic, or threaten or
damage private or public property. It is not the intent of the City Council
by enacting this chapter to regulate in any manner the content of speech or
infringe upon the right to assemble, except for regulating the time, place,
and manner of speech and assembly, and this chapter should not be interpreted
or construed otherwise.

§ 117.05  PERMIT REVIEW.



   (A)   Receipt of application. Upon receipt of a special event permit
application, the City Administrator shall be responsible for promptly
processing the application, including conferring with department heads and
the applicant as necessary to implement the provisions of this chapter, and,
when required by this chapter, forwarding the processed application to the
City Council with a recommendation to approve, approve with conditions or
modifications, or deny, the special event permit application.



   (B)   Special services. The City Administrator shall promptly
distribute copies of the application for review by the head of each
department in cases where special services are requested or will be
necessary. Each such department head shall review the application and
evaluate the special services and shall report to the City Administrator,
with a recommendation that the application and the requested special services
be approved, approved with conditions or modifications, or denied. Each
department head shall also provide the City Administrator with a cost
estimate for the special services associated with his or her department.



   (C)   Review. When a special event will not require any special
services or does not require a significant amount of special services, the
City Administrator may review and approve the permit application
administratively. In cases where a special event requires a significant
amount of special services, the application will be presented to the City
Council for review. The City Council may hold a public hearing on the permit
application. It may also refer the permit application to the City Commissions
for its review and recommendation.



   (D)   Permit denial. The city may deny an application for a special
event permit if it determines from a consideration of the application or
other pertinent information, that:



      (1)   The information contained in the application or
supplemental information requested from the applicant is false or nonexistent
in any material detail;



      (2)   The applicant fails to supplement the application after
having been notified by the city of additional information or documents
needed;



      (3)   The applicant fails to agree to abide or comply with all
of the conditions and terms of the special event permit, including payment of
all costs and expenses;



      (4)   The special event would substantially or unnecessarily
interfere with traffic in the city, would interfere with access to the fire
station or fire hydrants, or would interfere with access to businesses or
residences in the immediate vicinity of the event, and there are not
sufficient city resources available at the time of the event to mitigate the
disruption;



      (5)   The special event is of the size or nature that requires
the diversion of so many law enforcement officers to properly police the
event, site, and contiguous areas that allowing the special event would
unreasonably deny law enforcement protection to the remainder of the city and
its residents;



      (6)   The proposed date and time of the special event
conflicts with a previously scheduled event and there are not available at
the time of the proposed special event sufficient city resources to provide
services for both events without substantially or unnecessarily interfering
with police, fire, water, public works, or other services to the city as a
whole;



      (7)   The location of the special event will substantially
interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place
upon or along public property or rights-of-way;



      (8)   The special event would likely endanger the public
safety or health;



      (9)   The special event would substantially or unnecessarily
interfere with police, fire, water, public works, or other services to the
city as a whole and there are not available at the time of the proposed event
sufficient city resources to mitigate the disruption;



      (10)   The applicant fails to comply with the liability
insurance requirements or the applicant's insurance lapses or is canceled;



      (11)   The special event would likely create or constitute a
public nuisance;



      (12)   The special event would likely cause significant damage
to public property or facilities;



      (13)   The special event would engage in or encourage
participants to engage in illegal acts; or



      (14)   The applicant, responsible party, or the person on
whose behalf the application is submitted has on prior occasions made
material misrepresentations regarding the nature and extent of special
services required for a special event in the city, or has violated the terms
of a prior special event permit.

§ 117.06  PERMIT ISSUANCE.



   (A)   Permitted areas. Because of the predominantly residential
character of the city and the relatively small size of the commercially zoned
areas resulting in the potential for conflicting uses, special events will be
permitted within the city only after a finding by the city that the character
of the proposed special event is compatible with the character of the
surrounding neighborhood, considering the possible creation of problems
including noise, lighting, traffic, sanitation, congestion, and other factors
affecting the public health, safety, and welfare of such areas, in addition
to compliance with all ordinances of this city and applicable statutes and
regulations.



   (B)   Permit conditions. The city may condition the issuance of a
special event permit by imposing reasonable conditions concerning the time,
place, and manner of the special event, and such conditions as are necessary
to protect the safety of persons and property, and the control of traffic,
provided that such conditions shall not unreasonably restrict the right of
free speech. The city may inspect the property upon which the special event
is to be held prior to the event in order to make certain there is compliance
with all permit conditions. Such conditions may include, but are not limited
to:



      (1)   Alteration of the date(s), time(s), route(s), or
location of the special event proposed;



      (2)   Elimination of an activity at the special event which
cannot be mitigated to a point as to ensure public safety and welfare, or
which causes liability to the city;



      (3)   Requirements concerning the area of assembly and
disbanding of a parade or other events occurring along a route;



      (4)   Requirements concerning the accommodation of pedestrian
or vehicular traffic, including restricting the special event to only a
portion of the street or right-of-way;



      (5)   Requirements for the use of special services;



      (6)   Requirements for the use of traffic cones or barricades;



      (7)   Requirements for the provision of first aid or sanitary
facilities;



      (8)   Requirements for the use of special event monitors and
the providing of notice of the special event's permit conditions to the event
participants;



      (9)   Requirements on the number and type of vehicles,
animals, or structures to be allowed at the special event, and the inspection
and approval of floats, structures, and decorated vehicles by the city for
safety purposes;

(Ord. 2018-1, passed 4-9-2018)



§ 117.07  SPECIAL SERVICES FEES.



   (A)   Special services fee deposit. If any special services are to
be used during the special event, the applicant may be required to pay a
special services fee deposit at least ten business days before the special
event. The special services fee deposit shall be determined by the City
Administrator. It shall be based upon an estimate of special services that
are necessary as determined by the city department heads.

prepare a detailed account of all special services provided for the special
event and, in such cases, will set the final user fee using the rates, fees,
and charges in the amounts set by resolution. The city will then provide the
authorized and responsible person identified in the special event permit
application with a copy of the detailed account of the special services and
an invoice for the user fee, less the fee deposit. The balance of the user
fee will then become due and payable immediately upon its receipt. Any
unexpended deposit amount will be returned to the applicant.



   (C)   Special services rates. The rates charged shall be an amount
set by resolution.



(Ord. 2018-1, passed 4-9-2018)

   If the special event requires special services prior to the issuance of
a special event permit, the permit applicant and authorizing officer of the
sponsoring organization, if any, must sign an agreement to indemnify, defend,
and hold the city, its officials, employees, and agents harmless from any
claim that arises in whole or in part out of the special event, except any
claims arising solely out of the negligent acts or omissions of the city, its
officials, employees, and agents.



(Ord. 2018-1, passed 4-9-2018)



§ 117.09  INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Liability insurance required. The applicant, sponsor, and
those hired and/or obtained by the applicant to provide a service at the
special event, must possess or obtain liability insurance to protect against
loss from liability imposed by law for damages on account of bodily injury or
property damage arising from the special event. A certificate of insurance

The certificate of insurance must name the city, its officials, employees,

the applicant or sponsor must also present the city with a certificate of
insurance naming the city, its officials, employees, and agents as additional
insureds.



   (B)   Minimum limits. Insurance coverage must be a commercial
general liability policy. The minimum limit must be at least $1,000,000. If
alcoholic beverages are to be sold or distributed at the special event, the
policy must also include an endorsement for liquor liability. The city may
require additional endorsements or increased minimum limits depending upon
the type of special event and the proposed activities.



   (C)   Waiver or reduction of required limits. The city may waive or
reduce insurance requirements of this section under the following
circumstances:



      (1)   The applicant or officer of the sponsoring organization
signs a verified statement that it believes that the special event's purpose
is First Amendment expression and that the cost of obtaining the insurance is
so financially burdensome that it would constitute an unreasonable burden on
the right of First Amendment expression;



      (2)   The applicant or officer of the sponsoring organization
signs a verified statement that the insurance coverage required by this
section is impossible to obtain; or



      (3)   The city determines that the insurance requirements are
in excess of the reasonable risk presented by the proposed special event.



(Ord. 2018-1, passed 4-9-2018)



§ 117.10  OVERNIGHT CAMPING.



   No person holding a permit for a special event shall allow, and no
participant in a special event shall, camp overnight at the location of a
special event, except for a reasonable number of persons required to maintain
security.



(Ord. 2018-1, passed 4-9-2018)



§ 117.11  COMPLIANCE WITH PERMIT.



   (A)   Unlawful to sponsor a special event without a permit. It is
unlawful for any person to sponsor or conduct a special event requiring a
permit pursuant to this chapter unless a valid special event permit has been
issued for the event.



   (B)   Unlawful to exceed the scope of the permit. The special event
permit authorizes the special event permittee or sponsor to conduct only such
a special event as is described in the permit and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the permit. It is unlawful for the permittee or
sponsor to willfully violate the terms and conditions of the permit.

§ 117.12  REVOCATION.

Police Chief at any time for failure to comply with the provisions of this
chapter and conditions of the permit.



(Ord. 2018-1, passed 4-9-2018)



§ 117.13  MODIFICATIONS.



   The city may modify or waive any of the requirements of this chapter
after a finding that the waiver or modification of the requirements,
including the required fee, will not endanger the public health, safety, and
welfare of the community and that enforcement of the requirements would
impose a unique hardship upon the applicant.



(Ord. 2018-1, passed 4-9-2018)

   (A)   Injunction. The provisions of this chapter may be enforced by
injunction in any court of competent jurisdiction.



   (B)   Public nuisance. The holding of a special event in violation
of any provision or condition contained in this chapter will be deemed a
public nuisance and may be abated as such. Issuance of a special event permit
by the city does not preclude the right of an individual to pursue a private
nuisance action against the applicant.



   (C)   Misdemeanor.  Violation of any provision of this chapter is a
misdemeanor. Violators shall be subject to a fine or imprisonment as
specified by state statute. Each day in which a violation continues to occur
shall constitute a separate offense. Violation of any provision of this
chapter shall also be grounds for revocation of the special event permit.

chapters, unless specifically adopted in this chapter.  The Minnesota State
Building Code is hereby incorporated in this chapter as if fully set out
herein.



   (C)   Building Code optional chapters. The Minnesota State Building
Code, established pursuant to M.S. §§ 16B.59 to 16B.75, as it may be

of work for which the inspection is called is not complete or when
corrections called for are not made.



   (B)   This section is not to be interpreted as requiring

be retracted by end pressure.  However, each such door must be capable of
being opened from the inside without the use of a key or any special

are permitted to be placed over emergency escape and rescue openings.
However, such devices must provide a minimum net clear opening size that
complies with the MSBC. They shall also be releasable or removable from the
inside, without the use of a key, tool, or force greater than that required
for the normal operation of the escape and rescue opening. Where such bars,
grilles, grates or similar devices are installed in existing buildings, smoke
detectors shall be installed in accordance with Section 704 in the IPMC.



   (II)   Section 800. General references.  Whenever this code refers
to the International Codes, such references shall be deemed to be to the
comparable applicable code as adopted by the state of Minnesota. Whenever
this code refers to the International Zoning Code, such references shall be

   (B)   Conduct enforcement. The City Administrator and the City
Council are responsible for enforcement and administration of this section.



   (C)   Upon determination by the City Administrator that a rental
dwelling was used in a disorderly manner, as described in division (A) of
this section, the City Administrator must give notice to the owner/licensee
of the violation and direct that steps be taken to prevent further violations.



   (D)   If a second instance of disorderly use of a rental dwelling
occurs within the 12-month period following an incident for which a notice in
division (C) of this section was given, the City Administrator must notify
the owner/licensee of the violation and must also require the owner/licensee
to submit a written report of the actions taken, and proposed to be taken to
prevent further disorderly use. This written report must be submitted to the
City Administrator within ten business days of receipt of the notice of
disorderly use and must detail all actions taken by the owner/licensee in
response to all notices of disorderly use within the preceding 12 months.



   (E)   (1)   If a third instance of disorderly use of a rental
dwelling occurs within the 12-month period following any two previous
instances of disorderly use for which notices were given, the City
Administrator must notify the owner/licensee of the violation and must also
require the owner/licensee to submit a written report of the actions taken,
and proposed to be taken, to prevent further disorderly use.  The 12-month
period begins on the date of the police report generated in response to the
first instance of disorderly use. The written report must be submitted to the
City Administrator within ten business days of receipt of the notice of
disorderly use and must detail all actions taken in response to all notices
of disorderly use within the preceding 12 months.



      (2)   After the third instance of disorderly use, the City
Administrator may deny, revoke, suspend or not renew the license for the
premises.  Before such an action, the City Administrator must give to the
owner/licensee written notice of a hearing before the City Council to
consider such denial, revocation, suspension or non-renewal.  Such written
notice must specify all violations of this section, and must state the date,
time, place and purpose of the hearing.  The hearing must be held no less
than ten days and no more than 30 days after giving such notice.



      (3)   Following the hearing, the city may deny, revoke,
suspend or decline to renew the license for all or any part or parts of the
rental dwelling or may grant a license upon such terms and conditions as is
deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section.



      (4)   Appeal. Following receipt of a decision by the city to
deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew a license, the owner/licensee may request
a hearing before the City Council. The request must be made in writing to the
City Administrator within ten days of the city's decision.



      (5)   Upon a decision to revoke, suspend, deny or not renew a
license for violations of this section, the owner/licensee will not be
eligible for any new rental licenses for a period determined by the City
Administrator, but not to exceed one year. Any person who has had two or more
licenses revoked, suspended, denied or not renewed for violations of this
section, will not be eligible for any new rental licenses for a period
determined by the City Administrator, but not to exceed two years.



   (F)   No adverse license action shall be imposed where the instance
of disorderly use occurred during the pendency of eviction proceedings
(unlawful detainer) or within 30 days of notice given to a tenant to vacate
the premises where the disorderly use was related to conduct by that tenant
or by other occupants or guests of the tenant's unit.  Eviction proceedings
are not a bar to adverse license action, however, unless they are diligently
pursued by the licensee. 



   (G)   A determination that a rental dwelling has been used in a
disorderly manner as described in division (A) of this section shall be made
upon a fair preponderance of the evidence to support such a determination. 
It is not necessary that criminal charges be brought in order to support a
determination of disorderly use nor does the fact of dismissal or acquittal
of such a criminal charge operate as a bar to adverse license action under
this section.



   (H)   All notices given by the city under this section must be
personally served on the owner/licensee, sent by certified mail to the
owner/licensee's last known address or, if neither method of service effects
notice, by posting on a conspicuous place on the rental dwelling.



   (I)   Enforcement actions provided in this section are not
exclusive, and the city may take any action with respect to a licensee, a
tenant, or a rental dwelling as is authorized by the City Code, state or
federal law.  The city may postpone or discontinue any enforcement action,
including an action to deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew a license, if it
appears that the owner/licensee has taken appropriate measures to prevent
further instances of disorderly use.

operator so that the yards, open spaces and parking facilities are kept in a
safe and attractive condition.  Where a conditional use permit has been
granted, the landscaping shown on the approved landscaping plan is considered
as minimal and must be maintained accordingly.  Any deviation to species or
material shall be equal to or better than originally approved.  In addition,
adequate lighting facilities must be provided and operated between the hours
of sunset and sunrise; and snow plowing or snow shoveling must be regularly
accomplished to maintain all sidewalk and parking areas in a safe and

§ 151.37  SAFETY FROM FIRE.

§ 151.38  ENFORCEMENT.



   (A)   Responsibility.  It is the responsibility of the owner and
operator/manager to be in compliance with this subchapter, other city
ordinances and state laws.



   (B)   Maintenance standards.  Every rental dwelling must maintain
the standards in this property maintenance chapter, in addition to any other
requirement of the ordinances of the city or special permits issued by the
city, or the laws of the State of Minnesota.



   (C)   Inspections and investigations.



      (1)   The City Administrator is authorized to make inspections
to enforce this subchapter.



      (2)   All designated agents authorized to inspect have the
authority to enter, at all reasonable times, any rental dwelling.  Prior to
entering a rental dwelling, the designated agent must first present proper
credentials and request entry.  If any owner, operator, occupant or other
person(s) in charge of a rental dwelling fails or refuses to permit access
and entry to the rental dwelling, or any part thereof, the designated agent
may, upon showing that probable cause exists for the inspection and for the
issuance of an order directing compliance with the inspection requirements of
this section, petition and obtain such order from a court of competent
jurisdiction in order to secure entry.



      (3)   Compliance orders must be written in accordance with §
151.03 of this Code.



      (4)   There shall be no fee charged for an initial inspection
to determine the existence of a housing maintenance code violation, nor any
fee for the first re-inspection to determine compliance with an order to
correct a housing maintenance code violation.



         (a)   A fee shall be charged for each subsequent
re-inspection occurring after the due date for compliance with an order, as
determined by the city. The amount of the re-inspection fee will be set by
resolution of the Council.



         (b)   The re-inspection fees prescribed above are to be
billed directly to the owner or operator/manager for the property upon
completion of any re-inspection for which a fee is required.  Failure to pay
such fees is grounds for revocation, suspension, or non-issuance of a rental
dwelling license.  This subdivision is not to be considered the exclusive
method of collecting re-inspection fees and does not preclude collection by
other lawful means.



         (c)   Every notice of violation and order to correct
housing code violations must contain a clear and conspicuous explanation of
the policy in this section requiring re-inspection fees for subsequent
re-inspection.



         (d)   The City Administrator may waive a re-inspection
fee in case of error, mistake, injustice, or other good cause.



   (D)   Revocation, suspension, denial or non-renewal of license.



      (1)   The City Administrator may revoke, suspend, deny or
decline to renew any license issued under this subchapter for part or all of
a rental dwelling upon any of the following grounds:



         (a)   False statements on any application or other
information or report required by this subchapter to be given by the
applicant or licensee;



         (b)   Failure to pay any application, penalty,
re-inspection or reinstatement fee required either by this section or City
Council resolution;



         (c)   Failure to correct deficiencies in the time
specified in a compliance order;



         (d)   Failure to allow an authorized inspection of a
rental dwelling;



         (e)   Violation of an owner's duties under M.S. §§
299C.66 to 299C.71, as may be amended from time to time, ("Kari Koskinen
Manager Background Check Act");



         (f)   Any other violation of this subchapter.



      (2)   Before the City Administrator may revoke, suspend, deny
or not renew a license, written notice must be sent to the applicant or
owner/licensee setting forth the alleged grounds for the potential action.
The notice must also specify a date for a hearing before the City Council,
which must not be less than ten days from the date of the notice. At the
hearing, the owner/licensee may present witnesses in their defense.



      (3)   After revocation, denial or non-renewal of a license,
the owner/licensee will not be eligible for any new rental license for a
period determined by the City Administrator, but not to exceed one year.



      (4)   A decision to revoke, suspend, deny or not renew a
license or application will specify the part or parts of the rental dwelling
to which it applies.  Until a license is reissued or reinstated, no rental
unit becoming vacant in such part or parts of the rental dwelling may be
relet or occupied.  Revocation, suspension or non-renewal of a license will
not excuse the owner/licensee from compliance with all terms of this section
for as long as any unit in the rental dwelling is occupied.



      (5)   Failure to comply with all terms of this section during
the term of revocation, suspension or non-renewal is a misdemeanor and
grounds for extension of the term of revocation, suspension or continuation
of non-renewal of the license.



      (6)   Appeal.  Following receipt of a decision by the City
Administrator to deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew a license, the
owner/licensee may request a hearing before the City Council.  The request
must be made in writing to the City Administrator within ten days of the City
Administrator's decision.



   (E)   [Reserved].



   (F)   Summary action.



      (1)   When the conduct of any owner/licensee or their agent,
representative, employee or lessee or the condition of their rental dwelling
is detrimental to the public health, sanitation, safety and general welfare
of the city at large or residents of the rental dwelling as to constitute a
nuisance, fire hazard or other unsafe or dangerous condition and thus give
rise to an emergency, the City Administrator has the authority to summarily
condemn or close off individual units or such areas of the rental dwelling. 
Notice of summary condemnation must be posted at the location of the rental
dwelling license and at the units or areas affected and shall indicate the
units or areas affected.  Upon notice of summary condemnation, the City
Administrator may deny, revoke, suspend or decline to renew the license for
all or any part or parts of the rental dwelling or may impose terms and
conditions as necessary to remedy the nuisance, fire hazard, or other unsafe
or dangerous condition.



      (2)   Any person aggrieved by a decision or action of the City
Administrator under division (F) shall be entitled to appeal to the City
Council by filing a notice of appeal in the office of the City
Administrator.  The appeal must be filed within ten days of the City
Administrator's decision. The City Administrator will schedule a date for a
hearing before the City Council and notify the aggrieved person of the date.



      (3)   The hearing must be conducted in the same manner as if
the aggrieved person had not received summary action.



      (4)   The decision of the City Administrator is not voided by
the filing of such appeal.  Only after the Council has held its hearing will
the decision or action of the City Administrator be affected.

FOR A USE ASSOCIATED WITH AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR OR OUTDOOR STORAGE OR SALES OF
RECREATIONAL VEHICLES OR TRAILERS, TRUCKS OR AUTOMOBILES IN THE HIGHWAY
COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (C-2) AND IN THE MANUFACTURING AND INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
(M).



   (A)   Authority.  Pursuant to M.S. § 462.355, Subd.  4, the city
is authorized to establish interim ordinances to regulate, restrict or
prohibit any use or development in all or part of the city while the city is
conducting studies, or has authorized a study to be conducted, or has
scheduled a hearing to consider adoption or amendment of the comprehensive
plan or official zoning controls.  In furtherance of this statutory
authority, the city has adopted Chapter 153, the zoning ordinance, including
§ 153.152 governing amendment of the zoning ordinance.  The city declares
that this interim section is adopted pursuant to M.S. § 462.355, Subd. 4,
and the applicable provisions of Osseo Code of Ordinances, Chapter 153.



   (B)   Findings and purpose. 



      (1)   The City Council is concerned about the effects of
conditional uses in the Highway Commercial District (C-2) and in the
Manufacturing and Industrial District (M), especially as certain conditional
uses are incompatible with the design and use of permitted uses in these
districts and may detract from the desirability of these districts as places
to establish businesses that are permitted uses in these districts. The City
Council is also concerned that certain conditional uses may negatively affect
the elimination of blighted properties.  The City Council is also concerned
that certain conditional uses may negatively impact adjoining residential
districts by the creation or allowing of night lighting, noise and outside
storage of vehicles and other business property.



      (2)   The City Council is currently studying a master plan for
redevelopment in the city and is concurrently studying changes to the
comprehensive plan.  The City Council is interested in promoting the
economic vitality of the Highway Commercial District and the Manufacturing
and Industrial District.  Several sites are currently available for new
businesses within the study area.  The City Council is concerned that new
conditional uses in these districts could be in conflict with changes to the
comprehensive plan and could negatively affect existing and future commercial
development in these districts.



      (3)   As a result of the important land use and zoning issues
cited above, the city, through its Planning Commission, will conduct studies
to consider possible amendments to the comprehensive plan or official zoning
controls to address these issues.  The City Council finds that this interim
section should be adopted to protect the planning process and the public
health, safety, aesthetics, economic viability and general welfare of the
city.



   (C)   Zoning study.  The Highway Commercial District (C-2) and the
Manufacturing and Industrial District (M), as shown on the City of Osseo
Zoning Map (§ 153.021, Appendix D), is hereby declared to be an interim
zoning study area with respect to any uses other than those currently listed
as permitted uses in those respective zoning districts.  The Planning
Commission is directed to commence a planning study of the effects of certain
uses in these districts and to propose such amendments to the comprehensive
plan or zoning controls related to uses that the Planning Commission deems
advisable.



   (D)   Restrictions.  For a period of one year from the effective
date of this section, no approval of any conditional use permit for a use
associated with automotive repair or outdoor storage or sales of recreational
vehicles or trailers, trucks, or automobiles shall be granted for any
property in the Highway Commercial District (C-2) or the Manufacturing and
Industrial District (M), except as may be granted based upon hardship.  The
City Council specifically reserves the right to extend this section for such
additional periods as are necessary to complete the planning study as
provided by state law.



   (E)   Hardship.  In a case of hardship, any person having a legal
or equitable interest in land and aggrieved by the provisions of this interim
section may apply to the City Council for a waiver of all or a portion of the
applicable restrictions as provided herein.  A waiver may be granted where
the City Council finds substantial hardship caused by the restrictions and
finds that a waiver will not unduly affect the integrity of the planning
process or the purposes for which the interim section is enacted.

§ 153.041  PROVIDING FOR A MORATORIUM ON GRANTING CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
FOR USES IN THE CBD, CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT ASSOCIATED WITH: DRIVE-IN
BUSINESSES; MINOR AUTO SERVICE STATIONS FOR RETAIL SALE AND SERVICE;
MORTUARIES; AND DRY CLEANING, LAUNDRY, LINEN TOWELS, DIAPER, AND SIMILAR
SUPPLY SERVICES.



   (A)   Authority.  Pursuant to M.S. § 462.355, Subd. 4, as may be
amended from time to time, the City of Osseo is authorized to establish
interim ordinances to regulate, restrict or prohibit any use or development
in all or part of the city while the city is conducting studies, or has
authorized a study to be conducted, or has scheduled a hearing to consider
adoption or amendment of the comprehensive plan or official zoning
controls.  In furtherance of this statutory authority, the City of Osseo has
adopted Chapter 153 of its Code of Ordinances, the zoning ordinance,
including § 153.152 governing amendment of the zoning ordinance.  The City
of Osseo declares that this interim ordinance is adopted pursuant to M.S. §
462.355, Subd. 4, as may be amended from time to time, and the applicable
provisions of Osseo Code of Ordinances, Chapter 153.



   (B)   Findings and purpose. 



      (1)   The City Council is concerned about the effects of
certain conditional uses in the Central Business District (CBD). The city
forwarded its draft 2030 Comprehensive Plan Update to the Metropolitan
Council by December 31, 2008, per M.S. § 473.864, Subd. 2, as may be amended
from time to time. On April 8, 2009, the Metropolitan Council officially
recommended that the city put its plan into effect. Now the city will need to
officially adopt the 2030 Comprehensive Plan update and has nine  months to
make necessary zoning amendments in order to ensure there are no conflicts
between the existing zoning ordinance and the 2030 Comprehensive Plan Update.
As such, the city will be revising its zoning ordinance.



      (2)   The 2030 Comprehensive Plan Update guides for mixed-use
and pedestrian-oriented development in the CBD area. The city's existing
zoning ordinance allows for several conditionally permitted uses that are
automobile-oriented and thus appear inconsistent with the future land use of
the area and also the future zoning of the area. Per § 153.037, these
conditionally permitted uses are: drive-in businesses; minor auto service
stations for retail sale and service; mortuaries; and dry cleaning, laundry,
linen towels, diaper, and similar supply services.



   (C)   Zoning study.  Above and beyond the general zoning amendments
that will be made over the next nine months, the CBD, Central Business
District as shown on the City of Osseo Zoning Map (§ 153.021, Appendix D),
is hereby declared to be an interim zoning study area with respect to
automobile-oriented businesses. The Planning Commission is directed to
commence a planning study of the effects of certain uses in these districts
and to propose such amendments to the zoning ordinance related to uses that
the Planning Commission deems advisable.



   (D)   Restrictions.  For a period of one year from the effective
date of this section, no approval of any conditional use permit for a use
associated with drive-in businesses; minor auto service stations for retail
sale and service; mortuaries; and dry cleaning, laundry, linen towels,
diaper, and similar supply services shall be granted for any property in the
CBD, Central Business District, except as may be granted based upon
hardship.  The City Council specifically reserves the right to extend this
section for such additional periods as are necessary to complete the planning
study as provided by state law.



   (E)   Hardship.  In a case of hardship, any person having a legal
or equitable interest in land and aggrieved by the provisions of this interim
section may apply to the City Council for a waiver of all or a portion of the
applicable restrictions as provided herein.  A waiver may be granted where
the City Council finds substantial hardship caused by the restrictions and
finds that a waiver will not unduly affect the integrity of the planning
process or the purposes for which the interim section is enacted.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS



§ 153.050  SPECIAL REGULATIONS; PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.



   Every use permitted by this chapter shall be so established and
maintained as to comply with the provisions of the following performance
standards.



   (A)   Residual features.  No activity or operation shall be
established or maintained which by reason of its nature or manner of
operation will cause the emission of noise, odor, toxic or noxious fumes,
gases, smoke, dust, and particulate matter in concentrations so as to be
detrimental to or endanger the public health, welfare, comfort, and safety or
cause injury to property or business.



   (B)   Glare.  Direct or reflected glare, such as from floodlights,
spotlights, or high temperature processes, and as differentiated from general
illumination, shall not be visible beyond the site of origin at any property
line.  Any lighting used for exterior illumination (including off-street
parking areas) shall be directed away from adjacent properties.



   (C)   Vibration.  No activity shall at any time cause earth
vibrations perceptible beyond the limits of the site on which the use is
located.  Vibrations created during the process of construction are exempt
from this standard.



   (D)   Explosives.  Any use requiring the storage, utilization, or
manufacturing of products which should decompose by detonation shall be
located not less than 400 feet from any residential district.  This standard
shall not apply to the storage or usage of liquefied petroleum or natural gas
for normal residential or commercial purposes.



   (E)   Waste material.  In commercial or industrial districts,
without first having received a permit to do so from the city, liquid wastes
containing any organic or toxic matter shall not be washed into the public
sanitary sewer system or storm sewer system.  If this permit is not granted,
a method of disposal shall be devised which will not require continuous land
acquisition for permanent operation and will not cause a detrimental effect
to adjacent land.  Should the waste be of solid form rather than fluid, it
shall be stored within a completely enclosed structure or contained in a
closed container designed for that purpose.  Such a waste storage structure
or container shall be so located and fenced as to be removed from public
view.  In all districts, all waste material, debris, refuse, garbage, and
materials not currently in use for construction or otherwise regulated
herein, shall be kept in an enclosed building or property and contained in a
closed container designed for that purpose.  The owner of vacant land shall
be responsible for keeping that vacant land free of waste material and
noxious weeds.



   (F)   Radiation and electrical emissions.  No activities shall be
permitted that emit dangerous radioactivity beyond enclosed areas.  There
shall be no electrical disturbance (except from domestic household
appliances) adversely affecting the operation at any point of any equipment
including but not limited to radio and television reception other than that
of the creator of the disturbance.



   (G)   Traffic control.  The traffic generated by any use shall be
channeled and controlled in a manner that will avoid congestion on public
streets, safety hazards, and excessive traffic through residential areas. 
Traffic into and out of all commercial and industrial uses and areas shall in
all cases be forward moving with no backing onto streets or pedestrian
ways.  No access drive to any lot shall be located within 30 feet of any two
intersecting street right-of-way lines.



   (H)   Land slope.  No building or structure shall be constructed on
slopes of 18% or more in grade.

   (A)   Land alteration restricted; exceptions.  Land alteration is
the process of changing the existing landscape by excavating, filling, or
grading.  Subject to the exceptions set forth below, no land shall be
altered, excavated, filled, or graded and no vegetation shall be removed
without first obtaining a permit from the city.  The following exceptions
shall be allowed:



      (1)   A fill less than one foot in depth and placed on natural

without a building permit.  The application shall be accompanied by a plot
plan clearly describing the type, location, and method of anchoring the fence.



      (2)   Boundary line fences shall be located entirely upon the
private property of the party constructing the fence unless the owner of the
property of the adjoining property agrees, in writing, that the fence may be
erected on the division line of the respective properties.  The persons,
firms, or corporations constructing or causing the construction of the fence
shall be responsible for maintaining that part of their property between
fence and property line.  City staff will require any applicant for a fence
permit to establish the boundary lines of his or her property by a survey
thereof to be made by any registered land surveyor or by showing the stake
markers of the surveyed lot.



      (3)   Permanent fencing is required to meet the standards of
the State Building Code.



   (B)   Fencing standards for all districts.  Fencing in all

exposed outer surface shall be uniformly painted or stained in a neat and
aesthetically pleasing condition.



      (2)   No fence shall be permitted on a public right-of-way or
boulevard area without special permission from the City Council.



      (3)   No fence shall be erected on a corner lot that will
obstruct or impede the clear view of an intersection by approaching traffic.



      (4)   All snow-stop fencing may be used from November 1 to
April 1.  No permit shall be required for temporary fencing.



      (5)   Any fence which is dangerous to the public safety or
general welfare and health is a public nuisance and the city may commence
proceedings for the abatement thereof.  Electric fences may not be used as
boundary fences, and material such as hog wire fencing, barbed wire fencing,
or snow fencing will not be allowed as permanent fencing.



      (6)   The side of the fence considered to be the face
(finished side as opposed to structural supports) shall face abutting
property.  Abutting property owners will be notified by the constructor of
the fence five calendar days before the building permit is issued.



   (C)   Fencing standards in residential districts (R-1 and R-2).



      (1)   A fence may be located along the rear lot line to a
maximum height of up to six feet and to a maximum height of six feet along
the side lot lines up to the point where it is parallel with the front edge
of the house.  From this point forward to the right-of-way, the height of
the fence shall not exceed three feet.  Any fence that crosses the width of
the front yard shall not exceed three feet in height.  The maximum height
may be increased to four feet if the material type of the fence is not more
than 50% opaque (such as, chain link).  A variance is needed for fences
exceeding the above mentioned heights.  The front of a house situated on a
corner lot shall be the architectural front of the house facing the street
from which the house is addressed.  No fence may be placed in violation of
the restrictions of this section.  Refer to Appendix A.

      (4)   The city's zoning regulations include the regulation of
signs in an effort to provide adequate means of expression and to promote the
economic viability of the business community, while protecting the city and
its citizens from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, location, and
character that would adversely impact the aesthetics of the community and
threaten its health, safety, and welfare. The regulation of the physical
characteristics of signs within the city has a positive impact on traffic
safety and the appearance of the community.



   (B)   Purpose and intent. It is not the purpose or intent of this
section to regulate the message displayed on any sign, except as provided for
in § 153.092(B)(10), nor is it the purpose or intent of this section to
regulate any building design or any display not defined as a sign, or any
sign which cannot be viewed from outside a building. The purpose and intent
of this section is to:



      (1)   Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination,
and other physical characteristics of signs within the city in order to
promote the public health, safety, and welfare;

of the city by preventing visual clutter that is harmful to the appearance of
the community;

aesthetic; and



      (4)   Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign
regulations set forth herein under the zoning authority of the city.



   (C)   Effect. A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed, or
maintained in the city if it is in conformance with the provisions of these
regulations. The effect of this section, as more specifically set forth
herein, is to:



      (1)   Allow a wide variety of sign types in non-residential
zones, and a more limited variety of signs in residential zones, subject to
the standards set forth in this subchapter;



      (2)   Allow certain small, unobtrusive signs incidental to the
principal use of a site in all zones when in compliance with the requirements
of this subchapter or when required by federal, state, or local law;



      (3)   Prohibit signs whose location, size, type, illumination,
or other physical characteristics negatively affect the environment and where
the communication can be accomplished by means having a lesser impact on the
environment and the public health, safety, and welfare; and



      (4)   Provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this
subchapter.

   (A)   Noncommercial speech; substitution clause. The owner of any
sign which is otherwise allowed by this subchapter may substitute
noncommercial copy in lieu of any other noncommercial or commercial copy.
This substitution of copy may be made without any additional approval or
permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent
favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any
particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This
provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary.



   (B)   Nonconforming signs. Nonconforming signs shall be treated like
other nonconforming uses as provided in § 153.130 of this code, or as
otherwise specified in state statute.



   (C)   Process and enforcement.



      (1)   Administration. The provisions of this subchapter shall
be administered and enforced by the Zoning Administrator, or their designee
who may have other municipal duties. Their duties shall include, but not be
limited to:



         (a)   Determining whether all sign permit applications
comply with the terms of this subchapter; and



         (b)   Conducting site inspections to determine
compliance with the terms of this subchapter.



      (2)   Variances. Any request for variation from the provisions
of this subchapter shall be brought under the terms of § 153.150 of this
code and applicable Minnesota State Law.



      (3)   Appeals. Any appeal to a decision made under this
subchapter shall be brought under the terms of § 153.147 of this code.



      (4)   Unlawful signs. Signs placed upon public property, or
within the public right-of- way, or in violation of the terms of this
section, shall be immediately determined to be abandoned under this section.
Abandoned signs shall be subject to removal by the city. Upon removal, the
Zoning Administrator, or their designee, shall mark the date of removal of
the sign and hold it for 45 days at the city offices. The owner of the sign
may collect the sign from the city offices at any point during that time. If
the sign is not retrieved within 45 days, the city may destroy the sign.



   (D)   Violations; separate offense. Each day that the violation
continues shall constitute a separate offense. Violations of this subchapter

§ 153.099  MORATORIUM ON OFF-SITE, FREESTANDING SIGNS.



   (A)   Authority.  Pursuant to M.S. § 462.355, Subd. 4, the city is
authorized to establish interim ordinances to regulate, restrict or prohibit
any use or development in all or part of the city while the city is
conducting studies, or has authorized a study to be conducted, or has
scheduled a hearing to consider adoption or amendment of the comprehensive
plan or official zoning controls. In furtherance of this statutory authority,
the city has adopted Chapter 153, the zoning ordinance, including § 153.152
governing amendment of the zoning ordinance. The city declares that this
interim section is adopted pursuant to M.S. § 462.355, Subd. 4, and the
applicable provisions of Osseo Code of Ordinances, Chapter 153.



   (B)   Findings and purpose.  There is a need to study signage
within the existing ordinances of the city so as to address the location,
construction, altering, development, erection, placement, reconstruction, or
enlargement of off-site, freestanding signs; and to determine these and other
issues so as to realistically assess the manner of regulatory controls that
may need to be adopted by the city affecting the location, deployment, and
use of such signage; and to provide for the public health, safety, and
welfare of all individuals. The City Council will be studying all such
related issues through the City Planner and Planning Commission. A moratorium
is required in order to protect this planning process.



   (C)   Moratorium established and scope.  In accordance with the
findings set forth within this section and pursuant to the authority of M.S.
§ 462.355, Subd. 4, there is hereby established a moratorium on the
location, construction, altering, development, erection, placement,
reconstruction, or enlargement of any signage or like structures within the
city. During the period of time of the moratorium application for sign
permits for off-site, freestanding signage and all other permits and
approvals related to such work shall not be accepted by the city.



   (D)   Applicability.  The moratorium shall be applied upon real
property designated within all zoning districts of the city.



   (E)   Hardship.  In a case of hardship, any person having a legal
or equitable interest in land and aggrieved by the provisions of this interim
section may apply to the City Council for a waiver of all or a portion of the
applicable restrictions as provided herein. A waiver may be granted where the
City Council finds substantial hardship caused by the restrictions and finds
that a waiver will not unduly affect the integrity of the planning process or
the purposes for which the interim section is enacted.



   (F)   Penalty.  Any person, corporation or other entity that
constructs, erects, reconstructs, enlarges locates or expands a sign
structure or related facility in violation of this section shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor and shall be subject to any legal and/or equitable remedies
available to the city.



   (G)   Effective date.  This section shall be in full force and
effect from and after its passage and publication according to law and shall
remain effective until August 31, 2010, unless shortened or further extended
by order of the City Council.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS



§ 153.110  DEFINITION.



   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT or PUD.  A zoning district which may include
single or mixed uses, one or more lots or parcels, intended to create a more
flexible, creative, and efficient approach to the use of land, and subject to
the procedures, standards, and regulations contained in this subchapter. 
The planned development provisions are intended to:



      (1)   Protect natural features in private, common, or public
open space;



      (2)   Improve the efficiency of public streets and utilities;



      (3)   Provide transitions in land use in keeping with the
character of adjacent land use; or



      (4)   Improve the arrangement of structures, facilities, and
amenities on a site for both private and public benefit.



(1997 Code, § 25.12)  (Ord. passed 11-14-1994; Am. Ord. passed 2-25-2002)



§ 153.111  DEVELOPMENT REVIEW COMMITTEE.



   The Development Review Committee referred to in this subchapter shall
be appointed by the City Council, consisting of representatives from the City
Council, Planning Commission, Economic Development Authority, and the city at
large, and will conduct a review of all development plans.



(1997 Code, § 25.12)  (Ord. passed 11-14-1994; Am. Ord. passed 2-25-2002)



§ 153.112  ALLOWANCES.



   (A)   Variety.  Within a comprehensive site design concept, a
mixture of land uses, housing types, and densities may be allowed.



   (B)   Sensitivity.  Through the departure from the strict
application of required setbacks, yard areas, lot sizes, minimum house sizes,
minimum requirements, and other performance standards associated with
traditional zoning, planned unit development can maximize the development
potential of land while remaining sensitive to its unique and valuable
natural characteristics.



   (C)   Efficiency.  The consolidation for recreation and reductions
in street lengths and other utility-related expenses may be achieved.



   (D)   Density transfer.  The project density may be clustered,
basing density on number of units per acre versus specific lot dimensions.



   (E)   District integration.  The combination of uses which are
allowed in separate zoning districts, such as:



      (1)   Mixed residential allows both densities and unit types
to be varied within the project;



      (2)   Mixed residential with increased density acknowledges
the greater sensitivity of PUD projects; regulation provides density on the
property if a PUD is utilized; and



      (3)   Mixed land uses with the integration of compatible land
uses within the project may be allowed in a planned unit development.



(1997 Code, § 25.12)  (Ord. passed 11-14-1994; Am. Ord. passed 2-25-2002)



§ 153.113  ALLOWED USES.



   Uses within the PUD may include only those uses generally considered
associated with the general land use category shown for the area on the
official Comprehensive Land Use Plan.  However, in some unique situations,
the PUD may allow the approval of use or uses that are not listed as either
permitted or conditional uses in any underlying zoning district.  The
specific allowed uses and performance standards for each PUD shall be
delineated in an ordinance and development plan.  The PUD development plan
shall identify all the proposed land uses, and those uses shall become
permitted uses when the development plan is approved.  Any change in the
list of uses presented in the development plan will be considered an
amendment to the PUD and will follow the procedures as specified in §
153.152 of this code.



(1997 Code, § 25.12)  (Ord. passed 11-14-1994; Am. Ord. passed 2-25-2002)



§ 153.114  REQUIRED STANDARDS.



   The city shall consider the proposed PUD from the point of view of all
standards and purposes of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan to achieve a
maximum coordination between the proposed development and the surrounding
uses, the conservation of woodlands and wetlands, and the protection of
health, safety, and welfare of the community and residents of the PUD.  To
these ends, the City Council shall consider the location of the buildings,
compatibility, parking areas, and other features with respect to the
topography of the area and existing natural features such as streams and
large trees; the efficiency, adequacy, and safety of the proposed layout of
internal streets and driveways; and other matters as the City Council may
find to have a material bearing upon the stated standards and objectives of
the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.



(1997 Code, § 25.12)  (Ord. passed 11-14-1994; Am. Ord. passed 2-25-2002)



§ 153.115  REVISIONS OR CHANGES.



   (A)   Minor changes in location, placement, and height.  Minor
changes in the location, placement, and height of structures may be
recommended by the Development Review Committee if required by engineering or
other circumstances not foreseen at the time the final plan was approved and
filed with the City Planner.



   (B)   Significant changes in use, location, size, and height. 
Changes in uses, significant changes in location, size, or height of
structures, any rearrangement of lots, blocks, and building tracts, changes
in provision of common open spaces, and all other changes to the approved
final development plan may be made only after a public hearing conducted by
the Planning Commission.  Upon determination by the Development Review
Committee that a major change has been proposed, the applicant shall apply
for an amended PUD.  The application to amend the PUD shall be treated as a
rezoning application.  The Planning Commission shall hold a hearing as set
forth in § 153.152 of this code, and make recommendations to the Council. 
Any changes shall be recorded as amendments to the recorded copy of the final
development plan.



   (C)   Provisions of original district apply.  All of the provisions
of the chapter applicable to the original district within the planned unit
development district as established shall apply to the amended PUD district
except as otherwise provided in approval of the final plan.  The effective
date of the PUD shall be after:



      (1)   Approval of the PUD amendment and text; and



      (2)   Publication of the ordinance.



   (D)   Review.  If substantial development has not occurred within a
reasonable time after approval of the PUD zoning district, the City Council
may instruct the Planning Commission to initiate rezoning to the original
zoning district.  It shall not be necessary for the City Council to find
that the rezoning was in error.



   (E)   Formal review periods.  Within the PUD agreement, the city
may schedule formal City Council review periods on an annual or five-year
basis to ascertain that actual development on the site meets the conditions
of the approved PUD.



(1997 Code, § 25.12)  (Ord. passed 11-14-1994; Am. Ord. passed 2-25-2002)



§ 153.116  PHASING SCHEDULE; PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE.



   (A)   Comparison with approved development schedule.  The Planning
Commission shall compare the actual development accomplished in the various
PUD zones with the approved development schedule.



   (B)   Extension of limits of development schedule.  Upon
recommendation of the Planning Commission and for good cause shown by the
property owner, the City Council may extend the limits of the development
schedule.



   (C)   Construction rates of dwelling and open space.  The
construction and provision of all of the common open space and public and
recreational facilities which are shown on the final development plan must
proceed at the same rate as the construction of dwelling units, if any.  The
Development Review Committee shall review all of the building permits issued
for the PUD and examine the construction which has taken place on the site. 
If it finds that the rate of construction of dwelling units is greater than
the rate at which common open spaces and public and recreational facilities
have been constructed and provided, it shall forward this information to the
City Council for action.



   (D)   Performance bond.  A performance bond or letter of credit
shall be required to guarantee performance by the developer.  The amount of
this bond or letter of credit and the specific elements of the development
program that it is intended to guarantee will be stipulated in the
development agreement.



(1997 Code, § 25.12)  (Ord. passed 11-14-1994; Am. Ord. passed 2-25-2002)



§ 153.117  CONTROL OF PUD FOLLOWING COMPLETION.



   (A)   Final development plan governs.  After the certificate of
occupancy has been issued, the use of the land and the construction,
modifications, and alterations of any buildings or structures within the
planned development shall be governed by the final development plan.



   (B)   Changes after issuance of certificate of occupancy.  After
the certificate of occupancy has been issued, no changes shall be made in the
approved final development plan except upon application as provided below.



      (1)   Any minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of
proposed or existing buildings or structures may be recommended by the
Development Review Committee if they are consistent with the purposes and
intent of the final plan.  No change authorized by this section may increase
the footprint of any building or structure, the number of required access
points, or parking spaces by more than 10%.



      (2)   Any building or structure that is totally or
substantially destroyed may be reconstructed only in compliance with the
final development plan unless an amendment to the final development plan is
approved under this chapter.



      (3)   Changes in the use of the common open spaces may be
recommended by an amendment to the final development plan by the Planning
Commission after a public hearing as provided in § 153.152 of this code and
without all the documents necessary for the original application.



      (4)   Any other changes in the final development plan must be
authorized by an amendment of the final development plan under this chapter.



   (C)   Additional action by city.  Nothing herein contained shall
prevent the city from taking other lawful action as is necessary to prevent
or remedy any violation.



(1997 Code, § 25.12)  (Ord. passed 11-14-1994; Am. Ord. passed 2-25-2002)

   (A)   Application conference.  Upon filing of an application for a
PUD, the applicant of the proposed PUD shall arrange for and attend a
conference with the City Planner.  The primary purpose of the conference
shall be to provide the applicant with an opportunity to gather information
and obtain guidance as to the general suitability of applicant’s proposal
for the area for which it is proposed and its conformity to the provisions of
this chapter before incurring substantial expense in the preparation of
plans, surveys, and other data.



   (B)   Sketch plan.  The sketch plan provides an opportunity for an
applicant to submit an informal plan to the city showing the applicant’s
basic intent and general nature of the development.  The sketch plan is
optional and is intended to provide feedback from the Planning Commission
before the applicant incurs substantial cost in the preparation of formal
plans.  The sketch plan shall be considered a partial, incomplete
application prior to formal submittal of the complete application and
scheduling of hearings.



   (C)   General concept plan.  The purpose of a general development
concept plan is to formally present a planned unit development and
preliminary plat application in a public hearing before the Planning
Commission as set forth in §§ 153.110et seq. and 153.145et seq. of this
code.  The plan shall include the following:



      (1)   Overall maximum PUD density range;



      (2)   General location of major streets and pedestrian ways;



      (3)   General location and extent of public and common and
open space;



      (4)   General location of residential and non-residential land
uses with approximate type of intensities of development;



      (5)   Staging and time schedule of development; and



      (6)   Other special criteria for development.



   (D)   Final development plan.  Following general concept
development approval, if given, the applicant shall submit the final
development stage application and final plat.  The application shall proceed
and be acted upon in accordance with §§ 153.145et seq. of this code for
zoning district changes.  If appropriate, because of the limited scale of
the proposal, the concept stage and development stages may proceed
simultaneously.



      (1)   Schedule.



         (a)   The developer meets with the City Planner to
discuss the proposed developments.



         (b)   The applicant shall file the concept plan
application and preliminary plat, together with all supporting data.



         (c)   Within 30 days after verification by the City
Planner that the required plan and supporting data are adequate, the Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing as provided for in §§ 153.110et seq.
and 153.145et seq. of this code.



         (d)   The Planning Commission shall conduct the hearing
and report its findings and make recommendations to the City Council.  The
procedure shall be that set forth in §§ 153.110et seq. and 153.145et seq.
of this code.



         (e)   The city may request additional information from
the applicant concerning operational factors or retain expert testimony at
the expense of the applicant concerning operational factors.



         (f)   If the Planning Commission fails to make a report
within ten days after completion of the hearing, then the City Council may
proceed as provided for in §§ 153.110et seq. and 153.145et seq. of this
code without the report.  The City Council shall assign an ordinance
numerical reference to each final plan and PUD agreement text approved.  The
City Council may attach additional conditions as it deems reasonable. 
Approval shall require a majority vote of the City Council.  After approval
by the City Council, the PUD zoning ordinance map amendment shall be
published, with reference made to the PUD agreement text.  The applicant
shall be responsible for recording the ordinance and PUD agreement with the
County Recorder’s Office prior to issuance of any building permit or within
60 days, whichever is less.  The official PUD ordinance and agreement shall
also be filed in the Administrator-Clerk-Treasurer’s office.

NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES, USES, AND LOTS



§ 153.130  NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES AND USES.



   (A)   Existing uses.  The lawful use of any land or building
existing at the time of the adoption of this zoning chapter on November 14,
1994 may be continued, at the size and in the manner of operation existing on
that date, even if the use does not conform to the regulations of this
chapter, and if the use has not at any time been discontinued and continues
to exist on the date of the adoption of this chapter.  The use, however,
shall be subject to the provisions following in this subchapter.



   (B)   Non-conforming use not made conforming.  The use of any land
or buildings that did not conform to the provisions of the prior city zoning
ordinance adopted December 29, 1955, or amendments thereto, do not become
conforming uses under this chapter unless specifically provided in this
chapter.  This chapter does not make permitted uses out of any uses that
were not permitted under the prior city zoning ordinance unless specifically
permitted by this chapter.



   (C)   Restrictions on changes.



      (1)   Repair or maintenance.  A non-conforming building or
structure may be repaired or maintained, subject to the limitations of this
chapter.



      (2)   Enlargement.  A non-conforming building or structure
shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless the additions or
enlargements are made to bring the building or structure into conformity with
the regulations of this chapter.



      (3)   Restoration.  A non-conforming building or structure
which is damaged by fire or other cause to an extent of more than 50% of its
market value shall not be restored except in conformity with the regulations
of this chapter.  However, if a building permit has been applied for within
180 days of when the building or structure is damaged, then the building or
structure may be restored to its pre-damage non-conforming status subject to
the applicability of the Minnesota State Building Code and other requirements
of the Osseo Code of Ordinances.



      (4)   Maintenance.  Normal maintenance of a non-conforming
building or structure is permitted; including necessary non-structural
repairs and incidental alterations which do not physically extend or
intensify the non-conforming use.



      (5)   Enlargement or alteration.  No non-conforming structure
or use shall be enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area
than was occupied when the use became non-conforming, except in the following
case:  a non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were arranged or designed for that use when the use became
non-conforming, but no such use shall be extended to occupy land outside the
building.



      (6)   Relocation.  No non-conforming use or structure shall
be moved in whole or in part to any other part of the parcel of land upon
which the same was conducted at the time of passage of this chapter, nor
shall that use or structure be moved in whole or in part to any other lot,
except to bring it into conformance with the regulations of this chapter.



      (7)   Discontinuance or abandonment.  A non-conforming use or
structure that has been discontinued or abandoned for more than one year
shall not be re-established, and any future use shall be in conformity with
the regulations of this chapter.



      (8)   Status change. A non-conforming use of a building or
land may be changed to a similar non-conforming use or a more restrictive
non-conforming use.  Once a structure or parcel of land has been changed to
a more restrictive non-conforming use, it shall not return to a less
restrictive use.



         (a)   When a non-conforming structure or use of land has
been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to
a non-conforming use.



         (b)   When a non-conforming use or structure meets the
requirements for, and is granted, a conditional use permit as an allowed
conditional use in that district, the use or structure is thereafter deemed a
conforming use.

§ 153.131  NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.



   (A)   Dwellings on small lots.  In any district in which one-family
dwellings are permitted, a one-family dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, notwithstanding limitations imposed by
other provisions of this chapter.  The lot must be in separate ownership. 
This provision shall apply even though the lot fails to meet the requirements
for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district,
provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to
area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which the lot is located, but in no case shall building be
permitted on a lot less than 50 feet in width.  Variance of yard
requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Appeals.



   (B)   Lots in the same ownership.  If two or more lots, or
combinations of lots and portions of lots, with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter,
and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for
lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided
parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no portion of the parcel shall
be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and
area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of any
parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements
stated in this chapter.

§ 153.149  BUILDING PERMITS.



   (A)   Building permits.  Hereafter no person shall erect, alter,

§ 153.150  VARIANCES.



   (A)   General.  Variations from the provisions of this chapter may
be granted by the Board of Appeals only in instances where the strict
enforcement of this chapter would cause undue hardship because of
circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, and only
when it is demonstrated that the variance will be in keeping with the spirit
and intent of this chapter.  Undue hardship, as used in connection with the
granting of a variance means the property in question cannot be put to a
reasonable use if used under conditions allowed by the official controls, the
plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not
created by the landowner, and the variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the locality.  Economic considerations alone shall
not constitute an undue hardship if reasonable use for the property exists
under the terms of the ordinance.  Undue hardship also includes, but is not
limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. 
Variances shall be granted for earth sheltered construction as defined in
section M.S. § 216C.06, Subd. 2, as it may be amended from time to time,
when in harmony with this chapter.  The Board of Appeals may not permit as a
variance any use that is not permitted under the ordinance for property in
the zone where the affected person’s land is located.  The Board may
permit as a variance the temporary use of a one-family dwelling as a
two-family dwelling.  The Board may impose restrictions and conditions upon
the premises benefitted by a variance as it considers necessary so that the
public health, safety, and general welfare may be secured and substantial
justice done.



   (B)   Exhibits.  Application for variances shall be accompanied by
the boundary survey and site plan as required for building permit
applications.



   (C)   Application procedure.  The procedure for applying for a
variance from the regulations of this chapter shall be as follows.



      (1)   The property owner or his or her agent shall meet with
the Zoning Officer to explain his or her situation, learn the procedures, and
obtain an application form.



      (2)   The applicant shall file the completed application form,
together with the required exhibits, with the Zoning Officer and shall pay
the required filing fee.



      (3)   The Zoning Officer shall transmit the application and
one copy of the exhibits to the Chair of the Board of Appeals and Planning
Commission.



      (4)   The Planning Commission shall consider the application
for variance and make recommendations to the Board of Appeals.



      (5)   The Board of Appeals may hold public hearings as it may
consider necessary on a proposed variance.



   (D)   Standards for granting variance.  The Board of Appeals may
vary the regulations of this chapter when supporting evidence in each
specific case indicates that:



      (1)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape,
or topographic conditions of the specific parcel of land involved, a
particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;



      (2)   The conditions upon which the petition for a variance is
based are unique to the parcel of land for which the variance is sought and
are not applicable, generally, to other property with the same zoning
classification;



      (3)   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively
upon a desire to increase the value or income potential of the parcel of land;



      (4)   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by the
provisions of this chapter and has not been created by any persons presently
or formerly having an interest in the parcel of land;



      (5)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other land or improvements in the vicinity
in which the parcel of land is located;



      (6)   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply
of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase congestion
of the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public
safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the
vicinity; and



      (7)   Adherence to the regulations of this chapter would
create an undue hardship because of inadequate access to direct sunlight for
solar energy systems.

§ 153.151  CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.



   (A)   Permit required.  Before a building or premises is devoted to
any use classified under conditional uses in this chapter, a conditional use
permit must be granted by the City Council following a recommendation by the
Planning Commission.



   (B)   Exhibits.  The following exhibits shall be required:



      (1)   The boundary survey and site plan as required for
building permit applications; and



      (2)   Elevation drawings indicating the design treatment of
all proposed buildings and structures, and general floor plans of the
buildings.



   (C)   Procedures.  The procedure for obtaining a conditional use
permit is as follows.



      (1)   The property owner or his or her agent shall meet with
the Zoning Officer to explain his or her situation, learn the procedures, and
obtain an application form.



      (2)   The applicant shall file the completed application form,
together with the required exhibits, with the Zoning Officer and shall pay
the required filing fee.



      (3)   The Zoning Officer shall transmit the application and
exhibits to the Planning Commission and shall place the matter on the next
Planning Commission agenda.



      (4)   The Planning Commission shall study the application to
determine possible adverse effects of the proposed conditional use and to
determine what additional requirements may be necessary to reduce those
adverse effects, and shall recommend one of three actions:  approval,
denial, or conditional approval.  The Planning Commission may hold public
hearings as it may consider necessary on a proposal for a conditional use
permit.



      (5)   The Planning Commission shall transmit its
recommendation to the City Council for its official action.



      (6)   The City Council shall act on the application after
receiving the recommendation of the Planning Commission.



   (D)   Standards for granting conditional use permits. 



      (1)   A conditional use permit may be granted by the City
Council after demonstration by evidence that:



         (a)   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of
the conditional use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health,
safety, comfort, or general welfare;



         (b)   The conditional use will not be injurious to the
use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purpose
already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values
within the neighborhood;



         (c)   The establishment of the conditional use will not
impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding
property for uses permitted in the district;



         (d)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and
necessary facilities have been or will be provided;



         (e)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to
provide ingress or egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in
the public streets; and



         (f)   The conditional use shall, in all other respects,
conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located.



      (2)   The Planning Commission may recommend, and the City
Council may determine, conditions and restrictions upon the establishment,
location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the conditional use as
deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure
compliance with the requirements specified in this chapter.



   (E)   Revocation of conditional use permits.



      (1)   Where a conditional use permit has been issued pursuant
to the provisions of this chapter, the permit shall become null and void
without further action by the Planning Commission or the City Council unless
work thereon commences within one year of the date of granting that
conditional use.  A conditional use permit shall be deemed to authorize only
one particular use and shall expire if that use shall cease for more than 12
consecutive months.



      (2)   Failure to comply with any condition set forth in a
conditional use permit shall be a misdemeanor and shall also constitute
sufficient cause for the revocation of the conditional use permit by the City
Council following a public hearing.  The property owner shall be notified in
advance of the City Council’s review of the permit.



      (3)   Inspections will be conducted at least annually to
determine compliance with the terms of a conditional use permit.



   (F)   Uses by conditional use permit not non-conforming uses.  Uses
authorized by conditional permit under this section shall not be deemed a
non-conforming use, but shall without further action be considered a
conforming use, but only in accordance with the conditions set forth in the
conditional use permit.

§ 153.157  CONSISTENCY WITH STATE LAW.



   Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, the
provisions of M.S. § 15.99, as it may be amended from time to time, and the
following sections shall govern the process for making decisions under this
chapter.  To the extent to which these sections conflict with the provisions
of M.S. § 15.99, as it may be amended from time to time, the provisions of
the statute shall apply.



(Am. Ord. 2005-4, passed 7-11-2005)



§ 153.158  APPLICATIONS.



   (A)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, all
applications for any site plan, conditional use permit, variance, or for any
other city approval required by this chapter, or to amend this chapter, shall
be made in writing on a form provided by the city, if the city has a form, to
the Zoning Administrator.  The Zoning Administrator is authorized to reject
in writing any incomplete application within 15 business days of receipt if
the application is incomplete, stating the reasons for its rejection,
including what information is missing.  This rejection shall be sent by
first-class mail to the applicant.  Every application shall contain the
legal description of the property and a statement of the specific permit or
action being sought. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the
city from requesting additional information from the applicant upon which to
base a decision.



   (B)   If a dispute arises over a specific fee imposed by the city,
the amount of the fee must be deposited and held in escrow, and the person
aggrieved by the fee may appeal to district court, as provided by M.S. §
462.361, as it may be amended from time to time.  The application shall
proceed as if the fee had been paid, pending a decision of the court.



(Am. Ord. 2005-4, passed 7-11-2005)



§ 153.159  FINAL ACTIONS.



   (A)   As required by M.S. § 15.99, as it may be amended from time
to time, the following provisions apply to the process for approving or
denying applications for a zoning amendment, site plan, conditional use
permit, land use permit, variance, or any other application which requires a
city approval under chapter.



   (B)   The city shall take final action to approve or deny an
application described above within 60 days of receiving an application,
unless the application is not accepted under § 153.156.  If the city cannot
take action to approve or deny the application within 60 days of receiving
the application, the Zoning Administrator is authorized before the end of the
initial 60-day period, to make a one-time extension of the time for taking
action by providing written notice by first-class mail to the applicant of
the extension, the reasons for the extension, and its anticipated length,
which may not exceed an additional 60 days unless approved by the applicant
in writing.



   (C)   When the final action to approve or disapprove an application
is to be taken by the City Council, the Planning Commission or the Board of
Appeals and Adjustments, if a vote on a resolution or properly made motion to
approve the application fails for any reason, the failure shall constitute a
denial of the application, provided that those voting against the motion
state on the record the reasons why they oppose the application.  A denial
of an application because of a failure to approve a resolution or motion does
not preclude an immediate submission of a same or similar application.



   (D)   Except as provided in division (C), if the application is
denied by the City Council, Planning Commission or Board of Appeals and
Adjustments, whichever body has the authority to make the final decision to
approve or deny an application, it must state the reasons for denial on the
record and provide the applicant in writing a statement of the reasons for
the denial.  If this written statement is not adopted at the same time s the
denial, it must be adopted at the next meeting following the denial of the
application but before the expiration of the time allowed for making a
decision under this section.  The written statement must be consistent with
the reasons stated in the record at the time of the denial.  The written
statement must be provided to the applicant upon adoption.



   (E)   If the decision to deny the request is made by the Zoning
Administrator or other city official, the official must state in writing the
reasons for the denial at the time the official denies the request.



(Am. Ord. 2005-4, passed 7-11-2005)



§ 153.160  ADDITIONAL EXTENSIONS OF TIME.



   Minnesota Statutes § 15.99, as it may be amended from time to time,
provides for certain exceptions to the time limits established in §
153.159.  These exceptions are as follows.  If the provisions of M.S. §
15.99, as it may be amended from time to time, are inconsistent with this
section, then the provisions of that statute shall apply.



   (A)   The time limit in § 153.159 is extended if a state statute,
federal law, or court order requires a process to occur before the city acts
on the application, and the time periods prescribed in the state statute,
federal law, or court order make it impossible to act on the application
within 60 days.  In cases described in this division, the deadline is
extended to 60 days after completion of the last process required in the
applicable statute, law or order.  Final approval of the city receiving an
application is not considered a process for purposes of this division.



   (B)   The time limit in § 153.159 is also extended if:



      (1)   An application submitted to a state agency requires
prior approval of a federal agency; or



      (2)   An application submitted to the city requires prior
approval of a state or federal agency.



   (C)   In cases described in division (B), the deadline for action is
extended to 60 days after the required prior approval is granted.



(Am. Ord. 2005-4, passed 7-11-2005)



§ 153.161  APPLICATIONS FOR SUBDIVISION APPROVAL AND BUILDING PERMITS.



   Sections 153.157 through 153.159 shall not apply to any request for
action under the city’s subdivision regulations or under M.S. § 462.358 or
Ch. 505, as they may be amended from time to time.  Neither shall they apply
to request for a building permit.

§ 154.01  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   DEVELOPMENT.  Any man-made change to real estate, including but not
limited to construction or reconstruction of buildings, installing
manufactured homes or travel trailers, installing utilities, construction of
roads or bridges, erection of levees, walls, or fences, drilling, mining,
filling, dredging, and storage of materials.



   FLOOD.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from overflow of inland or tidal waves,
or the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source. 



   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source.



   FLOODPROOFING.  Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents. 



   MANUFACTURED HOME.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designated for use
with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required
utilities.



   NEW CONSTRUCTION.  For the purposes of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, NEW CONSTRUCTION means structures for which
the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.



   PERSON.  Any individuals, corporation, partnership, association, or
any other entity, including state and local governments and agencies.



   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.  The land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area may be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking
has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate
map, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR,
AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE, or V.  For purposes
of these regulations, the term SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA is synonymous in
meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard."



   STRUCTURE.  For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed
building, including gas or liquid storage tanks, that is principally above
ground.  The term includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers on site
for more than 180 days.



   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.  Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of
a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of
the structure either, (a) before the improvement or repair is started, or (b)
if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage
occurred.  For the purposes of this definition, SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure regardless of the
actual work performed.  The term does not, however, include either (1) any
project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to
assure safe living conditions or (2) any alteration of a "historic
structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure.



(Ord. 2004-2, passed 7-26-2004)



§ 154.02  PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.

improve, move, or demolish any building or structure without first obtaining
a separate permit for each building or structure from the designated
responsible person.



   (B)   No man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, fences, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, shall
be commenced until a separate permit has been obtained from the designated
responsible person for each change.



   (C)   No manufactured home shall be placed on improved or unimproved
real estate without first obtaining a separate permit for each mobile home
from the designated responsible person.



(Ord. 2004-2, passed 7-26-2004)



§ 154.03  PERMIT APPLICATION.



   To obtain a permit, the applicant shall first file a permit application
on a form furnished for that purpose.  The form must be completed and
submitted to the designated responsible person before the issuance of a
permit will be considered.

determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from
flooding.  If a proposed building site is in a flood prone area, all new
construction and substantial improvements (including the placement of
manufactured homes) shall be:



   (A)   Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
floatation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;



   (B)   Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage;



   (C)   Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damage; and

new development is in a flood prone area, any such proposal shall be reviewed
to assure that:



   (A)   All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage within the flood prone area;



   (B)   All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage; and



   (C)   Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of flood
hazard.



(Ord. 2004-2, passed 7-26-2004)



§ 154.07  WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM.



   The responsible person shall require within flood prone areas, new and
replacement water supply systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems.



(Ord. 2004-2, passed 7-26-2004)



§ 154.08  SANITARY SEWAGE AND WASTE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS.



   The responsible person shall require within flood prone areas:



   (A)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems to be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters; and



   (B)   On-site waste disposal systems to be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.



(Ord. 2004-2, passed 7-26-2004)



§ 154.09  ANNEXATIONS AND EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION.



   The city shall not approve any development located in a Special Flood
Hazard Area (SFHA) outside the corporate limits unless such development or
plat is in accordance with the following:



   (A)   A floodplain ordinance legally adopted by the city that meets
the minimum federal (44 CFR 60.3), state (Minnesota Regulation Parts
6120.5000 through 6120.6200), and local requirements for development within a
Special Flood Hazard Area.



   (B)   The SFHA's of those parts of unincorporated Hennepin County,
Minnesota, that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or
that may be annexed into the city are generally identified as such on the
