Except as set forth in Subsection (D) of Section 120.040, no meeting or vote may be closed
without an affirmative public vote of the majority of a quorum of the public governmental body. The
vote of each member of the governmental body on the question of closing a public meeting or vote
and the specific reason for closing that public meeting or vote by reference to a specific Section of
this Chapter shall be announced publicly at an open meeting of the governmental body and
entered into the minutes.
Any meeting or vote closed pursuant to Section 120.020 shall be closed only to the extent
necessary for the specific reason announced to justify the closed meeting or vote. Public
governmental bodies shall not discuss any business in a closed meeting, record or vote which
does not directly relate to the specific reason announced to justify the closed meeting or vote.
Public governmental bodies holding a closed meeting shall close only an existing portion of the
meeting facility necessary to house the members of the public governmental body in the closed
session, allowing members of the public to remain to attend any subsequent open session held by
the public governmental body following the closed session.

Except as provided in Section 120.020, rules authorized pursuant to Article III of the Missouri
Constitution and as otherwise provided by law, all votes shall be recorded, and if a roll call is
taken, as to attribute each "yea" and "nay" vote, or abstinence if not voting, to the name of the
individual member of the public governmental body. Any votes taken during a closed meeting shall
be taken by roll call. All public meetings shall be open to the public and public votes and public
records shall be open to the public for inspection and duplication. All votes taken by roll call in
meetings of a public governmental body consisting of members who are all elected shall be cast
by members of the public governmental body who are physically present and in attendance at the
meeting or who are participating via videoconferencing. When it is necessary to take votes by roll
call in a meeting of the public governmental body, due to an emergency of the public body, with a
quorum of the members of the public body physically present and in attendance and less than a
quorum of the members of the public governmental body participating via telephone, facsimile,
Internet, or any other voice or electronic means, the nature of the emergency of the public body
justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall be stated in the minutes. Where such
emergency exists, the votes taken shall be regarded as if all members were physically present
and in attendance at the meeting.
A journal or minutes of open and closed meetings shall be taken and retained by the public
governmental body, including, but not limited to, a record of any vote taken at such meeting. The
minutes shall include the date, time, place, members present, members absent, and a record of

that is not reasonably accessible to the public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the
public, the nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall
be stated in the minutes.

Section 120.080. Segregation Of Exempt Material.
If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure, as well as material which is
exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make
the non-exempt material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies provided
herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a
separation of exempt from non-exempt information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person
requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe the material
exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat
the purpose of the exemption.
Section 120.090. Custodian Designated — Response To
Request For Access To Records.
The City Clerk shall be the custodian of records and will be responsible for maintenance and
control of all records. The custodian may designate deputy custodians in operating departments of
the City and such other departments or offices as the custodian may determine. Deputy
custodians shall conduct matters relating to public records and meetings in accord with the
policies enumerated herein.
Each public governmental body shall make available for inspection and copying by the public of
that body's public records. No person shall remove original public records from the office of a
public governmental body or its custodian without written permission of the designated custodian.
No public governmental body shall, after August 28, 1998, grant to any person or entity, whether
by contract, license or otherwise, the exclusive right to access and disseminate any public record
unless the granting of such right is necessary to facilitate coordination with, or uniformity among,
industry regulators having similar authority.
Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon as possible, but in no
event later than the end of the third business day following the date the request is received by the
custodian of records of a public governmental body. If records are requested in a certain format,
the public body shall provide the records in the requested format, if such format is available. If
access to the public record is not granted immediately, the custodian shall give a detailed
explanation of the cause for further delay and the place and earliest time and date that the record
will be available for inspection. This period for document production may exceed three (3) days for
reasonable cause.
If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon request, a written statement of
the grounds for such denial. Such statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which
access is denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of the third business
day following the date that the request for the statement is received.
Section 120.100. Fees For Copying Public Records —
Limitations.
Except as otherwise provided by law, each public governmental body shall provide access to and,
upon request, furnish copies of public records subject to the following:
Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted under Section 32.091,
RSMo., shall not exceed ten cents ($0.10) per page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9)
inches by fourteen (14) inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to exceed the
average hourly rate of pay for clerical staff of the public governmental body. Research time
required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.

Based on the scope of the request, the public governmental body shall produce the copies
using employees of the body that result in the lowest amount of charges for search, research
and duplication time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the person
requesting the records may request the public governmental body to provide an estimate of
the cost to the person requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without charge or
at a reduced charge when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction
of the fee is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
Fees for providing access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes
or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices and for paper copies larger than nine (9) inches by fourteen (14)
inches shall include only the cost of copies, staff time, which shall not exceed the average
hourly rate of pay for staff of the public governmental body required for making copies and
programming, if necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or other medium used for the
duplication. Fees for maps, blueprints or plats that require special expertise to duplicate may
include the actual rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to duplicate such
maps, blueprints or plats. If programming is required beyond the customary and usual level to
comply with a request for records or information, the fees for compliance may include the
actual cost of such programming.
Payment of such copying fees may be requested prior to the making of copies.

Section 135.160. Local Bidder Preference.
[CC 1985 § 2-13; Ord. No. 705, 3-5-2001]
City Bidder Preference. A "City bidder" is one that regularly provides the purchased goods or
services and has a business office in the City of St. James. For projects or purchases that are
funded entirely from revenues of the City, if an evaluation of the bids indicates that the lowest and
best bid has been submitted by a non-City bidder, then the following City bidder preference
analysis shall be conducted:
Amount Of Preference. City bidders shall have a two percent (2%) preference based upon the
non-City lowest and best bid, but the preference shall not exceed five thousand dollars
($5,000.00).
Analysis.
The amount of preference determined in Subsection (A)(1), Amount Of Preference,
above shall be added to the amount of the non-City lowest and best bid, the sum of
which shall become the "preference guideline."
If any bid submitted by a City bidder is equal to or lower than the preference guideline,
then the lowest bid submitted by a City bidder shall be reviewed to determine whether it
is the lowest and best bid. If it is not the lowest and best bid, then the next City bid which
is equal to or lower than the preference guideline shall be reviewed, and the process
shall be continued until either a City bid has been selected as the lowest and best bid, or
all City bids equal to or lower than the preference guideline have been eliminated.
County Bidder Preference. A "County bidder" is one that regularly provides the purchased goods
or services and has a business office in Phelps County. If a City bidder has not been selected, and
if the lowest and best bid has been submitted by a non-County bidder, then the preference
analysis shall be conducted by giving the same amount of preference to County bidders. The
process shall be continued until either a County bidder's bid has been selected as the lowest and
best bid, or all County bidders submitting bids equal to or lower than the preference guideline have
been eliminated.
Meramec Regional Planning Commission (MRPC) Area Preference. An "MRPC-area bidder" is
one that has a business office in the MRPC area. If neither a City bidder nor a County bidder has
been selected, and if the lowest and best bid has been submitted by a non-MRPC-area bidder,
then the preference analysis shall be conducted giving the same amount of preference to MRPCarea
bidders. The process shall be continued until either an MRPC-area bidder's bid has been
selected as the lowest and best bid, or all bids submitted by MRPC-area bidders equal to or lower
than the preference guideline have been eliminated.
State Bidder Preference. A "State bidder" is one that has a business office in the State of Missouri.
If there has been no selection of a City bidder, a County bidder or an MRPC-area bidder, and if the
lowest and best bid has been submitted by a non-State bidder, then the preference analysis shall
be conducted by giving the same amount of preference to State bidders. The process shall be
continued until either a State bidder's bid has been selected as the lowest and best bid, or all bids
submitted by State bidders equal to or lower than the preference guideline have been eliminated.
United States Preference. A "United States bidder" is one that has a business office in the United
States. If there has been no selection of a City bidder, a County bidder, an MRPC-area bidder or a
State bidder, and if the lowest and best bid has been submitted by a non-United States bidder,

[Ord. No. 1099, 8-14-2017]
Guilt for an offense may be based upon an attempt to commit an offense if, with the purpose of
committing the offense, a person performs any act which is a substantial step towards the
commission of the offense. A "substantial step" is conduct which is strongly corroborative of the
firmness of the actor's purpose to complete the commission of the offense.
It is no defense to a prosecution under this Section that the offense attempted was, under the
actual attendant circumstances, factually or legally impossible of commission, if such offense
could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to
be.
Section 210.030. Conspiracy.
[Ord. No. 1099, 8-14-2017]
Guilt for an offense may be based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense when a person, with
the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of an offense, agrees with another person
or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such offense.
It is no defense to a prosecution for conspiring to commit an offense that a person, who knows
that a person with whom he or she conspires to commit an offense has conspired with another
person or persons to commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other person or
persons.
If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he or she can be found guilty of only one
offense so long as such multiple offenses are the object of the same agreement.
No person may be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense unless
an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or
her or by a person with whom he or she conspired.
Exceptions.
No person shall be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense if,
after conspiring to commit the offense, he/she prevented the accomplishment of the
objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his/her
criminal purpose.
The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of renunciation of criminal purpose
under Subsection (E)(1).
For the purpose of time limitations on prosecutions:
A conspiracy to commit an offense is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when
the offense or offenses which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be
committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he or she conspired;
If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him/her only if
he/she advises those with whom he/she has conspired of his/her abandonment or he/she
informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his/her
participation in it.
A person shall not be charged, convicted or sentenced on the basis of the same course of conduct
of both the actual commission of an offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense.
Note: Under certain circumstances this offense can be a felony under state law.

[Ord. No. 1099, 8-14-2017]

property;
Conceals or aids or abets the concealment of the property from the owner;
Sells, encumbers, conveys, pawns, loans, abandons or gives away the leased or rented
property or any part thereof, without the written consent of the lessor, or without informing the
person to whom the property is transferred to, that the property is subject to a lease;
Returns the property to the lessor at the end of the lease term, plus any agreed upon
extensions, but does not pay the lease charges agreed upon in the written instrument, with
the intent to wrongfully deprive the lessor of the agreed upon charges.
The provisions of this Section shall apply to all forms of leasing and rental agreements, including,
but not limited to, contracts which provide the consumer options to buy the leased or rented
personal property, lease-purchase agreements and rent-to-own contracts. For the purpose of
determining if a violation of this Section has occurred, leasing contracts which provide options to
buy the merchandise are owned by the owner of the property until such time as the owner
endorses the sale and transfer of ownership of the leased property to the lessee.
Evidence that a lessee used a false, fictitious, or not current name, address, or place of
employment in obtaining the property or that a lessee fails or refuses to return the property or pay
the lease charges to the lessor within seven (7) days after written demand for the return has been
sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address the person set forth in the lease
agreement, or in the absence of the address, to the person's last known place of residence, shall
be evidence of intent to violate the provisions of this Section, except that if a motor vehicle has not
been returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease or rental agreement,
such failure to return the motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of the intent of the offense of
stealing leased or rented property. Where the leased or rented property is a motor vehicle, if the
motor vehicle has not been returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease
or rental agreement, the lessor may notify the local law enforcement agency of the failure of the
lessee to return such motor vehicle, and the local law enforcement agency shall cause such motor
vehicle to be put into any appropriate State and local computer system listing stolen motor
vehicles. Where the leased or rented property is not a motor vehicle, if such property has not been
returned within the seven-day period prescribed in this Subsection, the owner of the property shall
report the failure to return the property to the local law enforcement agency, and such law
enforcement agency may within five (5) days notify the person who leased or rented the property
that such person is in violation of this Section, and that failure to immediately return the property
may subject such person to arrest for the violation.

Section 210.1190. Passing Bad Checks.
[Ord. No. 1099, 8-14-2017]
A person commits the offense of passing a bad check when he/she:
With the purpose to defraud, makes, issues or passes a check or other similar sight order or

transmission of account information within ten (10) days after receiving actual notice in writing
that it has not been paid because of insufficient funds or credit with the drawee or because
there is no such drawee.

which is actually received by the defendant. Such notice may include the service of
summons or warrant upon the defendant for the initiation of the prosecution of the check or checks
which are the subject matter of the prosecution if the summons or warrant contains information of
the ten-day period during which the instrument may be paid and that payment of the instrument
within such ten-day period will result in dismissal of the charges. The requirement of notice shall
also be satisfied for written communications which are tendered to the defendant and which the
defendant refuses to accept.
Note: Under certain circumstances this offense can be a felony under state law.

Section 315.060. Traffic Control Signal Legend — Right Turn On
Red Light — When.
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights or colored
lighted arrows, successively one (1) at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and
yellow shall be used except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights
shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
Green indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the
same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow,
may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
Steady yellow indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in Section 315.070, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian
shall then start to cross the roadway.
Steady red indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except as provided in Subsection
(A)(3)(b) below.

intersection in obedience to a red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a
right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as
directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the State Highways and
Transportation Commission with reference to an intersection involving a State highway,
and local authorities with reference to an intersection involving other highways under
their jurisdiction, may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any intersection
where safety conditions so require, said prohibition shall be effective when a sign is
erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this Section shall be applicable except as to those provisions
which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
Section 315.070. Pedestrian Control Signals.
Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words WALK or DON'T WALK or
appropriate symbols are in place, such signals shall indicate as follows:

opposite direction or any vehicle overtaken.
No vehicle shall at any time be driven to the left side of the roadway under the following
conditions:
When approaching the crest of a grade or upon a curve of the highway where the driver's

safety and then only after the giving of an appropriate signal in the manner provided herein.
An operator or driver when stopping, or when checking the speed of the operator's vehicle if
the movement of other vehicles may reasonably be affected by such checking of speed, shall
extend such operator's arm at an angle below horizontal so that the same may be seen in the
rear of the vehicle.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the right shall extend such operator's arm
at an angle above horizontal so that the same may be seen in front of and in the rear of the
vehicle and shall slow down and approach the intersecting highway as near as practicable to
the right side of the highway along which such operator is proceeding before turning.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the left shall extend such operator's arm
in a horizontal position so that the same may be seen in the rear of the vehicle and shall slow
down and approach the intersecting highway so that the left side of the vehicle shall be as
near as practicable to the center line of the highway along which the operator is proceeding
before turning.
The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by a signal
light or signal device in good mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would
not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by
such light or device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand
and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds
twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to
the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen
(14) feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles. The provisions of this
Subsection shall not apply to any trailer which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand

provided, further, that the provisions of this Section as far as mechanical devices on vehicles
so constructed that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of
such vehicle as above provided shall only be applicable to new vehicles registered within this
State after the first day of January 1954.
Section 340.200. Stopping For School Bus.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway upon meeting or overtaking from either direction any
school bus which has stopped on the highway for the purpose of receiving or discharging any
school children and whose driver has in the manner prescribed by law given the signal to stop
shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus
resumes motion or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State Law:
Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading." Each school bus subject to the provisions of Sections
304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device
approved by the State Board of Education which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.
Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school system which has a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted
entirely in front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels, and which is used
for the transportation of school children shall be equipped with a crossing control arm. The
crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from
the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right side of the
front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri school children
who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading
or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to
drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district has the
authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or
more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to
stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a
stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers
should proceed with caution and, in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the
school bus with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at
any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided
by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2)
lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the
road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred
(500) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder
and a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in
each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such
time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.

control at such intersection.
When two (2) vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on
the right. This Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from opposite
directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is attempting to or is making a left turn.
The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close
thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.

yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction when the making of
such left turn would create a traffic hazard.
The driver of a vehicle about to enter or cross a highway from an alley, building or any private road
or driveway shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching on the highway to be entered.
The City may, on any section of road where construction or major maintenance operations are
being effected, fix a speed limit in such areas by posting of appropriate signs, and the operation of
a motor vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so posted shall be deemed prima facie
evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a violation of Section 340.160.

another with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained financial responsibility unless such
person has financial responsibility which covers the person's operation of the other's vehicle.
However, no owner or non-resident shall be in violation of this Subsection if he/she fails to
maintain financial responsibility on a motor vehicle which is inoperable or being stored and not in
operation.
For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall mean the ability to respond in
damages for liability on account of accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said
financial responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, in the
amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1)
person in any one (1) accident and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the amount of fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of two (2) or more persons in
any one (1) accident and in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to
or destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.
Proof of financial responsibility may be shown by any of the following:
A current insurance identification card issued by a motor vehicle insurer or by the Director of
Revenue of the State of Missouri for self-insurance. A motor vehicle liability insurance policy,
a motor vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the name and address of
the insurer, the name and address of the named insured, the policy number, the effective
dates of the policy and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five (5) digits
of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if the insurance policy covers five (5) or
more motor vehicles shall be satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance
identification card; or
A certificate of the State Treasurer of a cash or security deposit according to Section 303.240,
RSMo.;
A surety bond according to Section 303.230, RSMo.; or
A photocopy or an image displayed on a mobile electronic device as authorized by and
subject to the restrictions of Section 303.024, RSMo.
Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the insured motor vehicle or by the
operator of the motor vehicle if the proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator
rather than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall exhibit the insurance
identification card on the demand of any Peace Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or
commercial vehicle inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident while
that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the officer's or inspector's duties.
However, no person shall be found guilty of violating this Section if the operator demonstrates to
the court that he/she met the financial responsibility requirements of Section 303.025, RSMo., at
the time the Peace Officer wrote the citation.
Any person who violates any provisions of this Section shall be guilty of an ordinance violation.
Section 380.150. Display Of False Evidence Of Insurance —
Penalty — Confiscation Of False Evidence.
No person shall display evidence of insurance to a Law Enforcement Officer knowing there is no valid
liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle as required pursuant to this Article or knowing the
evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance. If
the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator for displaying invalid
evidence of insurance, the Officer shall confiscate the evidence for presentation in court. Any person
convicted of violating this Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.

Article X. "PUD" Planned Unit District
Section 405.155. Regulations
[Ord. No. 1127, 6-11-2018]
Purpose And Scope. The division of the City into zoning districts is based on the principle that
similar conditions prevail throughout a particular district. Development or redevelopment of certain
uses within these districts has the potential, if not properly planned, to adversely impact the
community with regard to traffic, incompatibility of uses, property values, utilities or in other ways.
This Section is intended to authorize certain new or changed uses of property as well as certain
site alterations, as specified herein, if the location and circumstances are appropriate for the use
or change under the standards provided in this Section. To achieve these objectives, this Section
provides increased flexibility of development design by authorizing the City Council to allow
deviations to the underlying district regulations, subdivision regulations and other deviations where
lawful, appropriate to the project, and while maintaining public safety and the purposes of the
applicable codes, provided that a use that is not already authorized to be approved in an
underlying zoning district may not be authorized by this PUD process. Approval by the City
Council of a PUD Overlay District as provided herein shall be a legislative act of rezoning and,
except as provided herein, subject to the procedural requirements for rezoning set forth in this
Code and in Chapter 89, RSMo., as amended. Any ordinance approving a development plan shall
be deemed to incorporate the provisions of this Article.
Underlying District Regulations; Modifications; Conditions. A PUD ordinance may grant
modifications to requirements in this Chapter or as may otherwise be required to meet the
purposes of this Section, but shall not authorize uses not permitted by the underlying zoning
district. Conditions may be imposed as a condition of a PUD to affect the purposes of applicable
codes and regulations to the proposed development and also in light of modifications granted, if
any. Except as expressly modified by the ordinance approving the PUD, the requirements of the
underlying zoning district and other applicable codes and ordinances shall continue to govern. No

conditional use permit shall be required when a PUD is approved expressly authorizing a
conditional use permitted by the underlying district.
PUD District; When Required. The PUD District overlay approval shall be required in all zoning
districts whenever a use of a site otherwise permitted by the underlying district includes:
New construction of buildings for commercial use in excess of 2,000 square feet or where
vacation of any public rights-of-way or easement is needed for the development; or
Expansion or exterior reconstruction of existing commercial buildings in excess of 2,000
square feet.
A change in use, which necessitates an alteration of parking of more than five (5) parking
spaces.
Plan Approval Required; PD Designation. Any district zoned under this Section shall include the
"PD" designation along with the underlying district classification. No subdivision, development,
redevelopment or occupancy of a new use of the property encompassed by the "PD" designation
shall take place until a final development plan has been reviewed and approved in conformance
with the requirements of this Section. Minor construction, preparation or other minor activities that
do not alter the stormwater, traffic access, utilities, parking or other impacts regulated by this
Chapter may be approved by the City prior to a final development plan where consistent with the
purposes of this Section.
Height Restrictions. The total height of any structure shall be limited to the building height of the
underlying district unless otherwise expressly provided by the conditions in the ordinance
governing the PUD.
Procedures.
A Planned District may be initiated by an application by the City or by one (1) or more of the
owners of record or owners under contract of a lot or tract of land, or their authorized
representatives. The Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council may review and
approve a Planned District outside the existing City limits contingent upon proper fees as set
forth below being paid to the City, as well as the prerequisites set forth in this Section being
completed, with said approval of the Planned District effective when the property
encompassing the Planned District is annexed into the City. Said review shall not eliminate or
alter the requirements set forth above or any further requirements of Chapters 400 through
415.
Procedures for application, review, and approval of a Planned District shall be as follows:
Application And Fee.

A preliminary development plan as containing such description of the site, use
and improvements as reasonably required by the City for evaluation.
Each application for a Planned Unit District shall be submitted for review to the City's
staff or consultants. To the extent the City incurs actual costs from such review, the

the two-year period, the Commission shall review any changes in the Zoning District Map
brought by the proposed district. If the Commission finds said changes to be inappropriate,
the Commission shall recommend to the City Council that the map be revised in accordance

to whether the application qualifies for the simplified development plan process if the
procedure is so requested in the PUD application. This determination shall be in writing
and may be appealed to the City Council within ten (10) days of its issuance. If the
simplified plan process is denied by the Director or by the City Council, either on appeal
or after the Director's approval of such process, the change or use shall be authorized
only if a PUD is approved pursuant to Subsections (A) through (I) of this Section.

otherwise required by this Chapter, or where it can be conclusively shown that adequate

Section 405.450. Appeal Of Decisions Of The Board.

presentation of such petition the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the Board of Adjustment

shown, grant a restraining order. The Board of Adjustment shall not be required to return the original
papers acted upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such
portions thereof as may be called for by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth such other facts
as may be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be
verified. If, upon the hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper
disposition of the matter, it may take additional evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as
it may direct and report the same to the court with his/her findings of fact and conclusions of law, which
shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which a determination of the court shall be made. The
court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review. Costs
shall not be allowed against the board unless it shall appear to the court that it acted with gross
negligence, or in bad faith, or with malice in making the decision appealed from. All issues in any
proceedings under Sections 89.080 to 89.110, RSMo., shall have preference over all other civil actions
and proceedings.

Upon approval of the preliminary plat by the City Planning and Zoning Commission, the
subdivider may proceed with the preparation of the final plat and detailed construction
drawings and specifications for the improvements required under these regulations.
The approval of the preliminary plan by the City Planning and Zoning Commission is
revocable and does not constitute final approval or acceptance of the subdivision by the City
Council or authorization to proceed on construction of improvements within the subdivision
but shall constitute approval of layout and general engineering proposals and plans.
Before submitting the final plat to the City Planning and Zoning Commission for approval, the
subdivider shall furnish all plans and information as listed in Article VI, Final Plat
Requirements, necessary for the detailed engineering consideration of the improvements
required and obtain the approval of the City Engineer, which shall be endorsed thereon.
For final plat approval, the subdivider shall submit to the City Planning and Zoning
Commission:
Three (3) paper copies and one (1) Mylar copy of the final plat and a digital file on two (2)
separate disks [one (1) for the City and one (1) for the County] in AutoCAD DWG format
(version 2004 or newer).
A performance bond in the amount approved by the City Engineer or City Attorney.
One (1) copy of the certified approved plans, profiles, cross sections and specifications.
A certificate from the City Engineer that the final plat is substantially in accord with the
preliminary plan as approved by the City Planning and Zoning Commission.
When the final plat has been passed upon by the City Planning and Zoning Commission, one
(1) copy of the final plat and performance bond shall forthwith be transmitted to the City
Council, together with a certificate showing the action of the City Planning and Zoning
Commission.
When the final plat has been approved by the City Council, the performance bond accepted
and all three (3) copies duly certified, three (3) copies shall be delivered to the City Planning
and Zoning Commission, one (1) copy to the City Engineer and one (1) to the City Clerk for
their respective files, and one (1) to the subdivider for filing with the Recorder of Deeds for
Phelps County. If said plat is disapproved by the City Council, such disapproval shall point out
in writing wherein said proposed plat is objectionable.
The passage of the resolution accepting the plat shall constitute final approval of the platting
of the area shown on the final plat, but the owner shall cause such plat to be recorded in the
office of the Recorder of Deeds of Phelps County, Missouri, and shall file satisfactory
evidence of such recording in the office of the City Clerk before the City shall recognize the
plat as being in full force and effect.
Upon receipt of the duly certified copies of the final plat by the City Planning and Zoning
Commission, the Secretary of the City Planning and Zoning Commission will transmit copies
of the plat, upon which have been placed the official house numbers as determined by the
City Engineer, to the subdivider, the water company, the gas company, and the telephone
company.
Receipt of the duly certified final plat by the subdivider is authorization that he/she may
proceed with the installation and construction of the required improvements.
The City Council will return the performance bond to the subdivider upon certification by the
City Engineer of satisfactory completion of the installation and construction of the required
improvements and acceptance of the required improvements by the City Council. Prior to

[CC 1985 § 25-58; Ord. No. 277, A3 § 1, 11-7-1966; Ord. No. 659, 8-7-2000]
Whenever the area is divided into lots containing one (1) or more acres and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be re-subdivided into smaller building lots, consideration must be given to the
highway, street and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so that additional minor streets can be
opened which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots. Easements providing for the future
opening and extension of such streets may, at the discretion of the City Council, be made a
requirement of the plat.
Section 410.060. Relation To Existing Streets.
[CC 1985 § 25-59; Ord. No. 277, A3 § 2, 11-7-1966; Ord. No. 659, 8-7-2000]
The arrangement of highways and streets in new subdivisions shall make provisions for the
continuation of the existing highways and major streets (or their proper projection where adjoining
property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be deemed necessary by the City Council for public
requirements. The width of such highways and streets in new subdivisions shall not be less than the
minimum street widths established herein. The highway and street arrangements shall also be such as
to avoid hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for
convenient access to it.
Section 410.070. Streets In Relation To Railroads.
[CC 1985 § 25-60; Ord. No. 277, A3 § 3, 11-7-1966; Ord. No. 659, 8-7-2000]

unsubdivided property, a half street at least twenty-five (25) feet in right-of-way width shall be
dedicated, and whenever subdivided property adjoins a half street, the remainder of the street shall be
dedicated. No homes shall be constructed on half streets. Half streets are permitted where it is
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision, and at other locations where the City
Engineer determines that it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when adjoining
property is subdivided. No roadway shall be constructed on a half street right-of-way until both halves
of the half street have been dedicated to the City. The City Engineer may require the dedication of fifty
(50) feet minimum right-of-way on perimeter streets to accommodate two (2) lanes of traffic.
Section 410.090. Minimum Roadway Width.

boundary of a historic district. The Department of Public Works shall send a completed
preliminary design for a public improvement project to the SJHPC simultaneously with its
submission to the City Council for approval. The SJHPC shall have at least thirty (30) days to
complete its review and report to the City Council, except when the Department of Public
Works, if necessary to accelerate the design review process, may specify a time less than
thirty (30) days within which the SJHPC shall complete its review and report to the Council.
The SJHPC shall review and comment upon any proposed acquisition of a landmark or of
land or buildings within a historic district by the City of St. James or any of its agencies or
departments. The City Council or the Department of Public Works shall, at the earliest
possible date that will not interfere with acquisition negotiations, send the SJHPC information
concerning the location, size, purchase price, current use, and proposed use of the land or
building to be acquired, and specify the date by which the SJHPC shall report to the City
Council.
The SJHPC shall review the public improvement or land acquisition project to determine its
effect upon the historic, archaeological or architectural character of the landmark or historic
district and report to the City Council within any time specified by the City Council or Planning
Department, but not to exceed forty-five (45) days. The report by the SJHPC shall include any
recommendations for changes to the preliminary design or land acquisition that will lessen or
alleviate any adverse effect of the proposed project upon the historic, archaeological or
architectural character of the landmark or historic district. The City Council shall take no final
action on the preliminary design or land acquisition until it has received and reviewed the
report of the SJHPC.
Section 415.310. Standards For Review.
[CC 1985 § 25-448; Ord. No. 762 § 2, 10-7-2002]
In considering an application for a building or demolition permit or for a certificate of
appropriateness, the SJHPC shall be guided in principal by the Secretary of the Interior's
Standards, as follows, in addition to any design guidelines in the ordinance designating the
landmark or historic district. Applications, standards for review and design guidelines shall be
available in the office of the City Clerk for distribution to the public.
A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires
minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.
The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes
that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or
architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in
their own right shall be retained and preserved.
Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that
characterize a historic property shall be preserved.
Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old
in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial
evidence.

Section 420.020. Findings Of Fact.
[CC 1985 § 12-2; Ord. No. 631 Art. I § 2-13, 3-6-2000]
Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of St. James,
Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and
the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Section 420.030. Statement Of Purpose.
[CC 1985 § 12-3; Ord. No. 631 Art. I § 2-13, 3-6-2000]
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to
minimize those losses described in Article I, Section 420.020(A); to establish or maintain the
community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined
in 44 CFR 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(b) by applying the provisions
of this Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding
or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;

In all areas of special flood hazard, once base flood elevation data is obtained as set forth in
Article IV, Section 420.160(B), the following provisions are required:
Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to one (1) foot above base flood level.
Non-Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure, including manufactured homes, shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood level
or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base
flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall certify that the standards of this Subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in Article III, Section 420.140(A)(7)(c).
It is required for all new construction and substantial improvements that fully enclosed areas
below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area
other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and
The bottom of all opening shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings
may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided

[CC 1985 § 12-43; Ord. No. 631 Art. 5 § 2-13, 3-6-2000]
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing Subsections (B) through (F)
below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of
historic places upon determination, provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's
continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, a determination that
failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and a
determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one
hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and such construction below the base flood
level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all
variance actions as required by this Chapter.
Section 420.250. Conditions For Approving Variances For
Accessory Structures.
[CC 1985 § 12-44; Ord. No. 631 Art. 5 § 2-13, 3-6-2000]
Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case-bycase
analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following
conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Article V, Sections 420.230 and
420.240 of this Chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the one-hundred-year flood and the threat to public
health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory
structures that are constructed at grade and wet-floodproofed.
Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in
zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building
components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes,
flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation must be built with flood-resistant materials in
accordance with Article IV, Section 420.160(C)(2) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure in accordance with Article IV, Section 420.160(C)(1) of this
Chapter. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific

flood-related forces, including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact
forces.
Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood
elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed
enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with
Article IV, Section 420.160(C)(4) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening
requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls subject to the onehundred-
year flood contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters in accordance with Article IV, Section 420.170(A)(3) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway
encroachment provisions of Article IV, Section 420.170(B)(2) of this Chapter. No variances
may be issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood levels would result during the one-hundred-year flood.
Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.
No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be
paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one-hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and such construction
below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this Chapter.
Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community
and a registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain
development permit for construction.

Section 425.010. Purposes.
[CC 1985 § 26-300; Ord. No. 630 § 1, 2-7-2000]
The general purpose of this Chapter is to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of
towers and telecommunications facilities in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the
competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the City.
Specifically, the purposes of this Chapter are:
To regulate the location of towers and telecommunications facilities in the City;
To protect residential areas, and land uses from potential adverse impact of towers and
telecommunications facilities;
To minimize adverse visual impact of towers and telecommunications facilities through careful
design, siting, landscaping, and innovative camouflaging techniques;
To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of towers and antenna support structures
as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
To avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and telecommunications facilities by
ensuring that such structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified,
maintained, and removed when no longer used or determined to be structurally unsound;
To ensure that towers and telecommunications facilities are compatible with surrounding land
uses;
To facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunications services to the residents and
businesses of the City in an orderly fashion; and
To encourage the location of towers in industrial and business districts, rather than residential
areas.

applicant must also demonstrate with written evidence, the following:
In the case of a requested modification to the setback requirement, that the area of the
parcel of land upon which the tower is proposed to be located makes compliance with
Section 425.050 of this Chapter impossible, and the only alternative for the person is to
locate the tower at another site which poses a greater threat to the public health, safety
or welfare or is closer in proximity to a residentially zoned land; or
In the case of a request for modification of the height limit in zoning district for towers and
telecommunications facilities, that the modification is necessary to facilitate co-location of
telecommunications facilities in order to avoid construction of a new tower; or to meet the
coverage requirements of the applicant's wireless communications system, which

having an interest in said building as shown by the land records of the Recorder of Deeds of
Phelps County who may appear before the Building Commissioner on the date specified in
the notice to show cause why the building or structure reported to be a dangerous building
should not be repaired, vacated or demolished in accordance with the statement of particulars
set forth in the Building Inspector's notice as provided herein. Any party may be represented
by counsel and all parties shall have an opportunity to be heard.
Make written findings of fact from the evidence offered at said hearing as to whether or not
the building in question is a dangerous building within the terms of Section 505.020 of this
Chapter.
If the evidence supports a finding based upon competent and substantial evidence that the
building or structure is a dangerous building and a nuisance and detrimental to the health,
safety or welfare of the residents of the City, the Building Commissioner shall issue an order
based upon its findings of fact commanding the owner, occupant, mortgagee, lessee, agent or
other person(s) having an interest in said building as shown by the land records of the
Recorder of Deeds of Phelps County to repair, vacate or demolish any building found to be a
dangerous building and to clean up the property, provided that any person so notified shall
have the privilege of either repairing or vacating and repairing said building, if such repair will
comply with the ordinances of this City, or may vacate and demolish said dangerous building
at his/her own risk to prevent the acquiring by the City of the lien against the land where the
dangerous building stands. If the evidence does not support a finding that a building or
structure is a dangerous building or a nuisance or detrimental to the health, safety or welfare
of the residents of the City, no order shall be issued.
If the owner, occupant, mortgagee or lessee fails to comply with the order within thirty (30)
days, the Building Commissioner shall cause such building or structure to be repaired,
vacated or demolished and the property cleaned up as the facts may warrant. If the Building
Commissioner or other designated officer or officers issues an order whereby the building or
structure is demolished, secured or repaired, or the property is cleaned up, the cost of
performance shall be certified to the City Clerk or officer in charge of finance who shall cause
a special tax bill or assessment therefor against the property to be prepared and collected by
the City Collector or other official collecting taxes, unless the building or structure is
demolished, secured or repaired by a contractor pursuant to an order issued by the City and
such contractor files a mechanic's lien against the property where the dangerous building is
located. The contractor may enforce this lien as provided in Sections 429.010 to 429.360,
RSMo. Except as provided in Section 505.090, at the request of the taxpayer the tax bill may
be paid in installments over a period of not more than ten (10) years. The tax bill from the
date of its issuance shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owner and shall
also be a lien on the property until paid. Said tax bill or assessment shall bear interest at a
rate of eight percent (8%) per annum until paid.
Section 505.090. Insurance Proceeds — How Handled.
If there are proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a covered claim payment made for
damage or loss to a building or other structure caused by or arising out of any fire, explosion or
other casualty loss, the following procedure is established for the payment of up to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the insurance proceeds as set forth in this Subsection. This Subsection shall
apply only to a covered claim payment that is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the face value of
the policy covering a building or other structure:
The insurer shall withhold from the covered claim payment up to twenty-five percent (25%) of
the covered claim payment and shall pay such monies to the City to deposit into an interestbearing
account. Any named mortgagee on the insurance policy shall maintain priority over
any obligation under this Chapter.

The City shall release the proceeds and any interest that has accrued on such proceeds
received under Subsection (A)(1) to the insured or as the terms of the policy and
endorsements thereto provide within thirty (30) days after receipt of such insurance monies,
unless the City has instituted legal proceedings under the provisions of Section 505.080(A)
(6). If the City has proceeded under the provisions of Section 505.080(A)(6), all monies in
excess of that necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 505.080(A)(6) for the
removal, securing, repair and clean up of the building or structure and the lot on which it is
located, less salvage value, shall be paid to the insured.
If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in Subsection (A) of this Section, at
the request of the taxpayer the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not more than
ten (10) years. The tax bill from the date of its issuance shall be a lien on the property and a
personal debt against the property owner(s) until paid.
This Section shall apply to fire, explosion or other casualty loss claims arising on all buildings and
structures.
This Section does not make the City a party to any insurance contract, and the insurer is not liable
to any party for any amount in excess of the proceeds otherwise payable under its insurance
policy.
The Building Commissioner may certify that in lieu of payment of all or part of the covered claim
payment under Subsection (A) that it has obtained satisfactory proof that the insured has removed
or will remove the debris and repair, rebuild or otherwise make the premises safe and secure. In
this event, the Building Commissioner shall issue a certificate within thirty (30) days after receipt of
proof to permit covered claim payment to the insured without the deduction pursuant to
Subsection (A) of this Section. It shall be the obligation of the insured or other person making the
claim to provide the insurance company with the written certificate provided for in this Subsection.

Building Commissioner and the Building Commissioner may cause the immediate repair, vacation or
demolition of such dangerous building. The costs of such emergency repair, vacation or demolition of
such dangerous building shall be collected in the same manner as provided in Sections 505.080 and

Section 625.010. Purpose And Findings.
[CC 1985 § 6-58; Ord. No. 783, 8-4-2003; Ord. No. 786, 9-2-2003]
Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to regulate the display of explicit sexual material and
sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of
the citizens of St. James, Missouri, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent
the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the City. The
provisions of this Chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction
on the content of any communicative materials, including explicit sexual materials. Similarly, it is
not the intent nor effect of this Chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to explicit sexual
materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors
of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of this
Chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene or offensive material of a sexual
nature.
Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on
communities as outlined in numerous studies/reports generally available for consideration, and on
findings incorporated in a series of cases as found and included herein by reference to the ILM
Model Ordinance on Sexually Oriented Business Regulation, the City Council finds that:
Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities
that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is no
mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that
occur on their premises.
Employees of certain sexually oriented businesses engage in higher incidences of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments, and that by offering or
providing such locations may thereby create unhealthy conditions, unless properly regulated.
At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually
oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human
immunodeficiency virus infections (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non-A, non-B,
amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. According to the best scientific
evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally
transmitted by sexual acts.
The number of cases of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases has been on the rise
or remain at high levels in the United States.
The findings noted above raise substantial governmental concerns by establishing that
sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably
regulated in order to protect the public interest and to address substantial governmental
concerns.
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that
reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses.
Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is managed in a way consistent with the health, safety, and welfare
of its patrons and employees, as well as the general public. It is appropriate to require
reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented
business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult
booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary
sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.

Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current
employees and past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal
behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing
minors from working in such establishments.
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-today
operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is
substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will
aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is desirable to obtain a limited
amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in conduct that this
Chapter is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct.
The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related
crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in
contravention of this Chapter.
The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses serves as a deterrent to,
and prevents conduct that leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of St. James, Missouri, will be
promoted by the enactment of this Chapter.

implement this policy.

fiscal year, ensure that an annual City Reserve Fund adjustment is made as part of the
annual budget process.

Capital Project Fund Establishment, Contributions And Reductions. To accumulate the
desired Capital Project Fund balances, the Municipal Utility/City shall implement the following
procedures:
Establishment Of Funds And Accounts. The Municipal Utility/City shall establish
necessary budgetary and revenue policies, funds and sub-accounts as are necessary to
implement this policy. The establishment of Capital Project Reserve Funds will assist in
delaying rate increases and/or tax increases; however, the establishment of these funds
does not negate a future need to institute tax and/or rate increases or the possibility of a
future need to issue bonds for significant capital expenditures.
City Capital Project Fund Accounts — Contributions. All City departments will include
depreciation in their annual budget, and the appropriate percentage of annual
depreciation will be deposited to the credit of each department/Utility Capital Project
Fund. The annual depreciation shall be based on asset depreciation schedules prepared
by the City Auditor. All departments shall work to maintain the designated capital reserve
balance in each fund. City departments will plan annual capital improvement
expenditures based on fund balances available in excess of the established goals. The
fund balance goals are designed to be maintained from year to year.
Municipal Utility Capital Project Fund Accounts — Contributions. Municipal Utilities will
include depreciation in their annual budget and this annual depreciation will be deposited
to the credit of each Utility Capital Project Fund. The annual depreciation shall be based
on asset depreciation schedules prepared by the City Auditor. Municipal Utilities shall
work to maintain the designated capital reserve balance goal in each fund.
City And Municipal Utility Capital Project Fund Accounts — Additional Contributions. For
each fiscal year, when the reserve balance in the City or Municipal Utility Reserve Fund
exceeds the designated reserve balance for that fund, the excess funds shall be
transferred to the Capital Project Fund and credited to the Capital Project Fund for the
department and/or Utility as determined by the Mayor and City staff and approved by the
Municipal Utility Board/City Council.
City Capitol Project Fund Reduction And Restoration. Reserves in these accounts may
only be spent for capital projects or repairs and replacement to facilities and equipment
relating to the department for which the Capital Project Fund Account was created. City
departments will plan annual capital improvement expenditures based on fund balances
available in excess of the established goals for each department. The fund balance goals
are designed to be maintained from year to year. The City Council will approve any
expenditures made from Capital Project Fund Accounts. In the event that expenditures
are made from City Capital Project Fund Accounts that drop the fund balance below the
goal, the City will work to recapitalize the fund to its established goal over the period of
not more than three (3) years, or as determined by the City Council and accomplished

through the annual budgeting process. This may include consideration of increasing
revenue sources or decreasing operating expenditures.
Municipal Utility Capital Project Fund Reduction And Restoration. The minimum balances
in the Municipal Utility Capital Project Funds are designed to be maintained as reserve
funds. The balances available in each Utility consisting of the difference between the
minimum balance and the goal are available for capital projects or repairs and
replacement to facilities and equipment relating to the Utility for which the Capital Project
Fund Account was created. The Municipal Utility will plan annual capital improvement
expenditures based on fund balances available. When expenditures are made from the
Municipal Utility Capital Project Fund Accounts that drop the fund balance below the
minimum, the Municipal Utility and City will work to recapitalize the fund over the period
of not more than five (5) years through the annual budgeting process. The fund balance
minimum and goals will be adjusted annually based on change in accumulated
depreciation, and this amount will be included as a line item in the annual budgeting
process. The Municipal Utility Board will recommend and the City Council will approve
any expenditure made from Capital Project Fund Accounts. When capital expenditures
are made and the fund drops below the goal, the Municipal Utilities/City will develop a
plan to work toward recapitalization of the fund balance goal. This may include
consideration of rate increases or decreasing operating expenditures.
Periodic Review And Modification. The Mayor and City and Municipal Utility staff shall
periodically evaluate and make recommendations to the City Council and/or the Municipal
Utility Board regarding the adequacy of the designated reserves and recommend
modifications to this policy; however, such recommendations shall be consistent with the
intended purpose.

exist. The type and degree of protection required shall be commensurate with the degree of
hazard.
An approved air gap separation or reduced pressure, principle backflow prevention assembly shall
be installed at the service connection or within any premises where, in the judgement of the water
purveyor or the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, the nature and extent of activities on
the premises, or the materials used in connection with the activities, or materials stored on the
premises, would present an immediate and dangerous hazard to health should a cross connection
occur, even though such cross connection may not exist at the time the backflow prevention
device is required to be installed. This includes but is not limited to the following situations:
Premises having an auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of the auxiliary supply is
acceptable to the water purveyor and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
Premises having internal excess connections that are not correctable, or intricate plumbing
arrangements which make it impractical to ascertain whether or not cross connections exist.
Premises where entry is restricted so that inspection for cross connections cannot be made
with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short notice to assure the cross connections do not
exist.
Premises having a repeated history of cross connections being established or reestablished.
Premises which, due to the nature of the enterprises therein, are subject to recurring
modification or expansion.
Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to permit entry into the
public water supply, or where a cross connection could reasonably be expected to occur. This
shall include the handling of process waters and cooling waters.
Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled such that if
backsiphonage or backpressure should occur, a serious health hazard may result.
The types of facilities listed in Section 710.330 fall into one (1) or more of the categories of
premises where an approved air gap separation or reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly is required by the water purveyor and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources to
protect the public water supply and must be installed at these facilities unless all hazardous or
potentially hazardous conditions have been eliminated or corrected by other methods to the

Surcharge Established. No persons shall discharge any toxic pollutants to the sanitary sewerage
system. Any person violating the terms of this Chapter shall be fined not less than twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) or more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each occurrence. Any such
discharge shall be deemed a violation for each day of such discharge. Any user so discharging
any toxic pollutant or non-domestic waste which shall cause an increase in the cost of operation
and maintenance of the sewerage treatment works shall be further charged by way of an increase
of user fee for the increased cost attributable to such discharge. The Utility Board of the City of St.
James shall determine any such additional charge for each violation of this Chapter after
requesting an estimate of the increase in the operation and maintenance cost from the
Superintendent of the sewerage treatment system. Any person discharging wastewater in
concentrations in excess of the defined normal domestic waste strength shall be charged a
surcharge in accordance with the surcharge formula included in this Chapter. The City of St.
James may provide sewerage services outside the incorporated limits of the City of St. James by
entering into a written agreement with the prospective user, whereby said user by contract binds
and commits himself/herself to the provisions of this Chapter and all other ordinances of the City
of St. James pertaining to the use of the sanitary sewer system. Any violation of the terms of this
Chapter or any other ordinance governing the use of the sanitary sewer system by users located
outside the City limits of the City of St. James may cause discontinuance of said sewer system by
any persons so violating this Chapter, in the discretion of the Utility Board of the City of St. James.
Surcharge For Discharge Of Stronger Than Normal Wastes.
Scope. The surcharge discussed herein shall apply to users of the St. James, Missouri,
sanitary sewer system which discharges wastes having higher than normal concentrations of
BOD and suspended solids. This surcharge does not include any additional costs or fines
resulting from the discharge of toxics, metals, or other types of non-domestic wastes. The City
of St. James shall have the right, as provided for in this Chapter, to enter all properties for the
purpose of sampling wastes to determine if the average waste strength exceeds the normal
domestic waste strength, as defined below.
Definition. "Normal domestic waste strength," as referred to in Subsection (A), shall be the
waste strength originating from typical residential users. This waste shall be defined as
containing no toxics or other substances forbidden by this Chapter, and have a concentration
of BOD and suspended solids not exceeding two hundred fifty (250) mg/l and three hundred
(300) mg/l, respectively. The concentration limits defined above shall be changed by
amending this Section if representative test results indicate that the average strength varies
significantly from the defined limits.
Test Procedure For Determining Waste Concentrations. When, in the opinion of the
Superintendent, the waste strength from a user may exceed the normal domestic waste
strength, as defined above, the actual average concentration of BOD and suspended solids
shall be determined by laboratory tests. These tests shall be performed according to the
procedures given in the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater." The City, at its option, may either perform the necessary tests, or require the
user to monitor its own waste concentrations. Where self-monitoring is employed, the user
may be required to furnish the City with duplicate wastewater samples so that test results may
be verified periodically. The Superintendent shall require a sufficient number of samples to
obtain a reasonable estimate of the actual waste strength. Composite samples may be
required when considered necessary by the Superintendent. As a minimum, one (1) grab
sample per month shall be collected and analyzed. All samples shall be collected at a time
when the user's waste discharge is representative of normal conditions.
Formula. A sewer use surcharge shall be levied in accordance with the following formula for
persons discharging waste stronger than the defined normal domestic waste strength. This
surcharge shall be in addition to the regular sewer use charge require this Chapter.
Surcharge (in dollars): V(C1(B-N1) + C2(S-N2))

Where:
V is volume of water used in 1,000s of gallons per month
C1 is the unit cost of treating BOD = $0.0004 / 1,000 gallons per mg/l
B is the average BOD concentration of the user's waste discharge during the month
(mg/l)
N1 is the defined BOD concentration for normal domestic waste strength = 250 mg/l
C2 is the unit cost of treating suspended solids = $0.0004 / 1,000 gallons per mg/l
S is the average suspended solids concentration of the user's waste discharge during
the month (mg/l)
N2 is the defined suspended solids concentration for normal domestic waste strength =
300 mg/l
Changes In Surcharge. The sewer use surcharge may be modified by amending this Section
for either of the following reasons:
As discussed previously, the defined normal domestic waste strength for BOD and/or
suspended solids shall be changed if representative samples and test results indicate a
significant variation between the actual waste concentrations and the assumed values.
This would result in changing N1 and N2 in the formula above.
The surcharge shall be changed whenever it is found necessary to adjust the regular
sewer use charge. The unit costs of treatment (C1 and C2 in the above formula) shall be
adjusted by the same percentages as the regular user charge.
Excessive Strength Surcharge Computation.
This surcharge is to apply to waste discharges containing concentrations of BOD and
suspended solids stronger than the defined normal domestic waste strength. The total annual
cost of treatment has been estimated at twenty-seven thousand eight hundred dollars
($27,800.00). This cost has been divided into three areas: BOD, suspended solids, and flow.
The estimated split between these three areas is as follows:
BOD 30%
Suspended solids 35%
Flow 35%
Total 100%
The model formula is as follows:
Surcharge: V(C1(B-N1) + C2(S-N2))
Where:
V is volume of water used in 1,000s of gallons per month
C1 is the unit cost of treating BOD = $0.0004
B is the average BOD concentration of the user's waste discharge during the month
(mg/l)
N1 is the defined BOD concentration for normal domestic waste strength = 250 mg/l
C2 is unit cost of treating suspended solids = $0.00035
S is the average suspended solids concentration of the user's waste discharge during
the month (mg/l)
N2 is the defined suspended solids concentration for normal domestic waste strength =
300 mg/l

Rewriting the formula with constants inserted gives:
Surcharge = V(0.0004(B-250) + 0.00035(S-300))
The values for C1 and C2 were determined by dividing the cost of treatment by the estimated
present loadings for BOD and suspended solids.
Unit cost of treating BOD = 0.30 x $40,800 ($/yr)
732 (lb/day) x 365 (day/yr) = 0.046 ($/lb)
Converting to proper units:
C1 =
0.046($/lb) x 3790 (liter/1,000 gal)
+ 0.0004
450,000 (mg/lb)
Unit cost of treating suspended
solids =
35 x 40,800 ($/yr)
880 (lb/day) x 365 (day/yr) = 0.45 ($/lb)
Converting to proper units:
C2 =
0.045 ($/lb) x 3,790 (liter/1,000
gal)
450,000 (mg/lb)
= 0.0004
Sample Calculation. Suppose a user discharges waste having a concentration with an
average strength of six hundred (600) mg/l BOD and four hundred fifty (450) mg/l suspended
solids. His/her monthly water billing gives a usage of twenty thousand (20,000) gallons.
Compute the user's sewer charge for this month.
Regular User Charge = $0.42 x 20,000 gal = $8.40
Surcharge = V(0.0004(B-250) + 0.0004(S-300))
= 20(0.0004(600-250) + 0.0004(450-300))
= $4.00
Total Monthly Charge = $8.40 + $4.00 = $12.40
