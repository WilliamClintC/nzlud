the CEO to issue the Land Use Authorization. If the Planning Board
determines that the application is not satisfactory the Planning Board must
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 2-4 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2012, JUNE 2015
deny the permit and state in writing the reasons for the denial, including
findings of fact.
e. If the Planning Board needs more time to review the application and the
information presented, or if the applicant needs more time to present
additional information to show that the application is satisfactory, the
Planning Board may vote to continue review of the application to another
Planning Board meeting which is to be held within 60 days. This time
period may be longer by mutual agreement of the applicant and the Planning
Board. The motion to continue must state the reason for the continuation
and the date, time, and location of the meeting to which it is continued.
9. If the Planning Board can not judge that the proposed land use or activity will
conform to all applicable provisions of this Ordinance, and other applicable
codes or Ordinances of the Town, the Planning Board may, after notification to,
and at the expense of, the applicant, employ one or more independent
consultants to ensure compliance with all requirements of this Ordinance. The

completion of all improvements proposed by the applicant, occupancy may take
place but only after a performance guarantee has been given to the Town
covering the full cost to the Town of their completion.
3. The performance guarantee may be either a certified check payable to the Town
of Fryeburg, an irrevocable letter of credit from a lending institution, or a
performance bond payable to the Town of Fryeburg issued by a surety
company. The performance guarantee must be in an amount adequate to cover
the total costs of all required improvements, taking into account the time-span
of the guarantee and the effects of inflation upon costs. The conditions and
amount of the performance guarantee must be determined by the Planning
Board after discussion with the Board of Selectmen.
4. Prior to the release of any part of or the entire performance guarantee, the
Planning Board must determine to its satisfaction that the proposed
improvements meet or exceed the design and construction requirements for that
portion of the improvements for which the release is requested. Any interest
accumulated on an escrow account must be returned with any money owed by
the town to the developer after it has been determined that the proposed
improvements meet all design and construction requirements.
5. If the Planning Board finds, upon inspection of the improvements performed
before release of the guarantee, that any of the required improvements have not
been constructed in accordance with plans and specifications filed by the
applicant, the Planning Board must so report to the Board of Selectmen. The
Town must then notify the applicant, and, if necessary, the bonding company or
lending institution, and take all necessary steps to preserve the Town's rights
under the guarantee.

6. There is no Performance Guarantee requirement for land uses or activities for
which the Review Authority is the CEO.
M. Fees
1. The Board of Selectman must annually set the amount of all fees required by
this Ordinance. If they fail to set the fees, those established for the prior year
continue in effect.
2. The applicant may pay into a special account the cost to the Town of hiring
independent consulting services. This cost is to be determined after the
Planning Board has secured an estimate of the cost of the services and the
applicant has seen the estimate. If the balance in the special account is
anticipated to be exhausted, the Planning Board may notify the applicant and
require an additional amount. Any balance in the account remaining after a
final decision on the application must be returned to the applicant.

Zoning Map must be retained on file in the office of the Town Clerk.
F. Uncertainty of Boundary Location
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of various Districts as shown
on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules apply:
1. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets, lot
lines, municipal limits, or railroad lines are to be construed as following such
center lines, lot lines, municipal limits, or railroad lines;
2. Boundaries indicated as following shorelines are to be construed as following
such shorelines, and in the event of natural change in the shoreline are to be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as
approximately following the center line of streams, rivers, lakes, or other bodies
of water are to be construed as following such center lines;

b. Other property in the district will not be adversely affected.
c. A refusal of the request would result in injustice.
The procedures for a hearing under a variance request are to be followed.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 3-2 MARCH 1998
SECTION 4
NON-CONFORMING SITUATIONS
A. Purpose
It is the intent of this Section to promote conformity with this Ordinance, except
that non-conforming conditions that legally existed before the effective date of
this Ordinance, or any amendment thereto are allowed to continue, subject to the
requirements set forth in Section 4. except as otherwise provided in this
Ordinance, a non-conforming condition shall not be permitted to become more
non-conforming.
B. Land Use Requirements
Except as hereinafter specified, no building, structure or land shall hereafter be
used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be
erected, constructed, moved or altered and no new lot shall be created unless in
conformity with all of the regulation herein specified for the district in which it is
located, unless a variance is granted.
C. Non-Conformance
1. General
a. Continuance, enlargement, reconstruction: Any non-conforming
use or non-conforming structure may continue to exist but may not
be extended, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered except
as specified below.
b. Transfer of ownership: Non-conforming structures, nonconforming
lots of record, and non-conforming uses may be
transferred, and the new owner may continue the on-conforming
use or continue to use the non-conforming structure or lot, subject
to the provisions of this Ordinance.
c. Nonconformity resulting from governmental action or eminent
domain: No non-conforming structure or aspect of such structure,
and no non-conforming lot or aspect of such lot, shall be deemed
to be more nonconforming as a result of any taking of a portion of
that structure or lot by eminent domain or by action of
governmental authority which occurred after the enactment of this
ordinance. Any such non-conforming structure, non-conforming
lot, and non-conforming use which was lawfully in existence on
the date of acquisition by eminent domain or by action of
governmental authority shall be deemed to be continued in lawful
existence subject to the requirements set forth in this section as
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 4-1 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2010
REV. JUNE 2014, JUNE 2015, JUNE 2016
though such acquisition by eminent domain or by action of
governmental authority has not occurred.
No structure, lot, or use of lot which conformed with the
provisions of this ordinance prior to the acquisition by eminent
domain or by action of governmental authority shall be considered
non-conforming or in violation of this ordinance solely as a result
of such acquisition by eminent domain or by other governmental
action. Such structure, lot, or use shall be deemed to continue to be
a conforming structure, lot, or use after the acquisition by eminent
domain or other governmental action as though such taking or
acquisition by governmental authority had not occurred. For
purpose of this ordinance lot area, setback, coverage, and any other
dimensional requirements under this ordinance shall be measured
or determined as though no such acquisition by eminent domain or
other governmental action had occurred.
d. Restoration or replacement: This Ordinance allows_ the normal
upkeep and maintenance of non-conforming uses and structures,
and repairs, renovations, enlargements, modernization of nonconforming
uses and structure, and such other changes in the nonconforming
use or structure as Federal, State, and local building
and safety codes may require. Any non-conforming structure
which is hereinafter removed, damaged or destroyed, regardless of
the cause (including demolition incidental to renovation) by more
than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage,
destruction, or removal may be replaced, repaired, restored or
reconstructed, provided a permit is obtained within eighteen (18)
months of the date of said damage or destruction or demolition,
provided that:
(1) Such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the
water body, tributary stream or wetland setback requirement
to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning
Board or its designee;
(2) If the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the
required setback it shall not be any larger than the original
structure, except as allowed pursuant to Section 4.C.3 below,
as determined by the non-conforming footprint of the
reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location. If the
total footprint of the original structure can be relocated or
reconstructed beyond the required setback area, no portion of
the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or
constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new
structure. When it is necessary to remove vegetation in order
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 4-2 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2010
REV. JUNE 2014, JUNE 2015, JUNE 2016
to replace or reconstruct a structure, vegetation shall be
replanted in accordance with Section 4.C.3.b.4.f, relocation
below.
2. Non-conforming use
a. Resumption Prohibited: A building, lot or structure in or on which
a non-conforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding two
years, or which is superseded by a conforming use, may not again
be devoted to a non-conforming use, even if the owner has not
intended to abandon the use.
b. A Structure Non-conforming as to Use: Except for single family
dwellings, a building or structure, non-conforming as to use, shall
not be enlarged unless the non-conforming use is terminated.
Except in a Resource Protection District, single family dwellings,
which are non-conforming uses, may be enlarged as long as the
dimensional requirements of the district in which they are located
are met. A non-conforming use or part of a building or structure
shall not extended throughout other parts of the building or
structure unless those parts of the building or structure were
manifestly enlarged or designed for such use prior to the adoption
of this Ordinance, or of any amendment making such use nonconforming.
c. An existing non-conforming use or an agricultural produce
processing facility existing on the effective date of this Ordinance
whether or not non-conforming may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that the proposed use is equally or more
appropriate to the district than the existing non-conforming or
agricultural produce processing use, and the impact on adjacent
properties and resources, is less adverse than heard as an
administrative appeal. The determination of appropriateness shall
require written documentation for the applicant regarding the
probable effects on public health and safety, erosion and
sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative
cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural
beauty, floodplain management and archaeological and historic
resources.
d. Use of Land: A non-conforming use of land which is accessory to
a non-conforming use of a building shall be discontinued at the
same time the non-conforming use of the building is discontinued.
In case of earth removal operations, the removal of earth may not
be extended as a non-conforming use beyond the required setback
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 4-3 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2010
REV. JUNE 2014, JUNE 2015, JUNE 2016
line of the specific parcel upon which such operations were in
progress when such use became non-conforming as required by the
performance standards for extractive industries. Adjacent parcels
in the same or different ownership shall not be eligible for
exemption under the non-conforming use provisions unless earth
removal operations were in progress on these parcels before these
provisions were enacted.
e. Not withstanding the provisions of paragraphs C.2.b., C.2.c, and
C.2.d above a structure non-conforming as to use, or a nonconforming
use of land, may be enlarged, extended or expanded
provided that the applicant shows that the soils, location and lot are
suitable for the proposed use and will not unreasonably interfere
with the use and enjoyment of their property by adjacent
landowners. The enlargement, extension or expansion will
conform to all other requirements of the district involved including
dimensional standards and the performance standards of Sections
Sixteen and Seventeen of this Ordinance. In order to be eligible
for an enlargement, extension or expansion under this subsection,
the non-conforming use must be lawfully non-conforming at the
time of adoption of this Ordinance. The enlargement, extension, or
expansion shall be heard as an administrative appeal to the Board
of Appeals.
The provisions of required off-street parking for an existing nonconforming
use shall not be considered the expansion of the use.
3. Non-conforming Structure: (Pertaining to dimensional requirements.
Applications regarding non-conforming use shall be reviewed under the
provisions above).
a. Non-Shoreland Zone Enlargements Controlled: A structure nonconforming
to the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance may
be added to or enlarged when the proposed addition or enlargement
will conform to all the regulations of the district in which it is
located; or when the proposed addition or enlargement does not
increase the non-conforming aspects of the existing structure; or by
variance, pursuant to the provisions of this Ordinance. In addition,
state laws must be adhered to.
The addition of an open patio with no structures elevated above the
ground shall not constitute the expansion of a non-conforming
structure. The addition of steps shall not constitute the expansion
of a non-conforming structure. The enclosure of an existing deck
shall not constitute the expansion of a non-conforming structure.
In all districts, the addition of a deck shall constitute the expansion
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 4-4 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2010
REV. JUNE 2014, JUNE 2015, JUNE 2016
of a non-conforming structure and shall comply with the
requirements of this Ordinance.
b. Shoreland Zone Enlargements Controlled: All new principal and
accessory structures, excluding functionally water-dependent uses,
must meet the dimensional requirements of this ordinance
including the water body, tributary stream, or wetland setback
requirements contained in Section 20. A non-conforming structure
may be added to or expanded after obtaining a permit from the
same permitting authority as that for a new structure, if such
addition or expansion does not increase the non-conformity of the
structure and is in accordance with subparagraphs 1) and 2) below:
( 1) Expansion of any portion of a structure within 25 feet of
the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary
stream, or upland edge of a wetland is prohibited, even if
the expansion will not increase nonconformity with the
water body, tributary stream or wetland setback
requirement. Expansion of an accessory structure that is
located closer to the normal high-water line of a water
body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland than the
principal structure is prohibited, even if the expansion will
not increase nonconformity with the water body, tributary
stream, or wetland setback requirement.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph 1 ), above, if a legally existing
nonconforming principal structure is entirely located less
than 25 feet from the normal high-water line of a water
body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland, that
structure may be expanded as follows, as long as all other
applicable municipal land use standards are met and the
expansion is not prohibited by Section 4.C.3.b.
L The maximum total footprint for the principal structure
may not be expanded to a size greater than 800 square
feet or 30% larger than the footprint that existed on
January 1, 1989, whichever is greater. The maximum
height of the principal structure may not be made
greater than 15 feet or the height of the existing
structure, whichever is greater.
(3) All other legally existing nonconforming principal and
accessory structures that do not meet the water body,
tributary stream, or wetland setback requirements may be
expanded or altered as follows, as long as other applicable
municipal land use standards are met and the expansion is
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 4-5 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2010
REV. JUNE 2014, JUNE 2015, JUNE 2016
not prohibited by Section 4.C.3.b. or Section 4.C.3.b.l.,
above.
i. For structures located less than 75 feet from the normal
high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or
upland edge of a wetland, the maximum combined total
footprint for all structures may not be expanded to a
size greater than 1,000 square feet or 30% larger than
the footprint that existed on January 1, 1989, whichever
is greater. The maximum height of any structure may
not be made greater than 20 feet or the height of the
existing structure, whichever is greater.
lL. For structures located less than 100 feet from the
normal high-water line of a great pond classified as
GP A or a river flowing to a great pond classified as
GP A, the maximum combined total footprint for all
structures may not be expanded to a size greater than
1,500 square feet or 30% larger than the footprint that
existed on January 1, 1989, whichever is greater. The
maximum height of any structure may not be made
greater than 25 feet or the height of the existing
structure, whichever is greater. Any portion of those
structures located less than 75 feet from the normal
high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or
upland edge of a wetland must meet the footprint and
height limits in Section 4.C.3.b. l .i. and Section
4.C.3.b.2.i. above.
nt. In addition to the limitations in subparagraphs (i) and
(ii), for structures that are legally nonconforming due to
their location within the Resource Protection District
when located at less than 250 feet from the normal
high-water line of a water body or the upland edge of a
wetland, the maximum combined total footprint for all
structures may not be expanded to a size greater than
1,500 square feet or 30% larger than the footprint that
existed at the time the Resource Protection District was
established on the lot, whichever is greater. The
maximum height of any structure may not be made
greater than 25 feet or the height of the existing
structure, whichever is greater, except that any portion
of those structures located less than 7 5 feet from the
normal high-water line of a water body, tributary
stream, or upland edge of a wetland must meet the
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 4-6 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2010
REV. JUNE 2014, JUNE 2015, JUNE 2016
footprint and height limits in Section 4.C.3 .b. l .i and
Section 4.C.3.b.2.i above.
( 4) An approved plan for expansion of a nonconforming
structure must be recorded by the applicant with the
registry of deeds, within 90 days of approval. The recorded
plan must show the existing and proposed footprint of the
non-conforming structure, the existing and proposed
structure height, the footprint of any other structures on the
parcel, the shoreland zone boundary and evidence of
approval by the municipal review authority.
c. Foundations: The placing of a foundation below a lawfully existing
or lawfully expanded non-conforming structure shall not constitute
the expansion of the structure so long as the first floor of the
structure is not increased and the foundation does not extend
beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure. Whenever a new,
enlarged, or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming
structure, the structure and new foundation must be
placed to conform to the shoreline setback to the greatest practical
extent as determined by the Planning Board or its designee, basing
its decision on the criteria specified in Section 4.C.3.f Relocation
below.
d. Discontinuance: Discontinuance of the use of a legally existing
non-conforming structure shall not constitute abandonment of the
structure. Conforming use of the structure may be commenced at
any time.
e. Lack of Required Parking or Loading Space: A building or
structure which is non-conforming as to the requirements for offstreet
and/or loading space shall not be enlarged, added to or
altered unless off-street parking and/or loading space is provided to
bring parking and/or loading space into conformance with the
requirements of this Ordinance for both the addition or alteration
and for the original building or structure, or a variance is obtained.
f. Relocation: A non-conforming structure may be relocated within
the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located
provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback
requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the
Planning Board or its designee, and provided that the applicant
demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system
meets the requirements of State law and the State of Maine
Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules, or that a new system can
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 4-7 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2010
REV. JUNE 2014, JUNE 2015, JUNE 2016
be installed in compliance with the law and said Rules. In no case
shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure
to be more non-conforming.
In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback
to the greatest practical extent, the Planning Board or its designee
shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential
for soil erosion, the location of other structures on the property and
on adjacent properties, the location of the septic system and other
on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type and amount of
vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation. When it is
necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland
setback area in order to relocate a structure, the Planning Board
shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the
destroyed vegetation in accordance with Section 20.C. l 1. In
addition, the area from which the relocated structure was removed
must be replanted with vegetation. Replanting shall be required as
follows:
(1) Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be
replanted with as least one native tree, three (3) feet in
height, for every tree removed. If more than five trees
are planted, no one species of tree shall make up more
than 50% of the number of trees planted. Replaced
trees must be planted no further from the water or
wetland than the trees that were removed.
Other woody and herbaceous vegetation, and ground
cover, that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate
structure must be re-established. An area at least the
same size as the area where vegetation and/or ground
cover was disturbed, damaged, or removed must be reestablished
within the setback area. The vegetation
and/or ground cover must consist of similar native
vegetation and/or ground cover that was disturbed,
destroyed or removed.
(2) Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a
parcel the original location of the structure shall be
replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses,
shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof.
4. Non-conforming Lots of Record
a. Vacant Lots: A vacant non-conforming lot may be built upon
provided that such lot is in separate ownership and not contiguous
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 4-8 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2010
REV. JUNE 2014, JUNE 2015, JUNE 2016
with any other vacant lot in the same ownership, and that all
provisions of this Ordinance except lot area, lot width, frontage
and shore frontage can be met. Variance of setback or other
requirements not involving lot area, lot width, frontage, or shore
frontage shall be obtained only by action of the Board of Appeals.
b. Built Lots: A non-conforming lot that was built upon prior to the
enactment or subsequent amendment of this Ordinance is subject
to the following restrictions: The structure(s) may be repaired,
maintained, or improved and may be enlarged in conformity with
all dimensional requirements of this Ordinance except lot area, lot
width, or lot frontage. If the proposed enlargement of the
structure( s) cannot meet the dimensional requirements of this
Ordinance a variance shall be obtained from the Board of Appeals.
c. Contiguous Built Lots: If two or more contiguous lots or parcels
are in single or joint ownership of record at the time of or since
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, if all or part of these
lots do not meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance or
subsequent amendments, and if a principal use or structure exists
on each lot, the non-conforming lots may be conveyed separately
or together, provided that the State Minimum Lot Size Law (12
M.R.S.A. sections 4807-A through 4807-D) and the State of Maine
Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied with. This
provision does not apply to subdivisions which have been
approved by the Fryeburg Planning Board since January 1, 1974.
If two or more principal uses or structures existed on a single lot of
record on the effective date of this ordinance, each may be sold on
a separate lot provided the above referenced law and rules are
complied with. When such lots are divided each lot thus created
must be as conforming as possible to the dimensional requirements
of this ordinance.
d. Contiguous Lots- Vacant or Partially Built: If two or more
contiguous lots or parcels are in single or joint ownership of record
at the time or since adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, if
any of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional
requirements of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments, and if
one or more of the lots are vacant or contain no principle structure
the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to meet the
dimensional requirements.
D. Vested Rights
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 4-9 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2010
REV. JUNE 2014, JUNE 2015, JUNE 2016
Non-conforming use rights cannot arise by the mere filing of a notice of intent to
build, an application for building permits, or an application for required state
permits and approvals. Such rights arise when substantial construction of
structures has begun and/or development infrastructure improvements for town
approved subdivisions began prior to or within 24 months of the adoption of this
Ordinance, or in the case of pending applications, when the review process on an
application commences. Such construction must be legal at the time it
commences and the owner must be in possession of and in compliance with all
validly issued permits, both state and local.
E. Non-conforming as to Performance Standards
A use non-conforming as to General Performance Standards in Section Sixteen,
Specific Performance Standards in Section Seventeen, or any other site
development requirement including, but not limited to, parking spaces, access
control, loading spaces, screening, erosion and sedimentation control, lighting,
hours of operation, and noise, may continue but may not be expanded, the
structure may not be enlarged, and the structure may not be altered to expand the
use, unless all non-conforming performance standards and the site development
are brought into conformance with this Ordinance.

OUTLYING RESIDENTIAL-COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
A. Purpose
The purpose of Outlying Residential-Commercial District is to foster the continuation
of the former village areas of Fryeburg Center and North Fryeburg, and East
Fryeburg. These are areas where commercial and residential uses have existed
together and these mixed uses will be encouraged by the district. High impact
industrial and commercial uses are not appropriate in this district, nor are scattered
and strip development. Clustered commercial uses and low impact commercial uses
are appropriate.
B. Location
The location and boundaries of the Outlying Residential-Commercial District are
established as shown on the Official Zoning Map and are a part of this Ordinance.
C. Dimensional Requirements
Except for legal non-conformity, buildings or land used or occupied, and buildings

GENERAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
A. Purpose
The purpose of the General Commercial District is to accommodate the shopping and
business needs of a much larger consumer population and area of residency than is
served by the Village Commercial District. Also in the General Commercial District
are the commercial uses which because of their needs for large areas of outdoor
storage and display, and motor vehicle parking and maneuvering, are not appropriate
in the Village Commercial District.
In this district appropriate buffering and set backs are to be used to assure that
development is compatible with adjacent uses, and performance, site development,
and highway access management standards are to be employed to assure that the uses
do not have a detrimental effect on the public health, safety (including traffic safety),
and welfare.
B. Location

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
A. Applicability and Purpose
These standards apply to all new or expanded uses of land and buildings in the Town
of Fryeburg, unless otherwise specified, whether or not specific approval or a permit
is required. The purposes of these standards are to help implement the
Comprehensive Plan, to balance the rights of land owners to use their land with the
rights of abutting land owners and the general public, and to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare. Any of these standards may be waived by a unanimous vote of
the Planning Board, present and voting, upon a written finding that the purpose and
intent of the Ordinance will be maintained without the applicant meeting the specific
standard.
B. Access Control and Traffic Impacts
1. Any development must provide for safe access to and from streets. Safe access
must be assured by providing access points which are appropriate as to number
and location, with respect to sight-distances, intersections, schools, and other
traffic generators.
2. Any access on to a street is limited to the minimum width necessary for safe
entering and exiting. The proposed development may not have an unreasonable
negative impact on the street system, All exit driveways must be designed so
that there is at least ten feet of sight-distance for each mile per hour of legal
speed on the accessed street.
Safe circulation within the site must be provided by separating pedestrian and
vehicular traffic and by providing parking and loading areas required in this
Section 16.I. The site layout shall provide for the safe movement of vehicular,
pedestrian, and cyclist traffic, and emergency vehicles through the site.
A system of pedestrian ways shall be provided within any proposed
development. The system shall connect major building entrances and exits with
parking areas and with existing or planned sidewalks within the vicinity of the
project. The system shall be safely delineated or separated from vehicular
traffic though landscape buffers, curbing, or appropriate pavement markings or
s1gnage.
3. Slope and intersection angle
Driveways may not have an average slope in excess of 8% within 25 feet of the
point of intersection of a street. The angle of intersection between the driveway
and the street must be as close to 90 degrees as possible.
4. Driveways through residential districts
No driveway may be located in a residential district to provide access to uses
other than those permitted in that residential district.

5. Streets must have carrying capacity
The street to which a driveway connects and the streets which are expected to
carry traffic to the use served by the driveway must have traffic carrying
capacity and be suitably improved to accommodate the amounts and types of
traffic generated by the proposed use. No development may reduce the road's
Level of Service to "D" or below.
6. Street improvements required
Where necessary to safeguard against hazards to traffic and pedestrians and/or
to avoid traffic congestion, provisions must be made for turning lanes, traffic
directional islands, frontage streets, and traffic controls within the public streets.
7. Streets must have carrying capacity
The street to which a driveway connects and the streets which are expected to
carry traffic to the use served by the driveway must have traffic carrying
capacity and be suitably improved to accommodate the amounts and types of
traffic generated by the proposed use. Table 10-4 (Chapter 10) of the Fryeburg
Comprehensive Plan shall be used as a guide for forecasting Level of Service.
The Planning Board may require that an updated analysis be submitted. No
development may reduce the road's level of service to "D" or below.
8. Prevent queuing
Driveways serving commercial uses must be designed with enough on-site
vehicular stacking capacity so as to prevent queuing of entering vehicles on any
street.
9. Circulation connections to adjoining lots

potential uses, generally open to the public, without need to travel onto a
street.
10. Sight distance for posted speeds of 45 miles per hour or greater
A driveway must be designed in profile and grading, and located, so as to
provide the ten feet of sight distance for every mile per hour of posted speed. If
the street is not posted the posted maximum speed is assumed to be 45 miles per
hour. The measurements must be from the driver's seat of a vehicle standing on
that portion of the driveway with the front of the vehicle a minimum of ten feet
behind the curb line or edge of shoulder, with the height of the eye 3.5 feet to
the top of an object 4.25 feet above the pavement.

D. Building and Site Review (Applies only to Village Commercial District)
In the Village Commercial District, the following building and site conditions must
be approved by the Planning Board prior to the issuance of any building permit for a
new building, or which affects the exterior appearance of an existing building as seen
from the street.
1. Architectural Design
a. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide design standards with which to
assist the development or renovations of commercial properties to
compliment the overall New England style ambiance of the Town of
Fryeburg. The guidelines are directed towards, but are not limited to,
assisting corporate franchises and commercial development in the design of
structures which reflect small town New England atmosphere unique to
Fryeburg. Consideration must be given to scale and pedestrian orientation
for the design of, or renovation of a commercial structure so as to make it fit
in and compliment the surrounding neighborhood.
b. The objective of these regulations is not intended to restrict imagination,
innovation or variety in the new construction or renovation of commercial
buildings and related property, but rather to encourage continued economic
development, conserve property values, and further enhance the visual
appearance of the community. These provisions do not apply to
industrial/commercial buildings in other zoning districts.
c. The regulations contained herein do not expect to foresee all possible
proposed building situations. Decisions concerning such unforeseen
situations will be made with these regulations in mind.
(1) Monotony of design or warehouse style structures shall be avoided.
Variation in detail, form and siting shall be used to provide visual
appeal. In order to prevent the construction of warehouse style
buildings-buildings with long, horizontal roof lines-all new
buildings and additions shall have pitched roofs of 3: 12 or greater or
gabled roofs, where practical. In cases where pitched roofs are not
practical, the use of false building fonts shall be used to imitate
pitched roofs to vary the horizontal lines along portions of the facade
to create the appearance of multiple attached buildings. All sides of
a structure should receive design consideration. In commercial
structures with over 100 feet parallel to the road front, building
elevations facing the road shall be designed to give the appearance of
multiple attached buildings. Wherever possible, all roof top
mechanical units shall be located so as not to be visible from street
level or from public areas from ground level.
(2) The exterior surfaces of all buildings shall be covered with wood or
vinyl clapboard, wood or vinyl shingles, or brick. Pitched roofs shall
be constructed of shingles, metal roofing or other materials
traditionally used in this region.

REV. JUNE 2009
REV. OCT 2012
REV. JUNE 2015
(3) Windows shall comprise no less than 10% of the exterior wall
surface of the portions of the building facing the road front.
Windows may be used for either interior illumination or for display
purposes.
2. New Construction Setbacks
All new buildings constructed shall have front setbacks reasonably consistent
with the setbacks of existing buildings on either side of the subject lot. This
provision may be modified by the Planning Board if the abutting buildings have
varying setbacks.
3. Landscape
a. Whenever a permit request is for 2,500 square feet or more for the ground
floor, it shall comply with the following standards in order to enhance site
design; enhance privacy, separate, screen and shield potentially conflicting
land uses or abutters from undue impact; control excessive storm water
runoff; prevent soil erosion and pollution of water bodies; reduce heat, glare
and dust; not detract from the Town's aesthetic qualities; and help integrate
the built environmental with the natural environment.
b. Boundaries with existing residential properties must be planted with
vegetative screening which will create an effective visual barrier from the
ground level to a height of ten feet. If the existing vegetative cover meets
the intent of this standard the existing cover may be maintained.
c. There will be no outside storage of merchandise or equipment and no
storage of merchandise in trailers.
E. Dust, Fumes, Vapors, and Gases
Emission of dust, dirt, fly ash, fumes, vapors or gases in quantity which damage
human health, animals, vegetation, or property, or which soils or stains persons or
property, at any point beyond the lot line of the establishment creating that emission
is prohibited.
F. Explosive Materials
Bulk quantities of highly flammable or explosive liquids, solids, or gases, stored
above ground, must be at least 75 feet from any lot line or street, and must be in
anchored tanks and buffered by fencing or vegetation from non-compatible uses.
Bulk quantities of highly flammable or explosive liquids, solids, or gases stored
below ground must be at least 40 feet from any lot line or street.
G. Glare & Lighting
1. No lights shall be placed in view of any public roadway or street so that its beams
or rays are directed at any portion of the roadway when the light is of such
brilliance and so positioned as to impair the vision of the driver of any motor
vehicle upon said roadway.

REV. JUNE 2015
2. No rotating or flashing lights or signals, except safety signaling devices as required
by law, are permitted.
3. When Land Use Authorization is required, the applicant shall submit plans for all
proposed exterior lighting. These plans shall include the location, type of lighting
equipment, manufacturer's specification sheets. The Board shall require that the
lighting plan include foot-candle distributions, plotting the light levels in footcandles
on the gro\lnd, at the designated mounting heights for the proposed
fixtures.
The following design standards shall be followed unless waived by the Planning
Board if it finds that, due to special circumstances of a particular plan, they are not
necessary to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare.
a. The style of the light and light standard shall be consistent with the
architectural style of the principal building.
b. The maximum height of freestanding lights shall be the same as the
principal building, but shall not exceed twenty (20) feet.
c. All lights shall have shielding to provide a beam cut-off at no more than 75
degrees above nadir or be IDA (International Dark-sky Association)
compliant.
d. When lights along property lines will be visible to adjacent residences, the
lights shall be appropriately shielded or be IDA (International Dark-sky
Association) compliant..
e. Lighting shall be located along streets, parking areas, at intersections and
crosswalks and where various types of circulation systems merge, intersect
or split. Lighting shall be consistent with the guidelines and
recommendations published by the Illuminating Engineering Society of
North America for the given area.
f. Pathways, sidewalks and trails shall be lighted with light fixtures of a
height not to exceed four feet and be IDA (International Dark-sky
Association) compliant.
g. Stairways and sloping or rising paths, building entrances and exits require
illumination.

N. Erosion Control
Erosion of soil and sedimentation of watercourses and water bodies must be
minimized by the following erosion control management practices:
1. The stripping of vegetation, removal of soil, re-grading, or other development of
the site must be accomplished by limiting the duration of exposure and area of
the site to be disturbed. Dust control methods as required by the review
authority must be employed during dry conditions.
2. Temporary vegetation, mulching, and/or siltation fabrics must be used to protect
critical areas during the development. Sedimentation of run-off waters must be
trapped by debris basins, silt traps, sediment basins, or other methods
determined acceptable by the review authority. Any exposed ground area must
be temporarily or permanently stabilized within one week from the time it was
last actively worked, by use of riprap, sod, seed, mulch, or other effective
measures. In addition:
a. Where mulch is used, it must be applied at a rate of at least one bale per 500
square feet and must be maintained until a catch of vegetation is established.
b. Anchoring the mulch with netting, peg and twine, or other suitable method
may be required to maintain the mulch cover and must be used on slopes of
2: 1 or greater.
c. Additional measures must be taken where necessary in order to avoid
siltation into the water. Such measures may include the use of staked hay
bales and/or silt fences.
3. Permanent vegetation and/or other erosion control measures should be installed
prior to completion of the construction, but no later than six months after
completion of the construction.
4. The top or bottom of a cut or fill may not be closer than ten feet to a property
line unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the affected landowner and Town,
but in no instance may said cut or fill exceed a 3: 1 slope, unless an adequate
retaining wall is constructed to prevent erosion of the slope.
5. Man-made drainage ways and drainage outlets must be protected from erosion
caused by water flowing through them. Drainage ways must be stabilized with
vegetation or lined with riprap.

0. Storm Water Run-off
Surface water run-off must be minimized and detained on-site if possible or
practicable. If it is not possible to detain water on-site, downstream improvements to
the channel are required of the developer to prevent flooding caused by his project.
The natural state of watercourses, swales, floodways, or rights-of-way must be
maintained as nearly as possible. Design period is 50-year storm.
P. Water Quality Protection
1. No person, land use, or activity may locate, store, discharge, or permit the
discharge of any treated, untreated, or inadequately treated liquid, gaseous, or
solid materials of such nature, quantity, obnoxiousness, toxicity, or temperature
that will run off, seep, percolate, or wash into surface or ground waters so as to
contaminate, pollute, or harm such waters or cause nuisances, such as
objectionable shore deposits, floating or submerged debris, oil or scum, color,
odor, taste or unsightliness, or be harmful to human, animal, plant, or aquatic
life.
2. All outdoor storage facilities for fuel, chemicals, chemical or industrial wastes,
and potentially harmful raw materials must be located on impervious pavement,
and must be completely enclosed by an impervious dike which is high enough
to contain the total volume of liquid kept within the storage area, plus, if not
covered by a roof, the rain falling into this storage area during a 50-year storm,
so that such liquid will not spill onto or seep into the ground surrounding the
paved storage area. Storage tanks for home heating oil and diesel fuel, not
exceeding 350 gallons in size, are exempted from this requirement, if they are
not located over a high seasonal water table (within 15 inches of the surface) or
over rapidly permeable sandy soils.
Q. Aquifer Protection
A study of the impacts on the aquifer should be required if a development which
comes under Town Planning Board review is proposed in any areas shown on the
Prime Aquifers Map as being a Prime Aquifer. If the study determines that the
development will adversely affect the quality or quantity of the ground water, the
development shall be required to be modified so that the ground water 'Yill not be
adversely affected.
R. Other Regulations Apply
The applicant is responsible for complying with all applicable local, county, state, and
federal laws and regulations. Public buildings, businesses and multi-family dwellings

REV. JUNE 2009
REV. OCT 2012
REV. JUNE 2015
in a cluster or for more than one-family dwelling must separately meet all density and
dimensional requirements per the zoning district in which it is located under this
ordinance. An accessory building exclusively for one single-family dwelling shall
not be counted as a unit under this ordinance
T. Water Supply
Any use or development shall be provided with a system of water supply that is
adequate for the intended use or uses.
If the project is to be served by a public water supply, the applicant shall secure and
submit a written statement from the supplier of the proposed water supply system
stating that the project will not result in an undue burden on the source or distribution
system.
U. Building Height
No building may exceed 35 feet in height. Features of buildings and structures, such
as chimneys, cupolas with no floor area, towers, solar energy systems, ventilators,
and spires may exceed 35 feet in height, but must be set back from the nearest lot line
a distance equal to at least the height of such feature or structure.
In the Industrial District building heights for uses that require height may exceed 35
feet, up to a maximum of 60 feet, provided the Planning Board, as part of its review,
consults with the Fryeburg Fire Chief and finds the fire fighting equipment and
personnel of the town are sufficient for rendering fire fighting services for the
building proposed to exceed 35 feet in height. In the absence of such finding, no
building in excess of 35 feet in height may be approved except upon condition that it
be constructed with an automatic sprinkler system as recommended by the Fire Chief.
V. Historical & Archaeological

archaeological resources, the development must include appropriate measures
for protecting these resources, including but not limited to, modification of the
proposed design of the site, timing of construction, and limiting the extent of
· excavation.
2. Proposed developments which include or are adjacent to buildings or sites on
the National Register of Historic Places, the Maine Historic Preservation
Commission or which the Comprehensive Plan has identified as being of
historical significance, shall be designed in such a manner as to minimize the
impacts on the historic features. When the historic features to be protected
include buildings, the placement and the architectural design of new structures
shall be similar to the historic structures. The Board may require the applicant
to seek the advice of the Maine Historic Preservation Commission.
3. In areas with a high concentration of historic properties, the Planning Board may
require new construction to utilize exterior building materials which harmonize

FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 18- l MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2010, JUNE 2015, JUNE 2017
C. Powers and Duties of the Board of Appeals
The Board of Appeals has the following powers and duties:
1. Administrative appeal of the Code Enforcement Officer (CEO)
To hear and decide administrative appeals where it is alleged there is a violation
or error in any written order, requirement, decision, interpretation, or
determination made by the CEO in the administration and enforcement of this
Ordinance.
2. Administrative appeal of the Planning Board
a. To hear and decide administrative appeals where it is alleged there is a
violation or error in any decision, interpretation, or determination made by
the Planning Board in its administration of any section of this Ordinance,
except for Administrative Appeals of Final Subdivision Approval granted by
the Planning Board.
b. Appeals of Final Subdivision Approval granted by the Planning Board shall
be taken directly to Superior court.
c. Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, a hearing of an
Administrative Appeal pursuant to this sub-section C(2), shall be conducted
by the Board of Appeals as an appellate review and not de novo.
3. Variances
To authorize variances when specifically applied for, but only within the
limitations set forth in this Ordinance.
D. Variances
Variances may be permitted only under the following conditions:
1. Variances may be granted only from dimensional requirements: lot size, lot
frontage, structure height, lot coverage, and setback requirements.
2. Establishment or expansion of uses otherwise prohibited are not allowed by
vanance.
3. A variance may not be granted simply because of the presence of nonconformity
in the district or uses in adjoining districts.
4. The Board of Appeals may grant a variance only if it finds that:
a. The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is
granted;
b. The need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property
and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
c. The granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the
locality; and
d. The hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior
owner.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 18-2 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2010, JUNE 2015, JUNE 2017
5. Such hardship may only be found by the Board of Appeals where this
Ordinance, as applied to the applicant's property, substantially destroys or
decreases the value of the property in question for any permitted use to which
the land or property can reasonably be put. Mere inconvenience to the property
owner does not satisfy this requirement. Financial hardship alone or pleading
that a greater profit may be realized from the applicant's property if a variance
is granted is not sufficient evidence of unnecessary hardship. Personal hardship
may not be considered as grounds for a variance, since the variance will
continue to affect the character of the neighborhood after title to the property
has passed.
6. The variance granted may only be the minimum variance that will make
possible the reasonable use of the land or structure in order to preserve the terms
of the Ordinance as much as possible, and the Board of Appeals may impose
such conditions to a variance as it deems necessary, to this end. The party
receiving the variance and any subsequent owner of the property must comply
with any conditions imposed.
7. The Board of Appeals may grant a variance only by the concurring vote of at
least three members.
E. Disability Variance
The Code Enforcement Officer may issue a permit to an owner of a dwelling for the
purpose of making a dwelling accessible to a person with a disability who resides
in, or regularly uses, the dwelling. If the permit requires a variance, the permit is
deemed to include that variance solely for the installation of equipment or the
construction of structures necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling for the
person with a disability. The Code Enforcement Officer may impose conditions on
the permit, including limiting the permit for the duration of the disability or to the
time that the person with a disability lives in the dwelling.
For the purposes of this section, the term "structures necessary for access to or
egress from the dwelling" includes ramps and associated railings, walls or roof
systems necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the ramps.
For the purposes under this section, "disability" has the same meaning as a physical
or mental disability under Title 5, Section 4553-A.
F. Repealed
G. Administrative Appeal and Variance Procedure
An applicant may apply for an administrative appeal, a variance, or both.
1. Application procedure:
a. An application is made by filing with the Board of Appeals a written notice
of appeal or application for a variance on forms provided. The application

Town Treasurer prior to their undertaking. Any money not spent must be
reimbursed to the applicant.
I. Stay of Proceedings
An application to the Board of Appeals for the granting of an administrative appeal or
a variance stays all legal proceedings related to that administrative appeal or variance
unless the CEO certifies to the Board of Appeals, after the notice of administrative
appeal or variance has been filed with the CEO, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in the CEO's opinion, cause irreparable harm to property or
create a threat to the life or health of any person including the applicant. In such case,
the CEO, if legally authorized by State law or local Ordinance, may seek injunctive
relief or, in appropriate cases, refer the matter to the municipal officers for
prosecution.

FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-6 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
b. The lot on which the structure is proposed is undeveloped and was
established and recorded in the registry of deeds of the county in which
the lot is located before the adoption of the Resource Protection District.
c. All proposed buildings, sewage disposal systems and other improvements
are:
1) Located on natural ground slopes of less than 20%; and
2) Located outside the floodway of the 100-year flood-plain along
rivers and artificially formed great ponds along rivers and outside
the velocity zone in areas subject to tides, based on detailed flood
insurance studies and as delineated on the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and
Flood Insurance Rate Maps; all buildings, including basements, are
elevated at least one foot above the 100-year flood-plain elevation;
and the development is otherwise in compliance with any
applicable municipal flood-plain ordinance. If the flood way is not
shown on the Federal Emergency Management Agency Maps, it is
deemed to be 112 the width of the 100-year flood-plain.
d. The total footprint, including cantilevered or similar overhanging
extensions, of all principal and accessory structures is limited to a
maximum of 1,500 square feet. This limitation shall not be altered by
variance.
e. All structures, except functionally water-dependent structures, are set back
from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream or
upland edge of a wetland to the greatest practical extent, but not less than
75 feet, horizontal distance. In determining the greatest practical extent,
the Planning Board shall consider the depth of the lot, the slope of the
land, the potential for soil erosion, the type and amount of vegetation to be
removed, the proposed building site's elevation in regard to the floodplain,
and its proximity to moderate-value and high-value wetlands.
C. Performance Standards
1. Agricultural Activities in the Shoreland Zone
a. All spreading or disposal of manure must conform to the requirements of a
nutrient management plan which meets the standards of the Manure
Utilization Guidelines published by the former Maine Department of
Agriculture on November 1, 2001 and the Nutrient Management Law (7
M.R.S.A § 4201-4209). The nutrient management plan must be filed with
the Code Enforcement Officer. Manure may not be stored or stockpiled
within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of a great pond or a river
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-7 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
flowing to a great pond, or within seventy-five (75) feet horizontal distance
of a tributary stream, or other water body, or wetland. All manure storage
areas within the Shoreland Zone must be constructed or modified such that
the facility produces no discharge of effluent or contaminated storm water.
b. There may be no tilling of soil within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond; within seventy-five
(75) feet, horizontal distance, from other water bodies, including streams;
nor within twenty-five (25) feet, horizontal distance, of tributary streams
and freshwater wetlands. Operations in existence on the original effective
date of this Ordinance and not in conformance with this provision may be
maintained.
c. Agricultural practices must be conducted to minimize soil erosion,
sedimentation, contamination, and nutrient enrichments of ground and/or
surface waters. In the Shoreland Zone, the tilling of soil greater than forty
thousand ( 40,000) square feet in surface area shall require a Conservation
Plan which must be filed with the Code Enforcement Officer.
d. Newly established livestock grazing areas shall not be permitted within one
hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a
great pond; within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance of other water
bodies including streams, or within twenty-five (25) feet, horizontal
distance, of tributary streams and freshwater wetlands. Livestock grazing
associated with ongoing farm activities, and which is not in conformance
with the above setback provisions, may continue, provided that such grazing
is conducted in accordance with a Conservation Plan filed with the Planning
Board.
2. Individual Private Campsites in the Shoreland Zone
a. No more than one campsite per lot existing on the effective date of this
Ordinance, or per 30,000 square feet of lot area within the Shoreland Zone,
whichever is less, may be permitted upon issuance of a use permit from the
Code Enforcement Officer.
b. Campsite placement on any lot, including the area intended for a
recreational vehicle or tent platform, must be set back 100 feet, horizontal
distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond or river, and 75
feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of other water
bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland.
c. Only one recreational vehicle shall be allowed on a campsite. The
recreational vehicle shall not be located on any type of permanent
foundation except for a gravel pad, and no structure except a canopy shall be
attached to the recreational vehicle.
d. The clearing of vegetation for the siting of the recreational vehicle, tent, or
similar shelter in a Resource Protection Overlay District may only be 1,000
square feet.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-8 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
e. A written sewage disposal plan describing the proposed method and location
of sewage disposal is required for each campsite and must be approved by
the Code Enforcement Officer. Where disposal is off-site, written
authorization from the receiving facility or land owner is required.
f. When a recreational vehicle, tent, or similar shelter is placed on-site for
more than 120 days per year, all requirements for residential structures must
be met, including the installation of a subsurface sewage disposal system in
compliance with the State of Maine Subsurface Waste Water Disposal
Rules.
g. When an individual private campsite is proposed on a lot that contains
another principal use and/or structure, the lot must contain the minimum lot
dimensional requirements for the principal structure and/or use and the
individual private campsite separately.
4. Erosion and Sedimentation Control
a. Within the Shoreland or Resource Protection Overlay District all
activities which involve filling, grading, excavation, or other similar
activities which result in unstable soil conditions and which require a
permit, require a written soil erosion and sedimentation control plan.
The plan must be submitted to the review authority for approval and
must include, where applicable, provisions for:
(1) Mulching and revegetation of disturbed soil.
(2) Temporary runoff control features such as hay bales, silt fencing, or
diversion ditches.
(3) Permanent stabilization structures such as retaining walls or riprap.
b. In order to create the least potential for erosion, development shall be
designed to fit with the topography and soils of the site. Areas of steep
slopes where high cuts and fills may be required shall be avoided
wherever possible and natural contours shall be followed as closely as
possible.
c. Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall apply to all aspects of
the proposed project involving land disturbance and shall be in operation
during all stages of the activity. The amount of soil exposed at every
phase of construction shall be minimized to reduce the potential for
eros10n.
d. Any exposed ground area shall be temporarily or permanently stabilized
within 1 week from the time it was last actively worked, by use of
riprap, sod, seed, and mulch, or other effective measures. In all cases
permanent stabilization shall occur within 9 months of the initial date of
exposure.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-9 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
e. Natural and man-made drainage ways and drainage outlets shall be
protected from erosion from water flowing through them. Drainage
ways shall be designed and constructed in order to carry water from a 25
year storm or greater, and shall be stabilized with vegetation or lined
with riprap.
f. When an excavation contractor will perform an activity that requires or
results in more than I cubic yard of soil disturbance, the person
responsible for management of erosion and sedimentation control
practices at the site must be certified in erosion control practices by the
Maine Department of Environmental Protection. This person must be
present at the site each day earthmoving activity occurs for a duration
that is sufficient to ensure that proper erosion and sedimentation control
practices are followed. This is required until erosion and sedimentation
control measures have been installed, which will either stay in place
permanently or stay in place until the area is sufficiently covered with
vegetation necessary to prevent soil erosion. The name and certification
number of a person who will oversee the activity causing or resulting in
soil disturbance shall be included on the permit application. This
requirement does not apply to a person or firm engaged in agriculture or
timber harvesting if best management practices for erosion and
sedimentation control are used; and municipal, sate and federal
employees engaged in projects associated with that employment.
5. Parking Areas
a. Parking areas must meet the setback requirements for structures. If the
Planning Board finds that no other reasonable alternative exists, the setback
requirement for parking areas serving public boat launching facilities may
be reduced, but may not be less than 50 feet from the normal high-water line
or upland edge of a wetland.
b. Parking areas must be adequately sized for the proposed use and must be
designed to prevent storm water runoff from flowing directly into a water
body, and, where feasible, to retain all runoff on-site.
6. Piers, Docks, Wharves, Breakwaters, Causeways, Bridges over 20 feet in
Length, and Other Structures and Uses Extending over or below the
normal high water line of a waterbody or within a wetland, and Shoreline
Stabilization.
a. In addition to Federal or State permits which may be required for such
structures and uses, they must conform to the following:
( 1) Access from shore must be developed on soil appropriate for such
use and constructed so as to control erosion.
(2) The location must not interfere with developed beach areas.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-10 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
(3) The facility must be located so as to minimize adverse effect on
fisheries.
(4) The facility must be no larger in dimension than necessary to carry
on the activity and be consistent with the surrounding character and
uses of the area. A temporary pier, dock or wharf shall not be wider
than six feet for non-commercial uses.
(5) New permanent piers and docks shall not be permitted unless it is

8. Clearing or Removal of Vegetation for Activities Other Than Timber
Harvesting
a. In a Resource Protection Overlay District abutting a great pond, there may
be no cutting of vegetation within the strip of land extending seventy-five
(75) feet, horizontal distance inland from the normal high-water line, except
to remove hazard trees as described in Section 20.C.9. Elsewhere, in any
Resource Protection Overlay District, the cutting or removal of vegetation is
limited to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that
district.
b. Except in areas as described in Section 20.C.8.a, above,, within a strip of
land extending one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, inland from the
normal high-water line of a great pond or a river, or within a strip extending
seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from any other water body,
tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation
must be preserved as follows:
( 1) There may be no cleared opening greater than two hundred fifty
(250) square feet in the forest canopy (or other existing woody
vegetation if a forested canopy is not present) as measured from the
outer limits of the tree or shrubcrown. However, a single foot path
not to exceed six ( 6) feet in width as measured between tree trunks
and/or shrub stems is allowed for accessing the shoreline provided
that a cleared line of sight to the water through the buffer strip is not
created.
(2) Distribution
[a] Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed
provided that a well distributed stand of trees and other natural
vegetation is maintained. For the purposes of Section 20.C.8, a
"well-distributed stand of trees" adjacent to a great pond, river,
or stream flowing to a great pond, must be defined as
maintaining a rating score of twenty-four (24) points or more in
each twenty-five (25) foot by fifty (50) foot rectangle (1250
square feet) area as determined by the following rating system:
Diameter of Trees at
4 1/2 feet Above
Ground Level

[b] Adjacent to other water bodies, tributary streams, and
wetlands, a "well-distributed stand of trees" is defined as
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-12 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
maintaining a minimum rating score of sixteen (16) per twentyfive
(45) foot by fifty (50) rectangle area.
The following shall govern in applying this point system:
1. The twenty-five (25) foot by fifty (50) foot
rectangular plots must be established where the
landowner or lessee proposes clearing within the
required buffer;
2. Each successive plot must be adjacent to, but not
overlap a previous plot;
3. Any plot not containing the required points must
have no vegetation removed except as otherwise
allowed by this Ordinance;
4. Any plot containing the required points may have
vegetation removed down to the minimum points
required or as otherwise allowed by this Ordinance.
5. Where conditions permit, no more than fifty (50)
percent of the points on any 25-foot by 50-foot
rectangular area may consist of trees greater than
twelve (12) inches in diameter.
For the purposed of Section 20.C.8.b "other natural
vegetation" is defined as retaining existing vegetation
under three (3) feet in height and other ground cover
and retaining at least five (5) saplings less than two (2)
inches in diameter at four and one half ( 4 Yi) feet above
ground level for each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangle area.
If five saplings do not exist, no woody stems less !han
two (2) inches in diameter can be removed until five (5
saplings have been recruited into the plot.
[c] Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than forty (40)
of the total volume of trees four inches or more in diameter,
measured at 4 1 /2 feet above ground level may be removed in
any ten year period.
(3) In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing
vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other ground cover,
including leaf litter and the forest duff layer, shall not be cut,
covered, or removed, except to provide for a footpath or other
permitted uses as described in Section 20.C.b and b. l.
(4) Pruning of tree branches on the bottom one-third of the tree is
allowed.
(5) In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation, when the removal of
storm-damaged, dead, or hazard trees results in the creation of
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-13 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
cleared openings, these openings must be replanted with native tree
species in accordance with Section 20.C.9 below, unless existing tree
growth is present.
(6) In order to maintain the vegetation in the shoreline buffer, clearing
or removal of vegetation for allowed activities, including associated
construction and related equipment operation, within or outside the
shoreline buffer, must comply with the requirements of Section
20.C.8.b.
(6) Section 20.C.8.b does not apply to those portions of public
recreational facilities adjacent to public swimming areas as long as
cleared areas are limited to the minimum area necessary.
c. At distances greater than one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from a
great pond or a river, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from
the normal high-water line of any other water body, tributary stream, or the
upland edge of a wetland, there must be allowed on any lot, in any ten year
period, selective cutting of not more than forty ( 40) percent of the volume of
trees four inches or more in diameter, measured 4 1/2 feet above ground
level. Tree removal in conjunction with the development of permitted uses
must be included in the forty (40) percent calculation. For the purposes of
these standards volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.
In no event may cleared openings for any proposed development, including
but not limited to principal and accessory structures, driveways, lawns, and
sewage disposal areas, exceed in the aggregate twenty-five (25) percent of
the lot area within the Shoreland Zone or ten thousand (10,000) square feet,
whichever is greater, including land previously cleared. This provision
applies to the portion of the lot within the shoreland zone, including the
buffer area.
d. Legally existing non-conforming cleared openings may be maintained, but
may not be enlarged, except as allowed by this Ordinance.
e. Fields and other cleared openings which have reverted to primarily shrubs,
trees, or other woody vegetation are regulated under the provisions of
Section 20.C.
9. Hazard Trees, Storm Damaged Trees, and Dead Tree Removal
a. Hazard trees in the shoreland zone may be removed without a permit after
consultation with the Code Enforcement Officer if the following
requirements are met:
1) Within the shoreline buffer, if the removal of a hazard tree results in
a cleared opening in the tree canopy greater than 250 square feet,
replacement with native tree species is required, unless there is new
tree growth already present. New tree growth must be as near as
practicable to where the hazard tree was removed and be at least 2
inches in diameter, measured at 4.5 feet above the ground level. If
new growth is not present, then replacement trees shall consist of
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-14 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
native species and be at least 4 feet in height and be no less than 2
inches in diameter. Stumps may not be removed.
2) Outside of the shoreland buffer, when the removal of hazard trees
exceeds 40 percent of the total volume of trees 4 inches or more in
diameter, measured at 4.5 feet above ground level in any 10 year
period and/or results in cleared openings exceeding 25 percent of
the lot area within the shoreland zone, or 10,000 square feet
whichever is greater, replacement with native tree species is
required, unless there is new tree growth already present. New tree
growth must be as near as practicable to where the hazard tree was
removed and be at least 2 inches in diameter, measured at 4.5 feet
above the ground level. If new growth is not present, then
replacement trees shall consist of native species and be at least 4 feet
in height and be no less than 2 inches in diameter.
3) The removal of standing dead trees resulting from natural causes, is
permissible without the need for replanting of a permit, as long as
the removal does not result in the creation of new lawn areas, or
other permanently cleared areas and stumps are not removed. For
the purpose of this provision dead trees are those trees that contain
no foliage during the growing season.
4) The Code Enforcement Officer may require property owners to
submit an evaluation from a licensed forester or arborist before any
hazard tree can be removed within the shoreland zone.
5) The Code Enforcement Officer may require more than a one-for-one
replacement for hazard trees that exceed 8 inches in diameter
measured at 4.5 feet above the ground level.
b. Storm-damaged trees in the shoreland zone may be removed without a
permit after consultation with the Code Enforcement Officer ifthe following
requirements are met:
1) Within the shoreline buffer when the removal of storm-damaged
trees results in a cleared opening in the tree canopy greater than 250
square feet, replanting is not required, but the area shall be required
to naturally revegetate, and the following requirements must be met:
• The area from which a storm-damaged tree is removed does
not result in new lawn areas, or other permanently cleared
areas;
•Stumps from storm-damaged trees may not be removed;
• Limbs damaged from a storm event may be pruned even if
they extend beyond the bottom 1/3 of the tree; and
• If after one growing season, no natural regeneration or
regrowth is present, replanting of native tree seedlings or
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-15 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
saplings is required at a density of one seedling per 80 square
feet oflost canopy.
2) Outside of the shoreline buffer, if the removal of storm damaged
trees exceeds 40 percent of the volume of trees 4 inches or more in
diameter, measured at 4.5 feet above ground level in any I 0 year
period or results, in the aggregate, in cleared openings exceeding 25
percent of the lot area within the shoreland zone or I 0,000 square
feet, whichever is greater, and no natural regeneration occurs within
one growing season, then native tree seedlings or saplings shall be
replanted on a one-for-one basis.
10. Exemptions to Clearing and Vegetation Removal Requirements
The following activities are exempt from the clearing and vegetation removal
standards set forth in Section 20.C.8, provided that all other applicable
requirements of this chapter are complied with, and the removal of vegetation is
limited to that which is necessary:
a. The removal of vegetation that occurs at least once every 2 years for the
maintenance of legally existing areas that do not comply with the vegetation
standards in this chapter such as but not limited to cleared openings in the
canopy or fields. Such area shall not be enlarged except as allowed by this
section. If any of these areas due to lack of removal of vegetation every 2
years, reverts back to primarily woody vegetation, the requirements of
Section 20.C.8 apply;
b. The removal of vegetation from the location of allowed structures or
allowed uses, when the shoreline setback requirements are not applicable;
c. The removal of vegetation from the location of public swimming areas
associated with an allowed public recreational facility;

provided best management practices are utilized and provided all
requirement of Section 20.C.1 are complied with;
e. The removal of non-native invasive vegetation species, provided the
following minimum requirements are met:
I) If removal of vegetation occurs via wheeled or tracked motorized
equipment~ the equipment is operated and stores at least 25 feet,
horizontal distance from the shoreline, except that tracked or
wheeled equipment may be operated or stored on existing structural
surfaces such as pavement or gravel;
2) Removal of vegetation with 25 feet, horizontal distance, from the
shoreline occurs via hand-tools; and
3) If applicable clearing and vegetation removal standards are exceeded
due to the removal of non-native invasive species vegetation, the
area shall be revegetated with native species to achieve compliance.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-16 MARCH 1998

f. The removal of vegetation associated with emergency response activities
conducted by the Department, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
the U.S. Coast Guard, and their agents.
11. Revegetation Requirements
When revegetation is required in response to violations of the vegetation
standards set forth in Section 20.C.8, to address the removal of non-native
invasive species of vegetation, or as a mechanism to allow for development that
may not otherwise be permissible due to the vegetation standards, including
removal of vegetation in conjunction with a shoreline stabilization project, the
revegetation must comply with the following requirements:
a. The property owner must submit a revegetation plan, prepared with and
signed by a qualified professional, that describes revegetation activities

vegetation to be planted.
b. Revegetation must occur along the same segment of shoreline and in the
same area where vegetation was removed and at a density comparable to
the pre-existing vegetation, except where a shoreline stabilization activity
does not allow revegetation to occur in the same area and at a density
comparable to the pre-existing vegetation, in which case revegetation must
occur along the same segment of shoreline and as close as possible to the
area where vegetation was removed.
c. If part of a permitted activity, revegetation shall occur before the
expiration of the permit. If the activity or revegetation is not completed
before the expiration of the new permit, a new revegetation plan shall be
submitted with any renewal or new permit application.

erosion and provide for effective infiltration of stormwater
runoff;
3) Only native plant species may be used to establish the buffer
area;
4) A minimum buffer width of 15 feet, horizontal distance, is
required, measured perpendicularly to the normal high water line
or upland edge of a wetland;

REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
14. Roads and Driveways in the Shoreland Zone
The following standards shall apply to the construction of roads and/or driveways
and drainage systems, culverts and other related features.
1. Roads and driveways shall be set back at least one-hundred (100) feet
horizontal distance from the normal high-water line of a great pond
classified GP A or a river that flows to a great pond classified GP A, and
seventy-five (75) feet horizontal distance from the normal high-water line of
other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland unless
no reasonable alternative exists as determined by the Planning Board. If no
other reasonable alternative exists, the Planning Board may reduce the road
and/or driveway setback requirements to no less than fifty (50) feet
horizontal distance upon clear showing by the applicant that appropriate
techniques will be used to prevent sedimentation of the water body. Such
techniques may include, but are not limited to, the installation of settling
basins, and/or the effective use of additional ditch relief culverts and
turnouts placed so as to avoid sedimentation of the water body, tributary
stream, or wetland.
On slopes of greater than twenty (20) percent the road and/or driveway
setback shall be increased by ten (10) feet horizontal distance for each five
(5) percent increase in slope above twenty (20) percent.
Section D.1 does not apply to approaches to water crossings or to roads or
driveways that provide access to permitted structures, and facilities located
nearer to the shoreline or tributary stream due to an operational necessity,
excluding temporary docks for recreational uses. Roads and driveways
providing access to permitted structures within the setback area shall fully
comply with the requirements of Section D .1 except for that portion of the
road or driveway necessary for direct access to the structure.
2. Existing public roads may be expanded within the legal road right-of-way
regardless of their setback from the water body, tributary stream or wetland.
3. New permanent roads are not allowed within the Shoreland zone along
Significant River Segments except:
a. To provide access to structures or facilities within the zone; or
b. When the applicant demonstrates that no reasonable alternative route exists
outside the shoreland zone. When roads must be located within the
shoreland zone they shall be set back as far as practicable from the normal
high water line and screened from the river by existing vegetation.
4. New roads and driveways are prohibited in a Resource Protection District
except that the Planning Board may grant a permit to construct a road or
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-20 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
driveway to provide access to permitted uses within the district. , A road or
driveway may also be approved by the Planning Board in a resource Protection
District, upon a finding that no reasonable alternative route or location is
available outside the district. When a road and/or driveway is permitted in the
Resource Protection District the road and/or driveway shall be set back as far as
practicable from the normal high water line of a water body, tributary stream, or
upland edge of a wetland.
5. Road and driveway banks shall be no steeper than a slope of two (2) horizontal
feet to one (1) vertical, and shall be graded and stabilized in accordance with the
provisions for erosion and sedimentation control contained in Section 16.0.
6. Road and driveway grades shall be no greater than ten (10) percent except for
segments of less than two hundred (200) feet.
7. In order to prevent road and driveway surface drainage form directly entering
water bodies, tributary streams or wetlands, roads and driveways shall be
designed, constructed, and maintained to empty onto an unscarified buffer strip
at least fifty (50) feet plus two times the average slope, in width between the
outflow point of the ditch or culvert and the normal high water line of a water
body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland. Surface drainage which is
directed to an unscarified buffer strip shall be diffused or spread out to promote
infiltration of the runoff and to minimize channelized flow of the drainage
through the buffer strip.
8. Ditch relief (cross drainage) culverts, drainage dips and water turnouts shall be
installed in a manner effective in directing drainage onto unscarified buffer
strips before the flow gains sufficient volume or head to erode the road,
driveway or ditch. To accomplish this, the following shall apply:
a. Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and associated water turnouts shall be
spaced along the road at intervals no greater than indicated in the following
table:
Road Grade Spacing
(Percent) (Feet)
0-2 250
3-5 200-135
6-10 100-80
11-15 80-60
16-20 60-45
21+ 40
b. Drainage dips may be used in place of ditch relief culverts only where the
grade is ten (10) percent or less.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 20-21 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2009, JUNE 2016
c. On sections having slopes greater than ten (10) percent, ditch relief culverts
shall be placed at approximately a thirty (30) degree angle down slope from
a line perpendicular to the centerline of the road or driveway.
a. Ditch relief culverts shall be sufficiently sized and properly installed in
order to allow for effective functioning and their inlet and outlet ends shall
be stabilized with appropriate materials.
9. Ditches, culverts, bridges, dips, water turnouts and other storm water runoff
control installations associated with roads shall be maintained on a regular basis
to assure effective functioning.
15. Storm Water Runoff
All new construction and development within the Shoreland Zone shall be
designed to minimize storm water runoff from the site in excess of the natural
predevelopment conditions. Where possible, existing natural runoff control
features, such as berms, swales, terraces and wooded areas shall be retained in
order to reduce runoff and encourage infiltration of storm waters. The storm
water runoff control systems shall be maintained as necessary to ensure proper
functioning.
16. Soils
All land uses shall be located on soils in or upon which the proposed uses or
structures can be established or maintained without causing adverse
environmental impacts, including severe erosion, mass soil movement, improper
drainage, and water pollution, whether during or after construction.

Article VI - Review and Approval of Resubdivision or Revision to Approved Subdivision
Plan
A. Modification Of Lot Line Configuration On Previously Approved Plans; Initial
Review By Code Enforcement Officer
1. If the owner of a lot in a previously approved subdivision proposes to convey
a portion of the lot or otherwise alter the boundaries of his or her lot
("alteration"), he or she will submit to the Code Enforcement Officer a notice
of intention, together with a sketch plan showing the proposed alteration, and
the Code Enforcement Officer will make a determination as to whether the
proposed alteration, together with prior such alterations by any owners of lots
shown on the plan, would, at the time of the subdivision's approval, have had
the effect of subjecting the prior review of the approved plan to materially
different approval standards. By way of example, and not by way of
limitation, if the proposed alteration would have increased the number of lots,
such that the applicable street design or street construction standards would
have been more stringent, the alteration would have had the effect of
subjecting the prior review of the approved plan to materially different
approval standards.
2. If the Code Enforcement Officer shall determine that the alteration would not
have had the effect of subjecting the prior review of the approved plan to
materially different approval standards, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
issue a written certificate reflecting such determination, and certifying that no
further review of the proposed alteration by the Planning Board is required.
B. Planning Board Review
1. If the Code Enforcement Officer shall determine that the alteration would
have had the effect of subjecting the prior review of the approved plan to
materially different approval standards, the lot owner must obtain Planning
Board approval for the alteration of the plan.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 21-13 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2010, JUNE 2017
2. The Planning Board need not conduct the same degree of review upon a
proposed alteration as would be required with respect to a proposed new
subdivision; however, the Planning Board shall consider those standards for
approval which were in effect at the time of the original plan approval, and
shall take into consideration:
a. the degree of completion of development of all lots within the subdivision;
b. the extent to which the proposed alteration might itself or, if replicated
upon other undeveloped lots (or on developed lots still capable of similar
development),
i. materially affect the density of development of the land shown
upon the plan;
n. materially affect the sufficiency of the roads to accommodate
traffic and emergency vehicle access;
c. the degree, if any, of potential interference of the proposed alteration with
existing services for lots, such as wells or septic systems, including the
potential for installing replacement septic systems, as they might be
needed;and
d. the ability of the lots, as altered, to comply with the dimensional
requirements of the current Land-Use Ordinance.
Article VII - General Requirements
In reviewing applications for the subdivision of land, the Board shall consider the following
general requirements. In all instances the burden of proof shall be upon the person proposing the
subdivision.
A. Subdivision Plan shall conform to all pertinent state and local codes and
ordinances, including Title 30-A M.R.S.A. §4404.
B. Retention of Proposed Public Sites and Open Spaces
The Board may require that the subdivider reserve an area of land as open space
and/or recreational area for use by the property owners within the subdivision.
The Board will consider the need for recreational space and the proximity of other
open spaces and recreational areas. Any area designated for common use shall be
arranged so that each property owner has access to it.
C. Preservation of Natural Features.
The Board may require that a proposed subdivision design include a landscape
plan that will show the preservation of existing trees, the replacement of trees and
vegetation, graded contours, streams and the preservation of scenic or
environmentally desirable areas. The street and lot layout shall be adapted to the
topography. Extensive grading and filling shall be avoided as far as possible.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 21-14 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2010, JUNE 2017
D. Historic Locations.
The Board shall consider the proposed subdivisions impact on historic buildings
and sites, as identified in the Comprehensive Plan or as listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. When a subdivision will include a historic building or
site the applicant will design the subdivision to minimize the impacts on the
historic building or site.
E. Land Not Suitable for Development
1. The following areas are not suitable for development: wetlands, streams,
brooks, ponds, vernal pools, storm water drainage features, public and private
right of ways, land zoned as resource protection, slopes in excess of 25%, and
significant wildlife habitats as defined by the Department of Inland Fisheries
and Wildlife. Land subject to flooding and land deemed by the Planning
Board, on the recommendation of the Soil Conservation Service, to be
uninhabitable, shall not be plotted for residential occupancy or for such other
uses as may increase danger to health, life or property but such land shall be
set aside for such uses as shall not produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
2. Wherever situated, in whole or in part, within two hundred-fifty (250) feet of
the high water line of any pond, lake, river, a proposed subdivision shall
conform to Section 20 - Shoreland Zoning.
3. Computation of density of a development will be based on net residential
acreage. Net residential acreage as defined herein shall apply to the
computation of development density and not to the pennitability of building
on any particular lot.
F. Density and Size of Subdivisions
In determining the allowable density of development within a subdivision, the
Planning Board shall consider the "net residential acreage" as defined in this
Ordinance and apply same to the density allowed in the subject zoning district.
Calculate the allowable number of lots by dividing the net residential acreage of
the parcel of land by the minimum lot size of the district in which the
development is located. The net residential acreage is calculated by taking the
total area of the lot and subtracting, in order, the following:
1. Portions of the lot which, because of existing land uses or lack of access, are
isolated and undevelopable for building purposes or for use in common with the
remainder of the lot, as determined by the Planning Board.
2. Portions of the lot shown to be in the floodway as designated in the Flood
Boundary and Flood way Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 21-15 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2010, JUNE 2017
3. Portions of the lot which are unsuitable for development in their natural state
due to topographical, drainage, or subsoil conditions such as, but not limited to:
• slopes in excess of 25%
• organic soils
• wetland soils
• 50% of the poorly drained soils
4. Portions of the parcel subject to a right-of-way.

6. Significant wildlife habitats
7. Portions of the parcel covered by surface waters.
8. Portions of the parcel utilized for storm water management facilities.
9. Fifteen per cent (15%) of the remaining area of the parcel to account for roads.
G. Liquidation Harvesting
No division of land shall be approved if it is determined by the Planning Board
that the parcel has been harvested in violation of rules of "Liquidation
Harvesting", pursuant to 12 MRSA Section 8866, et. Seq ("Forest Practices").
H. Lots
1. All lots, save those in approved cluster subdivisions, shall conform to the
minimum size and frontage as established by State law and by this
Ordinance. No departure from such requirements shall be permitted
except by variance.
2. The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation and the mm1mum
building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the
subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated.
3. Side-lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines.
4. Odd shaped lots and spaghetti lots are prohibited. The ratio of lot length
to width shall not be more than 5: 1.
5. Where a tract is subdivided into lots substantially larger than the minimum
size required in the zoning district in which a subdivision is located, the
Board may require that streets and lots be laid out so as to permit future

0. Cluster Development
The purpose of these provisions is to encourage the preservation of the rural
character of Fryeburg by preserving undeveloped land, including farm land, forest
land, and other undeveloped lands. This is done by allowing an innovative type
of development which permits homes to be built on lots which are smaller than
normally allowed, but requires undeveloped land to be preserved. The overall
density of a cluster development is no greater than an unclustered development.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 21-18 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2010, JUNE 2017

construct and acceptance requirements, and all other applicable town
ordinances, including the applicable Performance Standards of this Ordinance.
2. Each building must be an element of an overall plan for site development.
The developer must specify the placement of buildings and the treatment of
spaces, paths, roads, utility service, and parking, and in so doing must take
into consideration all requirements of this subsection and of other relevant
sections of this Ordinance.
3. A high-intensity soil survey must be submitted. No building may be
constructed on soil classified as being very poorly drained.

or wetland.
6. No lot may be smaller in area than 20,000 square feet.
7. The total area of undeveloped land within the development must equal or
exceed the sum of the areas by which any building lots are reduced below the
minimum lot area normally required in the district.
8. The setback standards of the district in which the buildings are located apply.
9. No individual lot or dwelling unit may have direct vehicular access onto a
public road existing at the time of development.
10. Shore frontage may not be reduced below the minimum normally required in
the Shoreland Overlay District.
11. Where a cluster development abuts a body of water, a usable portion of the
shoreline, as well as access to it, must be a part of the undeveloped land.
12. That portion of the cluster development which abuts a street not in the cluster
development and along the exterior boundaries of the cluster development
must be designed as a continuous landscaped buffer area not less than 50 feet
in width. This buffer area may contain no structures or streets other than
driveways or streets providing access to the cluster development. The first 25
feet of the buffer strip, as measured from the exterior boundaries of the
development, must contain natural vegetation.
13. The undeveloped land is that area which is not included in the residential lots,
which equals at least the total area by which all of the lots the cluster
development are reduced below the normal minimum lot size in the district.
There may be no further subdivision of the undeveloped land. This
undeveloped land may be used only for agriculture, forestry, conservation, or
noncommercial recreation. However, easements for public utilities, or
structures accessory to noncommercial recreation, agriculture, or
conservation, may be approved by the Planning Board.
FRYEBURG LAND USE ORDINANCE 21-19 MARCH 1998
REV. JUNE 2010, JUNE 2017
14. The undeveloped land must be shown on the development plan and with
appropriate notation on the face thereof to indicate:
a. That the undeveloped land may not be used for future building lots; and
b. The final disposition of the undeveloped land, which may be:
(1) dedicated to the Town for acceptance. The Planning Board must
approve the language of the dedication and the uses allowed in the
undeveloped land.
(2) deeded to a land trust. The Planning Board must approve the land trust
and the conditions of the deed.
(3) retained by the applicant. The land may only be used for active
agriculture or active forestry. The conditions of this use must be
approved by the Planning Board and indicated on the development
plan.
( 4) reserved for ownership by a homeowners' association made up of the
owners of the lots in the cluster development. If any or all of the
undeveloped land is to be reserved for use by the residents in a
homeowners association, a homeowners' association must be formed
and the bylaws of the homeowners' association must specify
maintenance responsibilities. The bylaws must be submitted to the
Planning Board for its approval prior to approval of the development
plan. Covenants for mandatory membership in the association, setting
forth the owners' rights and interest and privileges in the association
and the undeveloped land must be included. The homeowners'
association has the responsibility of maintaining the undeveloped land
and any common facilities. The developer must maintain control of the
undeveloped land and be responsible for its maintenance until
development sufficient to support the association has taken place.

ARTICLE XII- WAIVERS
A. Where the Planning Board finds that extraordinary and unnecessary hardships
may result from strict compliance with these standards or where there are special
circumstances of a particular Plan, it may waive these standards so that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest secure; provided that such waivers will
not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the Official Map, the
Comprehensive Plan, or the Land Use Ordinance, where such exist.
B. Where the Planning Board finds that, due to special circumstances of a particular
Plan, the provision of certain required improvements is not requisite in the interest
of public health, safety, and general welfare, or is inappropriate because of
inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities adjacent or in proximity to the
proposed subdivision, it may waive such requirements, subject to appropriate
conditions.

will consider granting a waiver if the Board determines that conditions particular to the
parcel justify a waiver based on the following conditions:
a. There is too little street frontage on existing public streets to reasonably allow for
the creation of 2 street connections.
b. The shape and physical conditions of the parcel do not permit 2 street
connections.

b. the structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety.
5. Variances may be issued by a community for the repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, or restoration of Historic Structures upon the determination
that:
a. the development meets the criteria of Section 24.I.1 through 4; and,
b. the proposed repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a Historic
Structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.

REV. JUNE 2009, 2010, 2013
a. the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
level will result in greatly increased premium rate for flood insurance
up to amounts as high as $25 per $100 of insurance coverage;
b. such construction below the base flood level increase risks to life and
property; and,
c. the applicant agrees in writing that the applicant is fully aware of all
the risks inherent in the use of land subject to flooding, assumes those
risks and agrees to indemnify and defend the municipality against any
