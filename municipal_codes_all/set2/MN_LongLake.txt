PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Long Lake, Minnesota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1989 Code, as supplemented and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1989 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Code Attorney, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Patty Sullivan, City Clerk, and Christopher Dietzen, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

The city tree inspector shall act as coordinator between the commissioner of agriculture and the council in the conduct of this program. 
(3)	Nuisances declared. The following things are public nuisances whenever they may be found within the city: 
a.	Any living or standing elm tree infected to any degree with the Dutch elm disease fungus Ceratocystis ulmi (buisman) moreau or which harbors any of the elm bark beetle Scolytus multistriatus (eichh.) or Hylungopinus rufipes (marsh); 
b.	Any dead elm tree, including legs, branches, stumps, firewood or other elm material from which the bark has not been removed and burned or sprayed with an effective elm bark beetle insecticide. 
(4)	Abatement. It is unlawful for any person to permit any public nuisance to remain on any premises owned or controlled by him within the city. Such nuisances may be abated in the manner prescribed by this subsection. 
(5)	Inspection and investigation. 
a.	Annual inspection. The tree inspector shall inspect all premises and places within the city at least three times during the growing season, by June 15, July 15, and August 15 to determine whether any condition described in subsection (3) exists there. He shall investigate all reported incidents of infestation by Dutch elm fungus or elm bark beetles.

Such abatement procedures shall be carried out in accordance with current technical and expert opinions and plans as may be designated by the commissioner of agriculture. 
State Law reference- Methods of disposal include burning, burying, chipping, and utilization, Minn. Rules § 1505.0230. 
(7)	Procedure for removal of infected trees and wood. 
a.	Whenever the tree inspector finds with reasonable certainty that the infestation defined in subsection (3) exists in any tree or wood in any public or private place in the city, he shall proceed as follows: 
1.	If the tree inspector finds that the danger of infestation of other elm trees is low risk because symptoms reflect early stages of infection not progressing beyond the 30 percent wilting point, he shall make a written report of his finding to the council, which shall proceed by abating the nuisance as a public improvement under Minn. Stats. ch. 429 or abating the nuisance as provided in subsection (6). 
State Law reference- Obligation of tree inspector to identify whether a tree infected with Dutch elm disease has extensive wilt or is showing only early symptoms of the disease, and categorize trees infected with Dutch elm disease as either high-risk trees or low-risk trees, Minn. Rules § 1505.0180. 
2.	If the tree inspector finds that danger of infestation of other elm trees is high-risk, that is, the trees are dead, barren or have extensive wilt (30 percent or more of the tree is wilted), he shall notify the abutting property owner by certified mail that the nuisance will be abated within a specified time, not less than five days from the date of mailing of such notice. The tree inspector shall immediately report such action to the council; and after the expiration of the time limited by the notice, he may abate the nuisance. 
b.	Upon receipt of the tree inspector's report required by subsection (7)a.1. of this section, the council may by resolution order the nuisance abated. Before action is taken on such resolution, the council shall publish notice of its intention to meet to consider taking action to abate the nuisance. This notice shall be mailed to affected property owners and published once no less than one week prior to such meeting. The notice shall state the time and place of the meeting, the streets affected, action proposed, the estimated cost of the abatement, and the proposed bases of assessment, if any, of costs. At such hearing or adjournment of such meeting, the council shall hear property owners with reference to the scope and desirability of the proposed project. The council shall thereafter adopt a resolution confirming the original resolution with such modifications as it considers desirable and provide for the doing of the work by day labor or contract. Every reasonable effort shall be made to remove all low-risk trees on private and public property within 20 days of notification, but in no case shall it be later than April 1 of the following year. 
c.	The tree inspector shall keep a record of the costs of abatements done under this subsection and shall report monthly to the city clerk all work done for which assessments are to be made, stating and certifying the description of the land, lots and parcels involved and the amount chargeable to each. 
d.	On or before September 1 of each year, the clerk shall list the total unpaid charges for each abatement against each separate lot or parcel to which they are attributable under this subsection. The council may then spread the charges or any portion of the charges against the property involved as a special assessment under Minn. Stats. § 429.101 and other pertinent statutes for certification to the county auditor and collection the following year along with current taxes. 
(8)	Spraying elm trees. 
a.	Whenever the tree inspector determines that any elm tree or elm wood within the city is infected with Dutch elm fungus, he may spray or treat all nearby high-value elm trees, with an effective elm bark beetle destroying concentrate or fungicide or both. Activities authorized by this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with technical and expert opinions and plans of the commissioner of agriculture and under the supervision of the commissioner and his agents whenever possible. 
b.	The notice provisions of subsection (7) apply to spraying and treatment operations conducted under this subsection. 
(9)	Transporting elm wood prohibited. It is unlawful for any person to transport within the city any bark-bearing elm wood without having obtained a permit from the tree inspector. The tree inspector shall grant such permits only when the purposes of this section will be served. 
(10)	Interference prohibited. It is unlawful for any person to prevent, delay or interfere with the tree inspector or his agents while they are engaged in the performance of duties imposed by this section.

DIVISION 6. - DISCONNECTION[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
State Law reference- Notice requirements for disconnection of utility services, Minn. Rules § 7820.2400. 

Sec. 36-161. - Purpose and intent. 
    The council finds that there are certain users of the city's water who consistently fail or refuse to pay their water bills. While it is the city's practice to certify unpaid water bills onto the taxes for the properties involved this results in a delay in payment and at times causes parties who have recently acquired such a property to pay for the previous owner or occupant's water usage. The purpose of this division is to inhibit the consistent practice of allowing water bills to go unpaid so as to be certified to the real estate taxes and to encourage prompt payment. 
(Code 1989, § 575.01) 
Sec. 36-162. - Disconnection authorized. 
    Any user of the city's water who received from the city invoices for such usage and who fails to currently pay the invoice shall be subject to the following sanctions: 
(1)	Disconnection procedure. If the customer has failed to pay a bill for water service and the amount of the customer's outstanding bill equals or exceeds the amount of the customer's deposit, the city shall be entitled to disconnect the water service, unless the disconnection would affect in any way the primary heat source of a residential unit, to the location at which the customer is then an occupant or owner (whether or not the same) once 30 days have elapsed since written notice of an uncertified but past-due water bill has been delivered to such customer. It shall be sufficient delivery of such notice if sent by first class mail to the address of the user from or upon which he is using city water. 
(2)	Reconnection procedure. Once a user has had water service disconnected as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the water service at the location disconnected shall not be reconnected unless and until all past-due water bills have been paid in full together with such disconnection and reconnection charges as the city council shall from time to time adopt; except that the service of certain qualified customers shall be reconnected in accordance with Minn. Rules § 7820.2300. In addition, if it is determined that the curb box is broken or in need of maintenance or replacement at the time of disconnection, the cost of repair or replacement must also be paid before reconnection shall be authorized. 
(Code 1989, § 575.02) 
Sec. 36-163. - Appeal. 
    Any person aggrieved by any of the provisions of this division shall have the right to appeal to the council in writing setting forth the grounds or reasons as to why this division should not be enforced. The notice of appeal must be delivered to the city clerk within the 30-day period following written notice of default and intent to disconnect referenced in section 36-162. If such written notice of appeal is received by the city clerk, the disconnection shall be stayed until the next regular council meeting, at which time the appealing party may appear and present evidence to support his position. The council shall then rule upon the appeal and mail written notice of its findings of fact and decision to the customer. If the council rules adverse to the appealing party, the disconnection shall proceed forthwith unless the council shall in its discretion specify a later date. A customer who disagrees with the council's decision must submit the entire disputed payment in escrow to the utility and a copy of the utility's escrow payment form to the public utilities commission which shall constitute an informal complaint against the utility to be resolved in accordance with Minn. Rules ch. 7829.

Sec. 36-273. - Industrial user strength charge. 
(a)	Authorized. This section establishes an industrial user strength charge in addition to the charge based upon the volume of discharge by an industrial user and establishes an industrial user strength charge formula for the computation of the charge to recover operation and maintenance costs of waste treatment services attributable to the strength of the discharge of industrial waste into the sewer system and establishes tax lien against property served in connection with such strength charge. 
(b)	Recitals. The metropolitan waste control commission, a metropolitan commission organized and existing under the laws of the state, in order to receive and retain grants in compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and regulations under such act, has determined to impose an industrial user sewer strength charge upon users of the metropolitan disposal system (as defined in Minn. Stats. § 473.121, subd. 24) to recover operation and maintenance costs of treatment works attributable to the strength of the discharge of industrial waste, such sewer strength charge being in addition to the charge based upon the volume of discharge. In order for the city to pay such costs based upon strength of industrial discharge and allocated to it each year by the commission, it is found, determined and declared to be necessary to establish sewer strength charges and a formula for its computation for all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city. Furthermore, Minn. Stats. § 444.075, subd. 3 empowers the city to make such sewer charge a charge against the owner, lessee, occupant or all of them and certify unpaid charges to the county auditor as a tax lien against the property served. 
(c)	Establishment of strength charges. For the purpose of paying the costs allocated to the city each year by the commission that are based upon the strength of discharge of all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, there is approved, adopted and established, in addition to the sewer charge based upon the volume of discharge, a sewer charge upon each person, company or corporation receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, based upon strength of industrial waste discharged into the sewer system of the city. 
(d)	Establishment of strength charge formula. For the purpose of computation of the strength charge established by subsection (c) of this section, there is established, approved and adopted in compliance with the act the same strength charge formula designated in Resolution No. 76-172 adopted by the governing body of the commission on June 15, 1976, such formula being based upon pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of the sewage produced through an evaluation of pollution qualities and quantities in excess of an annual average base and the proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of waste treatment services provided by the commission. 
(e)	Strength charge payment. It is approved, adopted and established that the strength charge established by subsection (c) shall be paid by each industrial user receiving waste treatment services and subject to such charge before the 20th day next succeeding the date of billing to such user by or on behalf of the city, and such payment shall be deemed to be delinquent if not so paid to the billing entity before such date. Furthermore, it is established, approved and adopted that if such payment is not paid before such date an industrial user shall pay interest compounded monthly at a rate to be fixed from time to time by the superintendent on the unpaid balance due. 
(f)	Establishment of tax lien. As provided by Minn. Stats. § 444.075, subd. 3, it is approved, adopted and established that if payment of the strength charge established by subsection (c) is not paid before the 60th day next succeeding the date of billing to the industrial user by or on behalf of the city, the delinquent sewer strength charge, plus accrued interest established pursuant to subsection (e), shall be deemed to be a charge against the owner, lessee and occupant of the property served; and the city or its agent shall certify such unpaid delinquent balance to the county auditor with taxes against the property served for collection as other taxes are collected; however, such certification shall not preclude the city or its agent from recovery of such delinquent sewer strength charge and interest on such charge under any other available remedy.

Sec. 36-274. - Additional rates and charges. 
    Additional rates and charges may be established for industries which produce wastes in large volume and with high organic material content, based on a report made by the city engineer or superintendent to the council. If such wastes require for proper treatment that the sewage disposal plant or other portions of the municipal sewer system be expanded or replaced, the cost shall be borne by such industry. 
(Code 1989, § 415.06(4)) 
Sec. 36-275. - Sewer service charges. 
    Charges for sewer service shall be billed quarterly simultaneously with charges for water service. Bills shall be due within 30 days of the date of invoice, and, if unpaid on the date due, a penalty determined from time to time by the city council shall be added. Any unpaid charges for sewer service may be certified to the county auditor for collection with taxes levied against the premises served, in accordance with Minn. Stats. § 444.075, subd. 2.

State Law reference- Authority to establish service availability charges, Minn. Stats. § 444.075, subd. 3. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 36-451. - Purpose and intent. 
    The council finds that inequities exist pertaining to the connection to city sewer and water services for properties allowed to connect and hook up to them which have not been previously assessed by the city for the cost of construction and/or improvement. It is the purpose and intent of this article to establish connection and hookup charges for such properties in order to help pay for the cost of these public improvements, their availability, maintenance and improvement, as provided by Minn. Stats. § 444.075, subds. 3 and 5. 
(Code 1989, § 410.01) 
Sec. 36-452. - Sewer connection charges; certification. 
    No permit shall be issued to tap or connect with any sewer main of the city either directly or indirectly from any lot or tract of land unless the city administrator first certifies that the sewer connection fee, established and published from time to time as the council deems it necessary to maintain, repair and expand the system, has been paid. 
(Code 1989, § 410.02(1)) 
Sec. 36-453. - Sewer hookup charges. 
    In addition to the connection charges set forth in section 36-452, a hookup charge shall be imposed against each lot or tract of land served by the sewer system for usage of sewer treatment facilities, lift stations, force mains and trunk sewers. The amount of this charge shall be periodically established by motion or resolution of the council. Such periodic revision shall reflect construction cost changes evidenced by the Engineering News - Record Construction Cost Index. Initial charges shall be set by the council from time to time per sewer unit, defined as each 274 gallons of sewage flow per day. Single-family houses, townhouses, condominiums, duplex units, apartment units and mobile homes shall each comprise one sewer unit. Other buildings and structures shall be assigned one sewer unit for each 274 gallons of sewage flow per day which it is estimated they will discharge, and commercial and industrial buildings or uses shall be assigned a minimum of one sewer unit. The number of sewer unit hookup charges to be levied against each premises may thereafter be revised by resolution of the council to more accurately establish the benefit conferred upon the premises, and the council in making the redetermination may take into account the actual quantity of water consumed on the premises. 
(Code 1989, § 410.03) 
Sec. 36-454. - Water connection charges. 
(a)	Certification. No permit shall be issued to tap or connect with any water main of the city either directly or indirectly from any lot or tract of land unless the city administrator shall have certified that the water connection fee, established and published from time to time as the council deems it necessary to maintain, repair and expand the system, has been paid. 
(b)	Fees. The water connection fees for residential units of all types, inside and outside the jurisdictional limits of the city, shall be set from time to time as the council deems it necessary. 
(Code 1989, § 410.04) 
Sec. 36-455. - Water hookup charges. 
    In addition to the connection charges set forth in section 36-454, a hookup charge shall be imposed against each lot or tract of land served by the water system for usage of the wells, pumping stations, water storage facilities and equipment of the city water system. The amount of this charge shall be periodically established by motion or resolution of the council. Such periodic revision shall reflect construction cost changes evidenced by the Engineering News - Record Construction Cost Index. The initial charge shall be set from time to time as the council deems it necessary. A water unit is defined as each 274 gallons of water flow per day. Single-family houses, townhouses, condominiums, duplex units, apartment units and mobile homes shall each comprise one water unit. Other buildings and structures shall be assigned one water unit for each 274 gallons of water flow which it is estimated they will use each day and commercial and industrial buildings or uses shall be assigned a minimum of one water unit. The number of water unit hookup charges to be levied against each premises may thereafter be revised by resolution of the council to more accurately establish the benefit conferred upon the premises; and the council in making the redetermination may take into account the actual quantity of water consumed on the premises. 
(Code 1989, § 410.05) 
Sec. 36-456. - Hookup charges to be added to MWCC SAC/WAC fees. 
    Any sewer or water hookup fee charged pursuant to this article shall be in addition to any similar charges imposed by the metropolitan waste control commission to the city and shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the city's respective sewer and water funds. 
(Code 1989, § 410.06) 
Sec. 36-457. - Sewer and water connection charge exemptions. 
(a)	Sewer exemptions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, no property, lot or tract of land located within the jurisdictional limits of the city which has been assessed, reassessed or supplementally assessed for the cost of a sewer public improvement project shall be charged a connection fee as provided in section 36-452. A lot newly created from a previously assessed larger lot shall not qualify for this exemption unless the council imposes upon it a supplemental assessment at or about the time of its creation. 
(b)	Water exemptions. No property, lot or tract of land located within the jurisdictional limits of the city which has been assessed, reassessed or supplementally assessed for the cost of a water public improvement project shall be charged a water connection fee as provided in section 36-454. A lot newly created from a previously assessed larger lot shall not qualify for this exemption unless the council imposes a supplemental assessment upon it at or about the time of its creation.

DIVISION 2. - SERVICE AVAILABILITY CHARGES 

Sec. 36-481. - Purpose. 
(a)	It is the purpose of this division to recover from users of city wastewater disposal system facilities, on an equitable basis, the share of the city's facilities' costs attributable to such users, and to provide funds for replacements, debt service and improvements for the city. 
(b)	The city finds it has a limited number of service availability charge (SAC) units. Inequities exist among various commercial users within the city, especially relating to wastewater that is discharged into wastewater disposable system facilities. The city finds that commercial automobile washes use considerable amounts of water which is discharged into the wastewater disposal system facilities. Also, they use significantly more amounts of water than previously estimated. Eliminating wastewater discharge is consistent with protecting the environment and promoting the health, welfare and public safety of the city. 
(Ord. No. 415.041, § 1, 7-15-1997) 
Sec. 36-482. - Generally. 
    The debt service for the wastewater treatment facilities shall be recovered from new connections by a service availability charge (SAC) assessed against new building units. The following regulations shall apply to service availability charges (SAC): 
(1)	The service availability charge (SAC) shall be paid at the time at which a building permit or a sewer connection permit is issued for all buildings to be constructed or connected to the sewer system on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derives. No charge shall be due upon the issuance of a connection permit if a charge was paid upon issuance of a building permit. The debt service connection charge for each building or structure shall be equal to the number of SAC units times the service availability charge in effect at the time of the application. 
(2)	The SAC units for various residential, commercial, public and institutional facilities shall be calculated according to current estimates of the metropolitan council. 
(Ord. No. 415.041, § 2(a), 7-15-1997) 
Sec. 36-483. - Meters. 
(a)	Secured meters measuring water usage shall be installed at the expense of the commercial automobile wash operator. 
(b)	Meters shall be located in a manner and place reasonably accessible to the city for inspection, maintenance and repair, observation, measurement, and sampling and testing at any time without prior notice. 
(Ord. No. 415.041, § 2(c), 7-15-1997) 
Sec. 36-484. - Rates and billing procedures. 
(a)	Rates. Wastewater service charges and service availability charges for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city shall be established by ordinance and audited annually. 
(b)	Bills. Rates or charges for service shall be payable quarterly. 
(1)	The owner of the premises, the occupant, and the user of the service shall be jointly liable to pay for the service to such premises; and the service is furnished to the premises by the city only upon the condition that the owner of the premises, occupant, and user of the service are jointly liable to the city. 
(2)	Bills for sewer service shall be sent out by the city on the last day of each quarter for which the service is billed. 
(3)	All sewer bills are due and payable 30 days after being sent out. A penalty of ten percent shall be added to all bills not paid by the 30th day after they have been rendered. 
(c)	Delinquent bills. If the charges for such services are not paid within 60 days after the rendition of the bill for such services, such services may be discontinued without further notice and shall not be reinstated until all claims are settled. 
(Ord. No. 415.041, § 2(d), 7-15-1997) 
Sec. 36-485. - Charges as lien. 
    Each charge levied pursuant to this division shall be a lien against the property, and all such charges due on September 30 of each year which are more than 30 days past due, notice having been properly mailed to the occupant or owner of the premises, shall be certified by the council to the county auditor, which shall specify the amount, the description of the premises, and the name of the owner. The amount so certified shall be collected and remitted to the city in the same manner as assessments for local improvements. 
(Ord. No. 415.041, § 2(e), 7-15-1997) 
Sec. 36-486. - Funds from service charges. 
    The funds received from the collection of charges authorized by this division shall be deposited as collected in the city capital revolving fund and shall be used for the operation, maintenance, debt service, replacement and improvement of the city wastewater disposal system. 
(Ord. No. 415.041, § 2(f), 7-15-1997) 
Sec. 36-487. - Powers and authority of city. 
(a)	The city has the right to enforce this division, including but not limited to the recovery of delinquent charges, and may seek all available remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any person violating any of the provisions of this division shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished in accordance with section 1-13. Any person violating any of the provisions of this division shall become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage, including but not limited to attorney's fees, expert fees or engineering fees, occasioned by the city by reason of such violation. 
(b)	Any person found to be violating any provisions of this division shall be served by the city with written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for its satisfactory correction. Any person who continues any violation beyond the time limit shall be in breach of the service contract and shall be temporarily disconnected from the wastewater disposal system facilities. Such disconnection and reconnection shall be at the total expense of the customer. 
(c)	If any person fails to come into compliance with this division, the city reserves the right to close such use and may disconnect water or waste connections until the operation complies with this division. Any closing or disconnection by the city shall be preceded by written notice and a hearing before the city council. The notice shall give at least ten days' notice of the time and place of the hearing and shall state the nature of the charges against the user. The notice shall be mailed by regular and certified mail to the owner of the property. 
(d)	If any person exceeds his sewer availability charge (SAC) unit allocation, the city reserves the right to close the business operation responsible for the excess SAC unit use and may disconnect water or wastewater connections until compliance with this division. For purposes of determining compliance with this division, the city shall average the SAC unit consumption by the operation over the past 12 months. Any closing or disconnection by the city shall be preceded by written notice and a hearing before the city council. The notice shall give at least ten days' notice of the time and place of the hearing and shall state the nature of the charges against the user. The notice shall be mailed by regular and certified mail to the owner of the property. 
(e)	The city shall be permitted to gain access to such properties as may be necessary for the purpose of inspection, maintenance and repair, observation, measurement, sampling and testing, in accordance with provisions of this division. 
(f)	Where acids and chemicals damaging to sewer lines or treatment processes are released to the sewer causing rapid deterioration of these structures or interfering with proper treatment of sewage, the city is authorized to immediately terminate service by such measures as are necessary to protect the facilities. 
(g)	Any additional costs caused by discharges to the treatment works of toxins or other incompatible wastes, including the costs of restoring wastewater treatment services, cleanup and restoration of the receiving waters, and environmental and sludge disposal, shall be borne by the discharger of such wastes, at no expense to the city. 
(h)	As a condition of use, the city shall be granted access by industrial users to information regarding industrial processes which have a direct bearing on the type and source of discharges to the wastewater collection system. 
(i)	All work performed on private property by the city in the course of operating and maintaining the city's sewer utility shall be performed in full accordance with a duly negotiated and executed easement. 
(j)	The city and its authorized employees shall observe all applicable safety rules while performing work on private property, and the city shall hold the owner blameless for injury or death except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the owner to maintain safe conditions.

Sec. 36-488. - Commercial automobile wastes. 
(a)	Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Commercial automobile wash means a building or portion of a building containing facilities for washing automobiles, using production line methods with a chain, conveyor, blowers, steam-cleaning devices or other mechanical devices. 
(b)	SAC unit limitation. The metropolitan council estimates that commercial automobile washes use or consume 25 local service availability charge (SAC) units and 25 metropolitan council service availability charge (SAC) units. Commercial automobile washer operators have represented that reasonable technologies exist to limit the consumption of SAC units to 15 units. Accordingly, the city limits the allocation of SAC units to commercial automobile washes to 15 units unless otherwise agreed to in writing by a majority vote of the city council.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 36-523. - Stormwater utility factors. 
(a)	The stormwater management fee shall be determined by first determining the percentage of total runoff in the city which is attributed to single-family residential property. The fee per acre for single-family residential is computed by computing the product of the runoff percentage and the monthly stormwater utility revenue, divided by the estimated total acres of single-family residential land use in the city. The per-acre fee for all other individual parcels shall be defined as the product of the single-family residential per-acre fee, the appropriate utility factor, and the total acreage of the parcel. Single-family residential parcels shall be assessed on a per-household basis. 
(b)	The utility factors for various land uses are shown in the following table: 
Classification Land Use 1 Utility 
Factor 1. Residential 1.00 2. Commercial 4.23 3. Industrial 3.30 4. Public/Quasi-Public 2.22 5. Parks/Open Space/Cemeteries Exempt 6. Road Right-of-Way Exempt 7. Lakes/Streams/Wetlands Exempt 8. Vacant Exempt 9. Churches/Schools/Institutions 3.74 10. Multifamily Residential; Apartments/Condos/Townhomes 1.30  
1   Land use categories match those found in the city's comprehensive plan, which form the basis of the study "Stormwater Utility: a Special Report to the Long Lake City Council," by Short Elliot Hendrickson, Inc. (SEH). The study provides the basis for the utility factor rates. Generally, these land use categories will correspond to the residential, business, and industrial categories found in the city's zoning ordinance. According to the study, SEH will identify each parcel's land uses after passage of the policy, based on the tax parcel map (p. 43). 
(Ord. No. 415.10, 11-2-1999) 
Sec. 36-524. - Credits. 
    The council may adopt fee schedules, by resolution, for adjustment of the stormwater management fees. Information to justify a fee adjustment must be supplied by the property owner. Such adjustments of fees shall not be retroactive. Credits will be reviewed regularly by a staff committee. 
(Ord. No. 415.10, 11-2-1999) 
Sec. 36-525. - Exemptions.

(Ord. No. 415.10, 11-2-1999) 
Sec. 36-528. - Penalty for late payment. 
    Each billing for stormwater utility fees not paid when due shall incur a penalty charge as determined by the city council from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 415.10, 11-2-1999) 
Sec. 36-529. - Certifications of past-due fees on taxes. 
    If any two consecutive stormwater utility fees have not been paid when due, a penalty as set forth on section 36-528, shall be added to the amount due. Any such past-due fees may then be certified to the county auditor for collection with real estate taxes on the following year pursuant to Minn. Stats. § 444.075, subd. 3.

There are site conditions which require a sign adjustment to allow the sign to be reasonably
visible from a street immediately adjacent to the street or there are other unique
circumstances and the variance may be granted without substantial detriment to another
person or the public good, or inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the sign ordinance.
A variance or deviation from the design standards (materials, lighting, etc.) may be
authorized by the Council upon a finding of the Council that the strict application of the
design rules would prevent implementation of a design which, in terms of meeting the intent
of the sign ordinance, is equal or superior to the design alternatives allowed by the
ordinance or which are warranted by unusual conditions with respect to a specific building or
lot which requires the installation of a unique sign to match or complement the building or
lot.
Sec. 8-239. Penalties.
Upon a finding of any violation of this Article, the city shall provide written notice stating the
nature of the violation and a date for its satisfactory correction. If the violation has not been

and Minnesota Rules, Parts 6120.2500-6120.3900, Minnesota Rules Chapters
8410 and 8420.
B. Resolution of Policy. Whereas, the City of Long Lake Comprehensive Land Use
Plan and Water Resources Management Plan identify specific goals and policies
related to the proper management of its shoreland, lakes, wetlands, water and soil
resources, and;
Whereas, the City of Long Lake recognizes that the uncontrolled use of
shorelands, wetlands, and land disturbing activities in general in the City affects
the public health, safety and general welfar0e not only by contributing to the
pollution of surface and ground waters, but also by impairing the local tax base,
and;
Whereas, land development and use impact all receiving waters, especially lakes,
streams and wetlands by contributing to their impairment through point and
nonpoint pollution sources, and; Whereas, the City of Long Lake will soon adopt
a Water Resources Management Plan that recognizes that its storm water system
is integrated with the management of its natural lakes and wetlands and;
Now Therefore, City of Long Lake has determined that it is the best interests of
the public to manage and implement its Comprehensive Plan and Water
Resources Management Plan by a consolidated approach with this section as
provided for in Subdivisions 1 through 10 to avoid conflict and duplication to the

or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of
applicable water quality standards, other than storm water.
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm
drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this ordinance: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows,
rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains,
uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not
including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air
conditioning condensation, springs, noncommercial washing of vehicles,

b. Prohibition of Illicit Connections
(1) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
the connection.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this ordinance if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
I. Suspension of MS4 Access
a. Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The City
Council may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present an imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or
Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
b. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this ordinance may have their MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the
authorized enforcement agency for reconsideration and a hearing. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this Section, without the prior approval of the authorized
enforcement agency.

a. Applicability.
This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated
with industrial activity, including construction activity.
b. Access to Facilities.
i. The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the
authorized enforcement agency.
ii. Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions
of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any
additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
iii. The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devises as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of
the facilitys storm water discharge.
iv. The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the discharger
to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facilitys sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devises used
to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
v. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement
agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall
be borne by the operator.
vi. Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge
permit and of this ordinance. A person who is the operator of the facility
with a NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial
activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized
enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
Section 17A, Page 10 Amended May 19, 2015
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
ordinance.
vii. If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part
of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the City is able
to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance
with this ordinance or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized
enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court
of competent jurisdiction.
L. Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce storm water pollutants by the
use of best management practices.
The City will adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices (BMPs)
of any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. The
owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at
their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses
through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit
discharge, may be required to implement, at said persons expense, additional
structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants
to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm
water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the NPDES permit.
M. Watercourse Protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
persons lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the
property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would
pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the
watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately
owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will
not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
N. Notification of Spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for
a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or
operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which
are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into
Section 17A, Page 11 Amended May 19, 2015
storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release.
In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials,
said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone
or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the City
within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited
materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or
operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be
retained for at least three years.
O. Enforcement.
a. Notice of Violation. Whenever the City finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this Ordinance, the authorized
enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to
the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:
(1) The performance of monitoring, analysis, and reporting;
(2) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(3) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(4) The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
(5) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. If
abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further
advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by a designated
governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
P. Enforcement Measures after Appeal.
If the violation had not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the
Notice of Violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within 15 days of the decision
of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the authorized enforcement
agency, then representatives of the authorized enforcement agency shall enter
upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful
Section 17A, Page 12 Amended May 19, 2015
for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to
allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises
for the purposes set forth above.
Q. Cost of Abatement of the Violation.
Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be
notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property
owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within
15 days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by
the decision of the municipal authority, the charges shall become a special
assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the
amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the provisions of this
article shall become liable to the City by reason of such violation.
R. Injunctive Relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with
any of the requirements of this ordinance. If a person has violated and continues
to violate the provisions of this ordinance, the authorized enforcement agency
may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person
from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to
perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
S. Compensatory Action.
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this
Ordinance, the authorized enforcement agency may impose upon a violator
alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
T. Violations deemed a Public Nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition
caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this ordinance
is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a
nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violators expense,
and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such
nuisance may be taken.
U. Criminal Prosecution.
Any person that has violated or continues to violate this ordinance shall be liable
to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and shall be subject to a
criminal penalty of $1,000.00 dollars per violation per day and/or imprisonment
for a period of time not to exceed 90 days. The authorized enforcement agency
may recover all attorneys fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with
enforcement of this ordinance, including sampling and monitoring expenses.

and vegetation damage for the intended uses of controlled access lots;
2. They shall have a specific lot size not less than twice the minimum lot width of
the underlying zoning district.
3. They shall be jointly owned by all purchasers of lots in the subdivision or by
all purchasers of nonriparian lots in the subdivision who are provided riparian
access rights on the access lot and;
4. Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments shall be developed that
specify which lot owners have authority to use the access lot and what
activities are allowed. They may include other outdoor recreational activities
that do not significantly conflict with general public use of the public water or
enjoyment of normal property rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of
the insignificant conflict activities include swimming, sunbathing, or
picnicking. The covenants will not allow the parking of vehicles or watercraft
to be continuously moored, docked or stored over water, and shall require
centralization of all common facilities and activities in the most suitable
locations on the lot to minimize topographic and vegetation alterations.
F. Permitted water-oriented accessory structures. Each lot may have one wateroriented
nonhabitable accessory structure not meeting the normal structure

G. Steep Slopes, Visibility And Erosion. The Public Works Director shall evaluate
possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters prior
to issuance of a permit for construction of roads, driveways, structures, or other
improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary, conditions shall be
attached to the permit to prevent erosion and preserve existing vegetation,
screening of structures, vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from the surface of
public waters, assuming summer, leaf-on vegetation.
H. Height of Structures. All structures in residential districts shall not exceed thirtyfive
feet (35') in height.
I. Placement and Design of Roads, Driveways, and Parking Areas.
1. Public and private roads and parking areas shall be designed to take advantage
of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from
view from public waters. The Public Works Director shall review all roads and
parking areas to ascertain they are designed and constructed to minimize and
control erosion to public waters, consistent with the field office technical
guides of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, or other comparable

is not excessive.
K. Conditions Attached To Conditional Use Permits. The City Council, upon
consideration of the criteria listed above and the purposes of this Chapter may
attach such conditions to the issuance of the conditional use permits as it deems
necessary. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. Increased setbacks from the ordinary high water level;
2. Limitations on the natural vegetation to be removed or the requirement that
additional vegetation be planted; and
3. Special provisions for the location, design, and use of structures, watercraft
launching and docking areas.
L. Nonconforming Uses, Lots, and Structures in Shoreland Areas. All legally
established nonconformities as of the date of this Code amendment may continue,
but they shall be managed according to applicable State statutes and the City
Zoning Code for the subjects of alterations and additions, repair after damage,
discontinuance of use and intensification of use. The following standards apply to
nonconforming lots and uses in the shoreland management areas:
1. Construction On Nonconforming Lots Of Record. Vacant, undeveloped lots of
record in the office of the County Recorder on or before January, 1999 that do
not meet the requirements of this Chapter may be allowed as building sites
without variances from lot size requirements provided; the use is permitted in
the zoning district; all sanitary requirements of the City Code are complied
with insofar as practical; and the minimum lot size and length of water frontage
shall be not less than seventy percent (70%) of standard lot water frontage
requirements; the lot has been in separate ownership from abutting lands since
the above referenced date.
2. Combining of Nonconforming Lots. If, in a group of two (2) or more
contiguous lots under one ownership since January, 1999, any individual lot
does not meet the requirements of Subd. 7, the lot shall not be considered as a
separate parcel of land for the purposes of development. The lot shall be
combined with the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more
Section 17A, Page 19 Amended May 19, 2015
parcels of land, each meeting the requirements of this Chapter.
3. Additions/Expansions to Nonconforming Structures: All additions or
expansions to the outside dimensions of an existing nonconforming structure
must meet the setback, height, and other requirements of this Chapter. Any
deviation from these requirements may only be authorized by a variance.
4. Deck Additions to Nonconforming Structures. Deck additions may be
allowed, without a variance, to a structure which does not meet the required
setback from the ordinary high water level, if all of the following criteria and
standards are met:
a. the structure existed prior to January 1999,
b. a thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no reasonable
location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing ordinary high water
level setback of the structure, and
c. the new deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level does not
exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the existing setback of the structure from
the ordinary high water level or does not encroach closer than thirty feet
(30'), whichever is more restrictive; and the deck shall be constructed of
materials similar to the materials of the principal structure, wood, or earth
tone; and the new deck shall not be roofed or screened.
M. Subdivisions in Shoreland Areas. Subdivisions in shoreland management areas
are subject to the following criteria in addition to the overall subdivision
requirements of the City of Long Lake:
1. Land Suitability: Each lot created through subdivision, including planned unit
developments authorized by the City of Long Lake shall be suitable in its
natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration as defined by a
suitability analysis. Suitability analysis shall consider susceptibility to
flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with severe
limitations for development, severe erosion potential, steep topography,
availability of sewer and water, near- shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for
water-based recreation, important fish and wildlife habitat, presence of
significant historic sites, or any other feature of the natural land likely to be
harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of future residents of the proposed
subdivision or of the community.
2. Consistency with Other Controls: Subdivisions shall conform to all official
controls of this community. A subdivision shall not be approved where a later
variance from one or more standards in official controls would be needed to
use the lots for their intended purpose. Each lot shall meet the minimum lot
size and dimensional requirements of Subd. 7.
3. Information Requirements: Sufficient information shall be submitted by the
applicant for the community to make a determination of land suitability. The
information shall include at least the following:
a. Topographic contours at two foot (2') intervals or less from City public
works maps or more accurate sources, showing limiting site
Section 17A, Page 20 Amended May 19, 2015
characteristics;
b. The surface water features required in Minnesota Statutes, section 505.02,
subdivision 1, to be shown on plats, obtained from United States
Geological Survey quadrangle topographic maps or more accurate
sources;
c. Adequate soil information to determine suitability for building and public
utilities for every lot from the most current existing sources or from field
investigations such as soil borings or other methods;
d. Information regarding adequacy of domestic City water supply; extent of
anticipated vegetation and topographic alterations; near-shore aquatic
conditions, including depths, types of bottom sediments, and aquatic
vegetation; and proposed methods for controlling storm water runoff and
erosion, both during and after construction activities;
e. Location of 100-year flood plain areas and floodway districts from
existing adopted maps or data; and
f. A line or contour representing ordinary high water level, the toe and the
top of bluffs, and the minimum building setback distances from the top of
the bluff and the lake or stream.
4. Dedications: When an on-site storm water ponding area is required by a project
to store surface water runoff, the City may require easements over natural
drainage or ponding areas for future maintenance of storm water and
significant wetlands.
Subd. 9 Erosion and Sediment Control for Land Disturbance Activities
A. Manner of Work.
All land disturbing or land filling activities or soil storage shall comply with the
requirements of Section 19, Subd. 25 of this Ordinance.
1. General Requirements. All land disturbing or land filling activities or soil
storage shall be undertaken in a manner designed to minimize surface runoff,
erosion and sedimentation. Whenever the issuing authority determines that any
land disturbing activity on any private property has become a hazard to life and
limb, or endangers the property of another, or adversely affects the safety, use,
slope, or soil stability of a public way, publicly controlled wetland, or
watercourse, then the owner of the property upon which the land disturbing
activity is located, or other person or agent in control of said property, upon
receipt of notice in writing from the issuing authority, shall within the period
specified therein repair or eliminate such conditions.
2. Erosion control provisions for all permits. All permits issued by the City of
Long Lake involving any excavation, fill or grading, including all building
permits shall contain an attached page of special provisions that specifies at a
minimum:
a. That the permittee is responsible for the cleanup and any damages
resulting from soil eroded from the building site onto public streets, storm
Section 17A, Page 21 Amended May 19, 2015
sewer systems, any adjoining private property, or any public waters,
shoreland or wetland;
b. That the permittee shall install and maintain either silt fencing along the
lot boundaries where runoff is possible to public streets, storm sewer
systems, any adjoining private property, or any public waters, shoreland or
wetland; or maintain a temporary mulch on all exposed soil at a rate
specified by the City Engineer; and
c. a general diagram of a typical lot development that shows the direction of
drainage on the lot, the locations of silt fence, areas that are to receive a
temporary mulch, a rock and gravel pad for parking construction vehicles
and a schedule for permanent seeding or sodding.
B. Erosion and sediment control performance standards. The design, testing,
installation, and maintenance of erosion and sediment control operations and
facilities shall adhere to the most current requirements of the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency (MPCA) Construction General Permit.
C. Permit required. Except as otherwise provided in the Uniform Building Code, as
adopted by the City of Long Lake, no person may grade, fill, excavate, store,
stockpile or dispose of earth materials or perform any other land disturbing or
land filling activity without first obtaining a building permit from the Building
Inspector. Annual maintenance permits are available for maintenance projects
greater than five hundred (500) square feet. No fill or excavation in a wetland
overlay district may occur unless the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District has
approved a replacement plan, issued a no-loss determination, or determined that
the activity is exempt from the Wetland Conservation Act Rules, Chapter 8420.
Questions relating to wetland type, location, area, functions and values must be
referred to the technical advisory panel established by Minnesota Statutes Section
103G.2242 as amended.
Subd. 10 Vegetation Removal
A. Except for driveways, sidewalks, patios, areas occupied by structures or areas
which have been improved by landscaping, all areas shall be covered by plants or
vegetative growth.
B. Vegetation removal. Prior to the cutting of oak and elm trees, the City Forester
shall be consulted for guidance on timing of cutting and proper disposal to
minimize transfer of diseases to healthy trees.
C. Vegetation Alterations in Shoreland Areas.

Section 17B Page 1 7/20/2004
SECTION 17B FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT
Subd. 1. Purpose. The Legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes
Chapters 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the authority to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Minnesota Statute, Chapter 103F further
stipulates that communities subject to recurrent flooding must participate and maintain eligibility
in the National Flood Insurance Program. Therefore the City of Long Lake, Minnesota does
ordain as follows:
A. Statement of Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to maintain the Community's
eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and to minimize potential
losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
B. Warning of Disclaimer of Liability. This Section does not imply that areas outside
of the flood plain district or land uses permitted within such districts will be free
from flooding and flood damages. This Section shall not create liability on the part
of the City of Long Lake or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this Section or any administrative decisions lawfully
made thereunder.
C. National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This Section is adopted to comply
with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as
44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to maintain the
Communitys eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
Subd. 2. General Provisions.
A. Adoption of Flood Insurance Study and Flood Insurance Rate Map. The Flood
Insurance Study, Volume 1 of 2 and Volume 2 of 2, Hennepin County, Minnesota,
All Jurisdictions and the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels numbered
27053C0302E and 27053C0306E for the City of Long Lake, dated September 2,
2004, as developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, are hereby
adopted by reference as the Official Flood Plain Zoning District Map and made a
part of this Section.
B. Lands to Which Section Applies. This Section shall apply to all lands designated
as flood plain within the jurisdiction of Long Lake. Flood plain areas within Long
Lake shall encompass all areas designated as Zone A, Zone AE, Zone AO, or Zone
AH as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in Section 2.1 of this
Section.
C. Interpretation. The boundaries of the flood plain district shall be determined by
scaling distances on the Official Flood Plain Zoning District Map. Where
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the flood plain
Section 17B Page 2 7/20/2004
district, the City Planner shall make the necessary interpretation based on the
ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the community adopted its
initial floodplain Section and the regional (100-year) flood profile, if available. If
100-year flood elevations are not available, the community shall: 1) Require a
flood plain evaluation consistent with Section 4.3 of this Section to determine a
100-year flood elevation for the site; or 2) base its decision on available
hydraulic/hydrologic or site elevation survey data which demonstrates the
likelihood the site is within or outside of the flood plain.
Subd. 3. Conflict With Pre-existing Zoning Regulations and General Compliance.
A. The Flood Plain District as Overlay Zoning District. The flood plain zoning district
shall be considered an overlay zoning district to all existing land use regulations of
the Community. The uses permitted in this Section shall be permitted only if not
prohibited by any established, underlying zoning district. The requirements of this
Section shall apply in addition to other legally established regulations of the
Community and where this Section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
Section shall apply.
B. Compliance: No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall
be constructed, located, extended, converted, repaired, maintained, or structurally
altered without full compliance with the terms of this Section and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this Section. Within the
Floodway and Flood Fringe, all uses not listed as permitted uses shall be prohibited.
In addition, a caution is provided here that:
1. New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain
recreational vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this Section;
2. Modifications, repair and maintenance, additions, structural alterations or repair
after damage to existing nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of
structures or land are regulated by the general provisions of this Section; and
3. As-built elevations for elevated structures must be certified by elevation surveys
as stated in this Section.
Subd. 4. Permitted Uses, Standards, and Flood Plain Elevation Criteria
A. Permitted Uses in the Flood Plain. The following uses of land are permitted uses in
the flood plain district:
1. Any use of land which does not involve a structure, a fence, an addition to the
outside dimensions to an existing structure (including a fence) or an obstruction
to flood flows such as fill, excavation, or storage of materials or equipment.
2. Any use of land involving the construction of new structures, a fence, the
placement or replacement of manufactured homes, the addition to the outside
dimensions of an existing structure (including a fence) or obstructions such as fill
Section 17B Page 3 7/20/2004
or storage of materials or equipment, provided these activities are located in the
flood fringe portion of the flood plain. These uses shall be subject to the
development standards of this Section and the flood plain evaluation criteria of
this Section for determining floodway and flood fringe boundaries.
3. Recreational vehicles are regulated by this Section.
B. Standards for Flood Plain Permitted Uses.
1. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the
use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing
the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated
on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA's requirements incorporate
specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or
multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation
will be requested.
2. Storage of Materials and Equipment:
a. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding,
flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life
is prohibited.
b. Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable
from the area within the time available after a flood warning or if placed on
fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
3. No use shall be permitted which will adversely affect the capacity of the channels
or floodways of any tributary to the main stream, or of any drainage ditch, or any
other drainage facility or system.
4. All structures, including accessory structures, additions to existing structures and
manufactured homes, shall be constructed on fill so that the lowest floor,
including basement floor, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
The finished fill elevation must be no lower than one foot below the regulatory
flood protection elevation and shall extend at such elevation at least 15' beyond
the limits of the structure constructed thereon.
5. All Uses. Uses that do not have vehicular access at or above an elevation not
more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation to lands
outside of the flood plain shall not be permitted unless granted a variance by the
Board of Adjustment. In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall
specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the use and only after
determining that adequate flood warning time and local emergency response and
recovery procedures exist.
Section 17B Page 4 7/20/2004
6. Commercial and Manufacturing Uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards,
railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory
flood protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by
the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in feet)
times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four (4) upon
occurrence of the regional flood.
7. On-site Sewage Treatment and Water Supply Systems: Where public utilities are
not provided: 1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) New or replacement
on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into
flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or contamination during
times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system designed in accordance with the
State's current statewide standards for on-site sewage treatment systems shall be
determined to be in compliance with this Section.
8. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state
or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
C. Flood Plain Evaluation
1. Upon receipt of an application for a permit for a use or other approval within the
Flood Plain District, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the
following information as is deemed necessary by the City Planner for the
determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the
proposed use is within the floodway or flood fringe.
2. A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the stream, elevation of
land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional areas to be occupied
by the proposed development, and high water information.
3. Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground, pertinent
structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and spatial arrangement of
all proposed and existing structures on the site, and the location and elevations of
streets.
4. Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and downstream,
and soil types.
Section 17B Page 5 7/20/2004
5. Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream
for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development.
6. The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to
a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in
determining whether the proposed use is in the floodway or flood fringe and to
determine the regulatory flood protection elevation. Procedures consistent with
Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 Code of
Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The
designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed
technical evaluation methodology with the respective Department of Natural
Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The designated
engineer or expert shall:
a. Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
b. Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a
hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
7. Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without
increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage increase than .5' shall
be required if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increased flood damages
would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream
within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries.
8. The City Planner shall present the technical evaluation and findings of the
designated engineer or expert to the Governing Body. The Governing Body must
formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or
Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit application. The Governing
Body, prior to official action, may submit the application and all supporting data
and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of
Natural Resources or the Planning Commission for review and comment. Once
the Floodway and Flood Fringe District Boundaries have been determined, the
Governing Body shall refer the matter back to the City Planner who shall process
the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of this Section.
Subd. 5. Utilities, Railroads, and Bridges in the Flood Plain District
A. All utilities and transportation facilities, including railroad tracks, roads and bridges,
shall be constructed in accordance with state flood plain management standards
contained in Minnesota Rules 1983 Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200.
Subd. 6. Subdivisions
A. No land shall be subdivided and no manufactured home park shall be developed or
expanded where the site is determined to be unsuitable by the City Council for reason
of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. The
Section 17B Page 6 7/20/2004
Planning Commission shall review the subdivision/development proposal to insure
that each lot or parcel contains sufficient area outside of the floodway for fill
placement for elevating structures, sewage systems and related activities.
B. In the flood plain district, applicants for subdivision approval or development of a
manufactured home park or manufactured home park expansion shall provide the
information required in this Section. The Planning Commission shall evaluate the
proposed subdivision or mobile home park development in accordance with the
standards established in this Section.
C. For all subdivisions in the flood plain, the floodway and flood fringe boundaries, the
regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads
shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
D. Removal of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation: The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood
hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-
year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and
side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These
standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change
of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
Subd. 7. Administration
A. Permit Required. A Permit issued by the Building Official shall be secured prior to
the erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance
and repair), or alteration of any building or structure or portion thereof; prior to the
use or change of use of a building, structure, or land; prior to the construction of a
dam, fence, or on-site septic system, prior to the change or extension of a
nonconforming use, prior to the repair of a structure that has been damaged by flood,
fire, tornado, or any other source, and prior to the placement of fill, excavation of
materials or the storage of materials or equipment within the flood plain.
B. State and Federal Permits. Prior to granting a permit or processing an application for
a variance, the City Planner shall determine that the applicant has obtained all
necessary state and federal permits.
C. Certification of Lowest Floor Elevations. The applicant shall be required to submit
certification by a registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered
land surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in
compliance with the provisions of this Section. The Building Official shall maintain
a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) for all new
structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the flood plain district.
Section 17B Page 7 7/20/2004
D. Notifications for Watercourse Alterations. The City Planner shall notify, in riverine
situations, adjacent communities and the Commissioner of the Department of Natural
Resources prior to the community authorizing any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work in the beds of public
waters pursuant to Minnesota Statute, Chapter 103G, this shall suffice as adequate
notice to the Commissioner of Natural Resources. A copy of said notification shall
also be submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
E. Notification to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase or Decrease the 100-year
Flood Elevation. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the
date such supporting information becomes available, the City Planner shall notify the
Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy of said
technical or scientific data.
Subd. 8. Variances
A. A variance means a modification of a specific permitted development standard
required in an official control including this Section to allow an alternative
development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only as
applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical
difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a community's
respective planning and zoning enabling legislation and this Section.
B. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such relief or
variance from the terms of this Section as will not be contrary to the public interest
and only for those circumstances such as hardship, practical difficulties or
circumstances unique to the property under consideration, as provided for in the
respective enabling legislation for planning and zoning for cities or counties as
appropriate. In the granting of such variance, the Board of Adjustment shall clearly
identify in writing the specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria
specified in this Section, any other zoning regulations of the Community, and the
criteria specified in the respective enabling legislation which justified the granting of
the variance. The following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency must be satisfied:
1. Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
2. Variances shall only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting
of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
Section 17B Page 8 7/20/2004
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or Sections.
3. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
C. Variances from the provisions of this Section may be authorized where the Board of
Adjustment has determined the variance will not be contrary to the public interest
and the spirit and intent of this Section. No variance shall allow in any district a use
prohibited in that district or permit a lower degree of flood protection then the
regulatory flood protection elevation. Variances may be used to modify permissible
methods of flood protection.
D. The Board of Adjustment shall submit by mail to the Commissioner of Natural
Resources a copy of the application for proposed variance sufficiently in advance so
that the Commissioner will receive at least ten days notice of the hearing. A copy of
all decisions granting a variance shall be forwarded by mail to the Commissioner of
Natural Resources within ten (10) days of such action.
E. Appeals. Appeals from any decision of the Board of Adjustment may be made, and
as specified in this Community's Official Controls and also Minnesota Statutes.
F. Flood Insurance Notice and Record Keeping. The City Planner shall notify the
applicant for a variance that: 1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance
and 2) Such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level increases risks to
life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance
actions. This Community shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its annual or
biennial report submitted to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance
Program.
Subd. 9. Nonconformities. A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this Section but which is not in conformity with the
provisions of this Section may be continued subject to the following conditions. Historic
structures shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
A. No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity.
B. A structural alteration within the inside dimensions of a nonconforming use or
structure is permissible provided it utilizes flood resistant materials so as not to result
in increasing the flood damage potential of that use or structure. A structural addition
to a structure must be elevated to the regulatory flood protection elevation in
accordance with this Section.
Section 17B Page 9 7/20/2004
C. The cost of all structural alterations or additions both inside and outside of a structure
to any nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50
percent of the market value of the structure unless the conditions of this Section are
satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations and additions constructed since the
adoption of the Community's initial flood plain controls must be calculated into today's
current cost which will include all costs such as construction materials and a
reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. If the current cost of all previous and
proposed alterations and additions exceeds 50 percent of the current market value of
the structure, then the structure must meet the standards this Section for new structures.
D. If any nonconforming use of a structure or land or nonconforming structure is
substantially damaged it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this Section. The City Council may issue a permit for reconstruction if
the use is located outside the floodway and, upon reconstruction, is adequately elevated
on fill in conformity with the provisions of this Section.
E. If a substantial improvement occurs from any combination of a building addition to the
outside dimensions of the existing building or a rehabilitation, reconstruction,
alteration, or other improvement to the inside dimensions of an existing nonconforming
building, then the building addition and the existing nonconforming building must
meet the requirements of this Section for new structures, depending upon whether the
structure is in the floodway or flood fringe, respectively.
Subd. 10. Penalties for Violation. A violation of the provisions of this Section or failure to
comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variance) shall constitute a misdemeanor.
A. In responding to a suspected Section violation, the City Planner and the Community
may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it including but not
limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for
corrective measures or a request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial
of flood insurance availability to the guilty party. The Community must act in good
faith to enforce these official controls and to correct Section violations to the extent
possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood Insurance
Program.
B. When a Section violation is either discovered by or brought to the attention of the
City Planner, the City Planner shall immediately investigate the situation and
document the nature and extent of the violation of the official control. As soon as is
reasonably possible, this information will be submitted to the appropriate
Department of Natural Resources' and Federal Emergency Management Agency
Regional Office along with the Community's plan of action to correct the violation
to the degree possible.
C. The City Planner shall notify the suspected party of the requirements of this Section
and all other Official Controls and the nature and extent of the suspected violation of
Section 17B Page 10 7/20/2004
these controls. If the structure and/or use is under construction or development, the
City Planner may order the construction or development immediately halted until a
proper permit or approval is granted by the Community. If the construction or
development is already completed, then the City Planner may either (1) issue an
order identifying the corrective actions that must be made within a specified time
period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official controls, or (2)
notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact permit/development
approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30-days.
D. If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the City Planner within the
specified period of time, each additional day that lapses shall constitute an additional
violation of this Section and shall be prosecuted accordingly. The City Planner shall
also upon the lapse of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore
the land to the condition that existed prior to the violation of this Section.
Subd. 11. Amendments. All amendments to this Section, including revisions to the Official
Flood Plain Zoning District Map, shall be submitted to and approved by the
Commissioner of Natural Resources prior to adoption. The flood plain designation on
the Official Flood Plain Zoning District Map shall not be removed unless the area is
filled to an elevation at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation and is
contiguous to lands outside of the flood plain. Changes in the Official Zoning Map must
meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Technical Conditions and
Criteria and must receive prior FEMA approval before adoption. The Commissioner of
Natural Resources must be given 10-days written notice of all hearings to consider an
amendment to this Section and said notice shall include a draft of the Section amendment
or technical study under consideration.
Subd. 12. Travel Trailers and Travel Vehicles. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
exemption criteria specified below shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and
as specifically spelled out below.
A. Exemption - Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this Section if
they are placed in any of the areas listed below and further they meet the following
criteria:
1. Have current licenses required for highway use.
2. Are highway ready meaning on wheels or the internal jacking system, are
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities commonly used in
campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks and the recreational vehicle has no
permanent structural type additions attached to it.
3. The recreational vehicle and associated use must be permissible in any preexisting,
underlying zoning use district.
B. Areas Exempted For Placement of Recreational Vehicles:
Section 17B Page 11 7/20/2004
1. Individual lots or parcels of record.

DESIGN REVIEW ARCHITECT
25.18 Policy Statement architect
In the City of Long Lake, the visual character and environmental quality of the
city are important attributes of the quality of life experienced by residents and
visitors. The city finds; that new development and redevelopment can have a
substantial impact on the character of the area in which it is located. Some
aspects of (re)development are more subtle and less amenable to exacting rules
and regulations which are established without regard to specific development
proposals. Among these are the general form of the land before and after (re)
developments, the spatial relationships of the structures and open spaces to land
uses, and the appearance of buildings and open space as they contribute to an
area. For the purpose of protecting the city and its citizens from visual chaos and
blight, it is hereby declared a matter of public policy that the preservation and
enhancement of environment quality and the protection of public and private
investments is a public necessity desirable to sound community planning and
development for Long Lake. This is required in the interest of health, safety and
welfare of the people. All of these matters require the timely exercise of
judgment in the public interest by people qualified to evaluate the design of
development in the City of Long Lake. There hereby is established a Design
Review Architect for the city of Long Lake. The Design Review Architect is an
advisory consultant that makes recommendations about issues of project design to
the Planning Commission. In addition to those duties and functions outlined in
this ordinance, the City Council by resolution may establish additional duties and
functions for the Design Review Architect.
Section 25 Page 7 Amended 4/21/2009

incurred by the city for review of plans by the Design Review Architect. This
payment shall be made by the petitioner upon receipt of an itemized invoice from
the city, and said payment shall be in addition to the fee required with the
petition.
25.20 Purpose
Subd. 1. From the issues identified in the policy statement, the following is a list
of purposes for the Design Review Architect.
a. To promote those qualities in the environment which bring value
to the community.
b. To foster the attractiveness and functional utility of the city as a
place to live, work, conduct business and recreate.

25.21 Criteria
Subd. 1. The final criteria for project design review are to be established and
adopted by the City. The following is a listing of the general areas of
concern to be addressed by the Design Review Architect. Any developer
or member of the public is entitled to have the Review guidelines and
criteria of review in writing. This is to be a permanent record of what
general guidelines the Architect is to follow with each proposal it reviews.
a. Structure Character and Design. To ensure that the built
environment enhances the quality of life in the city while being
attractive and functional. This includes the designs form and visual
image achieved through specific architectural elements and
materials.
b. Landscape and Environment. To prevent the unnecessary
destruction or blighting of the natural landscape or of the achieved
manmade environment.
c. Relationship of Structures and Open Spaces. To ascertain that the
treatment of builtup and open spaces has been designed so that
they relate harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings that
have a visual relationship to the proposed development.
d. Circulation. To determine that the proposal facilitates appropriate
pedestrian access, servicing, and parking and when necessary,
compliance with other regulations for the handicapped and other
persons with special requirements.
Section 25 Page 8 Amended 4/21/2009
e. Protection of Neighbors. To protect neighboring owners and users
by making sure that reasonable provisions have been made for such
matters as surface water drainage, sound and sight buffers, the
preservation of views, light and air, and those aspects of design not
adequately covered by other regulations which may have substantial
effects on neighboring land uses.

other City ordinances that affect design, such as the Sign Ordinance,
Noise Ordinance and the provisions for underground utilities in the
city.
25.22 Guidelines

SECTION 28A. INTERIM USES
Subd. 1 Purpose and Intent
A. Purpose: In addition to the purposes stated in Section 1 of this Ordinance, the interim use
permit procedure is intended to allow flexibility in the use of land or structures in the City
when such uses are not permanent and meet certain criteria designed to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare. Its purpose is also to establish predictable and balanced
regulations for the establishment of interim uses in the location and circumstances under
which the uses may be established without detriment to the public health, safety, and
welfare of neighboring property owners or occupants.
B. Intent
1. To allow a use for a brief period of time until a permanent location is obtained or while
the permanent location is under construction; or
2. To allow a use that is presently judged acceptable by the City Council, but that with
anticipated development or redevelopment, will not be acceptable in the future or will
be replaced in the future by a permitted or conditional use allowed within the zoning
district.
Subd. 2 Permit Required
An interim use permit shall be approved by City before erecting any structure or placing a use
on property in any zoning district where the use or structure is permitted as an interim use.

5.) Hours of operation, estimated patronage by employees and others, and
schedule for commencement and termination of the use,
Section 28A 2 July 2014
6.) A written statement evaluating how the use would meet City standards
for interim uses, the effects of the use on adjoining property; and the
general compatibility with the adjacent area, other properties in the
same zoning district and the Comprehensive Plan; and
7.) Other information as the City may require to determine if the proposed
use meets the intent and requirements of this Ordinance.
B. Review Procedure
1. The minimum requirements for the public hearing, public notice, and procedure for the
review of the interim use permit shall be the same as those for conditional use
permits, as provided in Section 28, Subd. 4 of this Ordinance.
2. If a proposed interim use is not listed as a permitted interim use in the zoning district
in which the property is located, an amendment to this Ordinance will be required,
according to the requirements of Section 29 - Zoning Amendment Procedure of this
Ordinance, before an interim use permit is considered by the City.

Use Permit:
A. That the interim use meets the standards and permit conditions of this Section,
B. That the date or event that will terminate the use can be identified with certainty;
C. That the use will not impose additional costs on the public if it is necessary for the public
to take the property in the future; and
D. That the applicant agrees to any conditions that the City Council deems appropriate for
permission of the use.
Subd. 5 Interim Use Standards

Subd. 9 Amendment or Assignment of Interim Use Permit
A. An amendment to a permit shall follow the procedures for consideration of an interim use
permit, as specified in Subd. 3 of this Section. The prior approval of an interim use permit
does not give the applicant or property any vested right to an amendment.
B. The permit may not be assigned or transferred to any other party by the applicant without
City Council approval. Any proposed assignment or transfer shall be considered by the City
as an amendment to the original interim use permit.

Section 32 Page 1 8/99
SECTION 32: ADULT USES
Subd 1: Purpose
The nature of adult uses is such that they are recognized as having adverse secondary
characteristics particularly when they are accessible to minors and located near
residential property or related residential uses such as schools, day care centers, libraries
or parks. Furthermore, the concentration of adult uses has an adverse effect upon the use
and enjoyment of adjacent areas. The nature of adult uses requires that they not be
allowed within certain zoning districts or within minimum distances from each other or
residential uses. Special regulation of adult uses is necessary to ensure that the adverse
secondary effects would not contribute or enhance criminal activity in the area of such
uses nor will it contribute to the blighting or downgrading or the surrounding property
and lessening of its value.
During 1999 the City conducted studies and extensive discussions of the role and purpose
of its commercial and industrial districts. The amendments to the zoning ordinance that
followed this process both refined and implemented the goals and objectives of the City¹s
Comprehensive Municipal Plan. The role the City has identified for its business districts,
after consideration of the City¹s traditional role, its goals and objectives, and its location
in the context of the west metro area, is provision of the day to day convenience shopping
and service needs of our community. The zoning amendments were structured to
encourage the provision of goods and services in Long Lake that are frequently
purchased, are not specialized, that people do not typically travel any significant distance
to obtain, and are not primarily entertaining in nature. For this reason, adult uses are
accommodated in the City both as accessory to the primary activity of the establishment,
and as a significant part or sole activity on the premise, with different standards applied
to each. This basis for accommodation of adult uses in the City was reinforced when the
customary setbacks and buffers from residential use for establishments that principally or
solely offer adult uses eliminated all potential sites in the narrow Long Lake business and
industrial districts along the spine of Hwy 12.
Subd 2: Adult Uses Defined
Adult Uses as defined in this Ordinance shall be subject to the following general
provisions:
1) Activities classified as obscene under Minnesota State law are not permitted and

SECTION 32A: SEXUAL PREDATOR RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS
Subd 1. Findings and purpose.
Certain predatory offenders present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are
extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses. Most sexual offenders commit
many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a
fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large,
while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.
It is the purpose of this section to serve the citys compelling interest to promote, protect and
improve the health, safety and welfare of its citizens by establishing areas around locations where
children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers, wherein certain sexual predators are
prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.
Subd 2. Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings

rules, regulations and specifications concerning the trimming, spraying,
removal, planting, pruning and protection of trees, shrubs, vines, hedges
and other plants upon the right-of-way of any street, alley, park or other
City-owned property.

Subd. 5: Landscape Requirements for Development and Redevelopment Plans
A. Intent - The City of Long Lake seeks to protect their tree resources by formulating
these standards for guiding development projects in tree protection and
conservation of woodland areas. All contractors and sub-contractors are to be
advised of tree protection standards by the developer or project manager.
Owners, contractors, developers, builders, and applicants shall avoid damage to or
Section 33 Page 3 10/19/2004
the destruction of significant trees when designing, locating, grading for and
building improvements.
B. Tree Preservation Requirements - The Applicant shall submit a Preservation Plan
if improvements are to be constructed on property containing significant Trees.
The Preservation Plan shall be submitted along with other materials required for
the approval.
1) Preservation Plan. A preservation plan for a proposed development or
redevelopment project must be prepared by a Minnesota registered
surveyor,, locating proposed improvements and all significant trees
located on the project area, including an indication of which significant
trees are to be preserved and which removed as a result of the construction
of the improvements. Significant trees diameters, heights and species
shall be noted on the Preservation Plan.
2) Design Considerations. During the planning process, it is expected that all
measures will be taken to protect significant trees and woodland areas on,
or adjacent to, the parcel and that roads, utilities and structures will be
sited to minimize the impact on trees and natural areas. Extensive
clearing of undergrowth and/or disturbance of the ground litter layer
should not occur in areas where trees are to be preserved.
3) If the applicant destroys or severely damaged trees which were required to
be preserved under the Preservation Plan, the Applicant will be required to
pay to the City of Long lake the sum of $200.00 per diameter inch of such
greater amount as may be determined by the City Council for each such
destroyed or damaged tree. Alternately, the Forester may, in consultation
with one other individual appointed by the City Administrator, agree to
tree replanting equaling total caliper inches lost, species and quality, in
lieu of a fine. Any such agreement shall specify the replacement tree(s)
species and diameter. Applicant shall have the right to appeal the
resulting fine or replanting requirements to the City Council.
4) The applicants responsibility for the loss of trees on sites subject to a
Preservation Plan shall cease once the site grading and construction have
been competed, the preservation has been verified, or any penalty fees
have been paid or approved, replacement trees have been planted, and
their growth has been well established.
5) All monies collected pursuant to this policy shall be placed in the Citys
park fund.
C. Sodding and Ground Cover Requirements. All open areas of developed lots which
are not devoted to buildings, patios, off street parking, loading and driving areas
shall be landscaped with grass ground cover, shrubs or other ornamental
Section 33 Page 4 10/19/2004
