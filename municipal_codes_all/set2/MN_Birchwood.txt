202.100.9. REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORMWATER
POLLUTANTS BY USE OF THE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
Birchwood Village has adopted requirements identifying Best Management
Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or Waters of the
State. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
Waters of the State through the use of these structural and non-structural best
management practices. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural best
management practices to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with
industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the
provisions of this section. These best management practices shall be part of a
stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with
these requirements of the NPDES permit.
202.100.10. WATERCOURSE PROTECTION. Every person owning property through which
a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of
the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and
other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of
water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such
structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the
watercourse.
202.100.11. NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS. Notwithstanding any other requirements of law, as
soon as any person responsible for a property has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges
or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or Waters of the
State, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such a release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. An owner or lessee is
responsible for the residential property they own or occupy. For commercial and
industrial property, responsible persons include an owner, but not be limited to the
tenant, the operator, and an emergency response officer for the facility or operation.
In the event of the release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the
City in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to Birchwood Village within three business days of the phone notice. If
the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
202.100.12. ENFORCEMENT.

Code 208 – page 4
or actions and provide a reasonable opportunity for the company to accept and undertake the
defense.

circumstances where indemnification applies, the company, at its sole expense, shall defend
the City if written notice of the claim or action is given to the company within a period
wherein the company is not prejudiced in the defense of such claim or action by lack of such
notice. If the company undertakes the defense, the company shall have complete control of
such claim or action, but it may not settle without the consent of the City, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or

waive or forfeit its right to reject the location of facilities by failure to respond within the
forty-five (45) days.

ground without a permit where an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of its
facilities. In such event the company must request a permit not later than the second

300. LAND USE
300.010. INTRODUCTION. Chapters 300 through 399 regulate the use of land, the
location, bulk, height and use of buildings, the arrangement of buildings on lots, and the
subdivision of land in the City of Birchwood Village. These regulations, which may be referred
to as "Land Use Regulations," are put forth in order to promote the public health, safety and
welfare, and to implement the Comprehensive Plan for Birchwood Village, Minnesota.
A majority of the City falls within the State of Minnesota's definition of shoreland. Since
uncontrolled use of shorelands adversely affects the public health, safety and welfare by
contributing to the pollution of public waters and by impairing the local tax base, the City's Land
Use regulations meet or exceed the requirements of the Minnesota Statewide Standards for
"Management of Shoreland Areas", (effective date July 3, 1989). These Standards are
administered by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization and policies contained in
Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 103F, Minnesota Regulations, Parts 6120.2500-6120.3900, and the

subdivision/plats must include copies of the subdivision/plat.

variances or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls must be sent to
the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked within
ten (10) days of final action.

(7) below, in order to ensure that the non-conforming use will not be intensified
and that, over time, the non-conforming use will, where possible, be brought into
conformity with the Zoning Code.
1. A Non-Conforming Pre-Existing Structure shall not be enlarged, modified,
changed, extended (either horizontally or vertically) or structurally altered,
unless such changes bring the Non-Conforming Pre-Existing Structure into
conformity with the Zoning Code. (Exception: A non-conforming use, lawfully
located within 60% of all required setbacks, may be structurally altered if the
alterations do not change the horizontal or vertical dimensions of the structure
and otherwise conform to the Zoning Code.)
2. A non-conforming use shall not be moved to any other part of the parcel of land
upon which the same was constructed unless the move would bring the structure
and its use into conformity with the Zoning Code.
3. If any Non-Conforming Pre-Existing Structure or Use is destroyed by fire or
other peril to the extent of greater than 50 percent of its estimated market value,
as indicated in the records of the county assessor at the time of damage, and no
building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is
damaged, any replacement or reconstruction must conform to the provisions of
the Zoning Code. Exception: If the non-conforming use that is to be
reconstructed came into being as the result of a previously granted variance, the
Council, after review, may continue the variance if the owner demonstrates that
the conditions under which that variance was granted continue to exist.
4. Normal maintenance of a Non-Conforming Pre-Existing Structure is permitted,
including necessary non structural repairs and incidental alterations which do
not physically extend or intensify the non-conforming use.
5. Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, a Non-Conforming Pre-Existing
Structure may be expanded, provided:
a. That such expansion does not increase the non-conformity in any dimension
(vertical or horizontal), does not create a new non-conforming use, and in
itself conforms with the Zoning Code; and
b. The sum of the setbacks on either side of the structure is not LESS than 20
feet.
6. When any Non-Conforming Pre-Existing use of land or of a building or
structure is discontinued for a period in excess of one year, such land, building,
or structure shall thereafter be used only as allowed by this Code.
7. No provision of this section shall be interpreted as negating the provisions of
302.015 (Undersized Lots).
C. Illegal Structures, Uses, or Lots: Any replacement or reconstruction of any kind
of a Non-Conforming Illegal Structure, Use, or Lot must conform to the
provisions of the Zoning Code.

301.065. PROVISION FOR VARIANCES. Where enforcement of the strict provisions of the
Zoning Code would cause undue hardship a variance may be granted to allow deviation
from the requirements, in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 462. (See
Section 304. VARIANCES AND APPEALS.)
“AMENDED BY ORDINANCE 2019-03-01; NOVEMBER 12, 2019.”
301.070. CONDITIONAL USES. Certain accessory uses permitted within the City have greater
than usual chances to present safety hazards, impact on neighboring people and
property, and nuisance situations. Because of these greater effects, the City requires
these uses to be covered under Conditional Use Permits. Applications for Conditional
Use Permits must comply with all provisions of Section 306. CONDITIONAL USE
PERMITS.
1. A Conditional Use Permit shall be required for the following projects:
a. Any land disturbance activity where the slope is toward a lake, pond, wetland,
or watercourse leading to such waters, and the alteration is closer to such waters
than the structure setback requirement. See Note at end of Section 301.070.
b. Any land disturbance activity where such work involves an area greater than
four hundred (400) square feet and/or more than fifty (50) cubic yards in
volume. See Note at end of Section 30l.070.
c. Any swimming pool with a capacity over three thousand (3000) gallons or with
a depth of over three and one-half (3 1/2) feet of water.
d. Any tennis court.
e. Any solar energy system for heating, cooling, electrical generation or other
purposes.

301.080. ZONING PERMIT. Certain uses and activities not requiring a Building Permit or a
Conditional Use Permit have the potential of adverse impact on neighboring property,
storm water runoff, and soil erosion. The City is especially concerned that landowners
comply with Setback and Impervious Surface coverage requirements. Therefore, the
City requires these uses and activities to be covered under Zoning Permits. Applicants
for Zoning Permits must comply with all provisions of Section 307 ZONING PERMIT
and Section 302 REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. If a
Building or Conditional Use Permit is applied for and issued, the applicant is not
required to apply for a Zoning Permit.

c. One-story detached accessory structures, used as tool and storage sheds,
playhouses, and similar uses, with a structure of one hundred forty-four (144)
or less square feet and greater than twenty five (25) square feet. (Note: Larger
structures require Building Permits.)
d. Sidewalks, driveways, and patios whose area is greater than one hundred (100)
square feet.
e. Decks and platforms less than thirty (30) inches above adjacent grade and not
attached to a structure with frost footings. (Note: Other decks and platforms
require Building Permits.)
f. Land Disturbance Activities greater than one hundred (100) square feet or
greater than ten (10) cubic yards. (Note: Land Disturbance Activities greater
than four hundred (400) square feet or greater than fifty (50) cubic yards require
Conditional Use Permits pursuant to Section 306.030 or Building Permits
pursuant to Section 301.070.)
g. Stairs and lifts to lake or water body. See special requirements in Section
302.080.
h. Beach sand replacement (above the OHWL) not to exceed four hundred (400)
square feet and/or fifty (50) cubic yards in volume.
“AMENDED BY ORDINANCE 2018-01-02; MAY 8, 2018.”
2. Landowners constructing structures or conducting activities similar to those in part
1 a. through e. and for Land Disturbance Activities in part f, but which do not
require Zoning Permits, are required to comply with all provisions of Section 302
REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
“AMENDED BY ORDINANCE 2005-1; APRIL 12, 2005.”
301.090. INTERIM USES. An "interim use" is a temporary use of property until a particular
date, until the occurrence of a particular event, or until zoning regulations no longer
permit it. An interim use permit is not required if a Building Permit or a Conditional

percent of the lot area unless the applicant satisfies the following conditions to obtain
a variance:
a. The applicant shall submit a stormwater management plan for the site that analyzes
the proposed development including the area(s) of impervious surfaces, direction
of runoff, proposed best management practices to manage runoff, and stormwater
retention that the best management practices will achieve.
b. The stormwater management plan shall include structures and/or best management
practices for the mitigation of stormwater impacts on receiving waters in
compliance with the City’s Surface Water Management Plan, or as approved by the
City Engineer, so that the site design includes stormwater management practices
that control the stormwater runoff volumes, and the post-construction runoff
volume shall be retained on site for 1.1 inches of runoff from impervious surfaces.
c. The applicant shall utilize the most recent version of the Minnesota MIDS

302.055. LAND DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY STANDARDS.
See Sections 301.070 and 306.030 for Conditional Use Permits for Land Disturbance
Activities.
1. The following are General Standards:
a. A combination of successive Best Management Practices may be used to achieve
the standards and requirements of Section 302.055. Justification for the
method(s) selected shall be provided by the applicant as part of the permit
application.
b. When possible, existing natural drainage ways and vegetated soil surfaces must be
used to convey, store, filter, and retain storm water runoff before discharge to
public waters and wetlands.
c. Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will minimize the
extent of disturbed areas, runoff, velocities, erosion potential, and reduce and
delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and protected as soon as
possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment on the site.
d. When development density, topographic features, and soil and vegetation
conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water runoff using natural
features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities such as diversions,
settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used.
Preference must be given to designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and
infiltration rather than buried pipes and man-made materials and facilities.
e. Grading and filing shall be such that the highest practical amount of runoff water
is retained on the parcel of land that is altered both during and after such
alteration.
f. Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that creates an unstable
slope.
2. The following are Specific Standards:
a. Land Use Standards
1. No construction or alteration of new or existing structures or land topography
shall be done so as to increase the rate of storm water runoff from the parcel as
compared to the runoff rate before such construction or alteration unless:
(i) The City has a storm water drainage system which will accommodate this
additional water flow without increasing the overall rate at which water leaves
the City or enters public waters; and/or
(ii) Adequate storm water runoff measures and facilities are constructed to
retain storm water on the lot and reduce the runoff rate such that the total rate
from the lot is not increased; and/or
(iii) The construction or alteration results in a substantial reduction in storm
water caused soil erosion on the lot, and the quantity of silt and/or other water
borne pollutants leaving the lot is reduced.
2. Fill shall be stabilized to accepted engineering standards for erosion control in
accordance with recommendations of the Washington County Soil and Water
Conservation District.
3. Fill shall not be placed on areas lower in elevation than the ordinary high water
level of any adjacent lake, pond or wetland; nor shall the final elevation of any
excavation or grading be lower than the ordinary high water level.
4. No grading or filling shall be permitted within twenty (20) feet (measured
horizontally) of the ordinary high water level of any lake, pond, or wetland.
5. No filled or excavated slopes shall be greater than thirty (30) percent.
6. Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of the shoreline
and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished slope does not
exceed three (3) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical, the landward extent of the
riprap is within ten (10) feet of the ordinary high water level, and the height of the
riprap above the ordinary high water level does not exceed three (3) feet.
b. Storm Water Control Structure Standards
1. When constructed facilities are used for storm water management, they must
be designed and installed consistent with the field office technical guide of the
Washington County Soil and Water Conservation Districts, Rice Creek Watershed
District, and the National Urban Runoff Program (NURP).
2. New constructed storm water outfalls to public waters or wetlands must
provide for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface
debris before discharge.
3. Drain Leaders. All newly constructed and reconstructed buildings with gutters
and downspouts must have drain leaders routed to pervious areas wherein the
runoff water can be allowed to infiltrate. The flow rate of water exiting the
leaders shall be controlled so that no soil erosion occurs.
c. Requirements and Standards During Construction
1. Best Management Practices to minimize and control stormwater runoff,
prevent erosion, and trap sediment shall be employed during construction in
accordance with the recommendations of Washington Conservation District
and/or as specified by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) in its
publication "Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas.”
(i) Site Dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by
temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, upflow chambers,
hydro-cyclones, swirl concentrators or other appropriate controls. Water may
not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion or flooding of the site or
receiving channels or a wetland.
(ii) Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building materials
(including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials and
hazardous materials) shall be properly disposed of off-site and not allowed to
be carried by runoff into a receiving channel, wetland, public water, or storm
sewer system.
(iii) Tracking. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives and parking
areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked
onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public road shall
be removed by street cleaning (not by flushing) at the end of each work day.
(iv) Drain inlet protection. During construction until site erosion control
measures are in place, all storm drain inlets shall be protected with straw
bales, silt fences, or equivalent barriers.
(v) Channeled runoff water passing through the site from adjacent areas shall
be diverted around disturbed areas if practical. Otherwise, the channel shall
be protected as described below. Sheetflow runoff from adjacent areas greater
than ten thousand (10,000) square feet in area shall also be diverted around
disturbed areas. Diverted runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not
erode the conveyance and receiving channels.
2. No more than one-third (l/3) of the surface area of a lot shall be devoid of
vegetative ground cover at any time. All Activities on the site shall be conducted
in a logical sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time.
3. Temporary ground cover, (mulch) shall be used within 2 weeks of finish and
permanent vegetative cover, sod and plantings shall be provided as soon as
possible but not exceeding 1 year after the completion of finish grading.
4. During and after grading, filling, and excavating, stormwater runoff and
erosion from the entire disturbed area must be controlled. Silt fences, straw bales
or equivalent control systems must be placed along all sideslope and downslope
sides of the site. If a channel or area of concentrated runoff passes through the
site, silt fences shall be placed along the channel edges to reduce the quantity of
sediment reaching the channel.
5. Any soil or dirt storage piles of material shall not be located with a downslope
drainage length of less than twenty-five (25) feet from the toe of the pile to any
roadway or drainage channel, public water, wetland, or lake.
All soil or dirt storage piles remaining must be stabilized by mulching, vegetative
cover, tarps, or other means within seven days. Erosion from piles which will be
in existence for less than seven days shall be minimized by placing straw bales or
silt fence barriers around the piles.
Any soil or dirt storage piles (including those for in-street utility repair) located
within or closer than twenty-five (25) feet to a roadway or drainage channel must
be covered with tarps or suitable alternative control to minimize erosion at all
times when not in actual use.
All soil and dirt piles not to be used in the final landscape shall be removed from
the lot within thirty (30) days of being excavated. Preferably such soil and dirt
should be hauled off when excavated and not piled on the lot.
6. Maintenance and inspection. The use of stormwater runoff and erosion control
measures shall include Best Management Practices maintenance. The City
Building Official shall inspect for compliance with this ordinance in conjunction
with each construction inspection and periodically as part of the scheduled
Erosion Control Maintenance Program. The City Building Official shall keep a
log of inspections, deficiencies and corrective actions and shall inform the
applicant of deficiencies and corrective actions required.
d. VEGETATIVE ALTERATIONS
1. Generally. The purpose of this section is to preserve, protect and reduce the
loss of trees and other vegetation. The removal of woody, non-noxious,
vegetation in the City shall be carried out in accordance with the following
criteria:
2. Clear cutting. Clear cutting of trees shall be prohibited except as necessary
for placing public facilities and roads and private and public structures. Clear
cutting of trees shall also be allowed on land within twenty (20) feet of
buildings and five (5) feet of driveways.
3. Removal of Trees – Replacement Required. Whenever significant trees, are
to be removed, the following requirements shall apply.
a. Significant trees that are removed shall be replaced at a rate of one (1) tree
replaced for each one (1) significant tree lost. Replacement trees shall be no
less than two and one half (2 1/2) inches in diameter for deciduous trees and
six (6) feet tall for coniferous trees. Replacement shall be completed within
one (1) year of the removal of tree(s) or one (1) year of the conclusion of
development or construction activities. For activities requiring permits, the
City may require the applicant to provide the City with a cash deposit, surety
bond or letter of credit to secure the applicant’s obligation to replace lost trees
in an amount necessary to cover the cost of replacement trees.
b. When Part 2 allows clear cutting that is within ten (10) feet of a side or
rear property lot line, the property owner shall provide vegetative screening
reasonably equivalent to the original vegetative screening within a reasonable
time after completion of the clear cutting.
4. Removal of Trees – No Replacement. On any parcel the removal of trees,
limbs or branches, and other plants that are dead, diseased or pose safety
hazards, and of all cottonwood, poplar family, box elder, green ash, silver
maple, elm (Siberian and American), and buckthorn trees of any size, is
permitted without replacement.
5. Buffer Strips. Existing vegetative buffer strips along any property lot lines
shall be maintained, or made more dense, to provide vegetative screening.
Replacement of vegetation type(s) is permitted as long as the resultant
screening is reasonably equivalent to that provided by the original vegetation.
6. Sound Practices. All cutting, pruning and trimming of trees must be based on
sound forest management practices for individual tree species. Upon request,
the City will provide assistance in determining what practices are sound.
7. Vegetation Alterations on Lots Abutting Water. Limited removal or alteration
of vegetation on lots abutting lakes, ponds, or wetlands, is allowed subject to
the following standards:
a. Clear cutting or intensive clearing of vegetation is not allowed.
b. Limited clearing of trees, subject to 302.055.2.d.3 and 4, and shrubs, and
cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is allowed to provide a view to the
water from the principal dwelling site and to accommodate the placement
of buildings, stairways and landings, picnic areas, access paths, beach and
watercraft access areas, and permitted water-oriented accessory structures
or facilities, provided that:
(i) The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed
from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced.
(ii) Vegetation which is removed must be replaced with other
vegetation which is equally effective in retarding water runoff and
preventing erosion.
(iii) A protective buffer strip of vegetation at least 16.5 feet back from
the ordinary high water mark shall be maintained abutting the
shorelines of all lakes and wetlands.
(iv) All applicable requirements of the Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources or other state agency are met.
8. Conduct of Activities. Land Disturbance Activities shall be conducted on no
more than one-third (1/3) of the surface area of a lot at any time. All activities
on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area of
bare soil exposed at any one time. Mulch, fiber matting, or similar ground
cover shall be applied during the conduct of the Land Disturbance Activities
to control erosion. Permanent vegetative cover, sod, or plantings shall be
provided as soon as possible but not exceeding six months after the
completion of Land Disturbance Activities.
“AMENDED BY ORDINANCE 2016-11: MAY 10, 2016.”
3. Variance. Any person who seeks a variance from any requirement of section 302.055
shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 304 (ZONING CODE: VARIANCES
AND APPEALS).
Any use which lacks reasonable screening of development on lots abutting lakes,
ponds, or wetlands, or which does not provide for adequate erosion control on any
property within the City, is a nonconformity. When a development or building permit
is sought for property with nonconforming vegetative or erosion conditions, a
recovery plan must be submitted by the permit applicant and approved prior to permit
issuance. The recovery plan must provide for reasonable screening of shoreland
development, protection of soil from erosion, surface water shading and a schedule
for implementation to meet the purposes of 302.055.2.d.

308.095 LAND DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY Refer to the provisions of Sections
302.050 IMPERVIOUS SURFACES, 302.055 LAND DISTURBANCE ACTVITY
STANDARDS, and 306.030 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT FOR LAND DISTURBANCE
ACTIVITY for additional requirements.
1. Management Criteria for Permanent Facilities.
a. An applicant shall install or construct, on or for the proposed land disturbing or
development activity, all storm water management facilities necessary to manage
increased runoff so that the two-year, ten-year, and one hundred-year storm peak
discharge rates existing before the proposed development shall not be increased,
and accelerated channel erosion will not occur as a result of the proposed land
disturbing or development activity.
b. The applicant shall give consideration to reducing the need for storm water
management facilities by incorporating the use of natural topography and land
cover such as wetlands, ponds, natural swales, and depressions as they exist
before development to the degree that they can accommodate the additional flow
of water without compromising the integrity of the wetland or pond.
c. The following stormwater management practices shall be investigated in
developing a storm water management plan in the following descending order of
preference:
(i) Infiltration of runoff water on-site, if suitable soil conditions are
available;
(ii) Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions;
(iii) Storm water retention facilities; and
(iv) Storm water detention facilities.
d. A combination of successive Best Management Practices may be used to
achieve the applicable minimum control requirements specified in subsection (a)
above. Justification shall be provided by the applicant for the method selected.
2. Design Standards for Detention Facilities. Storm water detention facilities constructed
in the City of Birchwood Village shall be designed according to the most current
technology as reflected in the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency publication
“Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas,” and shall contain, at a minimum, the
following design factors:
a. A permanent pond volume capacity equal to or greater than the runoff
expected from a 2.0 inch rainfall for the fully developed site;
b. A permanent pond length-to-width ratio of 3:1 or greater;
Code 308 – page 9
c. A minimum protective shelf extending ten feet into the permanent pond with a
slope of 10:1, beyond which the slopes should not exceed 3:1;
d. A permanent buffer strip of vegetation surrounding the permanent pond at a
minimum width of 16.5 feet;
e. All storm water detention facilities shall have a device to keep oil, grease, and
other floatable material from moving downstream as a result of normal
operations;
f. Storm water detention facilities for new development must be sufficient to limit
peak flows in each subwatershed to those that existed before the development for
the 10-year storm event. All calculations and hydrologic models/information
used in determining peak flows shall be submitted along with the storm water
management plan;
g. All storm water detention facilities must have a forebay to remove coursegrained
particles prior to discharge into any downstream watercourse or
waterbody.
3. Catch Basins. All newly installed or rehabilitated catch basins shall be provided with
a sump area for the collection of course-grained material. Such basins shall be cleaned
when they are half-filled with material.
4. Drainage Easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage
way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage rightof-
way conforming substantially with the lines of such water course, together with such
further width or construction or both, as will be adequate for storm-water run-off. The
easement shall include not only the stream channel, but also adjoining areas that have
been subject to flooding in years of heavy run-off.
5. Inspection and Maintenance. All storm water management facilities shall be designed
to minimize the need for maintenance, to provide access for maintenance purposes, and
to be structurally sound. All storm water management facilities shall have a plan of
operation and maintenance that assures continued effective removal of pollutants carried
in storm water runoff. A representative of the City shall inspect all storm water
management facilities during construction, during the first year of operation, and at least
once every five years thereafter. The inspection records will be kept on file at the City
offices for a period of at least six years. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
obtain any necessary easements or other property interests to allow access to the water
management facilities for inspection and maintenance purposes.
6. Models/Methodologies/Computations. Hydrologic models and design methodologies
used for the determination of runoff and analysis of storm water management structures
shall be approved by the City. Plans, specifications, and all computations for water
Code 308 – page 10
management facilities submitted for review shall be prepared and signed by a registered
professional engineer.
7. Water Management Plans. Storm water management plans shall be consistent with
watershed and ground water management plans adopted by governmental jurisdictions in
accordance with Minnesota Statutes 103B.231 and 103B.255 respectively.

street lines.
4. Water Courses. Lots abutting upon a water course, drainage way, channel, or stream
shall have an additional depth or width as required to assure house sites that are not
subject to flooding.
5. Features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for all natural
features, such as tree growth, water courses, historic spots or similar conditions, which, if
preserved, will add attractiveness and stability to the proposed development.
6. Lot Remnants. All remains of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing of
a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable
parcels. However, outlots may be used if there is a reasonable likelihood that future
subdivision of adjoining land will absorb these outlots into standard lots.

"AMENDED BY ORDINANCE 2005-1; APRIL 12, 2005."
309. PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY
309.010 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The City of Birchwood Village holds the ROW within its geographical
boundaries as an asset in trust for its citizens. The City and other public entities
have invested millions of dollars in public funds to build and maintain the ROW.
It also recognizes that some persons, by placing their equipment in the ROW and
charging the citizens of the City for goods and services delivered thereby, are
using this property held for the public good. Although such services are often
necessary or convenient for the citizens, such persons receive revenue and/or
profit through their use of public property. Although the installation of such
service delivery facilities are in most cases necessary and proper use of the ROW,
the City must regulate and manage such uses.
To provide for the health, safety and well-being of its citizens and to ensure the
structural integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of ROW, the City strives
to keep its ROW in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary
encumbrances. Although the general population bears the financial burden for the
upkeep of the ROW, one of the causes for the early and excessive deterioration of
its ROW is frequent excavation or other intrusions into its sub-surface area. This
Ordinance allows for the imposition of reasonable fees and regulates the
placement and maintenance of equipment currently within its ROW or to be
placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory
roles of state, federal and other agencies. Under this Ordinance, persons
disturbing and obstructing the ROW will bear a fair share of the financial
responsibility for its integrity. This Ordinance also provides for recovery of the
City's costs associated with managing its ROW.

work to schedule meetings.
13. Buried telecommunication facilities must have a locating wire or
conductive shield, except for di-electric cables.
14. Buried fiber facilities must be placed in a conduit of a type determined by
the ROW user unless the permit holder obtains a waiver from the City.
C. Standards for Installation of Overhead Facilities. The permit holder shall
comply with the following standards when installing facilities overhead:
1. All wires must be in compliance with the National Electric Safety Code
and at a location that does not interfere with traffic signals, overhead
signs, or street lights.
D. Standards for Wireless Telecommunication Facilities.
1. Purpose. The City of Birchwood Village desires high quality wireless
communication services to accommodate the needs of residents and
businesses. At the same time, the City strives to minimize the negative
impacts that wireless telecommunication facilities can have on aesthetics
and public safety. Due to the many services that must be delivered within
its limited area, the City also strives to avoid unnecessary encumbrances
within the public ROW. The City allows and regulates wireless
telecommunication facilities outside of the public ROW through
performance standards and height limits. The purpose of this Section is to
regulate wireless telecommunication facilities within the public ROW in a
manner that balances desire for service with aesthetic, public safety, and
ROW flexibility concerns.
Public ROW are appropriate locations for wireless telecommunication
facilities that present minimal impacts (i.e. small pole attachments that do
not require new poles, do not require pole extensions, and do not have
associated ground mounted equipment). Wireless telecommunication
facilities that require greater heights than can be afforded by existing poles
in the public ROW and that require ground-mounted equipment are more
appropriately sited outside the public ROW in accordance with adopted
performance standards of this Code. However, the City recognizes that as
wireless technology advances, some residential areas of the City may be
hard to serve with wireless technology due to the lack of acceptable siting
alternatives in the immediate vicinity. In such areas, where no alternative
non-ROW locations are available, wireless telecommunication facilities
that require pole extensions and ground equipment will be allowed in the
public ROW subject to the requirements of this Section which are meant
to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
2. Wireless Telecommunication Facilities as Pole Attachments. Wireless
telecommunication facilities that comply with the following requirements
may be attached to existing public utility structures within the ROW after
issuance of a small wireless facility permit.
a. The wireless telecommunication facility shall not extend above the top
of the existing public utility structure and the height of the existing
public utility structure shall not be increased to accommodate the
wireless telecommunication facility.
b. If the public utility structure must be replaced to structurally
accommodate the wireless telecommunication facility, the replacement
public utility structure height shall not exceed the existing public
utility structure height and the replacement public utility structure
diameter shall not exceed the existing public utility structure diameter
by more than 50 percent.
c. The wireless telecommunication facility shall not be larger than three
(3) cubic feet and shall have no individual surface larger than four (4)
square feet.
d. The wireless telecommunication facility shall not extend outward from
the existing pole or tower or arm thereof by more than two and one
half (2 1/2) feet, except that an antenna one half inch in diameter or
less may extend an additional six inches.
e. The wireless telecommunication facility shall include no ground
mounted equipment.
f. The wireless telecommunication facility shall not interfere with public
safety communications and shall meet the requirements of this
Ordinance.
g. Wireless telecommunication facilities in the ROW shall be removed
and relocated at City request subject to the provisions of this
Ordinance.
h. The wireless telecommunication facility shall not block light
emanating from the public utility structure and shall not otherwise
interfere with the original use of the public utility structure.
3. Wireless Telecommunication Facilities as Pole Extensions or with
Ground Mounted Equipment. Wireless telecommunication facilities that
require increased public utility structure height or that have ground
mounted equipment may be erected in the public ROW only when in
compliance with the following provisions and after issuance of a small
wireless facility permit or excavation permit:
a. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City or
his/her designee that the wireless telecommunication facility cannot be
placed in a complying location outside the ROW within one quarter
(1/4) mile of the proposed location.
b. The replacement public utility structure, including lightning rods and
all other attachments, shall not exceed the height of the existing public
utility structure by more than fifteen (15) feet. Once the height of a
public utility structure has been increased under the provisions of this
Section, the height shall not be further increased.
c. The replacement public utility structure diameter shall not exceed the
existing public utility structure diameter by more than fifty (50)
percent.
d. The wireless telecommunication facility shall not extend outward from
the public utility structure by more than two (2) feet.
e. If feasible and desirable, as determined by the City, the replacement
public utility structure shall match the original and surrounding public
utility structures in materials and color.
f. The wireless telecommunication facility shall not interfere with public
safety communications and shall meet the requirements of this
Ordinance.
g. A small wireless facility or excavation permit for a wireless
telecommunication facility that has ground mounted equipment will be
issued only if the City finds the following:
i. the ground mounted equipment will not disrupt traffic or
pedestrian circulation;
ii. the ground mounted equipment will not create a safety hazard;
iii. the location of the ground mounted equipment minimizes
impacts on adjacent property; and,
iv. the ground mounted equipment will not adversely impact the
health, safety, or welfare of the community.
h. Ground mounted equipment associated with the wireless
telecommunication facility shall meet the following performance
standards:
i. be set back a minimum of ten (10) feet from the edge of street or
curb line;
ii. be separated from a sidewalk by a minimum of three (3) feet;
iii. be set back a minimum of fifty (50) feet from the nearest
intersecting ROW line;
iv. be separated from the nearest ground mounted wireless
telecommunication equipment installation on the same block face
by a minimum of 330 feet unless the equipment is placed
underground;
v. if located adjacent to residential uses, ground mounted
equipment shall be limited to three (3) feet in height above grade
and twenty seven (27) cubic feet in cumulative size;
vi. if located adjacent to non-residential uses, ground mounted
equipment shall be limited to five (5) feet in height above grade
and eighty-one (81) cubic feet in cumulative size;
vii. ground mounted equipment located outside the public ROW
shall conform to the requirements of this Ordinance
viii. vegetative or other screening compatible with the surrounding
area shall be provided around the ground mounted equipment if
deemed necessary by the City.
i. Wireless telecommunication facilities in the ROW shall be removed
and relocated at City request subject to the provisions of this
Ordinance.
4. New Poles. The construction in the ROW of a new pole to support
wireless telecommunication facilities is not allowed, except as a
replacement of an existing public utility structure subject to the
requirements of this Section.
5. Charges. In addition to the permit fees required by the City, the City
reserves the right to charge telecommunication providers for their use of
the public ROW to the extent that such charges are allowed under state or
Federal law. Telecommunication providers shall be responsible for
payment of property taxes attributable to their equipment in the public
ROW.
309.071 TIMELINESS OF WORK. The work to be done under the permit and the
patching and restoration of the ROW as required herein, must be completed
within the dates specified in the permit. It may be increased by as many days as
work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the
permit holder or when work was prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable.
309.072 PERMIT EXTENSION. No person may excavate or obstruct the ROW beyond
the date or dates specified in the permit or do any work outside the area specified
in the permit unless such person makes a supplementary application before the
expiration of the permit. Payment of all fees for an extension of the permit is
required before extension may be granted by the City; If the work could not be
completed because of circumstances beyond the control of the permit holder or
the work was delayed or prohibited by unseasonable or unreasonable conditions,
the City may grant and extend the completion date of the work.
309.073 DELAY PENALTY. Notwithstanding Subsection (b) of this Section, the City
may impose a delay penalty where excavating or obstruction work in the ROW is
not completed within the time specified if no permit extension application has
been made prior to the expiration date of the permit. A delay penalty will not be
imposed if the delay is due to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant,
including without limitation inclement weather, acts of God, or civil strife.
309.080 PATCHING OR FULL RESTORATION OF ROW.
The permit holder shall patch its own work. In lieu of ROW restoration, a ROW
user may elect to pay a degradation fee as determined by the City.
A. City Restoration. If the City restores the ROW, the permit holder shall pay
the costs thereof within thirty (30) days of billing. If, during the twenty-four
(24) months following such surface restoration, the pavement settles due to
the permit holder's improper backfilling and compaction, the permit holder
shall pay to the City, within thirty (30) days of billing, all costs associated
with having to correct the defective work.
B. Permit Holder Restoration. If, within twelve (12) months after completion
of restoration of the ROW, the City determines the ROW has been properly
restored, the security posted by the permit holder as required by section
309.062 will be released.
C. Standards. The permit holder shall perform patching and restoration to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer.
D. Guarantees. If the permit holder performs the restoration work, the permit
holder shall guarantee such work and its maintenance for twelve (12) months
following its completion. During this twelve (12) month period it shall, upon

or a portion of its operations in the City must provide information satisfactory
to the City that the registrant’s obligations for its facilities in the ROW under
this chapter have been lawfully assumed by another registrant.
B. Removal of Abandoned Facilities. Any registrant who has abandoned
facilities in any ROW shall remove them from that ROW to the extent such
facilities interfere with another ROW repair, excavation, or construction,
unless this requirement is waived by the City.
309.210 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
By registering with the City or by accepting a permit granted under this
Ordinance, a registrant or permit holder agrees as follows:
A. Limitation of Liability. By reason of the acceptance of a registration or the
grant of a ROW permit, the City does not assume any liability (i) for injuries
to persons, damage to property or loss of service claims by parties other than
the registrant or the City, or (ii) for claims or penalties of any sort resulting
from the installation, presence, maintenance or operation of equipment or
facilities by registrants or permit holders or activities of registrants or permit
holders.
B. Indemnification. A registrant or permit holder shall indemnify, keep and hold
the City, its officials, employees and agents, free and harmless from any and
all costs, liabilities, and claims for damages of any kind arising out of the
construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its
equipment and facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a ROW,
whether or not any act or omission is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a
ROW permit. The registrant or permit holder does not indemnify the City for
its own negligence except for claims arising out of or alleging the City's
negligence in issuing the permit or in failing to properly or adequately inspect
or enforce compliance with a term, condition or purpose of a permit. This
section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity
otherwise available to the registrant, permit holder or the City, and the
registrant or permit holder, in defending any action on behalf of the City, shall
be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City
could assert on its own behalf.
If the registrant or permit holder is required to indemnify and defend, it shall
thereafter have control of the litigation, but the registrant or permit holder may
not settle the litigation without the consent of the City. Such consent will not
be unreasonably withheld.

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Ordinance is
for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative
agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct
and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions thereof.

401. SCAVENGING OF RECYCLABLE MATERIALS PROHIBITED.
401.010. PURPOSE. This chapter is designed to prevent unauthorized collections of
recyclable materials which are set out by City residents as part of a designated recycling
program. Unauthorized collection or "scavenging" may reduce the volumes of materials
collected as part of a designated program and thereby threaten the economic viability of the
authorized program. Scavenging may also cause confusion among participating residents and
thereby disrupt the publicity and educational processes of any authorized program. This chapter
is also designed to insure that a designated recycling program will be implemented in an orderly
fashion to avoid adverse effects on the public health, welfare, safety and environment.
401.020. DEFINITIONS.
1. Recyclable Materials. Shall mean all items of refuse designated by the Joint Powers
Commission of the Cities of Mahtomedi, Willernie, and Birchwood Village (hereafter JPC) to be
part of any authorized recycling program and which are intended for transportation, processing,
and remanufacturing or reuse.
2. Authorized or Designated Recycling Program. Shall mean a program for the
collection and recycling of recyclable materials which is instituted, sponsored and controlled by
the JPC.
3. Scavenging. Shall mean the unauthorized collection of recyclable materials that have
been set out by residents of the City specifically for participating in curbside recycling programs.
401.030. DESIGNATION OF ITEMS. The JPC shall prepare a list of refuse items
designated to be part of an authorized recycling program. Such items must be ones which are
generally accepted by the recycling industry for remanufacture and reuse, which can be cleaned,
prepared, and stored in a manner to protect the public health, welfare, safety or environment, and
which can be collected and recycled without threatening the economic viability of an authorized
recycling program. This list shall be filed with the City Clerk and sent to City households. The
JPC may modify the items on this list as circumstances warrant by following the procedure
specified for the original designation.
401.040. OWNERSHIP. Ownership of recyclable materials set out for the purpose of
participating in curbside recycling programs shall remain with the person or household from
which the materials originated until collected by authorized collector. Upon removal by the City
or its designated agents or contractors from a designated collection point, ownership of properly
prepared and stored recyclable materials intended for a City authorized collection program shall
be vested in the authorized collector. Materials not prepared, cleaned or stored according to JPC
specifications shall remain the responsibility and property of the individuals or household from
which the materials originated. Nothing in this ordinance shall abridge the right of any
individual or household to give or sell their recyclable materials to any recyclable materials
program.
401.050. UNAUTHORIZED COLLECTION. It shall be unlawful for any person who is
not authorized by the City, County or JPC to take or collect recyclable material set out for
authorized collection programs within the City.

4. Disposal. The discharge, deposits, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of
any solid or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof which may enter the environment or be
emitted into the air or discharged into any water, including ground waters.
5. Garbage. Discarded material resulting from the handling, processing, storage,
preparation, serving and consumption of food.
6. Garden. Ground area for cultivation of flowers, vegetables and shrubs.
7. Hazardous Waste. Any refuse or discarded material or combination of refuse or
discarded material in solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous form which cannot be handled by
routine waste management techniques because they pose a substantial present or potential hazard
to human health or other living organisms because of their chemical, biological, or physical
properties. Categories of hazardous waste materials include but are not limited to: explosives,
flammables, oxidizers, poisons, irritants and corrosives.
8. Incineration. The process by which solid wastes are burned for the purpose of volume

the elm, oak, and ash trees within the municipal limits are threatened by fatal diseases known as
Dutch elm disease, oak wilt, and from the emerald ash borer and the two-lined chestnut borer. .
It has further been determined that the loss of elm and oak trees growing upon private and public
property would substantially depreciate the value of property within the City and impair the
safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of the public. It is declared to be the
intention of the Council to control and prevent the spread of these diseases and these pests, and
this article is enacted for that purpose.

borer and the two-lined chestnut borer within the City.
403.040. NUISANCES DECLARED. The following are declared to be public nuisances
whenever and wherever they may be found within the City:
1. Elms. Any standing or living elm tree, (including but not limited to American elm, red
elm, rock elm, Siberian elm, and Chinese elm), or part thereof, determined by the City
tree inspector to be infected to any degree with the Dutch elm disease fungus,
Ceratocystis ulmi (Busiman) Moreau.
Any bark intact dead or dying elm tree, or part thereof, or any elm wood including
branches (greater than 2" in diameter at the largest end), logs, stumps, or firewood with
bark intact that poses a threat, (as determined by the City tree inspector), of harboring or
acting as a breeding site for the beetles, Scolytus multistriatus (Eichh) or Hylurgopinus
rufipes (Marsch).
2. Oaks. Any bark intact living or standing tree or part thereof, in the red oak group
(including, but not limited to, red oak, pin oak, northern pin oak, scarlet oak and black
oak) infected to any degree, (as determined by the City tree inspector), with the oak wilt
fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum (Bretz) Hunt, and has been determined (by the City tree
inspector) to pose a threat of overland transmission of the fungus to other oak trees. This
may also include any bark intact dead or dying red oak group oak tree, or part thereof,
that has died of oak wilt, (as determined by the City tree inspector), including branches
(greater than 2" in diameter at the largest end), logs, stumps, or firewood that is
determined by the City tree inspector to pose a threat of overland transmission of the oak
wilt fungus to other oak trees.
Any bark intact living or standing tree, or part thereof, in the red oak group described
above that is infected to any degree with the two-lined chestnut borer (Agrilus bilineatus)
that has been determined by the City tree inspector to pose a threat of overland
transmission of the borer. This may also include any bark intact dead or dying red oak
group oak tree, or part thereof, that has died from invasion of the two-lined chestnut borer
as determined by the tree inspector.
3. Ash. The provisions of paragraph 2 and 3 above shall also apply whenever the tree
inspector shall find a living or standing ash tree or bark intact or dying ash tree, or part
thereof, that has been infested with the emerald ash borer (Argilus planipennis or Agrilus
marcopol).
403.050. ABATEMENT. It is unlawful for any person to permit a public nuisance as
defined in 403.040 to remain on any premises owned or controlled by that person within the
designated control areas of the City. Such nuisances may be abated in the manner prescribed by
this chapter.
403.060. INSPECTION AND INVESTIGATION.
1. Annual Inspection.
a. Dutch Elm disease: The tree inspector shall inspect all premises and places
within the designated Dutch elm disease control area of the City at least once
during the growing season, by August 1st, to determine whether any condition
described in 403.040 (1) exists.
b. Elm wood: The tree inspector shall inspect all premises and places within the
designated Dutch elm disease control area of the City by August 1st, of each year
for elm wood or logs/stumps that meet any of the conditions described in 403.040
(1) and require by August 1st, removal or debarking of all wood logs, and stumps
to be retained.
c. Oaks: The tree inspector shall inspect all premises and places within the
designated control area of the City as many times as practical or necessary to
determine whether any condition described in 403.040 (2) exists.

City of Birchwood as many times as practical or necessary to determine whether
any condition described in 403.040 (3) exists.
2. Entry on Private Premises: The tree inspector so designated by the Council may enter
upon private premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of carrying out the duties
assigned to him/her under this chapter.
3. Diagnosis: Whenever possible, diagnosis shall be based upon accepted field
symptoms. The City tree inspector shall, upon finding indications of oak wilt or Dutch
elm disease or the two-lined chestnut borer or the emerald ash borer, take such steps for
diagnosis as may be appropriate. These steps may include analysis of twig and stem
samples from elm, oak, and ash trees or parts thereof suspected of being infected. The
tree inspector may submit such samples to an approved laboratory upon approval of the
Council. Laboratory isolation and confirmation of the presence of the fungi shall be done
by the Department of Agriculture's' disease laboratory, or other laboratories capable of
performing such services approved by the Minnesota Commissioner of Agriculture.
403.070. INTERFERENCE PROHIBITED. It is unlawful for any person to prevent,
delay or interfere with the City tree inspector or his/her agents while they are engaged in the
performance of duties imposed by this ordinance.
403.080. PROCEDURE FOR ABATEMENT AND REMOVAL.
1. Notice to Landowner. Whenever it is found with reasonable certainty that a tree has
oak wilt or Dutch elm disease, or is infected with the two-lined chestnut borer or the
emerald ash borer, the tree inspector shall proceed as follows:
(a) If the tree inspector finds that there is potential for infection of other oak
or elm trees, the owner of the property on which the nuisance is found, shall be
notified by certified mail, addressed to said owner at his/her last known address.
The tree inspector will specify on the notice a reasonable date before which the
nuisance must be abated. The tree inspector shall identify in the notice the
abatement action to be taken.
(b) The tree inspector shall immediately report said action to the Council and,
after the expiration of the time limited by said notice, the tree inspector may
proceed to abate the nuisance as herein provided.
(c) The cost of such abatement, plus a $50 administrative fee, shall be
assessed against the owner of the property involved, or against the property itself.
403.081. ABATEMENT ACTIONS.
1. High Risk Elm Trees: High risk elm trees shall be those trees that are dead, barren, or
have extensive wilt (30 percent or more of the tree is wilted). Such trees shall be
identified and marked prior to July 1st. These high risk trees shall be removed within 20
days of notification of the property owner.
2. Oak Wilt: All oak trees within the designated oak wilt control area of the City
diagnosed as having oak wilt should be isolated from neighboring healthy oak trees of the
same species by chemical or mechanical disruption of common root systems to prevent
root graft transmission of the oak wilt fungus.
To control the overland spread of oak wilt, the pruning of oaks shall be avoided during
the most susceptible period of infection, from April l5 until July l. If wounding is
unavoidable during this period, as in the aftermath of a storm or when the tree interferes
with utility lines, a tree wound dressing shall be applied immediately.
a. Red Oaks. To prevent the oak wilt fungus from producing spores and to
prevent the overland spread of this fungus, any bark intact diseased material
resulting from any tree of the red oak group, that wilted from oak wilt in July and
August of one year shall be declared hazardous for the spring of the following
year. This hazardous spring period shall be defined as April 15 to July 1 and
diseased material shall be determined such by the City tree inspector.
Any hazardous oak wood to be used as fuel wood or to be salvaged or other
purposes must be debarked, dried, or else completely covered by heavy plastic (4
mil or greater) from April 15 until July 1 of the year following the appearance of
oak wilt. After this time there is no danger of spore production and the wood
does not need to be covered.
Any branch greater than 2" in diameter of the red oak group determined to be
hazardous and not to be salvaged shall be disposed of by burning, chipping, or
removal to an authorized dump site prior to April l5 of the year following the
appearance of symptoms. Dead standing red oaks that have advanced beyond the
potential for spore production need not be removed except where they constitute a
hazard to life and/or property. The City tree inspector will advise accordingly.
Stumps of trees of the red oak group removed due to oak wilt shall be completely
covered with at least 2" of compacted soil, removed, or debarked to the ground
line to eliminate all possibilities of spore formation and overland disease spread.
Any hazardous material not dealt with in the above described manner must be
removed within 20 days of notification.
b. White Oaks: Trees of the white oak group (i.e. white oak, bur oak, bicolor
oak) diagnosed as having oak wilt should be isolated by root graft disruption as
previously stated. Diseased material originating from such trees will rarely ever
support spore formation, and salvaged material therefore will not require special
treatment to prevent overland spread. Standing trees of this group showing early
symptoms of oak will may sometimes be saved by removing affected branches.
The City tree inspector will advise accordingly.
3. Two-lined Chestnut Borer. The tree inspector shall identify such actions as the
inspector deems necessary to prevent the spread of the two-lined chestnut borer whenever
the two-lined chestnut borer is discovered in Birchwood.
4. Emerald Ash Borer. The tree inspector shall identify such actions as the inspector
deems necessary to prevent the spread of the emerald ash borer whenever the emerald ash
borer is discovered in Birchwood.
403.090. ROOT GRAFT DISRUPTION (BARRIERS) AT PROPERTY
BOUNDARIES. Because oak wilt is a community problem and because oak wilt control may
benefit an entire neighborhood, the tree inspector shall recommend and encourage neighborhood
participation and cooperation, including cost sharing, in root graft disruption and other control
efforts, especially where oak wilt is in danger of spreading across property boundaries.
403.100. TRANSPORTING ELM AND OAK WOOD PROHIBITED. It is unlawful for
any person to transport within the City any bark intact elm wood, or wood from the red oak
group that is determined to be hazardous, or any oak infected with the chestnut borer, or any ash
wood infected with the emerald ash borer without having first obtained a permit from the City
tree inspector to do so. The City tree inspector shall grant such permits only when such
permission does not interfere with the provisions of this ordinance.
403.110 PENALTY. Any person, firm or corporation who violates the conditions of
this ordinance is guilty of a misdemeanor.

has been filed, and the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to
show cause why the notice and order should be modified or withdrawn. The
failure of the petitioner or his representative to appear and to state his case at such
hearing shall have the same effect as if no petition were filed.
b. After the hearing, the Housing Appeals Board by a majority vote, shall sustain,
modify or withdraw the notice, depending on its findings as to whether the
provisions of this section have been complied with, and the petitioner and the
Housing Inspector shall be notified within ten days in writing of such findings.
c. The proceedings of the hearing, including the findings and decision of the
Housing Appeals Board and the reasons therefore shall be summarized in writing

order of vacation, the Inspector shall seek a court order in a court of competent
jurisdiction for the vacation of such dwelling or part thereof.
4. Emergency Order. Whenever the Housing Inspector finds that an emergency exists
which requires immediate action to protect the health and safety of the residents or of the
public, he may issue an order so stating, and notwithstanding any other provisions of this
section such order shall take effect and shall be complied with immediately. Upon
petition to the Housing Appeals Board, petitioner shall be afforded a hearing pursuant to
paragraph 2 of this section.
5. Vacation and Demolition.
a. If the owner, occupant, or lessee fails to comply with the order of the Housing
Inspector or the action of the Housing Appeals Board after hearing, the Housing
Inspector shall cause such dwelling or part thereof to be vacated and repaired or
demolished as the facts may warrant and shall, with the assistance of the City of
Birchwood Village Attorney, cause the costs of such repair or demolition to be
charged against the land on which the building existed as a municipal lien or to be
recovered in a suit of law against the owner.
b. In cases where it reasonably appears that there is immediate danger to the life
or safety of any person unless a dangerous dwelling as defined herein is

determination in which he has directly or indirectly, any personal or financial
interest. Three members of the Board in attendance at any meeting shall
constitute a quorum.
b. Interpret the intent of the section in specific cases where, upon appeal, it
clearly appears that, by reason of special conditions, undue hardship would result
from literal application of any action of the section. Where such undue hardship
is clearly demonstrated, the Board may permit a variance from the applicable
section provided the dwelling will vary only a reasonable minimum from the
literal provisions of the section and will comply generally with spirit and intent of
the regulations as to sanitation, safety and rehabilitation. Any such variance shall
be permitted only by the concurring vote of at least three members of the Board.
404.150. INTERPRETATION. The provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the
minimum requirements to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the City, and
where this chapter imposes greater requirements than imposed by other provisions or law or
ordinance, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
404.160. SEPARABILITY. Should any chapter, section or provision of this Code be
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the

408: EXCLUSION ZONESAND PROHIBITION
OF CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT-RELATED ACTIVITIES

in close proximity to them to be an unacceptable risk. This chapter is intended to exclude sex

409: Predatory Offender Residency Restrictions
409.010: Definitions
409.020: Regulations on Designated Predatory Offenders
409.030: A designated predatory offender does not violate this chapter if any of the
following apply
409.040: Penalty and Enforcement
409.050: Renting Properties and Penalties
409.060: Severability
Findings and Intent:
Predatory offenders present an extreme threat to public safety. It is the intent of this chapter to
serve the city’s compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and
welfare of the community by restricting certain predatory offenders from establishing residency
near locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers.
The website for the Minnesota Department of Corrections states, “All predatory offenders who
are required to register as sex-offenders are also assigned a level 1, 2, or 3 when they leave
prison. Level 3 is considered the highest risk to re-offend. If a level 3 offender moves into your
neighborhood, you will be notified by law enforcement.”
The Department of Corrections cites statistics indicating that most offenders victimize someone
they already know and most offenders do not commit offenses near their own place of residence.
However, those statistics do not hold true for all offenders. This ordinance, in conjunction with
Birchwood’s Safe Zone Ordinance, aims to reduce opportunities for predatory behavior by those
with the highest risk to re-offend, toward potential victims who access public spaces in
Birchwood.

Level III predatory offender under Minnesota Statutes, section 244.052, a
successor statute, or a similar statute from another state in which that person’s risk
assessment indicates a high risk of re-offense.
2. “Permanent residence” means a place where a person abides, lodges or resides for
fourteen (14) or more consecutive days. A permanent residence includes the
entire property upon which a dwelling sits, extending out to the property line.
3. “Temporary residence” means a place where a person abides, lodges or resides for
a period of fourteen (14) or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year
and which is not the person’s permanent address, or a place where the person
routinely abides, lodges, or resides for a period of four (4) or more consecutive or
non-consecutive days in any month and which is not the person’s permanent
residence. A temporary residence includes the entire property upon which a
dwelling sits, extending out to the property line.
4. “School” means any public or nonpublic elementary school, secondary school,
high school or college.
5. “Licensed day care” means any in-home or other group child care center currently

residence is within a prohibited zone.

Should any section, subdivision, clause or other provision of this chapter be held
to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect
the validity of this chapter as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the part held

required to receive a motor vehicle safety check and an emissions test.

projects; meet emergencies; and mitigate the effects of unexpected fluctuations in revenues or
expenditure needs. The city shall maintain the Spendable-Unassigned portions of the fund
balance at a minimum amount of between 40 and 50 percent of the budgeted operating
expenditures or six months of operating revenue whichever is greater and as measured on
December 31st of each year.

funds.
801.023. Non-spendable Fund Balance. The term “Non-spendable Fund Balance”
means the amount of a fund balance that cannot be spent because it is either not in spendable
form or there is a legal or contractual requirement for the funds to remain intact.
801.024. Spendable Fund Balance. The term “Spendable Fund Balance” means the
amount of fund balance that is available for appropriation based on the constraints that control
how specific amounts can be spent. The following categories define the revenue source and the
level of force of the constraint on spending. Categories should be supported by actual plans
approved by the governing body, an appropriate officer, or grant provider or enabling legislation.
801.025. Restricted Fund Balance. The term “Restricted Fund Balance” means that
portion of the Spendable Fund Balance that reflects constraints on spending because of legal
