Article V. Rules of Order
Section 100.051. Rosenberg's Rules Of Order – Simple
Parliamentary Procedures For The 21st Century.
[Ord. No. 06202016 § 1, 6-20-2016[1]]
Rosenberg's Rules Of Order Are Supported By The Following Four (4) Principles:
Rules Should Establish Order. The first purpose of the rules of parliamentary procedure is to
establish a framework for the orderly conduct of meetings.
Rules Should Be Clear. Simple rules lead to wider understanding and participation. Complex
rules create two (2) classes: those who understand and participate and those who do not fully
understand and do not fully participate.
Rules Should Be User-Friendly. That is, the rules must be simple enough that citizens feel
they have been able to participate in the process.
Rules should enforce the will of the majority while protecting the rights of the minority. The
ultimate purpose of the rules of procedure is to encourage discussion and to facilitate
decision-making by the body. In a democracy, the majority rules. The rules must enable the

majority to express itself and fashion a result, while permitting the minority to also express
itself (but not dominate) and fully participate in the process.
The Chairperson Should Take A Back Seat During Discussions.
While all members of the governing body should know and understand the rules of
parliamentary procedure, it is the chairperson (chair) who is charged with applying the rules of
conduct. The chair should be well versed in those rules, because the chair, for all intents and
purposes, makes the final ruling on the rules. In fact, all decisions by the chair are final unless
overruled by the governing body itself.
Because the chair conducts the meeting, it is common courtesy for the chair to take a less
active role than other members of the body in debates and discussions. This does not mean
that the chair should not participate in the debate or discussion. On the contrary, as a member
of the body, the chair has full rights to participate in debates, discussions and decisionmaking.
The chair should, however, strive to be the last to speak at the discussion and debate
stage, and should not make or second a motion unless he or she is convinced that no other
member of the body will do so.
The Basic Format For An Agenda Item Discussion.
The meeting is governed by the agenda and the agenda constitutes the body's agreed-upon
road map for the meeting. Each agenda item can be handled by the chair in the following
basic format:
First, the chair should clearly announce the agenda item number and should clearly state
what the subject is. The chair should then announce the format that will be followed.
Second, following that agenda format, the chair should invite the appropriate people to
report on the item, including any recommendation they might have. The appropriate
person may be the chair, a member of the governing body, a staff person or a committee
chair charged with providing information about the agenda item.
Third, the chair should ask members of the body if they have any technical questions for
clarification. At this point, members of the governing body may ask clarifying questions to
the people who reported on the item and they should be given time to respond.
Fourth, the chair should invite public comments or, if appropriate at a formal meeting,
open the meeting to public input. If numerous members of the public indicate a desire to
speak on the subject, the chair may limit the time of each public speaker. At the
conclusion of the public comments, the chair should announce that public input has
concluded (or that the public hearing, as the case may be, is closed).
Fifth, the chair should invite a motion from the governing body members. The chair
should announce the name of the member who makes the motion.
Sixth, the chair should determine if any member of the body wishes to second the
motion. The chair should announce the name of the member who seconds the motion. It
is normally good practice for a motion to require a second before proceeding with it, to
ensure that it is not just one (1) member of the body who is interested in a particular
approach. However, a second is not an absolute requirement, and the chair can proceed
with consideration and a vote on the motion even when there is no second. This is a
matter left to the discretion of the chair.
Seventh, if the motion is made and seconded, the chair should make sure everyone
understands the motion. This is done in one (1) of three (3) ways:
The chair can ask the maker of the motion to repeat it;

The chair can repeat the motion; or
The chair can ask the secretary or the clerk of the body to repeat the motion.
Eighth, the chair should now invite discussion of the motion by the members of the
governing body. If there is no desired discussion or the discussion has ended, the vote
should proceed immediately and there is no need to repeat the motion. If there has been
substantial discussion, it is normally best to make sure everyone understands the motion
by repeating it.
Motions In General.
Motions are the vehicles for decision-making. It is usually best to have a motion before the
governing body prior to discussing an agenda item, to help everyone focus on the motion
before them.
Motions are made in a simple two-step process. First, the chair recognizes the member.
Second, the member makes a motion by preceding the member's desired approach with the
words: "I move . . ."
The chair usually initiates the motion by:
Inviting the members to make a motion: "A motion at this time would be in order."
Suggesting a motion to the members: "A motion would be in order that . . ."
Making the motion.
As noted, the chair has every right as a member of the body to make a motion but
normally should do so only if he or she wishes a motion to be made but no other
member seems willing to do so.
The Three (3) Basic Motions. These three (3) motions are the most common:
The Basic Motion. The basic motion is the one (1) that puts forward a decision for
consideration. A basic motion might be: "I move that we create a five-member committee to
plan and put on our annual fundraiser."
The Motion To Amend. If a member wants to change a basic motion that is under discussion,
he or she would move to amend it. A motion to amend might be: "I move that we amend the
motion to have a ten-member committee." A motion to amend takes the basic motion that is
before the body and seeks to change it in some way.
The Substitute Motion. If a member wants to completely do away with the basic motion under
discussion and put a new motion before the governing body, he or she would "move a
substitute motion." A substitute motion might be: "I move a substitute motion that we cancel
the annual fundraiser this year."
Motions to amend and substitute motions are often confused. But they are quite different,
and so is their effect, if passed. A motion to amend seeks to retain the basic motion on the
floor, but to modify it in some way. A substitute motion seeks to throw out the basic motion
on the floor and substitute a new and different motion for it. The decision as to whether a
motion is really a motion to amend or substitute motion is left to the chair. So, if a member
makes what that member calls a motion to amend, but the chair determines it is really a
substitute motion, the chair's designation governs.
When Multiple Motions Are Before The Governing Body.

Up to three (3) motions may be on the floor simultaneously. The chair may reject a fourth
motion until the three (3) that are on the floor have been resolved.
When two (2) or three (3) motions are on the floor (after motions and seconds) at the same
time, the first vote should be on the last motion made. So, for example, assume the first
motion is a basic "motion to have a five-member committee to plan and put on our annual
fund-raiser." During the discussion of this motion, a member might make a second motion to
"amend the main motion to have a 10-member committee, not a five-member committee to
plan and put on our annual fundraiser." And perhaps, during that discussion, a member
makes yet a third motion as a "substitute motion that we not have an annual fundraiser this
year." The proper procedure would be as follows:
First, the chair would deal with the third (the last) motion on the floor, the substitute
motion. After discussion and debate, a vote would be taken first on the third motion. If the
substitute motion passes, it would be a substitute for the basic motion and would
eliminate it. The first motion would be moot, as would the second motion (which sought to
amend the first motion), and the action on the agenda item would be complete. No vote
would be taken on the first or second motions.
On the other hand, if the substitute motion (the third motion) failed, the chair would
proceed to consideration of the second (now the last) motion on the floor, the motion to
amend. The discussion and debate would focus strictly on the amendment (should the
committee be five (5) or ten (10) members). If the motion to amend passed, the chair
would now move to consider the main motion (the first motion) as amended. If the motion
to amend failed, the chair would now move to consider the main motion (the first motion)
in its original format, not amended.
Third, the chair would now deal with the first motion that was placed on the floor. The
original motion would either be in its original format (five-member committee) or, if
amended, would be in its amended format (ten-member committee). And the question on
the floor for discussion and decision would be whether a committee should plan and put
on the annual fundraiser.
To Debate Or Not To Debate.
The basic rule of motions is that they are subject to discussion and debate. Accordingly, basic
motions, motions to amend and substitute motions are all eligible, each in their turn, for full
discussion before and by the body. The debate can continue as long as members of the body
wish to discuss an item, subject to the decision of the chairperson (chair) that it is time to
move on and take action.
There are exceptions to the general rule of free and open debate on motions. The exceptions
all apply when there is a desire of the body to move on. The following motions are not
debatable (that is, when the following motions are made and seconded, the chair must
immediately call for a vote of the body without debate on the motion):
A Motion To Adjourn. This motion, if passed, requires the body to immediately adjourn to
its next regularly scheduled meeting. This motion requires a simple majority vote.
A Motion To Recess. This motion, if passed, requires the body to immediately take a
recess. Normally, the chair determines the length of the recess, which may range from a
few minutes to an hour. It requires a simple majority vote.
A Motion To Fix The Time To Adjourn. This motion, if passed, requires the body to
adjourn the meeting at the specific time set in the motion. For example, the motion might
be: "I move we adjourn this meeting at midnight." It requires a simple majority vote.
A Motion To Table. This motion, if passed, requires discussion of the agenda item to be
halted and the agenda item to be placed on "hold." The motion may contain a specific

time in which the item can come back to the body: "I move we table this item until our
regular meeting in October." Or, the motion may contain no specific time for the return of
the item, in which case a motion to take the item off the table and bring it back to the
body will have to be taken at a future meeting. A motion to table an item (or to bring it
back to the body) requires a simple majority vote.
A Motion To Limit Debate. The most common form of this motion is to say: "I move the
previous question," or "I move the question" or "I call the question." When a member of
the body makes such a motion, the member is really saying: "I've had enough debate.
Let's get on with the vote." When such a motion is made, the chair should ask for a
second to the motion, stop debate and vote on the motion to limit debate. The motion to
limit debate requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the body. Note that a motion to limit debate
could include a time limit. For example: "I move we limit debate on this agenda item to
fifteen (15) minutes." Even in this format, the motion to limit debate requires a two-thirds
(2/3) vote of the body. A similar motion is a motion to object to consideration of an item.
This motion is not debatable, and if passed, precludes the body from even considering an
item on the agenda. It also requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote.
Majority And Super-Majority Votes.
In a democracy, decisions are made with a simple majority vote. A tie vote means the motion
fails. So in a seven-member body, a vote of 4-3 passes the motion. A vote of 3-3 with one (1)
abstention means the motion fails. If one (1) member is absent and the vote is 3-3, the motion
still fails.
Almost all motions require a simple majority, but there are a few exceptions. The exceptions
occur when the body is taking an action that effectively cuts off the ability of a minority of the
body to take an action or discuss an item. These extraordinary motions require a two-thirds
(2/3) majority (a super-majority) to pass:
Motion To Limit Debate. Whether a member says, "I move the previous question," "I move the
question," "I call for the question" or "I move to limit debate," it all amounts to an attempt to
cut off the ability of the minority to discuss an item, and it requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote to
pass.
Motion To Close Nominations. When choosing officers of the body, such as the chair,
nominations are in order either from a nominating committee or from the floor of the body. A
motion to close nominations effectively cuts off the right of the minority to nominate officers
and it requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote to pass.
Motion To Object To The Consideration Of A Question. Normally, such a motion is
unnecessary, because the objectionable item can be tabled or defeated straight up. However,
when members of a body do not even want an item on the agenda to be considered, then
such a motion is in order. It is not debatable and it requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote to pass.
Motion To Suspend The Rules. This motion is debatable but requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote to
pass. If the body has its own rules of order, conduct or procedure, this motion allows the body
to suspend the rules for a particular purpose. For example, the body (a private club) might
have a rule prohibiting the attendance at meetings by non-club members. A motion to
suspend the rules would be in order to allow a non-club member to attend a meeting of the
club on a particular date or on a particular agenda item.
The Motion To Reconsider.
There is a special and unique motion that requires a bit of explanation all by itself: the motion
to reconsider. A tenet of parliamentary procedure is finality. After vigorous discussion, debate
and a vote, there must be some closure to the issue. And so, after a vote is taken, the matter
is deemed closed, subject only to reopening if a proper motion to reconsider is made.

A motion to reconsider requires a majority vote to pass, but there are two (2) special rules that
apply only to the motion to reconsider.
First is the matter of timing. A motion to reconsider must be made at the meeting where
the item was first voted upon or at the very next meeting of the body. A motion to
reconsider made at a later time is untimely. (The body, however, can always vote to
suspend the rules and, by a two-thirds (2/3) majority, allow a motion to reconsider to be
made at another time.)
Second, a motion to reconsider may be made only by certain members of the body.
Accordingly, a motion to reconsider may be made only by a member who voted in the
majority on the original motion. If such a member has a change of heart, he or she may
make the motion to reconsider (any other member of the body may second the motion). If
a member who voted in the minority seeks to make the motion to reconsider, it must be
ruled out of order. The purpose of this rule is finality. If a member of the minority could
make a motion to reconsider, then the item could be brought back to the body again and
again, which would defeat the purpose of finality.
If the motion to reconsider passes, then the original matter is back before the body and a new
original motion is in order. The matter may be discussed and debated as if it were on the floor
for the first time.
Courtesy And Decorum.
The rules of order are meant to create an atmosphere where the members of the body and
the members of the public can attend to business efficiently, fairly and with full participation.
And at the same time, it is up to the chair and the members of the body to maintain common
courtesy and decorum. Unless the setting is very informal, it is always best for only one (1)
person at a time to have the floor and it is always best for every speaker to be first recognized
by the chair before proceeding to speak.
The chair should always ensure that debate and discussion of an agenda item focus on the
item and the policy in question, not on the personalities of the members of the body. Debate
on policy is healthy; debate on personalities is not. The chair has the right to cut off
discussion that is too personal, too loud or too crude.
Debate and discussion should be focused, be free and open. In the interest of time, the chair
may, however, limit the time allotted to speakers, including members of the body.
Can a member of the body interrupt the speaker? The general rule is no. There are, however,
exceptions. A speaker may be interrupted for the following reasons:
Privilege. The proper interruption would be: "Point of privilege." The chair would then ask
the interrupter to "state your point." Appropriate points of privilege relate to anything that
would interfere with the normal comfort of the meeting. For example, the room may be
too hot or too cold, or a blowing fan might interfere with a person's ability to hear.
Order. The proper interruption would be: "Point of order." Again, the chair would ask the
interrupter to "state your point." Appropriate points of order relate to anything that would
not be considered appropriate conduct of the meeting; for example, if the chair moved on
to a vote on a motion that permits debate without allowing that discussion or debate.
Appeal. If the chair makes a ruling that a member of the body disagrees with, that
member may appeal the ruling of the chair. If the motion is seconded and after debate, if
it passes by a simple majority vote, then the ruling of the chair is deemed reversed.
Call For Orders Of The Day. This is simply another way of saying, "Let's return to the
agenda." If a member believes that the body has drifted from the agreed-upon agenda,
such a call may be made. It does not require a vote and when the chair discovers that the

agenda has not been followed, the chair simply reminds the body to return to the agenda
item properly before them. If the chair fails to do so, the chair's determination may be
appealed.
Withdraw A Motion. During debate and discussion of a motion, the maker of the motion
on the floor, at any time, may interrupt a speaker to withdraw his or her motion from the
floor. The motion is immediately deemed withdrawn.
Special Notes About Public Input.
The rules outlined here help make meetings very public-friendly. But in addition, and
particularly for the chair, it is wise to remember three (3) special rules that apply to each
agenda item:
Rule One: Tell the public what the body will be doing.
Rule Two: Keep the public informed while the body is doing it.
Rule Three: When the body has acted, tell the public what the body did.
Public input is essential to a healthy democracy and community participation in public
meetings is an important element of that input. The challenge for anyone chairing a public
meeting is to accommodate public input in a timely and time-sensitive way, while maintaining
steady progress through the agenda items. The rules presented here for conducting a
meeting are offered as tools for effective leadership and as a means of developing sound
public policy.

[Ord. No. 06062016A § 1, 6-06-2016[1]]
Excellence in performance by Board of Aldermen members, City of Peculiar employees, and other
appointed board members is the best way to achieve our common goal of ensuring quality of life in
Peculiar. To be most effective, the efforts of all must be integrated. A special obligation of the City
Board of Aldermen is to set a leadership example to promote cooperation. The public expects the best
communication, planning, and decision-making possible from its representatives and employees. The
Board of Aldermen must strive for high standards of behavior and performance to benefit all Peculiar
residents. Adherence to the following set of principles will ensure effective guidance and operation of
this Board of Aldermen and will accentuate a positive, open, and productive environment for all.
Editor's Note: The ordinance adopting this material had same being included as a new Section 100.071,
which would have placed it within former Article V. In consultation with the City we determined the better
placement would be within its own Article at the end of this Chapter.

General Responsibilities Of Board Of Aldermen Members. Each Board member is accountable to
the Board of Aldermen for his/her actions. Each Board of Aldermen member will keep an open and
receptive mind toward the views and opinions of others. Should concerns about another Board of
Aldermen member arise, the person with the concern will share privately his/her view with the
other individual on a one-to-one basis before making it a public issue. When a Board of Aldermen
member has an idea on how the Board of Aldermen can work more effectively, the person is
encouraged to present the idea to the Board of Aldermen.
Specific Responsibilities Of Board Of Aldermen Members. At minimum, all Board members
should:
Demonstrate honesty and integrity in every action and statement.
Review Board procedures, including but not limited to this Code of Ethics, at least annually.
Represent the City at ceremonial functions at the request of the Mayor.
Respect the proper roles of elected officials and City staff members in ensuring open and
effective government.
Provide contact information to the City Administrator in case an emergent or urgent situation
arises while the Board member is out of town.
Specific Responsibilities Of Board Of Aldermen Members At Meetings.
Use Formal Titles. The Board members should refer to one another formally during Board
meetings as Mayor or Alderman [last name].
Practice civility and decorum in discussions and debate.
Be respectful of diverse opinions, as difficult questions, tough challenges to a particular point
of view, and criticism of ideas and/or information are legitimate elements of a free democracy
in action.
Honor the role of the Mayor in maintaining order and equity.
Respect the Chair's efforts to focus discussion on current agenda items. Objections to the
Chair's actions should be voiced politely and with reason, following the parliamentary
procedures.
Prepare in advance of Board meetings and be familiar with issues on the agenda; submit
questions on agenda items ahead of the meeting to enable better responses by City staff
members.
Stay focused and act efficiently during public meeting.
Do not politicize procedural issues (e.g., approval of minutes or order of agenda) for strategic
purposes.
Be courteous and respectful to staff. There should not be an effort to embarrass or demean
staff in a public forum.
Meeting Agendas. Board of Aldermen meeting agendas will be open and publicized. Agenda items
are to be turned into the City Clerk by 5:00 p.m. on the Tuesday prior to the regularly-scheduled
Monday meeting to allow the Mayor to review and approve. Surprises at meetings from the Board
of Aldermen members or staff can be unwelcome and counterproductive. Information upon which
decisions are to be made must be communicated to all Board of Aldermen members equally and
prior to decision-making meetings to enable free discussion.

Procedures Of Board Meetings. Rosenburg's Rules of Order, the simple parliamentary procedures
for the 21st century as endorsed by the Missouri Municipal League, shall be followed as the
procedures of the meetings.[1]
Note: See Article IV, Section 100.051, of this Chapter.
Section 100.120. Board Of Aldermen's Conduct With The Public.
[Ord. No. 06062016A § 1, 6-06-2016]
Communication. Effective communication requires a high level of trust. The Board of Aldermen
believes in open communication and the public's right to know. Open channels of communication
must be maintained among all members of the Board of Aldermen. It is understood that
information permitted by Statute to be discussed in closed sessions must remain confidential.
Sharing of such information with unauthorized persons at any time is unacceptable. If a public
statement on any City matter is appropriate or necessary, the Board of Aldermen, as a whole, will
agree upon a specific statement to be made by a Board member or other official designee. While
Board of Aldermen members, City staff members, and appointed board members may have their
personal opinions, those personal opinions must be as such and not as representations of City
policy.
Section 100.130. Board Of Aldermen's Conduct With Other
Boards And Commissions.
[Ord. No. 06062016A § 1, 6-06-2016]
Attendance In Official v. Personal Capacity. The City has established several Boards and
Commissions as a means of gathering more community input. Citizens who serve on Boards and
Commissions become more involved in government and serve as advisors to the Board of
Aldermen. They are a valuable resource to the City's leadership and should be treated with
appreciation and respect. Board of Aldermen members serve as liaisons to Boards and
Commissions (according to appointments made by the Mayor) and in this role are expected to
represent the full Board of Aldermen in providing guidance to the Board or Commission. In other
instances, Board of Aldermen members may attend Board or Commission meetings as
individuals.
Board of Aldermen members attending these meetings as official liaisons should:
Attend all regularly scheduled meetings of the respective Board or Commission, or
arrange for an alternate.
Maintain an active liaison relationship.
Board of Aldermen members attending these meetings in individual capacity should adhere to
the following protocols:
Any public comments by a Board of Aldermen member in personal capacity should be
clearly identified as personal views and not those representing the feelings of the Board
of Aldermen as a whole.
Limit contact with the Board or Commission members to questions of clarification of the
Board or Commission's position.
Avoid conduct, which shall be deemed inappropriate, with a Board or Commission
member to lobby on behalf of an individual, business, or developer, or to advocate a
particular policy perspective.

Be mindful that Boards and Commissions are advisory to the Board of Aldermen as
whole, not individual Board members.
Pursuit Of Concerns Regarding Board Or Commission Members. Board of Aldermen members
should pursue concerns regarding an individual Board or Commission member with tact. If the
Board of Aldermen member is comfortable talking with that individual privately, the Board member
should do so. If a problem cannot be resolved in such a manner, the Board of Aldermen member
should consult with the Mayor, who can bring the issue to the Board of Aldermen as appropriate.
Procedures To Be Followed By Board And Commission Members; Penalties For Failure To
Comply. The members of Boards and Commissions must follow policies and procedures
established by the Board of Aldermen. However, Board members should not feel they have the
power or right to threaten Board and Commission members in any way if they disagree about an
issue. A Board or Commission appointment should not be used as a political "reward."
Respect For Diverse Opinions. A primary role of the City's Boards and Commissions is to
represent many points of view in the community and to provide the Board of Aldermen with advice
based on a full spectrum of concerns and perspectives. Board of Aldermen members may have a
closer working relationship with some individuals serving on Boards and Commissions, but must
be fair to and respectful of all citizens serving on Boards and Commissions.
Separation Of Political Support From Public Forums. Board and Commission members may offer
political support to a Board member, but not in a public forum while conducting official duties.
Conversely, Board members may support Board and Commission members who are running for
office, but not in an official forum in their capacity as a Board member.
Section 100.140. Board Of Aldermen's Conduct With The City
Administrator And Subordinate Staff Members.
[Ord. No. 06062016A § 1, 6-06-2016]
General Principles Of Cooperation And Respect. Governance of a City relies on the cooperative
efforts of elected officials, who set policy; and City staff members, who analyze problems and
issues, make recommendations, and implement and/or administer the Board's policies. Every
effort should be made to cooperate with and show mutual respect for the contributions made by
individual City staff members for the good of the community.
General Rule Against Board Interference With City Staff. Under Section 115.340 of the Peculiar
Municipal Code, "[n]o member of the Board of Aldermen shall directly interfere with the conduct of
any department or duties of employees subordinate to the City Administrator except at the express
direction of the full Board of Aldermen or with the approval of the City Administrator." The Board of
Aldermen have establish that no directive or communication can be established with any staff
person without permission of the Mayor or City Administrator.
Communication With City Staff Members Regarding Concerns. While every Board of Aldermen
member can, and has the responsibility to, communicate to the City Administrator and/or City staff
matters that he or she believes deserve attention and application of the City's financial and/or
human resources, this responsibility does not entitle any Board of Aldermen member to
monopolize the City's resources, usurp the judgment of the City Administrator, or interfere with a
City staff member carrying out his or her duties. All requests must be approved by the Mayor.
Specific Duties Of The Board Of Aldermen. By Statute, the Board of Aldermen members are
responsible for the care, management, and control of the City and its finances in a policy-making
capacity.[1]

Specific Duties Of The City Administrator (And Subordinate City Staff Members). These duties are
established in Peculiar Municipal Code Section 115.330 and incorporated herein.[2]
Editor's Note: Peculiar Municipal Code Section 115.330 establishes the City Administrator's duties
and is incorporated in full as if set out herein.
Specific Principles Of Cooperation And Respect.
Treat all City staff members as professionals.
Channel communications through appropriate senior City staff members:
Questions of City staff members should be directed only to the City Administrator and/or
Mayor. The Mayor should be copied on any request to the City Administrator.
Board members should not set up meetings with staff members directly but should work
through the City Administrator and/or Mayor.
When in doubt about what staff contact is appropriate, Board members should ask the
City Administrator and/or Mayor for direction. However, nothing in these protocols is
intended to hinder the access required by Board-appointed liaisons to fulfill their unique
responsibilities.
Never publicly criticize an individual employee, including Board-appointed officers. However, it
must be noted that criticism differs from questioning the facts or opinions of City staff
members.
Direct critical comments about City staff member performance to the City Administrator by
private correspondence or conversation.
Avoid involvement in administrative functions: Avoid any staff interactions that may be
construed as trying to shape staff recommendations. Board members shall further refrain from
coercing staff into making recommendations to the Board as a whole.
Be cautious about communicating the City's position on policy issues: Before sending
correspondence related to a legislative or policy position, check with the City Administrator
and/or Mayor to verify that a position has not already been determined.
Do not attend staff meetings unless requested by staff. Even if the Board member does not
say anything, the Board member's presence may imply support, show partiality, intimidate
City staff members, or hamper the staff member's ability to do his or her job objectively.
Do not solicit political support from City staff members.
Depend upon City staff members to respond to citizen concerns and complaints. It is the role
of Board of Aldermen members to pass on concerns and complaints on behalf of their
constituents. It is not appropriate to pressure City staff members to solve a problem in a
particular way. Refer citizen complaints to the City Administrator, who will, in turn, be
responsible for informing the Board of Aldermen member of the complaint's resolution.
Respect the "one (1) hour" rule for staff work: Requests for staff support should be made to
the City Administrator and/or Mayor. Any request that would require more than one (1) hour of
City staff member time should be approved by the full Board of Aldermen to ensure that staff
resources are allocated in accordance with overall Board of Aldermen priorities. Once notified
that a request for information or staff support would require more than one (1) hour, the Board
of Aldermen member may request that the Mayor place the request on an upcoming Board
agenda.

Section 100.150. City Staff Member Conduct With The Board Of
Aldermen.
[Ord. No. 06062016A § 1, 6-06-2016]
Specific Principles Of Cooperation And Respect.
Demonstrate professionalism and non-partisanship in all interactions with the community and
in public meetings.
Demonstrate respect for Board of Aldermen members at all times.
Treat all Board of Aldermen members equally.
Respect the role of Board of Aldermen members as policy-makers for the City: City staff
members are expected to provide the best professional recommendations on issues. City
staff members should not try to determine Board of Aldermen support for particular positions
in order to craft recommendations. The Board of Aldermen must be able to depend upon City
staff members to make independent recommendations and if necessary, to provide
information about alternatives to recommendations. City staff members should also provide
information on the advantages and disadvantages of each staff recommendation and
alternative.
If a Board of Aldermen member directs a City staff member to take care of or provide
information to them that has not received approval of the City Administrator or the Mayor; that
staff member is to contact the City Administrator immediately and in turn the City
Administrator will inform the Mayor for appropriate action with the Board of Aldermen
member.
Upon the receipt of staff support request in accordance with the "one (1) hour" rule, City staff
members must follow through on said requests in the fullest and most expeditious manner
possible.
It is recommended that City staff not participate in any political forums or provide highly visible
support in a Mayoral or Aldermen election. This recommendation in no way inhibits any
employee from voting or becoming involved in local elections.

[Ord. No. 03032014 §I, 3-3-2014]
Meetings Using Video Conference Technology.
Policy statement. While it is legally permissible for members of the City's public governmental
bodies to attend meetings and vote via video conference transmission, a member's use of
video conference attendance should occur only sparingly. Because it is good public policy for
citizens to have the opportunity to meet with their elected officials face-to-face, elected
members of a public governmental body should endeavor to be physically present at all
meetings unless attendance is unavoidable after exercising due diligence to arrange for
physical presence at the meeting. The primary purpose of attendance by video conference
connection should be to accommodate the public governmental body as a whole to allow
meetings to occur when circumstances would otherwise prevent the physical attendance of a
quorum of the body's members. A secondary purpose of attendance by video conference
should be to ensure that all members may participate in business of the public governmental
body that is emergency or highly important in nature and arose quickly so as to make
attendance at a regular meeting practically impossible. Except in emergency situations, all
efforts should be expended to ensure that a quorum of the members of the public
governmental body be physical present at the normal meeting place of the body.
Video conference defined. For purposes of this section "video conference" or "video
conferencing" shall refer to a means of communication where at least one (1) member of a
public government body participates in the public meeting via an electronic connection made
up of three (3) components: 1) a live video transmission of the member of the public
governmental body not in physical attendance; 2) a live audio transmission allowing the
member of the public governmental body not in physical attendance to be heard by those in
physical attendance; and 3) a live audio transmission allowing the member of the public
governmental body not in physical attendance to hear those in physical attendance at a
meeting. If at any time during a meeting one (1) or more of the elements of a video
conference becomes compromised (e.g., if any participants are unable to see, hear, or fully
communicate), then the video conference participant is deemed immediately absent, and this
absence should be reflected in the minutes. A video conference participant's absence may
compromise a quorum in which case the applicable Missouri laws shall take effect regarding a
broken quorum.
Frequency of use of video conference attendance. A member of a public governmental body
shall not attend more than two (2) meetings via video conference in a rolling twelve-month
period. In keeping with the policy stated in Subsection (A)(1) above, attendance via video
conference should only occur sparingly and for good cause. Such good cause shall be at the
discretion of the member seeking to attend by video conference, but shall be for significant
reasons such as serious illness or injury of the member or a member of his or her immediate
family, including father or mother, spouse, sibling, child, or grandchild.
Physical location. Members of the public may not participate in a public meeting of a
governmental body via video conference. The public wishing to attend a meeting and elected
officials not participating via video conferencing of a meeting shall participate at the physical
location where meetings of the public governmental body are typically held, or as provided in
a notice provided in accordance with the Sunshine Law. The public governmental body shall
cause there to be provided at the physical location communication equipment consisting of an
audio and visual display, and a camera and microphone so that the member(s) of the public
governmental body participating via videoconferencing, the members of the public
governmental body in physical attendance, and the public in physical attendance may actively
participate in the meeting in accordance with rules of meeting decorum. The communication
equipment at the physical location of the meeting must allow for all meeting attendees to see,
hear, and fully communicate with the video-conferencing participant.
Voting. Elected members of a public governmental body attending a public meeting of that
governmental body via video conference are deemed present for purposes of participating in

a roll call vote to the same effect elected members of a public governmental body in physical
attendance at a public meeting of that governmental body are deemed present. As indicated
in Subsection (A)(2) above, if any component of the video conference communication fails
during the meeting, the member attending the meeting by video conference whose
connection failed shall be deemed absent immediately upon such failure, and if the public
governmental body was in the act of voting, the voting shall stop until all of the components of
video conference attendance are again restored and the video conference participant's
presence is again noted in the minutes.
Closed meetings. In a meeting where a member of a public governmental body is
participating via videoconferencing and the meeting goes into a closed session, all provisions
of Missouri law and City ordinances relating to closed sessions apply. Upon the public
governmental body's vote to close the meeting, all members of the general public shall not be
present. Likewise, a member of a public governmental body participating via
videoconferencing must ensure there are no members of the public present at his or her
location to see, hear, or otherwise communicate during the closed session. The member must
also take all reasonable precautions to guard against interception of communication by
others. Failure to ensure the requirements of this Subsection may result in corrective action
by the full public governmental body in accordance with City regulations.
Minutes. In the meeting, whether in open or in closed session, the minutes taken should
reflect the member, if any, participating via video conference; the members in physical
attendance; and members, if any, absent.
Emergency meetings. In the event that emergency circumstances create impossibility for the
members of a public governmental body to physically attend, the body as a whole may meet,
and if necessary vote, by video conference. Examples of such emergency circumstances
include, but are not limited to, war, riot, terrorism, widespread fire, or natural disaster such as
earthquake, tornado, hurricane, flood, or blizzard. To the extent possible in such
circumstances, the public governmental body shall use reasonable efforts to cause a physical
location to be provided for public attendance and participation.

[Ord. No. 041707, 4-17-2007]
The City Clerk is hereby designated as the "Custodian of Records" for the City of Peculiar, Missouri.
Such designations do not mean that the City Clerk will necessarily have all of the records in his or her
possession, but are simply an indication to whom requests for copies of records and information
regarding City government shall be directed. Requests for records made to persons other than the City
Clerk shall not be considered to be requests that are made pursuant to the Missouri Sunshine Law,
Chapter 610 of the State Statutes.
Section 117.005. How Records Are Requested.
[Ord. No. 041707, 4-17-2007]
All requests for records, notices or information shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by a
deposit of the estimated cost of reproducing the requested information. Oral requests, if received by
the Custodian of Records, shall be immediately recorded in written form to document the same. Any
request received by the Custodian of Records shall be initiated, with the date and time of receipt noted.
Section 117.010. Form of Response To Be Noted On Request.
[Ord. No. 041707, 4-17-2007]
The requesting party shall indicate on the request the manner in which a response is desired. In
absence of instructions to the contrary, it will be assumed that the requesting party wants to receive a
response in the same form as the original request. (Example, if someone stops by City Hall and
requests copies of documents, it will be assumed that the requesting party will stop by City Hall later to
pick up the documents. If someone mails a request to City Hall, it will be assumed that a mailed
response is desired.)
Section 117.015. Response Within Three Business Days.
[Ord. No. 041707, 4-17-2007]
The Custodian of Records shall respond to the request within three (3) business days of its receipt. A
"business day" is a day when the City Hall is open for the conduct of City business during its normal
business hours. While it is desirable that the entire transaction be completed within three (3) business
days, there may be circumstances where clarification or explanation of the request is necessary, or
where it may be necessary to provide only part of the requested information while searches are made
to find copies of other documents requested. If additional delay is necessary, the custodian shall give
explanation for the delay and the date the record will be available.
Section 117.020. Documentation of Response.

process the request.
Section 117.025. Request For Searches.
[Ord. No. 041707, 4-17-2007]
A request for copies of "all documents" or "every document" of a particular sort involves a request to
search through every record of the City in order for the City to certify that it has provided "all" or "every"
document. Such searches are expensive. Similarly, a request for records compiled in a format differing
from the format in which the records are customarily retained is a request for a search and compilation
and can be expensive. As a general rule, the Custodian of Records is not expected to engage in
extensive searches or compilations. Any search request that will require more than fifteen (15) minutes
of the custodian's time will be refused without a substantial advance deposit for the estimated time
required to search for the records.

[RSMo. §479.190]
Any Judge hearing violations of municipal ordinances may, when in his judgment it may seem
advisable, grant a parole or probation to any person who shall plead guilty or who shall be
convicted after a trial before such Judge. When a person is placed on probation he shall be given
a certificate explicitly stating the conditions on which he is being released.
In addition to such other authority as exists to order conditions of probation, the Court may order
conditions which the Court believes will serve to compensate the victim of the crime, any
dependent of the victim, or society in general. Such conditions may include, but need not be
limited to:
[Ord. No. 12052016 § I, 12-5-2016]
Restitution to the victim or any dependent of the victim, in an amount to be determined by the
Judge; and
The performance of a designated amount of free work for a public or charitable purpose, or
purposes, as determined by the Judge, for which no associated costs shall be charged to the
defendant.
A person may refuse probation conditioned on the performance of free work. If he does so, the
Court shall decide the extent or duration of sentence or other disposition to be imposed and
render judgment accordingly. Any county, city, person, organization, or agency, or employee of a
county, city, organization or agency charged with the supervision of such free work or who benefits
from its performance shall be immune from any suit by the person placed on parole or probation or
any person deriving a cause of action from him if such cause of action arises from such
supervision of performance, except for intentional torts or gross negligence. The services
performed by the probationer or parolee shall not be deemed employment within the meaning of
the provisions of Chapter 288, RSMo.
The Court may modify or enlarge the conditions of probation at any time prior to the expiration or
termination of the probation term.
Section 130.200. Appeals, Trial de Novo.

defendant shall have a right to trial de novo, even from a plea of guilty, before a Circuit Judge or
an Associate Circuit Judge.
In any case tried before a Municipal Judge who is licensed to practice law in this state or before an
Associate Circuit Judge, except where there has been a plea of guilty or the case has been tried
with a jury, the defendant shall have a right of trial de novo before a Circuit Judge or upon
assignment before an Associate Circuit Judge. An application for a trial de novo shall be filed
within ten days after judgment and shall be filed in such form and perfected in such manner as
provided by Supreme Court rule.
In any case tried with a jury before an Associate Circuit Judge a record shall be made and appeals
may be had upon that record to the appropriate Appellate Court.
The Supreme Court may provide by rule what record shall be kept and may provide that it be a
stenographic record or one made by the utilization of electronic, magnetic, or mechanical sound or
video recording devices.

The Board acknowledges there are occasions when products/services must be purchased from
one (1) specific source or manufacturer. If a request is made to purchase a product produced by
only one (1) supplier, yet several sources can provide a similar product, the request will be subject
to the normal bid process. Should a request that products/services be purchased on a sole source
basis, it must meet one (1) of the criteria shown below. A written explanation must be provided,
commonly referred to as a "sole source justification", to support the request. The four (4) most
commonly accepted sole source justifications are outlined below. Such justifications have been
accepted with proper supporting documentation.
The requested product is an integral part or accessory to existing equipment.
The service requested is for existing equipment which can only be completed by the original
manufacturer or manufacturer's designated service provider.
The requested product or service has unique design, performance and/or quality
specifications that are essential to a particular function and are not available in comparable
products.
The requested service or system requires a supplier with unique skills or experience.
In rare cases, only one (1) supplier may exist to provide a particular product or service. When
providing a justification based on the availability of one (1) supplier, the product or service must be
defined in generic terms. Specifying patented products or processes, when not necessary to meet
functional requirements, is not acceptable as a sole source justification. Justifications can be
accepted more readily by providing information regarding attempts to locate other suppliers, such
as letters, informal quotations or telephone contacts.
Section 140.080. Emergency Procurement.
[Ord. No. 070506 §1, 7-5-2006]

service or construction, the City Administrator shall have the power to secure the necessary items
in the open market, without competition, regardless of the amount of the expenditure.
In no event shall the contract price exceed commercially reasonable prices.
Section 140.090. Indefinite Quantity Procurement.
[Ord. No. 070506 §1, 7-5-2006]
In any case where the City has, within the preceding two (2) years, pursuant to an invitation to bid,
awarded a contract for the procurement of any supply, service or construction on a unit-price basis, the
City Administrator may negotiate with the successful bidder for the purchase of additional quantities of
the supply, units of service or construction. No such procurement shall be made at a higher than the
previous award.

lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow
shall be used except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
Green indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the
same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection;
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow,
may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
Steady yellow indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in Section 315.070 are thereby advised that there is insufficient
time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then
start to cross the roadway.
Steady red indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except as provided in Paragraph
(b) of this Subsection;
The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, than at the entrance to the
intersection in obedience to a red signal, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a
right turn but shall yield the right of way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as
directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the State Highways and
Transportation Commission with reference to an intersection involving a State highway,
and local authorities with reference to an intersection involving other highways under
their jurisdiction, may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any intersection
where safety conditions so require, said prohibition shall be effective when a sign is
erected at such intersection giving notice thereof;
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this Section shall be applicable except as to those provisions

"WALK": pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of
the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers of all vehicles;
"WAIT" or "DON'T WALK": no pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of
such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his crossing on the walk signal
shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone while the wait signal is showing.

drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a
limit line when marked, or if none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to
proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign;
Flashing yellow (caution signal), when a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent
flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with
caution.

involving between twenty-five thousand (25,000) and one hundred thousand (100,000)
square feet, or more, of gross leasable area. Large scale retail uses are characterized by
a target market area that may be greater than one (1) mile radius for the on premise
component of its sales. Destination retail centers may include services uses that provide
support for adjacent residential uses or businesses which may involve more than three
thousand (3,000) square feet of gross leasable area. Examples include copy centers,
large banks, or other similar services.
Mixed-use employment. Office and light industrial development that creates a campus
environment to connect multiple development sites into a cohesive setting and pattern.
Small office. Uses include those uses where individual units of gross leasable area
are typically between thirty-five hundred (3,500) and twenty thousand (20,000)
square feet, and where each owner or tenant typically employs between twenty (20)
and one hundred (100) employees on premises. Examples include large
professional service offices such as accountants, architects, insurance, law, real
estate, or other similar businesses.
Large office. Uses, or complexes, include individual units of gross leasable area that
may be more than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in a single building or group
of buildings, and each owner or tenant may typically employ more than one hundred
(100) employees on premises. Examples include major professional service firms or
large corporate offices.
Light Industrial. Uses include those where byproducts such as smoke, odor, dust or
noise are not discernable from outside of the building in which it is located.
Distribution and deliveries can occur from general consumer delivery services or
limited commercial truck access. Examples include research labs or facilities, small
electronics or computer assembly and manufacturing, furniture assembly.
Neighborhood retail. Small scale, commercial center engaged in the sale of household
merchandise and general consumer products and typically involving between two
thousand (2,000) and five thousand (5,000) square feet of gross leasable area.

sketch plans and development plans in accordance with the procedures and criteria for the
"C-P" District and Chapter 400, Article XI, Review and Approval Procedures.
Development Pattern And Structure.
Block Size. The block size defines the pattern and compactness of development and
encourages walkability where the blocks are small.
Small block. Blocks of 2.5 to 4 net acres in size.
Medium block. Blocks of 4 to 6 net acres in size.
Large block. Blocks 6 to 10 acres; larger only as limited exceptions or where internal
access streets within the block mimic the A-street, B-street or C-street connections.
Street type/streetscape. The street type and streetscape design define the street network that
shapes the public realm, and transitions and differences in street types help define distinct
places.
A-street. "A-streets" prioritize pedestrian activity and create value for buildings and
business that front directly on them. In general "A-streets" shall have the following design
features: Wide sidewalks (twelve (12) feet to twenty (20) feet); on-street Parking (eight
(8) feet parallel or eighteen (18) feet angled); slow speeds (below twenty (20) mph)
target) and narrow travel lanes ten (10) feet; frequent street trees planted in tree wells
within sidewalks (twenty-five (25) feet to forty (40) feet on center); seating area and other
public amenities along the sidewalk or associated with businesses; and frequent crosswalks
in association with short blocks.
B-street. "B-streets" have a balance between all modes of transportation (cars,
pedestrians, bicycles and transit) and promote access and connections to key places. In
general, "B-streets" shall have the following design features: Sidewalks (six (6) feet to ten
(10) feet); on-street parking (eight (8) feet parallel were appropriate); moderate speeds
(twenty (20) to thirty (30) mph) and travel lanes ten (10) feet to eleven (11) feet; bicycle
lanes where appropriate; and a landscape buffer six (6) feet to ten (10) feet with street
trees between the street and sidewalk (or in tree wells if on-street parking provides the
buffer between vehicles and pedestrians).
C-street. "C-streets" provide access throughout the areas, and support important land
uses that require a higher degree of vehicle access and connections. Due to the difficult
site designs and compromised streetscapes that result, these streets are typically on
edges or secondary networks of more valuable places. In general, "C-streets" shall have
the following design features: Sidewalks (six (6) feet to ten (10) feet or trail ten (10) feet
plus(+)) where appropriate; moderate to high speeds (twenty-five (25) — forty (40) mph)
and moderate to wide travel lanes (eleven (11) feet to twelve (12) feet); and a landscape
buffer (ten (10) feet plus(+)) with street trees or landscape berms between the sidewalk
or trail and road.
Civic space/landscape. Civic space and landscape design creates an extension of the public
realm and establishes transitions between public spaces and private development. The
design of these spaces can create gathering places, establish an aesthetic character for the
area, and/or screen and buffer more intense elements of site or building designs.
Formal space. Formal spaces are primarily designed for people to gather and are
designed with a high degree of pedestrian amenity and ornamentation. These spaces are
small and strategically located, typically along important street frontages as an extension
of the public right-of-way or as a focal point of surrounding blocks. They include
landscape elements, but also have a significant amount of hardscape. Examples include
courtyards, plazas or squares.

Open space. Open spaces are primarily designed to promote an aesthetic character or
buffer or screen elements of a site from adjacent areas, and are designed with a high
degree of landscape amenity. These spaces are incorporated into sites for either
ecological or aesthetic functions. Examples include buffers, berms, tree or landscape
islands, greens or any natural storm water BMP.
Campus space. Campus spaces are larger-scale and coordinated landscaped areas
designed to tie together larger and more dispersed projects into a common theme. These
spaces compliment the street network as an extension of the public realm and though
accessible to bicycles and pedestrians, include a large amount of landscape amenity
(which can be natural or formal). Examples include greens, trails and greenways, lawns
and other landscaped or garden-like amenities.
Natural area. Natural areas are landscape areas preserved or restored for their natural or
ecological function. These spaces are located based on inherent opportunity of the site
but become an organizing element and amenity for surrounding development patterns.
Examples include greenways, stream buffers, forested areas, or any natural storm water
BMP.
Uses.
Scale of use.
Small scale. Uses that require less than five thousand (5,000) square feet of space.
Medium scale. Uses that require between five thousand (5,000) square feet and sixty
thousand (60,000) square feet of space.
Large scale. Uses that require more than sixty thousand (60,000) square feet of space.
Mix of uses.
Retail. Use category is for businesses engaged in the exchange of merchandise for
general consumers, and nature of the exchange generally requires frequent interactions
with the clients, customers or patrons on the premises, where lots or buildings are
primarily designed for exposure to the public-at-large.
Services. Service uses include businesses engaged in the exchange of professional
skills, advice, personal care or other resources, and the nature of the exchange generally
requires frequent interactions with the clients, customers or patrons on the premises, and
where lots or buildings may require access or exposure to the public-at-large.
Employment. Employment uses include businesses engaged in administrative, clerical,
professional operations and support, and light industrial/manufacturing where products or
services are of the nature that generally, when compared to retail uses, do not require
daily on premise interactions with the clients, customers or patrons, and where lots and
buildings are not primarily designed to maximize exposure to the public-at-large.
Operations may require commercial vehicle access for distribution and deliveries.
Civic. Civic uses include uses serving a broad and general public and community interest
to enhance daily cultural, social or recreation opportunities for area landowners and
residents. Civic uses may include uses that are public and accessible to all citizens;
common and accessible by rights associated with ownership; or private and accessible
by membership or general association.
Residential. Residential uses include all types of dwelling units used for permanent
residence, including a variety of lot types, building types, and unit types, that may vary in
the kind and classes of buildings based on the character of the neighborhood.

D. Site Design.
Building type/orientation.
Small footprint. Small footprint buildings allow for compact development patterns that add
vitality by placing a larger amount and wider variety of uses within close proximity to a
key destination. In general, small-footprint buildings are no greater than three thousand
(3,000) square feet (footprint), however a series of these buildings may be joined by
common walls along a block face.
Large footprint. Larger footprint buildings accommodate destination uses. However due
to the larger impact and difficult site design and building access and orientation
challenges, these buildings need to be carefully sited to not disrupt urban design and
development patterns of nearby areas. In general, large-footprint buildings are typically
single story (or extended single story) and greater than fifty thousand (50,000) square
feet.
Street front. Street-front building orientation over-rides conventional setbacks and places
the building along the front lot line. This helps define the public realm and streetscape as
important space, and adds activity and vitality to the streetscape with pedestrian activity.
In general, Street-front building orientation includes the following design features: Front
"build-to" line (zero (0) feet to (10) feet); Building frontage on at least eighty percent
(80%) of the lot frontage/"build-to" line, except that up to fifty percent (50%) may be set
back to provide outside civic space along the frontage; and Building orientation to the
street (front entrance features and active street level uses).
Enhanced facade. Enhanced Facades create quality and visual interest along the
building frontage and typically accompanies Street-front building orientation. In general,
enhanced facade design includes: Primary entrances (one (1) entrance at least every fifty
(50) linear feet); transparency (at least seventy percent (70%) windows between two (2)
feet and ten (10) feet from street level; twenty-five percent (25%) to forty percent (40%)
on each story above street level); limited blank wall space (walls with no windows and
doors - no more than thirty (30) linear feet and six hundred (600) square feet); pedestrian
scale ornamentation and details - especially associated with primary entrances or to
animate blank wall space.
Building materials. All building shall be constructed according to the following materials
standards. Material use by category, primary, secondary or trim/accent, as identified in Table
D-2, will be dependent on the place type identified in Subsection (A)(2) and in accordance
with the percentage specified in Subsections (D)(2)(a) through (D)(2)(d).

Building Type/Orientation.
Small footprint: Small footprint buildings allow for compact development patterns that add
vitality by placing a larger amount and wider variety of uses within close proximity to a
key destination. In general, small-footprint buildings are no greater than three thousand
(3,000) square feet (footprint), however a series of these buildings may be joined by
common walls along a block face.
Medium footprint: Medium footprint buildings allow for a modest scale of development to
support adjacent walkable areas and as a transition between intensive large-scale
commercial uses and neighborhoods within a community. In general, medium-footprint
buildings are between five thousand (5,000) square feet and thirty thousand (30,000)
square feet per floor. These buildings are typically single story but, in some cases, can be
multiple stories.
Large footprint: Larger-footprint buildings accommodate destination uses. However, due
to the larger impact and difficult site design and building access and orientation
challenges, these buildings need to be carefully sited to not disrupt urban design and
development patterns of nearby areas. In general, large-footprint buildings are typically
single story (or extended single story) and greater than fifty thousand (50,000) square
feet.
Street front: Street-front building orientation overrides conventional setbacks and places
the building along the front lot line. This helps define the public realm and streetscape as
important space, and adds activity and vitality to the streetscape with pedestrian activity.
In general, street-front building orientation includes the following design features: front
build-to line [zero (0) feet to ten (10) feet] building frontage on at least eighty percent
(80%) of the lot frontage/build-to line, except that up to fifty percent (50%) may be set
back to provide outside civic space along the frontage; and building orientation to the
street (front entrance features and active street level uses).
Enhanced facade: Enhanced facades create quality and visual interest along the building
frontage and typically accompany street-front building orientation. In general, enhanced
facade design includes primary entrances [1 entrance at least every fifty (50) linear feet];
transparency [at least seventy percent (70%) windows between two (2) feet and ten (10)
feet from street level; twenty-five percent (25%) to forty percent (40%) on each story
above street level]; limited blank wall space [walls with no windows and doors: no more
than thirty (30) linear feat and six hundred (600) square feet]; pedestrian-scale
ornamentation and details, especially associated with primary entrances or to animate
any blank-wall space.
Building Materials. All buildings shall be constructed according to the following materials
standards. Material use by category, primary, secondary or trim/accent as identified in Table
D-2, will be dependent on the place type identified in Subsection (A)(2) and in accordance
with the percentage specified in Subsection D(2)(a) through (D)(2)(c).

Section 400.500. Approved Land Uses and Specific Exclusions.
[Ord. No. 03032014A §XII, 3-3-2014]
The presumption established by this Chapter is that all legitimate uses of land are approved within
at least one (1) zoning district in the City limits. Therefore, because the list of approved uses set
forth in Section 400.502 (Approved Land Use Table) cannot be all inclusive, those uses that are
listed shall be interpreted by the City Planner to include similar uses that have similar impacts to
the uses listed.
Notwithstanding Subsection (A) of this Section, all uses that are not listed in Section 400.502
(Approved Land Use Table), even given the interpretation mandated by Subsection (A) of this
Section, are prohibited. Nor shall Section 400.502 (Approved Land Use Table) be interpreted to
allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another
specified use that is approved in other zoning districts.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are specifically
prohibited in all districts:
Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale, distribution, or storage of any highly
combustible or explosive materials in violation of the City's Fire Prevention Code.
Stockyards, slaughterhouses, and rendering plants.
Use of a travel trailer as a temporary or permanent residence.
Section 400.501. Use of Designations "P," "SP," and/or "-" in
Approved Land Use Table.
[Ord. No. 03032014A §XIII, 3-3-2014]
Permitted Uses. Uses identified with a "P" in the Approved Land Use Table, Section 400.502, are
permitted in each respective district, provided that uses comply with all other applicable standards
of this Chapter. No building or premises improved or unimproved shall be used, and no building
shall be hereafter erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered, except for a
purpose permitted in the district in which the building or land use is located as shown in the
Approved Land Use Table, Section 400.502, except for:
Uses lawfully established prior to the effective date of this Zoning Chapter or in accordance
with Chapter 400, Article X, Non-Conformities, of this Chapter.
Special uses allowed in accordance with Chapter 400, Article V, Special Permits.
Special Uses. Uses identified with an "SP" in the Approved Land Use Table, Section 400.502, are
considered special uses and may be permitted in the subject district only after review and
approval by the Board of Aldermen in accordance with Chapter 400, Article V, Special Permits, of
this Code.
Prohibited Uses. Uses identified with a "-" in the Approved Land Use Table, Section 400.502, are
expressly prohibited in the subject district. Uses that are not listed may also be prohibited;
determination of whether an unlisted use may be permitted shall be made by the City Planner in
accordance with Chapter 400, Article XII, Administration and Enforcement, of this Code.

or uses designated in this code as permitted special uses or any other use which is determined to
be reasonably similar in character and intensity to other uses allowed in a district and that meets
the general intent of the district and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. Such permitted special
uses shall be restricted to the particular district or districts wherein listed within this code.
The Board shall impose such conditions as are appropriate and necessary to ensure compliance
with the Comprehensive Plan and protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public in
the issuance of any such special permits.
The Board may modify the minimum regulations of the district in which the permitted special use is
located or modify the required design standard for the proposed use and may attach specific
conditions for approval of the special permit, provided the public welfare and interest of the City
and surrounding area are protected and the general interest and spirit of these regulations are
preserved.
Unless expressly modified by the terms of the special permit, all regulations of the district in which
the permitted special use is located shall apply.
Section 400.580. Sketch Plan Materials.
[Ord. No. 111808 §1(400-502), 11-18-2008]
A sketch plan of the proposed special permit shall be presented to the City Planner at the time of

[Ord. No. 111808 §1(400-602), 11-18-2008; Ord. No. 03052018, 3-5-2018]
In subdividing property, the subdivider shall give consideration to dedicating suitable areas for
schools, parks, playgrounds, fire stations, libraries and other common areas for public use in
conformance with the Comprehensive Plan. Areas to be dedicated shall be shown on the
preliminary and final plats.
Since lands for recreation and educational purposes need to be acquired in areas of expansion of
the City, all subdividers shall be required to dedicate appropriate land area within their subdivision
or may submit a cash donation in lieu of the dedication. In subdivisions that are primarily
residential in nature, the preferences shall be for park land to be dedicated; in subdivisions that
are primarily commercial or industrial in nature, the preference shall be to obtain a cash donation.
The decision to accept either land or cash donation shall be by recommendation of the Park
Director to the Planning Commission. A dedication of land shall be by plat and deeded to a
homeowners' association or the City of Peculiar, Missouri. The dedication shall be a condition of
approval of the final plat. A cash donation shall be paid at the time a building permit is issued.
Subdividers who dedicate open space for park land pursuant to this Article shall dedicate park
land in an amount consistent with the recommendation of the National Recreation and Park
Association (NRPA) based upon the type of park facility needed at a particular location and
the development needs of a neighborhood or community park, including, but not limited to,
such amenities as play equipment, athletic areas such as baseball/softball diamonds,
soccer/football fields, volleyball courts, hard surface areas such as tennis courts, basketball
courts, skateboard and in-line skating rinks, picnic areas, walk/trail systems, restrooms,
natural areas, open spaces and buffer zones. Suggested facility development standards and
recommended standards for local developed open space, published by NRPA, combined with
the ratio of park size to population in the City of Peculiar, shall be used to determine actual
dedicated acreage requirements. For purposes of determining population and determining the
average number of occupants per dwelling unit, the average household size for the City of
Peculiar as reported in the most recent decennial census of the average number of persons
expected to live in a dwelling unit within a single- or multiple-family subdivision or
development shall be multiplied times the number of dwelling units proposed within a
subdivision.
When a cash donation is accepted in lieu of park land dedication, such donation shall equal
three hundred dollars ($300.00) per dwelling unit and seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00)
per acre of commercial and industrial land within the subdivision. All cash in lieu of property
shall be deposited in a special park acquisition and development fund as established by the
Board of Aldermen.
The Park Director may reject proposed lands which are not suitable for park use. The City will
consider, but is not limited to, the following criteria in determining whether the proposed dedication
of land is of sufficient size, character and quality:
The area proposed for park land dedication may be located either within or outside the
boundary of the subdivision, but must either be adjacent to an existing or proposed City park
site or within the same service area in which the subdivision is located. Park service area is
considered to be within one-half (1/2) mile of the subdivision for which it is considered.
The area proposed for park land dedication shall have characteristics, such as topography,
vegetation and geology and location, which make it suitable for future inclusion into the City
parks system.
The area proposed for park land dedication may contain valuable or sensitive environmental
features, the preservation of which conforms to the Comprehensive Plan.

Section 400.740. Location.
[Ord. No. 111808 §1(400-603), 11-18-2008]
All off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the principal use which they
serve, except that when in an office, commercial or industrial district a greater number of parking
spaces are required due to an enlargement, alteration or change of use, the required off-street
parking spaces may be located off site, provided they are located within three hundred (300) feet
of the principal use.
Parking spaces shall have direct access to a street or alley, except as otherwise provided herein.
Section 400.750. Joint Parking Facilities.
[Ord. No. 111808 §1(400-604), 11-18-2008]
Notwithstanding any other parking requirements provided in this code, when different land uses
occupy the same lot in a non-residential district, the total number of off-street parking spaces
required for each use may be combined and shared as provided herein. A proposal for sharing offstreet
parking shall be submitted to the City Planner for review. Special uses for which shared
parking is being proposed shall have shared parking approved as part of the special permit.
In determining the total off-street parking requirement for shared parking facilities, the following
guidelines shall be followed:
For each applicable general land use category, calculate the number of spaces required for a
use as if it were the only use, based upon the parking requirements of this code;
Use the figures for each individual land use to calculate the number of spaces required for
that land use for each time period specified in the table;
For each time period, add the number of spaces required for all applicable land uses to obtain
a grand total for each time period; then
Select the time period with the highest total parking requirement and use that as the total
number of parking spaces required for the site on a shared parking basis.
Where a use is not listed, the City Planner shall determine the appropriate required parking for
each time period.

Section 400.1050. Landscaping and Screening.
[Ord. No. 111808 §1(400-800.4), 11-18-2008]
Intent. The landscaping and screening requirements for commercial and industrial developments
are intended to preserve and enhance property values by ensuring that yards, open spaces,
parking lots and areas located next to public rights-of-way and residential uses are constructed
and maintained with plants and landscape materials.
Application And Scope. No new structure, building or parking lot shall be constructed unless it
complies with the landscaping and screening standards of this Section.
Definitions. As used in this Section, the following terms shall have these following meaning:
BENEFITTED USE
The use from which the burdened use is screened generally the existing structure, site and
development.
BURDENED USE
The use which must provide the required screening, generally the new construction and/or
development.
LANDSCAPED
An area devoted to or developed predominately with plant material or natural landscape
features, including lawn, ground cover, gardens, trees, shrubs and other plant materials.
SCREENED
Shielded, concealed and effectively hidden from view by a person standing at ground level on
an abutting site or outside the area or feature so screened, by a fence, wall, hedge, berm or
similar architectural or landscaped feature.
Site Landscaping Requirements. All new commercial and industrial developments shall provide
and maintain a landscaped area as follows:
The subdivider shall provide and maintain a landscaped area that equals or exceeds ten
percent (10%) of the total subdivision area. The following areas shall be provided as
landscaped area and may be utilized in conjunction with the screening requirements as set
forth herein:
A minimum landscaped area of ten (10) feet in width along all street frontages; and
A minimum landscaped area of ten (10) feet in width along all perimeter property lines.
No more than twenty percent (20%) of the total landscaped area may consist of porous
non-living materials.
For all buildings which equal or exceed ten thousand (10,000) square feet of building
coverage, there shall be provided for each ten thousand (10,000) square feet of building
coverage, three (3) deciduous shade trees and four hundred (400) square feet of ornamental
grasses or shrub coverage. Ornamental trees may be used in lieu of deciduous shade trees,

but are only credited as one-half (½) of a deciduous shade tree. For example, for buildings
which are between ten thousand (10,000) and nineteen thousand nine hundred ninety-nine
(19,999) square feet in building coverage, three (3) trees and four hundred (400) square feet
of ornamental grasses or shrubs would be required; whereas for buildings which are between
twenty thousand (20,000) and twenty-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine (29,999)
square feet of building coverage, six (6) trees and eight hundred (800) square feet of
ornamental grasses or shrubs would be required.
Site Screening Requirements. Where commercial or industrial uses are located adjacent to
residential uses, said uses shall be screened according to the following:
Types of screens.
A — Opaque screen. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six
(6) feet with intermittent visual obstructions extending from the opaque portion to a height
of at least twelve (12) feet. The opaque screen is intended to exclude all visual contact
between uses and to create a strong impression of special separation. The opaque
portion may be composed of a wall, fence or landscaped earth berm or combination
thereof. Planted or natural vegetation screens will be judged on the basis of the average
mature height and density of foliage of the species or field observation of existing
vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year.
At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions shall not contain any completely
unobstructed openings more than ten (10) feet wide. The portion of the intermittent visual
obstructions may contain deciduous plants. Planting areas for the placement of these
screens shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width.
B — Semi-opaque screen. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three
(3) feet with intermittent visual obstruction extending from the opaque portion to a height
of at least twelve (12) feet. The opaque portion may be composed of a wall, fence,
landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation or existing vegetation. Planted vegetative
screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height
and density of foliage of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation. At
maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions shall not contain any completely
unobstructed openings more than ten (10) feet wide. The zone of intermittent visual
obstruction may contain deciduous plants. Planting areas for the placement of these
screens shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width.
C — Broken screen. A screen composed of intermittent visual obstruction from the
ground to a height of at least twelve (12) feet. The broken screen is intended to create
the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact
between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm,
planted vegetation or existing vegetation. Planted vegetative screens or natural
vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage
of the subject species or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen may contain
deciduous plants. Planting areas for the placement of these screens shall be a minimum
of five (5) feet in width.
Screening locations. Screening shall be required along the common lot line(s) of adjacent
uses and wholly located on the burdened use property. Where uses are separated by an
intervening right-of-way, the burdened use must screen along the adjoining right-of-way. A
new burdened use is not required to provide screening to an adjacent use within the same or
more intense commercial or industrial zoning district. However, a new burdened use is
required to provide screening to an adjacent use within a residential or less intense
commercial or industrial zoning district.

ARTICLE IX. Signs
Section 400.1760. Purpose and Intent.
[Ord. No. 111808 §1(400-901), 11-18-2008]
The Board of Aldermen finds:
An excess of large, intense signs causes a visual blight on the character of the City of
Peculiar. This visual blight adversely affects the aesthetic quality of life and traffic safety for
residents, businesses, pedestrians and drivers. In order to promote the appearance of the
City, while protecting the rights of sign owners to expression and identification, the regulation
of existing and proposed signs is necessary to protect the public health, safety and general
welfare.

The purpose of this Article is to encourage signs which are integrated with and harmonious to
the buildings and sites which they occupy, to eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays,
to preserve and improve the appearance of the City as a place in which to live and to work
and as an attraction to non-residents who come to visit and to restrict signs which increase
the probability of accidents by distracting attention or obstructing vision.
This Article provides minimum standards to safeguard life, safety, property and public welfare
by regulating the size, height, construction, location, electrification, operation and
maintenance of all signs and sign structures exposed to public view within the City. The
pleasing visual appearance and traffic safety of the City cannot be preserved and achieved by
measures less restrictive than the procedures and standards of this Article.

Section 400.2420. Procedure For Zoning Map Snd Text
Amendments.
[Ord. No. 11062017A, 11-6-2017]
Planning Commission Public Hearing. All proposed text and map amendments must be submitted
to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation. The Planning Commission must
hold a public hearing on the application. The public hearing must be held at the next regular
meeting of the Planning Commission for which the application may be scheduled given public
notice deadlines, unless the applicant has consented to an extension of this time period. The City
Planner or other appointed official as designated by the Planning Commission must give written
notice of the hearing and prepare a written summary of the proceedings.
Planning Commission Recommendation Upon conclusion of the public hearing, the Planning
Commission will submit a recommendation to the Board of Aldermen to approve, approve with
modifications or deny the proposed amendment. If no majority vote of the full membership of the
Planning Commission can be obtained on a recommendation to be made, the application will be
forwarded to the Board of Aldermen with no recommendation. The Planning Commission must
submit its recommendation along with a record of the public hearing thereon, to the Board of
Aldermen. The Planning Commission may include reasonable conditions as a part of its
recommendations.
Board Of Aldermen Action.
The Board of Aldermen must consider the request for an amendment within sixty (60) days of
receipt of written recommendation of the Planning Commission.
After holding a public hearing on the proposed amendment and before making its final
decision, the Board of Aldermen may refer the application back to the Planning Commission
for additional study for a period no greater than forty-five (45) days. In this event, no additional
public hearing is required.
Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission and any protest petitions
that have been submitted, the Board of Aldermen must consider the application and may take
final action to approve or deny it. The Board of Aldermen may either affirm, or not affirm, the
recommendations of the Planning Commission. In the event the Board of Aldermen does not
affirm the Planning Commission recommendations on an application for map amendment,
then such change may only be approved with a favorable vote of five (5) out of the six (6)
voting members of the Board of Aldermen.
If final action is not taken by the Board of Aldermen within one hundred twenty (120) days
after the recommendation of the Planning Commission is submitted to it, the proposed
amendment will be deemed to have been defeated and denied, unless the applicant has
consented to an extension of this time period. Whenever a proposed amendment is defeated,
either by vote of the Board of Aldermen or by inaction described in this Section, such
amendment cannot be passed without another public hearing that is noticed in accordance
with this Chapter.
If the Board of Aldermen approves an application, it will adopt an ordinance to that effect. If
the Official Zoning Map has been changed the amending ordinance will define the change or

Section 400.2430. Findings Of Fact.
[Ord. No. 11062017A, 11-6-2017]
Findings Of Fact For Map Amendments (Rezoning). In their deliberation of a request, the Planning
Commission and Board of Aldermen may give consideration to the criteria stated below, to the
extent they are pertinent to the particular application:
The character of the surrounding neighborhood, including the existing uses and zoning
classification of properties near the subject property;
The physical character of the area in which the property is located;
Consistency with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan and other plans, codes
and ordinances of the City of Peculiar;
Suitability of the subject property for the uses permitted under the existing and proposed
zoning districts;
The trend of development near the subject property, including changes that have taken place
in the area since the subject property was placed in its current zoning district;
The extent to which the zoning amendment may detrimentally affect nearby property;
Whether public facilities (infrastructure) and services will be adequate to serve development
allowed by the requested zoning map amendment;
The suitability of the property for the uses to which it has been restricted under the existing
zoning regulations;
The length of time (if any) the property has remained vacant as zoned;
Whether the proposed zoning map amendment is in the public interest and is not solely in the
interests of the applicant; and
The gain, if any, to the public health, safety and welfare due to denial of the application, as
compared to the hardship imposed upon the landowner, if any, as a result of denial of the
application.
The Planning Commission and the Board of Aldermen may also consider other factors that
may be relevant to a particular application.
Findings Of Fact For Text Amendment. In their deliberation of a request, the Planning Commission
and Board of Aldermen may take into consideration the following:
Whether such change is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Comprehensive Plan
and plans adopted by the City of Peculiar;
Whether the proposed text amendment corrects an error or inconsistency in the Code;
The areas which are most likely to be directly affected by such change and in what way they
will be affected;

C.
Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or changing
conditions in the areas and/or zoning districts affected by it; and
Whether the proposed text amendment is in the best interests of the City as a whole.
Protest. In the event that a protest petition against any application for a zoning map amendment is
presented to the City Clerk prior to the date scheduled for the Board of Aldermen to take action
and is properly signed and notarized by the deeded owners of thirty percent (30%) or more of the
areas of the land (exclusive of streets and alleys) included in such proposed change or within an
area determined by lines drawn parallel to and three hundred (300) feet distant from the
boundaries of the district proposed to be changed, such amendment will not become effective
except by the favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all the members of the Board of Aldermen.

such locations and widths as determined by the City Engineer and in conformance with the
requirements of Chapter 415 of the Peculiar Municipal Code. The width of easements required for
public wastewater collectors, storm drains and/or water mains shall be as specified by the City
Engineer for the particular improvement.
[Ord. No. 11042013 §XI, 11-4-2013]
It is the policy of the City to locate all necessary utilities in the right-of-way or in easements
abutting rear or side lot lines. Deviations from this policy may be made by the City Engineer when
it is demonstrated that the utility is necessary and no practical alternative locations exist.
Easements shall be provided along each side of a stream, watercourse or river for the purpose of
preserving area designated for compensatory storage in the floodplain or a flood-prone area or for
establishing a minimum flood corridor or a surface drainage course along that stream,
watercourse or river when the area adjacent thereto is being subdivided; such easements shall be
of a width deemed necessary by the City Engineer. The easement is for the purpose of widening,
deepening, sloping, improving, cleaning or protecting the stream, watercourse or river for drainage
purposes. Said easement shall be provided in appropriate locations as determined by the City
Engineer for the purpose of permitting the flow and storage of floodwater. Minimum flood corridors
shall be preserved and dedicated along drainage ways which have a defined bed and bank or
drain an area equal to or greater than one hundred fifty (150) acres for purposes of preserving
riparian vegetation and preventing encroachment within the corridors by buildings, fill or
structures; provided however, that minor encroachments within the corridors may be permitted by
the City Engineer.
In any dedication of an easement, the City may prohibit or restrict buildings, fences, driveways and
other improvements; may enter for construction, reconstruction, replacement, repair, operation
and maintenance purposes; and will be held harmless for the cost of replacement or damage to
any improvement or vegetation within the easement and may make any other appropriate or
necessary requirements.
Section 405.700. Blocks.
[Ord. No. 111808 §1(405-500.10), 11-18-2008]
The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
Provision of adequate building sites for the type of use contemplated,
Requirements as to lot size and dimensions,
Convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic, and
Limitations and opportunities of topography.
Block lengths shall not exceed one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet between crossstreets
except where a major street forms one (1) boundary of the block. The City Planner may
allow longer block lengths when substantially different zoning districts or land uses form one (1)
boundary of the block.
In cases where the block length exceeds six hundred (600) feet or where needed to provide
pedestrian circulation, an easement dedicated to the City for pedestrian access shall be provided
of not less than ten (10) feet in width.
Section 405.710. Lots.

Minimum lot width shall be measured at the required building setback line; however, in no case
shall the lot width be less than that required by the zoning district in which the lot is located.
Further, the lot width at the front property line shall be at least thirty-eight (38) feet.
[Ord. No. 11062017, 11-6-2017]
The lot shape and orientation shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the
type of development and use contemplated. Lots shall be designed to provide satisfactory and
desirable building sites properly related to topography and the character of the surrounding
development.
Every lot shall front upon and have direct access to a public or private street.
Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide
separation of residential development from major streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation. In circumstances where the subdivision abuts a major street, double
frontage lots may be permitted when no frontage road exists adjacent to or abutting on the major
street and access from the lot is only to the local street. Where double frontage lots are allowed,
the subdivider, the subdivider's successors and assigns shall relinquish the right of access from
the lot to the major street and place covenants and restrictions upon the land to run with the land
relinquishing said access as approved by the City Attorney.
A lot used for commercial, industrial, business or non-residential purposes with at least six
hundred sixty (660) linear feet of frontage on a major street may have access to the major street
only if a safe access point is available and approved by the City Engineer. If a safe access point is
not available or if said lot does not have the required linear feet of frontage, a frontage road
abutting the major street constructed to a width approved by the City Engineer shall be dedicated
to provide access to said lot. However, where a lot is subdivided such that the lot does not have
six hundred sixty (660) linear feet of frontage or the distance between cross-streets is less than six
hundred sixty (660) linear feet, this requirement may be waived by the City Engineer if safe access
to the major street can be provided.
The minimum depth of lots in a residential district shall be ninety (90) feet.
The maximum depth of lots in commercial or industrial districts which have a minimum width of
one hundred (100) feet shall be five (5) times their width. The maximum depth of all other lots shall
be three (3) times their width. An existing lot that does not meet the lot width-to-depth ratio may be
subdivided so as to increase the lot's width, decrease its depth or both, even though such lot does
not thereafter comply with the width-to-depth ratio.
Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to street lines or radial if the street is curved.
Residential corner lots shall be wider than other residential lots to the extent necessary to permit
the establishment of front yards along both of the abutting streets. Corner lots fronting on major
street intersections and other acute angle intersections which are likely to be dangerous to traffic
movement shall have a curved line radius of twenty (20) feet at the street corner.
Residential lots proposed to be made servient to pedestrian way easements and adjacent
residential lots shall be of sufficient width to provide the additional required setback between the
residence and the pedestrian way, plus the width of the pedestrian way easement.
Section 405.720. Underground Utilities.
[Ord. No. 111808 §1(405-500.12), 11-18-2008]
All utilities, including electrical distribution systems, communications systems, cable television systems
and street lighting distribution systems, shall be placed underground throughout the subdivision, if
compatible with then-existing feeder and distribution systems servicing or located on the subdivision.

[Ord. No. 111808 §1(405-500.13), 11-18-2008; Ord. No. 03052018, 3-5-2018]
In subdividing property, the subdivider shall give consideration to dedicating suitable areas for
schools, parks, playgrounds, fire stations, libraries and other common areas for public use in
conformance with the Comprehensive Plan. Areas to be dedicated shall be shown on the
preliminary and final plats.
Since lands for recreation and educational purposes need to be acquired in areas of expansion of
the City, all subdividers shall be required to dedicate appropriate land area within their subdivision
or may submit a cash donation in lieu of the dedication. In subdivisions that are primarily
residential in nature, the preferences shall be for park land to be dedicated; in subdivisions that
are primarily commercial or industrial in nature, the preference shall be to obtain a cash donation.
The decision to accept either land or cash donation shall be by recommendation of the Park
Director to the Planning Commission. A dedication of land shall be by plat and deeded to a
homeowners' association or the City of Peculiar, Missouri. The dedication shall be a condition of
approval of the final plat. A cash donation shall be paid at the time a building permit is issued.
Subdividers who dedicate open space for park land pursuant to this Article shall dedicate park
land in an amount consistent with the recommendation of the National Recreation and Park
Association (NRPA) based upon the type of park facility needed at a particular location and
the development needs of a neighborhood or community park, including, but not limited to,
such amenities as play equipment, athletic areas such as baseball/softball diamonds,
soccer/football fields, volleyball courts, hard surface areas such as tennis courts, basketball
courts, skateboard and in-line skating rinks, picnic areas, walk/trail systems, restrooms,
natural areas, open spaces and buffer zones. Suggested facility development standards and
recommended standards for local developed open space, published by NRPA, combined with
the ratio of park size to population in the City of Peculiar, shall be used to determine actual
dedicated acreage requirements. For purposes of determining population and determining the
average number of occupants per dwelling unit, the average household size for the City of
Peculiar as reported in the most recent decennial census of the average number of persons
expected to live in a dwelling unit within a single- or multiple-family subdivision or
development shall be multiplied times the number of dwelling units proposed within a
subdivision.
When a cash donation is accepted in lieu of park land dedication, such donation shall equal
three hundred dollars ($300.00) per dwelling unit and seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00)
per acre of commercial and industrial land within the subdivision. All cash in lieu of property
shall be deposited in a special park acquisition and development fund as established by the
Board of Aldermen.
The Park Director may reject proposed lands which are not suitable for park use. The City will
consider, but is not limited to, the following criteria in determining whether the proposed dedication
of land is of sufficient size, character and quality:
The area proposed for park land dedication may be located either within or outside the
boundary of the subdivision, but must either be adjacent to an existing or proposed City park
site or within the same service area in which the subdivision is located. Park service area is
considered to be within one-half (1/2) mile of the subdivision for which it is considered.
The area proposed for park land dedication shall have characteristics, such as topography,
vegetation and geology and location, which make it suitable for future inclusion into the City
parks system.
The area proposed for park land dedication may contain valuable or sensitive environmental
features, the preservation of which conforms to the Comprehensive Plan.

Section 405.740. Maintenance of Common Facilities.
[Ord. No. 111808 §1(405-500.14), 11-18-2008; Ord. No. 11042013 §XII, 11-4-2013]
Where the subdivision contains sewers, sewage treatment plants, water supply systems, park areas,
street trees, streets, street lighting, recreational facilities, stormwater drainage and storage facilities or
other physical facilities ("private improvements") on parcels which are necessary or desirable for the
welfare of the area and which are of common use or benefit and which the City does not maintain, the
subdivider shall be responsible for the proper maintenance and supervision of the parcels and private
improvements on a permanent and continuous basis and shall retain ownership of or the right of entry
to the parcels in order to maintain the parcels and private improvements on said permanent and
continuous basis. However, the subdivider may be relieved and discharged of this maintenance
obligation upon creating, in writing, a permanent continuous association of property owners who would
be responsible for said maintenance obligation, provided that all such maintenance agreements are
incorporated in covenants and restrictions in deeds to the subdivided property and the documents
creating the association and the restrictive covenants have been reviewed and approved by the City
Attorney and filed of record with the Cass County Recorder of Deeds. Notwithstanding the above, the
subdivider shall not be relieved of this maintenance obligation for each specific private improvement
until the registered professional engineer or nurseryman who supervised installation of said private
improvement has certified to the City that the improvement has been installed in accordance with the
approved plans and relevant standards. Stormwater management facilities shall be subject to the
maintenance requirements of Chapter 415 of the Peculiar Municipal Code.
Section 405.750. Anti-Monotony Standards.
[Ord. No. 12192016B § I, 12-19-2016]
Purpose. The following standards shall apply to all construction of new single-family residential
dwellings to discourage excessive similarity, in order to protect and enhance property values and
promote the easy identification of houses. The following standards shall apply after the effective
date of this Section.
Abutting Lots. No residential dwelling of excessive similarity to another shall be erected within two
(2) lots abutting, across the street from, or across the street from two (2) lots abutting, a lot with a
residential dwelling of the same exterior design or appearance, or with identical front elevations. A
lot shall be considered across the street if the lots have a common frontage to the same street.
Spacing. In each subdivision of five (5) lots or more, each residential dwelling erected must be
located within at least one (1) group of five (5) adjoining lots where no structure of excessive
similarity exists.
Distinguishing Characteristics. For the purpose of this Section, the term "excessive similarity" shall
mean a dwelling which is identical, or nearly identical, to another in an accumulation of five (5) of
the following seven (7) characteristics:
Roof type, for example, but not limited to gable, hip, mansard, gambrel, flat or combination.
Roof height.

Section 405.800. General Considerations.
[Ord. No. 111808 §1(405-501.1), 11-18-2008]
Subdividers shall give due consideration to the desirability of providing or reserving areas for facilities
normally required in residential areas, including churches, libraries, schools and other public buildings;
parks, playgrounds and playfields; public access to water frontage; shopping and local neighborhood
business centers. Consideration shall be given to the preservation of all natural features such as
mature trees, watercourses, scenic points and historical points that enhance the public interest and
general welfare. The Board of Aldermen reserves the right to deny a subdivision that fails to address
these considerations.
Section 405.810. Sidewalks.
[Ord. No. 111808 §1(405-501.2), 11-18-2008]
On residential streets, within the boundaries of a single-family subdivision, sidewalks may be
constructed on one (1) side of the street if the density is two (2) dwelling units per gross acre or
less, excluding unimproved and/or partially improved drainage areas. On cul-de-sac streets
serving single-family developments where sidewalks are required only on one (1) side of the
street, the sidewalk need not extend around the bulb of the cul-de-sac. Duplex and multi-family
developments shall provide sidewalks on both sides of all streets.
When a sidewalk is required on one (1) side of a street, the sidewalk shall be placed on the
opposite side of the street from underground utilities lines.
On arterial streets, limited access streets, collector streets, commercial streets and industrial
streets, sidewalks shall be required on both sides of the street. City staff has the right to designate
collector streets within a subdivision.

Findings Of Fact. In support of this Chapter, the Board of Aldermen makes the following findings:
Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of
Peculiar, Missouri are subject to inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. All of these
issues adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain, which increases flood
heights and velocities; and

The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, and/or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The Flood insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards that consists of
a series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood, based upon engineering calculations, which permits a
consideration of flood factors such as expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods that are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on
the particular streams subject to this Chapter. These calculations are based upon the
general order of a flood that could be expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of
occurrence in any one (1) year, as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's
FIS and illustrative materials for Cass County dated January 2, 2013, as amended, and
any future revisions thereto.
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering
analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the
regulatory flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights
more than one (1) foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted
that would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but
still subject to inundation by the base flood.
Statement Of Purpose. This Chapter seeks to:
Promote the public health, safety, and general welfare;
To minimize the losses described in this Chapter;
To establish or maintain the City of Peculiar's eligibility for participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3);
and
To meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of
flooding; or that would cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, to be
provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.

In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A Zones and AE Zones, where base flood
elevation data has been provided as set forth in Article V, Section 410.120(B), the following
provisions are required:
Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to two (2) feet above base flood elevation. In all unnumbered and numbered A
Zones and AE Zones, FEMA Region VII recommends elevating to one (1) foot above the
base flood elevation to accommodate floodway conditions when the floodplain is fully
developed.
Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes,
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to two (2) feet above the base flood
elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that
below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this Subsection are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas
below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area
other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect, or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings

[Ord. No. 12032012 §III, 12-3-2012]
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article III, Section 410.020 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the
area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any
point.
The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
If Subsection (2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V.
In unnumbered A Zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or other sources as
set forth in Article V, Section 410.120(B).

Section 410.210. Conditions For Approving Floodplain
Management Variances.
[Ord. No. 12032012 §III, 12-3-2012]
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing Sections (B) through (F)
below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or the local
inventory of historic places upon determination, provided the proposed activity will not preclude
the structure's continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

Section 410.220. Conditions For Approving Variances For
Accessory Structures.
[Ord. No. 12032012 §III, 12-3-2012]
Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case-bycase
analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following
conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Sections 410.200 and 410.210 of
this Chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and
safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures
that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.
Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in
Zone A only as identified on the community's FIRM.
For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building
components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes,
flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation must be built with flood-resistant materials in
accordance with Article V, Section 410.120(D)(2) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure in accordance with Article V, Section 410.120(D)(1) of this
Chapter. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific
flood-related forces, including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact
forces.
Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood
elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed
enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with
Article V, Section 410.120(D)(4).
The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening
requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year
flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in
accordance with Article V, Section 410.130(3) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway
encroachment provisions of Article V, Section 410.150(2) of this Chapter. No variances may
be issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway, if any increase in flood
levels would result during the 100-year flood.
Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.
No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be
paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures.

or its officers and employees, of adequacy of safety of any stormwater management structure or use of
land. Nor shall the approval of a stormwater management plan and the issuance of the drainage permit
imply that land uses permitted will be free from damages caused by stormwater runoff. The degree of
protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based
on historical records, engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger storms may occur, or
stormwater runoff heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations
therefore shall not create liability on the part of the City or any officer with respect to any legislative or
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

Article IV. Provisions for Discharges
Section 420.070. Discharge Prohibitions.
[Ord. No. 11042013 §III, 11-4-2013]
Prohibition Of Illegal Discharges.
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses any materials, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other
than stormwater.
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain
system is prohibited except as described as follows:
The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this
Chapter: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn
watering, diverted stream flows, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm
drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation or footing drains (not including
active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air-conditioning
condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or
wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated—typically less than one (1) PPM
chlorine), fire-fighting activities and any other water source not containing pollutants.
Discharges specified in writing by the Public Works Department as being necessary to
protect public health and safety.
Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the Public
Works Department prior to the time of the test.
The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an

Prohibition Of Illicit Connections.
The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm
drain system is prohibited.
This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past,
regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or
prevailing at the time of connection.
A person is considered to be in violation of this Chapter if the person connects a line
conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such a connection to continue.
Section 420.080. Suspension of MS4 Access.
[Ord. No. 11042013 §III, 11-4-2013]
Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations. The Public Works Department
may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment or to the health or welfare of persons or to the MS4 or
waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the Public Works Department may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent
or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States or to minimize danger to persons.
Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in
violation of this Chapter may have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would
abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Public Works Department will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Public Works Department
for a reconsideration and hearing.
Offense Committed. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this Section without the prior approval of the Public Works
Department.
Section 420.090. Industrial or Construction Activity Discharges.
[Ord. No. 11042013 §III, 11-4-2013]
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall
comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a
form acceptable to the Public Works Department prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
Section 420.100. Monitoring of Discharges.
[Ord. No. 11042013 §III, 11-4-2013]
Applicability. This Section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with
industrial activity, including construction activity.
Access To Facilities.
The Public Works Department shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this Chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this
Chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.

Facility operators shall allow the Public Works Department ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that
must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by State and Federal law.
The Public Works Department shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Department to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
The Public Works Department has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral
request of the Public Works Department and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the operator.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the Public Works Department access to a permitted facility is
a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this Chapter. A person who is the operator
of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity
commits an offense if the person denies the Public Works Department reasonable access to
the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
Chapter.
If the Public Works Department has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe
that there may be a violation of this Chapter or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample
as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
Chapter or any order issued hereunder or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the Public Works Department may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the Cass County Circuit Court.
Article V. Pollution Prevention
Section 420.110. Requirement To Prevent, Control and Reduce
Stormwater Pollutants by Use of Best Management Practices.
[Ord. No. 11042013 §III, 11-4-2013]
The Public Works Department will adopt requirements identifying best management practices (BMPs)
for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of
stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system
or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or premises, which is or may be the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to
prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance
with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this Section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

operation or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any
known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system or water of the United States, said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify
emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Public Works Department in person or
by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be
confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the Public Works Department within three (3)
business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records
shall be retained for at least three (3) years.
Article VI. Enforcement and Abatement
Section 420.140. Enforcement.
[Ord. No. 11042013 §III, 11-4-2013]
Whenever the Public Works Department finds a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet
a requirement of this Chapter, the Department may order compliance by written notice of violation
to the responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation, any or all of the following:
The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;

after notification of costs, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and
shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment.
Section 420.170. Injunctive Relief.
[Ord. No. 11042013 §III, 11-4-2013]
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements
of this Chapter. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this Chapter, the City
may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which

position to do the work and make the installations at the cost of the owners of the property within
the subdivision. The regulations may provide for the dedication, reservation or acquisition of lands
and open spaces necessary for public uses indicated on the City Plan and for appropriate means
of providing for the compensation, including reasonable charges against the subdivision, if any,

regulations, in specific cases, in order that unwarranted hardship, which constitutes an
unreasonable deprivation of use as distinguished from the mere grant of a privilege, may be
avoided. The regulations of this Section shall not be adopted, changed or amended until a public

If no consent has been given to enter or inspect any building or premises, no entry or
inspection shall be made without the procurement of a warrant from the judge presiding in the
Peculiar Municipal Court of Cass County, or if that judge is not available, from any other judge
presiding in the Cass County 17th Judicial Circuit Court of Missouri. The court may consider
the following factors in its decision as to whether a warrant shall be issued:
Eyewitness account of violation.
Citizen complaint(s).
Tenant complaint(s).
Plain view violation(s).
Violation apparent from City record(s).
Nature of alleged violation, the threat of life or safety and imminent risk of significant
property damage.
Previous unabated violation(s) in the building or on the premises.
Cause supporting issuance of a warrant shall be deemed to exist in light of reasonable
legislative and administrative standards which show that there is reason to believe that a
condition of non-conformity exists with respect to a building or premises in violation of the
provisions of the City of Peculiar Municipal Code.
The Building Official or an authorized representative may enter the premises without consent
or a search warrant to make an inspection or enforce any of the provisions of the City of
Peculiar Municipal Code only when an emergency exists as prescribed in Section 500.0045 of
this Chapter, or when the premises are abandoned.
If a complaint, in writing, is filed by the Building Official or an authorized representative, any
police officer, deputy, City Attorney or prosecuting attorney of the City with the Municipal Court
of the City, stating that he/she has probable cause to believe there exists in a building or
structure more particularly described therein a violation or violations of provisions of the City
of Peculiar Municipal Code, and is within the territorial jurisdiction of the City, and if such
complaint is verified by the oath or affirmation stating evidential facts from which such judge
determines the existence of probable cause, then such judge shall issue a search warrant
directed to the authorized person to search the structure or premises therein described for the
purposes requested. Such search warrant may be executed and returned only within ten (10)
days after the date of its issuance. The person authorized to search shall make a return
promptly after concluding the search, and such return shall contain an itemization of all
violations of this code discovered pursuant to such search. Refusal to honor a search warrant
and permit inspection of the premises shall constitute an ordinance violation. Execution of a
search warrant under this Section shall not be by forcible entry.
Unless emergency conditions exist or until a notice of violation and a reasonable opportunity
to correct the violation is afforded the person, a summons shall not be served upon a
resident, property owner, or other responsible person, which alleges a violation of this code
based upon conditions discovered incidental to, and solely as a result of, conducting an
investigation pursuant to the authority of a search warrant, but which is not the subject of the
search warrant.

Section 520.020. Findings.
[Ord. No. 110204 §2, 11-2-2004]
The Board of Aldermen ("Board") of the City of Peculiar hereby finds and declares that:
The City is experiencing rapid population growth. It is anticipated that such rapid population
growth will continue and will result in a doubling of the population of the City.
The City is experiencing and will continue to experience a corresponding increase in the
demand on the City's capital infrastructure systems through increased volumes of traffic
utilizing the City's street network, increased sewer discharge, increased stormwater runoff,
increased water usage and other demands on public facilities and services.
The Board finds that it is appropriate for new development in the City to pay for its fair share
of public services and facilities and capital infrastructure improvements that are needed to
serve that new development.
New growth and development in the City has resulted and will continue to result in increased
usage, burden and demand on the existing capital infrastructure systems and the need for
construction of new capital infrastructure to add capacity and to complete those infrastructure
networks that are planned to support new development in the City.

of the City through all legally available revenue sources.
To the extent that new development will place additional demand upon the City's capital
infrastructure systems, that demand should be met by shifting the responsibility for financing
such facilities from the general public to the development creating the demand.
The imposition of growth improvement fees will help ensure that new development bears a
proportionate share of the cost of capital infrastructure improvements that are necessary to
accommodate new development throughout the City.
The Board finds that, based upon sound planning and engineering principles, it is appropriate
for the City to create "service areas" for the purpose of ensuring that capital infrastructure
improvements are planned within a reasonable distance from, and benefits are provided to,
the property from which growth improvement fees are paid and that a reasonable relationship
exists between the fee payer and the benefits derived from the improvements that are funded
by such fees.
The capital infrastructure improvements that are necessary to accommodate new
development in a particular service area have a rational nexus and reasonable relationship
and provide benefit to new development within each service area when new development
generates demands upon the capital infrastructure that serves such service area.
Section 520.030. Purpose and Intent.
[Ord. No. 110204 §3, 11-2-2004]
It is the intent of this Chapter to establish and implement a growth improvement fee system, for
which fees are payable prior to the time that new development generates new demands on the
City's capital infrastructure systems, in an amount reasonably related to the demands that are
generated by new development and the cost of constructing new public improvements that are
needed to serve the new development.
It is the intent of this Chapter that, by establishment of this system of calculating and imposing
growth improvement fees, new development in a particular service area will pay its pro rata share
of reasonably anticipated costs of capital infrastructure improvements that are required to serve
such new development and that the fees paid with respect to each new development are roughly
proportionate, both in nature and extent, to the demand that such new development will place on
the City's infrastructure systems.
It is the intent of this Chapter to establish an appeal procedure to allow for an individualized
determination that the growth improvement fees imposed on each new development are roughly
proportionate to the demand that the new development will place on capital infrastructure.
It is the intent of this Section that the capital infrastructure improvements which are financed
through the growth improvement fee system established hereby be based, when applicable, upon
the City's Comprehensive Plan and Capital Improvement Program.
This Chapter shall not be construed to authorize imposition of improvement fees for improvements
that are attributable to or needed to serve existing development.
This Chapter is enacted pursuant to the City's general Police powers and the authority granted to
the City pursuant to Chapter 89, RSMo., to plan for growth and development of the City and enact
zoning and subdivision regulations to provide for the coordinated development of the City, facilitate
the adequate provision of public services and facilities in the City and impose development

exactions that are reasonably related to the impacts on public services and facilities caused by
new development in the City.
It is the intent of this Section to establish a system of user's fees, as "user's fees" are interpreted
in Missouri case law, that will be used to pay for the cost of providing capital infrastructure
improvements, the demand for which is generated by new development. The amount of the user's
fee to be paid by new development is calculated to be proportionate to the demand for capital
infrastructure improvements that are necessitated by each such new development in each service
area. This Chapter is specifically designed so as not to establish a "tax" or "fee" as such terms are
used in Article X, Section 22 of the Missouri Constitution, but rather as a mechanism to equitably
shift the burden of the cost of new capital infrastructure improvements from the existing general
public to new development that will generate the need for capital infrastructure improvements that
will be constructed with funds derived from this system of improvement fees. The funds collected
from imposition of this system of user's fees are to be used to offset the cost of constructing
capital infrastructure improvements for new development. The funds collected pursuant to this
Chapter may not be paid into the City's general fund to defray customary governmental
expenditures. In addition, the system is designed so that the user's fees:
Are paid upon the approval of designated development applications and not periodically;
Are not billed to all or almost all City residents, but rather are charged to new development
only;
Are directly proportional in amount to capacity of capital infrastructure improvements
provided; and
Are based on services and improvements that the City is providing for the fees collected; and
Are for services and improvements that have not been historically provided exclusively by
monies derived from taxes.

Section 520.050. Imposition of Improvement Fees.
[Ord. No. 110204 §5, 11-2-2004]
Applicability.
This Chapter shall be applicable to each application which results in an increase in demand
for capital infrastructure improvements in the City. Any applicant who, after the effective date
of this Chapter, submits an application is hereby required to pay all improvement fees in the
manner and amounts set forth in this Chapter.
Payment of all improvement fees required by this Chapter shall be made prior to the issuance
of any permit or approval for which an application has been filed. Unless otherwise provided
in this Chapter, no application for which improvement fees are due shall be issued unless all
applicable improvement fees have been paid pursuant to this Chapter. It shall be unlawful to

issued prior to the payment of all improvements fees due pursuant to this Chapter may be
revoked by the City.
Following the lapse or expiration of an application, all applicable improvement fees shall be
calculated and imposed at the time a new application is filed.
Calculation of Improvement Fees.
For each category of capital infrastructure improvements for which an improvement fee is
established, the City shall, by ordinance, designate the applicable service units and the
applicable fee rate for each service unit. The fee rate shall be determined by dividing:

anticipated to occur within each service area by
The total projected service units associated with that category of capital infrastructure
improvements.
The improvement fee per service unit shall be established within each service area and shall
be set forth in an ordinance and made a part of this Chapter. The formula that shall be used to
calculate each improvement fee for each application shall be:
Number of Service Units x Fee Rate = Total Improvement Fee due.
The total improvement fees due shall be reduced by all applicable credits as set forth in this
Section.
Assessment and Collection.
Following an application, the Fee Administrator shall calculate the improvement fees due and
such amount shall be transmitted in writing to the applicant. The improvement fees due shall
be calculated by:
Determining the applicable improvement fees and designated service areas for such
improvement fees;
Verifying:
The number and type of residential dwelling units and/or
The gross floor area and type of non-residential development for which an
application is sought;
Determining the number of service units generated by the new development and the
applicable improvement fee per service unit; and
Multiplying the improvement fee per service unit by:
The appropriate number of residential dwelling units, and
The gross floor area of non-residential development.
If the application proposes a mix of uses, the Fee Administrator shall separately calculate the
improvement fees due for each type of development.
Following imposition of all improvement fees pursuant to this Chapter, the amount of the
improvement fees cannot be increased unless such improvement fees are modified pursuant
to the appeal process of this Chapter or the applicant proposes to change or modify the
approved development by the submission of a new application.
Non-Binding Estimate. Prior to submitting an application, an applicant may request a non-binding
improvement fees estimate from the City and the City shall calculate such estimate on the
development potential of such site based on data and specifications provided by the applicant.
The estimate shall not be binding on the City or the applicant, but is designed to provide the
applicant with an estimate of the total improvement fees that would be due for the anticipated
development. Actual improvement fees due shall be calculated in accordance with this Section
when an application is filed.
Credits.
Applicability and process. Any claim for a credit from the required improvement fees shall be
made no later than the time the application is filed. Any claim for a credit that is not made at

the time of application shall be deemed waived by the applicant. All credits against
improvement fees shall be granted based on this Chapter and additional standards set forth in
administrative guidelines that are adopted by the City and shall be subject to the following
limitations:
No credit shall be granted for the dedication or construction of site-specific improvements
that are required to be built to serve new development.
No credit shall exceed the total amount of improvement fee due. In no event will the City
reimburse an applicant when the amount of the credits exceeds the improvement fees
due, unless otherwise agreed by the City in writing.
No credit shall be granted for area-related facilities that are not identified by the City's
capital improvement plans for the category of facility for which the improvement fee is
imposed.
Reimbursement credit by agreement. A developer may elect to construct or install capital
infrastructure improvements. If the developer elects to make such improvements, the
developer must enter into an agreement with the City prior to the date of final plat approval
which provides for the amount of the credit and all other arrangements between the City and
developer.
Public entities. A full credit from all applicable improvement fees shall be granted to all public
governmental bodies for structures that are used for governmental purposes.
Reconstruction. A credit from all applicable improvement fees shall be granted for any
application that proposes to rebuild an involuntarily damaged or destroyed building, provided
that such rebuilding does not result in any additional demands on applicable capital
infrastructure improvements for which an improvement fee is imposed. To the extent that such
application creates additional demands on capital infrastructure improvements for which an
improvement fee is imposed, the Fee Administrator shall calculate and impose applicable
improvement fees for such increased demand.
Change in occupancy. A credit from all applicable improvement fees shall be granted for all
applications that are required for a change of existing uses within an existing building. To the
extent that such application creates additional demands on capital infrastructure
improvements for which an improvement fee is imposed, the Fee Administrator shall calculate
and impose applicable improvement fees for such increased demand.
Change in use. A partial credit from all applicable improvement fees shall be granted for each
application that proposes a change in use of an existing structure and the credit shall be
granted only for the demand on capital infrastructure improvements that was generated by the
development prior to the change in use of the property.
Transfer of property. In the event that a building is transferred to a person that would not be
eligible for a credit under this Chapter within a period of one (1) year from the date of
issuance of the application for which improvement fees have been paid, the transferee shall
be required to pay the improvement fees imposed by this Chapter.
Other credits. In its sole discretion, the City may authorize alternative credits or offset
agreements upon petition by an applicant in accordance with administrative guidelines that
the City may adopt.
Delayed Payments and Installment Payments.
Shell buildings. For all non-residential structures that are shell buildings constructed for the
purpose of speculative development ("shell buildings"), payment of the improvement fees due
for such structure may be delayed and become due and payable at the time that a certificate

of occupancy for a tenant finish building permit is issued if the impacts caused by such
building on the City's capital infrastructure which are funded through a particular improvement
fee will not occur until occupancy of the building.
Installment payments. For non-residential structures other than shell buildings, the applicable
improvement fees may be paid over a period of five (5) years in accordance with the
following:
Application for installment payments shall be made to the Fee Administrator in writing
prior to the time that all applicable improvement fees are due and payable on a form
provided by the City.
Upon submission of the application for installment payments, the applicant shall pay
twenty percent (20%) of the total improvement fees due.
Financial assurance shall be provided which shall assure payment of the remaining
outstanding improvement fees.
A payment in the amount of twenty percent (20%) of the total improvement fees shall be
due and payable by 12:00 P.M. on each of the first (1st) four (4) anniversary dates until
all improvement fees, plus interest, are paid. The anniversary date shall be one (1) year
from the date that a complete application was submitted. If the anniversary date falls on a
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday as recognized by the City, the anniversary date shall
be considered the first (1st) business day after the actual anniversary date.
After the second (2nd) and subsequent periodic payments, the financial assurance
provided to the City may be reduced to reflect the total outstanding amount of the
improvement fees due, but in no event will the financial assurance fall below the total
amount of the outstanding improvement fees that remain due, plus interest.
If periodic payments, with interest, are not made and financial assurance is not provided
in accordance with this Chapter, the full amount of all outstanding improvement fees shall
be immediately due and payable.
Financial assurance shall be made in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit from a
bank with sufficient financial capability as determined by the Fee Administrator or a bond
issued by a company rated A+ or better by A.M. Best and licensed to do business in the
State of Missouri or a cash deposit. The form of all proposed financial assurance shall be
acceptable to the City Attorney.
Interest shall be calculated annually on the outstanding balance of all applicable
improvement fees. The interest shall be calculated at the rate earned on the City's pooled
cash in accordance with the City's investment policy for the prior fiscal year.
There will be no prepayment penalty in the event that an applicant desires to prepay any
portion or all of the outstanding improvement fees.
Additional and Supplemental Funding Source. The improvement fees established by this Chapter
are to provide an additional and supplemental funding source for capital infrastructure
improvements necessitated by new development and is additional and supplemental to, and not in
substitution of, other requirements imposed by the City on development or the approval of plats or
the issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. Improvement fees are intended to be
consistent with and further the policies of the City by which the City seeks to ensure that provision
of public facilities are concurrent with the impacts of new development. A property owner may be
required to pay, pursuant to City ordinances, for other public facilities in addition to the
improvement fees as specified in this Chapter. All applicants who are required to pay improvement
fees shall otherwise comply with the City Code and all applicable ordinances of the City. This
Chapter shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, density of development,

to the Finance Department for placement in the appropriate improvement fee fund account which
has been established pursuant to this Section.
Improvement Fee Fund Accounts.
The Director of Finance shall establish separate improvement fee fund accounts for each
separate improvement fee and each separate service area for each improvement fee
authorized by this Chapter. Any funds not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be
invested in interest-bearing accounts. All interest earned shall be retained in the applicable
fee fund account.
Funds withdrawn from the applicable fund account must be used solely in accordance with
the provisions of Subsection (C) of this Section.
The Director of Finance shall maintain records for each such account, whereby improvement

ensure that the disbursement of funds from each account shall be used solely and exclusively
for the provision of projects specified for the particular improvement area and service area for
each improvement fee in which the fee is collected.
Funds shall be expended from each fee fund account in the order in which they are collected.
The Board may from time to time reallocate collected funds from the Road Improvement Fee
Fund and Sanitary Sewer and Wastewater Treatment Facilities Fee Fund accounts. No other
improvement fee fund accounts may be reallocated other than the above-referenced fee fund
accounts without amending this Chapter. Said fee funds shall not be reallocated from one
service area to another.
Use of Funds Collected.
The funds collected by reason of this Chapter shall be used exclusively for the purpose of
acquiring, equipping and/or making capital infrastructure improvements identified for each
improvement fee in each service area. The funds collected may be used as a pledge against
bonds, revenue certificates and other obligations of indebtedness that are used to pay for the
capital infrastructure improvements identified for each improvement fee in each service area.
Improvement fees may be used to pay for the costs of improving, upgrading or expanding
existing capital infrastructure improvements in order to meet the need for new capacity
generated by new development.
In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for advanced provision of
capital infrastructure improvements for which improvement fees may be expended, the
applicable improvement fee funds may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar

The Board has considered the matter of financing new street network improvements, the
need for which is necessitated by new development which generated new traffic in the City.
The Board hereby finds and declares that a road improvement fee imposed upon new
development to finance street network improvements in each service area, the need for which
is reasonably related to new development, furthers the public health, safety and welfare of the
City. Therefore, the Board deems it advisable to adopt road improvement fees.
The Board finds that road improvement fees should be imposed at different rates based on
the type of development. For the purpose of encouraging new commercial and industrial
development in the City, the Board finds that commercial and industrial development should
be charged a lower fee rate per service unit.
Data and calculations supporting the road improvement fees calculation are as follows:
For purposes of imposing road improvement fees, the City shall be divided into two (2)
service areas: the west service area and the east service area, as illustrated on the road
improvement fee service area map which is incorporated herein by reference.
The Board finds that average P.M. peak hour trips is the most accurate and effective
method to calculate the demand that new development places on the street network and
will therefore be the service unit for calculating road improvement fees. Based on data
and calculations for projected street network improvements to serve new development
and the total number of vehicle trips anticipated to be generated by such new
development, the maximum fee rate that can be charged by the City per trip is
approximately one thousand three hundred sixty-five dollars ($1,365.00) in the west
service area and approximately one thousand four dollars ($1,004.00) in the east service
area.
The Board finds that, based on plat applications and other recent proposals for residential
development, the City will experience rapid growth in new residential development and a
corresponding increase in traffic volumes generated by such new residential growth.
The Board finds that the rapid population growth will result in a corresponding increase in
commercial and industrial development in the City. This commercial and industrial growth will
generate increased traffic volumes on the City's Street Network. The Board further finds that it
is appropriate for commercial and industrial development to bear its proportionate share of the
cost of new road improvements that are necessary to accommodate the increased traffic that
is generated by such development.
Applicability And Assessment. Road improvement fees shall be imposed upon all new
development that generates increased traffic on the street network. The application at which road
improvement fees shall be calculated and charged is an application for a building permit.
Service Area. The road improvement fee shall be imposed in two (2) service areas as set forth on
the road improvement fee service area map which is incorporated herein by reference.
Fee Calculation. Road improvement fees shall be calculated and imposed based on the following:
The service unit shall be one (1) P.M. peak hour trip.
The fee rate per service unit shall be:
Residential development — one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
Industrial development — eight hundred dollars ($800.00).

Service units shall be assigned to residential and non-residential development by the Fee
Administrator using the "trip generation table" which is incorporated into this Chapter by
reference. The trip generation table is based on data contained in Trip Generation, 7th Edition
(2003) published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The Fee Administrator may
amend the data on the trip generation table from time to time, as deemed appropriate by the
Fee Administrator, to reflect the actual traffic demand created by new development and such
amended table shall be dated and incorporated into this Chapter.
In the event that an applicant proposes a land use that is not listed on the trip generation
table, the Fee Administrator shall assign trip generation data from the most appropriate land
use category as listed in the most recent version of Trip Generation.
The Fee Administrator shall determine the applicable service units for residential development
by multiplying the number of dwelling units by the trip generation rate for the specified land
use type.
The Fee Administrator shall determine the applicable service units for non-residential
development by dividing the total gross floor area of the building, measured in square feet, by
one thousand (1,000) and then multiplying that number by the trip generation rate for the
specified land use type. The number of rooms shall be used to calculate the service units for
motels.
Phase-In Credits.
Residential development.
2004. Each application for residential development which is submitted on or before
December 31, 2004, shall receive a seventy-five percent (75%) credit from all applicable
road improvement fees.

31, 2004, and on or before December 31, 2005, shall receive a twenty-five percent (25%)

Upon receipt of an application in accordance with Section 615.040 of this Chapter, the original
shall be referred to the Chief of Police who shall cause such investigation of the applicant's
business and moral character to be made as he/she deems necessary for the protection of the
public good. Such an investigation is deemed by the City to be necessary in order to protect the
public interest due to the fact that such activities involve unsolicited contact with persons that
usually occur at another's residence. There shall be a waiting period of two (2) business days in
order to afford necessary time to complete the investigation and to process the application with
respect to those businesses for which an investigation is required by this Chapter.
An applicant's license shall be issued unless it is determined by such investigation that any of the
following conditions exist:
That the applicant has been convicted of a crime or misdemeanor of moral turpitude; or
As relevant, that the applicant has failed to comply with all County and State rules, orders,
and statutes (including but not limited to Sections 150.470 through 150.540, RSMo.)
concerning peddling.
If a canvasser requests an identification card, the investigation will proceed as described above,
but if the City refuses to issue an identification card (or revokes it after issuance), the canvasser
will be advised that the failure to procure an identification card does not prevent him/her from
canvassing the residents of the City.
If, as a result of the investigation, none of the conditions set forth in Subsection (B) are found to
exist, the Chief of Police shall endorse the application with his approval. The Police Clerk shall
thereafter execute a license; and after collection of a twenty-dollar occupational license fee (in the
case of peddlers), deliver the applicant his license.
Such license shall contain the signature and seal of the Chief of Police and shall show the name,
company, and photograph of the applicant; the expiration date of the license; and the manner in

All users discharging a BOD loading of over 240 mg/l, or a TSS loading of over 240
mg/l, as determined by the City, shall pay the excess BOD and TSS surcharges.
The surcharges for excess BOD shall be determined by dividing forty percent (40%) of
the annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs of the waste treatment plant
(less any items not applicable to excess BOD) by the annual treatment loading
expressed in pounds of BOD per year.
The surcharge for excess TSS shall be determined by dividing thirty percent (30%) of the

The type of protection required by this Chapter shall depend on the degree of hazard which exists,
as follows:
An approved air-gap separation shall be installed where the public potable water system may
be contaminated with substances that could cause a severe health hazard.
An approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention device shall be installed where the public potable water system may be

hazard not dangerous to health.
Section 715.060. Where Protection Is Required.
[Ord. No. 70290A §6, 7-2-1990]
An approved backflow prevention device shall be installed on each service line to a consumer's
water system serving premises where, in the judgment of the Water Purveyor or the Missouri
Department of Natural Resources, actual or potential hazards to the public potable water system
exist. The type and degree of protection required shall be commensurate with the degree of
hazard.
An approved air-gap separation or reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be
installed at the service connection or within any premises where, in the judgment of the Water
Purveyor or the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, the nature and extent of activities on
the premises, or the materials used in connection with the activities, or materials stored on the
premises, would present an immediate and dangerous hazard to health should a cross-connection
occur, even though such cross-connection may not exist at the time the backflow prevention
device is required to be installed. This includes, but is not limited to the following situations:
Premises having an auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of the auxiliary supply is
acceptable to the Water Purveyor and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
Premises having internal cross-connections that are not correctable, or intricate plumbing
arrangements which make it impractical to ascertain whether or not cross-connections exist.
Premises where entry is restricted so that inspection for cross-connections cannot be made
with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short notice to assure the cross-connections do not
exist.
Premises having a repeated history of cross-connections being established or reestablished.
Premises, which due to the nature of the enterprise therein, are subject to recurring
modification or expansion.
Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to permit entry into the
public water supply, or where a cross-connection could reasonably be expected to occur. This
shall include the handling of process waters and cooling waters.
Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are handled such that if
backsiphonage or backpressure should occur, a serious health hazard may result.
The following types of facilities fall into one (1) or more of the categories of premises where an
approved air-gap separation or reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device is required
