This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993.

(1) 	
Definitions. i Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross 


income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities). 
ii. Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. 
iii. Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, or an eligible domestic relations order under the eligible domestic relations order act, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. A distributee also includes an eligible designated non-spouse beneficiary. 
iv. Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the retirement system to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

a. 	
The pension committee clearly informs the member that the member has a right to a period of at least 30 days after receiving the notice to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a particular distribution option), and 

b.

The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, or an eligible domestic relations order under the eligible domestic relations order act. 

(2) 	
For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this section, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that agrees to account separately for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.

Division 11 Amendments to Police and Fire Retirement System 
Sec. 2-221. 	Post retirement pension improvements to members retiring from the position of Police Chief, Deputy Police Chief, Fire Chief, and Deputy Fire Chief. 
Pursuant to Section 6(d) of the Public Act 345 of 1937, as amended, the retirement system is hereby amended to provide increased retirement benefits to a member who has retired from the position of Police Chief, Deputy Police Chief, Fire Chief, or Deputy Fire Chief, as of the day following their effective retirement date in accordance with the following: 
(a) 	
Final average compensation and multiplier. 

(1) 	
Effective June 1, 1991, the retiree shall have his or her retirement benefits re-computed to reflect a final average compensation computed using the best three (3) of the last five (5) years of service and a multiplier of two and one-quarter (2.25) percent. 

(2) 	
Effective November 1, 1995 the retiree shall have his or her retirement benefits re-computed to reflect a final average compensation computed using the best three (3) of the last five (5) years of service and a multiplier of two and one-half (2.5) percent. 

(3) 	
Effective January 1, 1996 for a retiree who retired between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 1996 shall have his or her retirement benefits re-computed to reflect inclusion in final average compensation of accumulated vacation time (up to a maximum of four hundred (400) hours). 

(4) 	
Effective January 1, 2007, a retiree shall have his or her retirement benefits re-computed to reflect a final average compensation computed using the best three (3) of the last ten (10) years of service and a multiplier of two and one-half (2.5) percent. 

(b) 	
Pension escalator. 

(1)

(1) 
full year of service beyond his or her date of eligibility for retirement up to a maximum of ten 

(10) 
years of escalation. An eligible retiree shall have his or her retirement benefit re-computed to reflect an annual increase of two (2) percent of the original benefit per year for each year of earned escalation credit up to a maximum of ten (10) years.

(c) 
Pop-up option. Effective November 1, 1995, a retiree shall have the option of electing to have his or her retirement benefits re-computed to provide that in the event the retiree's spouse shall predecease the retiree, the retiree's pension benefit would increase ("pop-up") to the regular pension amount. Said election is conditioned upon the cost of the pop-up option being borne by the retiree in the form of a reduced pension benefit. Said election must be made at the time of the retiree's termination of employment. 

(d) 
Purchase of other governmental service. Effective June 1, 1996, a retiree shall have the option of having his or her retirement benefits re-computed to reflect other full-time federal, state, or local governmental service.

(50) 
percent of the actuarially determined Township contribution rate for said period as of the retiree's effective retirement date. Said payments shall not be subject to annuity withdrawal. The retiree shall not be eligible to purchase more than five (5) years of combined other governmental service and military service. A retiree electing this option shall be required to exercise the option at the time of retirement and make payment in full within sixty (60) days of their retirement date. 

(e) 	
Deferred retirement option plan. 

(1) 	
Overview. Effective January 1, 2007, the police and fire management employees (i.e. Police chief, deputy police chief, fire chief and deputy fire chief), who are members of the Township's police and fire retirement system may voluntarily elect to participate in the Township's police and fire retirement system management employee deferred retirement option plan (hereinafter "DROP") after attaining the minimum requirements for a normal service retirement/pension. DROP participation will be granted by the Township as a retroactive post-retirement adjustment as of the day following the member's effective retirement date in accordance with Section 6(d) of Public Act 345 of 1937, as amended, and the terms herein. The participant's DROP benefit 


(CHAPTER 2, ARTICLE III, DIVISION 11, SECTION 2-221 cont.) 
CHAPTER 2 ADMINISTRATION 
shall be the dollar amount of the employee's monthly pension benefit computed by using the 
contractual guidelines and formula(s) that are in effect on the DROP date. After filing an election 
to participate in the DROP, the employee continues with full employment status, receives all 
future promotions and benefit/wage increases, and is considered an employee of the Township, 
not a retiree. Subject to compliance with the DROP provisions provided herein, upon termination 
of employment, the retiree shall be granted DROP participation and shall be eligible for 
distribution(s) from his or her individual DROP account as described herein. The participant's 
DROP benefit shall be credited monthly to the participant's DROP account which shall be 
established within the Township police and fire retirement system (the "police and fire retirement 
system"). The participant's DROP account shall be maintained and managed by the 
board of trustees of the police and fire retirement system (the "retirement board"). The participant 
is solely responsible for analyzing the tax consequences of DROP participation. 
(2) 	
Eligibility. Effective January 1, 2007 the following members of the management employee and administrative group unit may voluntarily elect to participate in the DROP at any time after attaining the minimum requirements for a normal service retirement/pension: the fire chief, the deputy fire chief(s), the police chief, and the deputy police chief(s). 

(3) 	
Election to participate. Once selected, participation in the DROP program is irrevocable (except as specifically provided in subsection l. herein). An eligible employee who wishes to participate in the DROP shall complete and sign such application form or forms as shall be required by the retirement board. The retirement board shall review the application within a reasonable time period and make a determination as to the employee's eligibility for participation in the DROP. An employee electing to participate in the DROP must file said election prior to their DROP date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee eligible to participate in the DROP prior to the adoption of this section establishing this DROP shall have sixty (60) days after its adoption to file a retroactive DROP election to any date after January 1, 2007. A member electing DROP participation shall be granted DROP participation commensurate with their retirement and shall have his or her retirement benefits adjusted, as of the date following his or her effective retirement date, to reflect his or her retroactive DROP election as of his or her DROP date. 


As of the retiree's effective DROP date, he or she shall cease to accrue additional retirement benefits otherwise credited to active members of the police and fire retirement system. The amount of credited service, multiplier and average final compensation shall be fixed as of the retiree's DROP date. Increases in compensation and accrual of additional service after a retiree's effective DROP date will not be factored into the pension benefits of active or former DROP participants (except as specifically provided in subsection l.). Except with regard to the retirement benefits expressly provided herein, employees electing DROP participation will continue with full employment status with all rights and privileges afforded to respective employees of the police department or fire department and the management and administrative employee group, including, but not limited to, future promotions, benefit and wage increases, as well as, retirement system membership and board representation. 
The Township may extend participation in an alternative retirement plan (e.g. defined contribution plan) to those applicable management employees who continue in their employment after expiration of their DROP participation period. 
(4) 	Participation period. The maximum period for participation in the DROP is five (5) years (the "participation period"). There is no minimum time period for participation. A retiree's DROP participation shall cease within five (5) years from their DROP date. 
The Township may extend participation in an alternative retirement plan (e.g. defined contribution plan) to those employees who continue in their employment after expiration of their DROP participation period. 
The retiree's monthly pension benefit otherwise credited to their DROP account shall cease as of the earlier of the retiree's termination of employment or expiration of the DROP participation period. Interest on the DROP account will continue to be credited until distributed in accordance with subsection i. herein. Upon retirement, the retiree's monthly retirement benefit shall be the monthly amount credited to their DROP account and the retiree shall be eligible for distribution of their DROP account balance in accordance with section i. herein. 
(CHAPTER 2, ARTICLE III, DIVISION 11, SECTION 2-221 cont.) 
CHAPTER 2 ADMINISTRATION 
(5) 	DROP benefit. The retiree's DROP benefit shall be the regular monthly retirement benefit to which the retiree would have been entitled if the retiree had actually terminated employment and retired on their DROP date (less the annuity withdrawal reduction as set forth in subsection f. and the actuarial reductions as a result of the retiree electing an optional form of benefit under the plan, if applicable). The retiree's DROP benefit shall be credited monthly to an individual DROP account. A management employee may at the time of DROP election elect to receive his or her benefit in the form of the plan's option I or option II benefit and nominate a named beneficiary in accordance with the police and fire retirement system provisions. 
The term "spouse" for purposes of benefit qualification of management DROP participants, shall mean: 
i. The person to whom the employee was legally married to on the employee's date of death if such death occurs after the employee's DROP date, but prior to termination of employment; or 
ii. The person to whom the retiree was legally married on both the effective date of termination of employment and the retiree's date of death provided such death occurs after termination of employment. 
The definition of "spouse" herein may be amended pursuant to an eligible domestic relations order entered pursuant to Michigan Public Act 46 of 1991, as amended (MCL § 38.1701 et seq.). 
(6) Annuity withdrawal. An employee electing DROP participation (who no longer accrues additional retirement benefits otherwise credited to active members of the police and fire retirement system) may elect the annuity withdrawal option provided by the police and fire retirement system at the time of electing DROP participation. The annuity withdrawal option and all other retirement options under the police and fire retirement system which are available to retirement system members shall only be available to the employee at such time as he or she elects DROP participation. 
The annuity withdrawal option election shall be made commensurate with the participant's DROP election, and not thereafter, and the annuity withdrawal amount at the time of DROP election will be utilized to compute the actuarial reduction of the retiree's DROP benefit, as well as the retiree's monthly retirement benefit from the police and fire retirement system after termination of employment. The annuity withdrawal amount (accumulated contributions) shall be withdrawn from the police and fire retirement system at the time of termination of employment and shall not be subject to withdrawal by an employee at the time of DROP election. 
Retirees who do not elect the annuity withdrawal option at the time of DROP election shall have 
their full unreduced benefit credited to their DROP account. At the time of the annuity withdrawal option election, if an employee is electing a straight life form of benefit with no qualifying spouse, the reduction computation is based in-part upon the actuarial life expectancy of the employee (rather than the life expectancies of both the employee and qualified spouse). There shall be no adjustment to the benefits payable to the DROP participant upon the subsequent marriage of a qualifying spouse. In the event such spouse (i.e. qualified after calculation of the annuity withdrawal election) subsequently qualifies for benefits payable by the police and fire retirement system, said benefits shall not be adjusted based upon the employee's annuity withdrawal option election. 
(7) 	DROP accounts. An individual DROP account shall be created for each retiree who previously elected DROP participation during employment. The retiree's DROP benefits shall be retroactively accumulated at DROP interest in the DROP account. All individual DROP accounts shall be maintained for the benefit of each employee and will be managed by the retirement board in the same manner as the primary pension fund. DROP interest for each retiree's DROP account on an annual basis shall be based upon the corresponding prior calendar year's market rate of investment return on the total assets in the police and fire retirement system portfolio but in no event shall DROP interest be greater than four (4) percent or less than zero (0) percent per annum compounded monthly. If the retirement system earns between zero (0) percent and four (4) percent, then the DROP interest will be the actual market rate of investment return. If the retirement system earns more than four (4) percent then DROP interest will be four 
(CHAPTER 2, ARTICLE III, DIVISION 11, SECTION 2-221 cont.) 
CHAPTER 2 ADMINISTRATION 
(4) percent and if the retirement system earns less zero (0) percent then DROP interest will be zero (0) percent. DROP interest will be credited to each individual DROP account on the first day of each month on the prior month's principal and interest balance. [By way of example, the following illustration is provided: The retirement system's market rate of investment return for calendar year 2006 is eight and one-half (8.5) percent. The DROP interest rate for calendar year 2007 will be four (4) percent per annum compounded monthly (e.g. 0.3333 percent monthly). A retiree's DROP account balance on February 1, 2007 is twelve thousand five hundred dollars ($12,500.00) (including principal and interest). On March 1, 2007, the retiree's DROP account will be credited with forty-one dollars and sixty-six cents ($41.66) in interest. 
The retirement board shall provide each retiree with a statement of their DROP account. The reference to individual DROP accounts shall be interpreted to refer to the accounting records of the police and fire retirement system and not to the actual segregation of moneys in the funds of the police and fire retirement system. 
(8) 
Contributions. The payroll of those employees electing DROP participation shall be included in the covered compensation upon which regular Township employer contributions to the police and fire retirement system are based. Employer contributions shall be credited to the retirement system and not to any individual DROP account. 

(9) 	
Distribution of DROP funds. Upon termination of employment, the retiree must choose one (1), or a consistent combination of, the following distribution methods to receive payment(s) from his or her individual DROP account: 


i. 	A total lump sum distribution to the retiree. 
ii. 	A partial lump sum distribution to the retiree. 
iii. A lump sum direct rollover to another qualified plan to the extent allowed by federal law and in accordance with the retirement board's rollover procedures. 
iv. 	
An annuity payable for the life of the retiree. 

v. 	
An optional form of annuity as established by Public Act 345 of 1937, as amended. 


vi. 	No distribution, in which case the accumulated balance shall remain in the retirement 
system to the extent allowed by federal law. A retiree may change his or her distribution method as may be applicable no more than once per annum prior to June 30 of each year in accordance with such procedures and time guidelines as adopted by the retirement board. A retiree may elect a total lump sum distribution of any remaining balance in his or her DROP account at any time after termination of employment which will be paid within ninety (90) days after receiving the request. All benefit payments under the retirement system shall be made (or commence in the case of an annuity) as soon as practical after entitlement thereto, but in no event later than the April 1 following the later of: 
a. 	
The calendar year in which the participant attains age seventy and one-half (70 ½ ); or 


b. 
The calendar year in which the participant's employment terminated. 
If the accumulated balance in any retiree's DROP account becomes less than five thousand dollars 
($5,000.00) (or such other amount as provided in Internal Revenue Code Section 411(a)(11)(A)), 



then the retirement board, in its sole discretion, may distribute the retiree's entire DROP account, 
in the form of a lump sum, to the retiree. 
Any and all distributions from a retiree's DROP account shall not be subject to offset by any 

workers' compensation wage loss payments received by the participant, including any redemption amounts. (10). Death during DROP participation. Except as otherwise provided in subsection l., if an employee who has made a DROP election dies either: 
i. 	Before termination of service; or 
ii. After retirement but before his or her DROP account balance has been fully paid out, the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries shall receive the participant's DROP account balance in the manner in which they elect from the previously mentioned distribution methods (subsection i.). In the event the employee or retiree has failed to name a 
beneficiary, the DROP account balance shall be payable to the employee's or retiree's beneficiary of benefits from the police and fire retirement system. If there is no such 
(CHAPTER 2, ARTICLE III, DIVISION 11, SECTION 2-221 cont.) 
CHAPTER 2 ADMINISTRATION 
beneficiary, the account balance shall be paid in a lump sum to the employee's or retiree's estate. In the event such death occurs prior to termination of service, benefits payable from the police and fire retirement system shall be determined as if the employee had terminated service on the day prior to the employee's date of death. 
(11). 	Disability during DROP participation. Except as otherwise provided in subsection l., in the event an employee who has elected DROP participation becomes totally and permanently disabled from further performance of duty as a fire fighter or police officer, the employee shall not be eligible for disability benefits from the police and fire retirement system, except as specifically provided in subsection l. The employee shall terminate employment and be eligible for those benefits provided to a retiree in accordance with the DROP provisions. 
(12). 	Special provision for duty disability and duty death. An employee who has elected DROP participation who the retirement board, in accordance with retirement system provisions, finds to be totally and permanently incapacitated for duty by reason of a personal injury or disease occurring as the natural and proximate result of causes arising out of and in the course of the employee's employment with the Township, may retroactively revoke his or her DROP election. If an employee who has elected DROP participation dies in the line of duty while in the employ of the Township, the employee's eligible survivors (i.e., survivors qualified under Section 6(2) of Public Act 345 of 1937, as amended) and the employee's eligible DROP beneficiary or beneficiaries may, by unanimous agreement, retroactively revoke the employee's DROP election if the revocation occurs before payment of a distribution from the employee's DROP account or payment of benefits from the police and fire retirement system. If a DROP election revocation is made as prescribed by this subsection, the employee's DROP account is not distributed, and the beneficiary or beneficiaries, as applicable, are entitled to all benefits provided by the police and fire retirement system as if a DROP election had not been made. 
(13). 	Promotion. In the event an employee who has previously elected to participate in a DROP pursuant to an applicable collective bargaining agreement is promoted to a police or fire management position in the management and administrative group, said employee's DROP participation period, DROP benefit and DROP account shall be governed by the provisions of the DROP plan in effect at the time of the DROP election. The thirty-three-year service limitation on DROP participation periods as provided in applicable collective bargaining agreements shall not apply to employees promoted to a management position. The Township may extend participation in an alternative retirement plan (e.g. defined contribution plan) in the event an employee's participation period expires prior to termination of employment. The DROP account shall be distributed as a post-retirement adjustment upon termination of employment in accordance with the provisions herein. 
(14). 	Pension escalator. The pension escalator as provided to police and fire management employees shall not be applied to a retiree's DROP benefit or DROP account. Management employees electing DROP participation shall continue to earn two (2) years of escalation for every one (1) full year of service as a management employee which is beyond their date of eligibility for retirement and during their DROP participation period. 
(15). 	Re-employment. In the event a retiree is re-employed by the Township in the capacity of a sworn police officer or firefighter, they shall not be eligible for membership in the police and fire retirement system or DROP participation. Retirement benefits payable from the police and fire retirement system shall continue during such period of re-employment. The Township may extend participation in an alternative retirement plan (e.g., defined contribution plan) during such period of re-employment. 
(16). 	DROP cost. The Township and the police and fire members of the management and administrative group intend for the DROP to be essentially cost neutral (i.e., ± 0.2% of covered payroll). The parties recognize the complexity in estimating the actuarial cost impact of this DROP on the police and fire retirement system. Accordingly, ten (10) years after this DROP is established, the retirement board will direct that the retirement system's actuary conduct an evaluation as to the cost impact of this DROP on the retirement system. In the event that the actuary determines that this DROP has had a positive cost to the retirement system (i.e., < .2% of covered payroll), the DROP shall be amended in such manner, as recommended by the actuary and approved by the parties, to result in an essentially cost neutral program. 
(CHAPTER 2, ARTICLE III, DIVISION 11 cont.) 
CHAPTER 2 ADMINISTRATION 
(17). 	I.R.C. compliance. The DROP is intended to operate in accordance with Section 415 and other applicable laws and regulations contained within the Internal Revenue Code of the United States. Any provision of the DROP, or portion thereof, that is found by the retirement board to be in conflict with an applicable provision of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States is hereby declared null and void. 
The Township police and fire retirement system consists of a defined benefit plan. The DROP account shall be established as part of the defined benefit plan of such retirement system or such other plan as the retirement board and the management and administrative employees group shall agree upon (i.e., I.R.C. Section 415(m) benefit plan) after consultation with appropriate legal counsel. 
(Ord. of 4-28-1997, § 1; Ord. of 2-12-2007) 
Sec. 2-222. 	Pension improvements to members employed in the position of police chief, deputy police chief, fire chief, and deputy fire chief. 
(a) 	
Retirement eligibility. A police or fire management employee shall have the option of having his or her retirement benefits commence to reflect full normal retirement benefits on or after the date the employee has accumulated twenty-five (25) years of service credit regardless of the employee's age. 

(b) 	
Purchase of military service. In accordance with Public Act 345 of 1937, as amended, an employee shall have the option of having his or her retirement benefits computed to reflect prior active service in the armed forces of the United States. Said election is conditioned upon the employee making payments to the retirement system of fifty (50) percent of the actuarially determined Township contribution rate for said period as of the employee's date of application of purchase. Said payments shall not be subject to annuity withdrawal. The employee shall not be eligible to purchase more than five (5) years of combined other governmental service and military service. An employee electing this option shall be required to make payment in accordance with such rules as established by the board of trustees of the police and fire retirement system.  


(Ord. of 2-12-2007) 
Sec. 2-223. 	Purchase of additional credited services. 
If a member, pursuant to the terms of their collective bargaining agreement or the Management & Administrative Group Personnel Policy, is permitted to purchase additional credited service for prior active service in the armed forces of the United States or for full-time employment by another state, local, or federal governmental agency, said purchase may be effectuated by a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer of assets from a qualified plan described in Internal Revenue Code sections 401(a), 403(b) or 457(b). This section shall be subject to Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and purchased credited service shall not exceed 5 years.

(CHAPTER 3 cont.) 
ARTICLE III. PIT BULL TERRIERS, POISONOUS/EXOTIC AND DANGEROUS ANIMALS Sec. 3-021. Purpose. 
The purposes of this article are declared to be as follows: 
(a) 
To identify and enumerate certain animals which, by their nature, are sufficiently dangerous, undesirable or unsuitable for incorporation into the residential, agricultural or commercial life of this community. 

(b) 
To impose prohibitory measures to discourage and ban the possession and maintenance of animals considered as exotic and not easily domesticated. 

(c) 
To describe and classify the breeds of dog generally known as pit bulls or pit bull terriers which are determined to pose an unacceptable risk to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of this community. 

(d) 
To provide for restrictions on the care and custody of existing licensed pit bull terrier dogs on the owners or possessors thereof. 

(e) 
To impose a ban on the prospective possession and maintenance of those breeds of pit bull terrier dogs so classified. 

(f) 
To establish guidelines and procedures to be utilized by animal control personnel in implementing this article. 

(g) 	
To provide for penalties and sanctions for violations hereof. 


(Ord. No. 154, § 2.00, 1-22-1990) 
Sec. 3-022. Legislative classification and findings. 
(a) 	
With the increasing urbanization and population density of the Township, the residents of the Township must be protected from the attack and threat of injury or disease from certain exotic animals possessed or maintained as domestic animals. 

(b) 	
This article is enacted following the passage of Act 381 of the Public Acts of 1988 (MCL 750.49) by the state legislature which provides for substantial penalties to be imposed against persons who promote the possession or use of dogs bred for fighting or baiting. 

(c) 	
This article is enacted following the passage of Act 426 of the Public Acts of 1988 (MCL 


287.321 et seq.) by the Michigan Legislature which provides for additional penalties and procedures for the protection against dangerous animals. 
(d) 	
The Township staff has collected detailed and reliable data from many sources on the number, nature and severity of attacks by pit bull terriers upon innocent citizens of this community, the Metropolitan-Detroit area, and other communities and urban areas within the state, and the United States of America. 

(e) 	
Based upon this data, the Township concludes that pit bull terriers within this community constitute an unacceptable risk of harm and fear to the residents hereof, and must therefore be closely regulated as provided herein. 

(f) 
The Township finds, from many reliable sources, ample evidence to support the following facts about pit bull terriers: 

(1) 	
Pit bull terriers were, for centuries, developed and selectively bred for the express purpose of attacking other dogs or other animals such as bulls, bears or wild hogs. 

(2) 	
In developing a dog for this purpose, certain traits were selected and maximized by controlled breeding including extremely powerful jaws, a low sensitivity to pain, extreme aggressiveness towards other animals, and a natural tendency to refuse to terminate an attack once it has begun. 

(3) 	
Based on the statistical evidence that pit bull dogs are the leading cause of dog bite related fatalities in the United States, and other evidence in the form of individual experiences, the pit bull is infinitely more dangerous once it does attack. 

(4) 	
The pit bull terriers' massive canine jaws can crush a victim with up to two thousand (2,000) pounds of pressure per square inch, three (3) times that of a German shepherd or doberman pinscher, making the pit bull's jaws the strongest of any animal, per pound. 


(CHAPTER 3, ARTICLE II, SECTION 3-022 cont.) 
CHAPTER 3 ANIMALS 
(5) 	
The breeds are almost impossible to confine without resorting to fortress-like measures; pit bull terriers can climb over high chain link fences and trees, tear metal sheeting with its teeth, attack through chain link fencing, tear loose its collars, and dig under fences and walls, requiring the adoption of breed-specific restrictions on the care and custody of licensed pit bull terriers for the protection of the citizens of this community. 

(g) 
These findings and facts lead the Township to conclude that a prohibition on the possession, maintenance and harboring of pit bull terriers, as defined herein, is reasonable and necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. The Board is fully aware that the breed of dog called a "bull terrier," usually considered to be of the same phenotype as the specific breeds banned herein, is not included within the prohibition of this article. The Board finds that this breed is not commonly found or bred at this time in the state nor the United States, and therefore does not pose the same risks. 


Sec. 3-023. Pit bull terriers prohibited; Civil Infraction. 
(a) 	
It shall be unlawful for any person to own, possess or maintain, within the Township, any pit bull terrier, as defined herein. 

(b) 
This section shall not be construed to apply to any person who is both within the territorial boundaries of the Township and in possession of any dog for the primary purpose of exhibiting or showing said dog at a dog show or similar event sponsored by a nationally recognized kennel club or dog breeders association, or its local affiliate or chapter. 

(c) 	
Violation of this Section is a civil infraction punishable as provided in Section 1-010(b), and/or by destruction or removal as provided in Section 3-027. 


Sec. 3-024. Pit bull terrier determination guidelines. 
The following procedures and standards shall be used by all animal control officers in determining whether a particular dog is subject to the prohibition in Section 3-023. 
(a) 
An animal control officer will initially determine why the dog is being considered as possibly prohibited. Factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to the following or a combination of the following:

(2) 	
Identification as a pit bull terrier by an owner of the dog.

(4) 	
Identification as a pit bull terrier by a licensed veterinarian or in veterinary records for the dog. 

(b)

(1) 	
Verification of inclusion by comparison of the physical characteristics of the subject dog with the breed standards in Appendix "A." 

(2) 	
Personal and professional experience of the officer in having observed known pit bull terriers in the past. 

(3) 	
Identification as a pit bull terrier by an owner of the dog.

(d) 	
Within the time specified in a notice of violation of Section 3-023, if an owner of the dog denies or wants to dispute that the dog is a pit bull, the owner may support that denial or dispute by submitting a Township approved veterinarian affidavit on or in a form approved by the Township that complies with the following requirements:

(d) 	
An animal control officer shall not proceed with issuance of a court citation, ticket, or complaint for a violation of Section 3-023 to an owner of a dog that has been certified as not being a Pit Bull or Pit Bull Terrier in a Township approved veterinarian affidavit submitted under and in conformity with subsection 

(c) 
unless the officer's identification of the dog as a pit bull is verified in writing by: 

(1) 	
Another animal control office as substantially conforming to the breed standards in Appendices A, B, or C; and 

(2) 	
A different Township approved veterinarian. 

(e) 	
All animal control officers involved in enforcing Section 3-023, shall be familiar with and consult the breed identification standards in Appendices A, B, and C, and shall become familiar with the pit bull terrier, as defined, by reference to photographs, physiological diagrams and breed behavior patterns. If an officer cannot determine the predominate breed of the dog in question as pit bull terrier, the dog shall not be subject to the prohibition in Section 3-023 unless the dog is later positively identified as a pit bull by a Township approved veterinarian.

ARTICLE VI VACANT PROPERTY REGISTRATION AND 
MAINTENANCE 
Sec. 4-176. Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to help protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens by preventing blight, protecting property values and neighborhood integrity, avoiding the creation and maintenance of nuisances and ensuring safe and sanitary maintenance of dwellings, commercial and industrial buildings. Due to economic conditions, mortgage fraud, foreclosures and increased bankruptcies, many homes and buildings have become vacant and unsupervised. This has caused properties to become attractive nuisances for minors and criminal activity. Vacant properties have a negative impact on surrounding properties and neighborhoods. Potential buyers are deterred by the presence of nearby vacant abandoned buildings. There is an increased instance of unsecured or open doors and windows, broken water pipes, theft of metals and other materials, overgrowth of grass, weeds, shrubs and bushes, illegal dumping and rat and vermin activity at vacant structures. Such neglect devalues properties and causes deterioration in neighborhoods and commercial areas. Further, it is important for the Township to be able to contact owners of vacant properties for fire safety and police purposes. 
(CHAPTER 4, ARTICLE VI cont.)

(CHAPTER 4, ARTICLE IX cont.) 
Sec. 4-249. Certification required. 

(a) 	
No person shall lease, rent or cause to be occupied a residential rental building or residential rental unit unless there is a valid certification issued by the Township in the name of the owner and issued for the specific residential rental building and each residential rental dwelling unit.

(1) 	
Any deficiencies discovered during previous inspections of the rental unit have been corrected; and 

(2) 	
There are no major violations of the inspection guidelines for rental dwellings (major violations are those violations which create a risk to the health, safety or welfare of occupants). However, a residential rental unit located in a multi-family residential rental building will

CHAPTER 4 BUILDINGS AND BUILDING REGULATIONS 
(CHAPTER 4, ARTICLE IX cont.) Sec. 4-251. Inspections. 
(a) 	
The Building Official shall inspect residential rental buildings and residential rental units on a periodic basis pursuant to this Article or under any of the following circumstances: 

(1) 	
Upon receipt of a complaint from an owner or occupant that the premises are in violation of this Article. 

(2) 	
Upon receipt of a report or a referral from the Police Chief, other public agencies or departments, or any individual indicating that the premises are in violation of this Article and which is based on the personal knowledge of the person making the report. 

(3) 	
If an exterior survey of the premises gives the Building Official probable cause to believe that the premises are in violation of this Article. 

(4) 	
Upon receipt of information by the Building Official that a rental unit is not registered with the Township as required by this Article. 


(5) 	As required for issuance or renewal of certification, with period of time between inspections of multiple dwellings to be no longer than four (4) years. Inspections under subsections (1) and (2) where the complaint identifies a child under 18 years of age as residing in the residential rental unit shall be performed before 
inspection of any nonemergency complaint. 
(b) 	
In order to provide for the scheduling of inspections, the owner or local agent of registered residential rental buildings is sent a reminder notice regarding the need to schedule an inspection for the renewal of the certification, which shall include notice of the responsibilities under subsection (e). Owners of newly registered units must call to schedule their own inspections. If the owner or agent does not respond to the reminder notice, the following will take place: 

(1) 	
The Building Official shall notify the owner or local agent of a residential rental building of the date and time such building is to be inspected which shall be at least 14 days after the date of the notice. Such notice maybe personally delivered or maybe sent by first-class mail. 

(2) 	
The notice shall require the owner or local agent to either: 

(i) 	
Appear at the date and time scheduled for the inspection; or 

(ii) 	
Object in writing within ten days of the mailing of the aforementioned notice and: 

a. 	
Schedule an alternative date for the appointment within thirty (30) days from the date identified in the initial notice; or 

b. 	
Direct the Building Official to contact the tenant of the residential rental unit directly to schedule the inspection and provide all tenant names, the address and telephone numbers. 





(3) 
If an owner, local agent or occupant subsequently learns he or she will not be present for a scheduled appointment, the individual must provide the Building Official with at least 24 hours advance notice and must re-schedule an inspection date within 30 days from the scheduled appointment. Unless a right to deny access exists and has been exercised by a tenant under Section 4-251(c), failure to appear for a scheduled appointment without providing the aforementioned notice shall be a violation of this paragraph and a civil infraction. Failure to appear for a scheduled second inspection date shall be a violation of this paragraph and a civil infraction. 

(c) 	
Unless a tenant has made a complaint to the Township regarding the condition of a residential rental unit, or the lease for that unit authorizes its inspection, all tenants of a residential rental unit may deny access for a rental inspection by completing and submitting an “Access Denied” form to the Building Official within ten (10) days of the notice described in subsection (b)(3). The Access Denied form shall be provided by the Building Official and shall describe the purpose of the requested inspection and contain a statement that by signing and submitting it each tenant assumes all risks of injury and damage from conditions that may not comply with the housing and building codes. If that is done, the residential rental unit shall not be inspected 


without a tenant’s subsequent consent or pursuant to an administrative search warrant. A 
consent to inspection by one tenant shall be binding on any other tenants of a residential rental unit. If a tenant is not present during an inspection, the Building Official may rely on the 
owner’s representation that a tenant has consented to the inspection. 
(CHAPTER 4, ARTICLE IX, SECTION 4-251 cont.) 
CHAPTER 4 BUILDINGS AND BUILDING REGULATIONS 
If no such consent or administrative search warrant is obtained the following procedures shall apply and be followed: (Ord. of 7-12-2010, amd. 03-26-2018) 
(1) 	
The Certification will be pulled, and the unit will be placed in an inactive file with a recheck scheduled for one year's time. 

(2) 	
In the event that the unit becomes vacant, it is the property owner's responsibility to schedule an inspection and to obtain certification prior to allowing occupancy. 

(3) 	
Failure of the owner to arrange for an inspection once the unit becomes vacant is a violation punishable as a civil infraction. 

(4) 	
An owner allowing occupancy of a unit without a valid certification after a vacancy is a violation and punishable as a separate civil infraction. 

(d) 
During the inspection, the Building Official shall note any violations of the housing and building codes and give written notice of any such violations to the owner or local agent.  The owner or local agent shall correct all violations within the time set forth in the notice. A reasonable time for correcting violations shall be determined by the Building Official in light of the nature of the violations and all relevant circumstances, but shall not exceed 60 days. Upon written request of the person responsible for correcting violations, the Building Official may extend the time for correcting violations if the Building Official deems such action appropriate under all relevant circumstances, but not to exceed an additional 60 days. 

(e) 	
  For multiple dwellings, Owners or the responsible local agent shall: 

(1) 	
Provide access to the residential rental unit to be inspected if the owner's lease with the tenant provides the owner with the right of entry. 

(2)

(3) 	
Notify the tenants of a residential rental unit of the Building Official's request to inspect the unit, make a good-faith effort to obtain permission for and arrange the inspection, and notify the Building Official within ten (10) days of the residential rental unit being vacated by the tenants. 

(4)

Sec. 4-252. Fees. 
(a) 	
The annual operating fees for periodic inspection of each residential rental building and residential rental dwelling unit and any other fees provided by this ordinance shall be as adopted and/or amended by resolution of the Township Board.  The annual operating fee shall cover periodic inspection for the issuance or renewal of a certification, except that such fee shall not cover an inspection made pursuant to a final notice of violation issued under Section 4-254(b). 

(b) 	
If the Building Official determines that a complaint was filed without a factual basis, and an inspection is made on the basis of said complaint the fee for such inspection may be charged to the complainant. 

(c) 	
An administrative late fee of ten (10%) percent of the unpaid balance shall be paid to the Township by the person obligated to pay an annual operating fee under subsection (a) if such fee is not paid within 60 days from date the billing is due, which unless a later date is stated on the billing, shall be the billing date. After 90 days from the date the billing is due, those fees shall become a lien on the real property and shall be reported to the Township Treasurer for certification to and approval by the Township Board for assessment on the real estate tax rolls of the property on which the building is located as provided in Section 1-014 of the Waterford Charter Township Code, to be collected in the same manner as provided for property tax liens under the general property tax act, MCL 211.1 – MCL 211.157.. 

(c) 	
The rental inspection program as provided for in this Article shall be operated by the Township on a "break even" basis. This means the fees charged shall be set at a rate to produce sufficient revenue to cover the actual, direct cost of administering the program. In the event the fees as set forth herein or as hereafter amended exceed the actual, direct cost of administering the program, the Township Board, by resolution, shall reduce the fees to an 


(CHAPTER 4, ARTICLE IX, SECTION 4-252 cont.) 
CHAPTER 4 BUILDINGS AND BUILDING REGULATIONS 
amount which shall produce sufficient revenue to cover the actual, direct cost of administering the program. If at any time the fees being collected are insufficient to cover the cost of the program, the Township Board, by resolution, shall increase the fees to an amount which shall produce sufficient revenue to cover the actual, direct cost of administering the program. 
(Ord. of 7-12-2010, amd. 11-12-2017) 
Sec. 4-253. Issuance or renewal of certification.

At least 30 but no more than 60 days before the expiration date on the certification issued for a residential rental property, the owner or local agent for the property shall apply to the Township for the scheduling of an inspection for the issuance of a new certification for that residential rental property. 

(b) 	
Upon receipt of a timely request for an inspection for the purpose of the issuance or renewal of a certification, the Township shall inspect the premises before the certification expires or is initially issued. Upon failure of the Township to conduct an inspection prior to occupancy or expiration of the certification the owner may rent the property until the Township has conducted an inspection, and the owner will not be deemed in violation of this Article during that time. If, however, the Township's failure to inspect is due to the owner's, local agent's or tenant's action, failure to act, or refusal to permit an inspection after reasonable notice of the intent to inspect, the owner shall not rent the property. (Ord. of 7-12-2010)

(Comp. Ords. 1986, § 26.410) 
Sec. 8-043. Legislative determinations. 
(a) 	
The special flood hazard areas of the Township are subject to periodic inundation which could result in potential loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which would adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 

(b) 	
These potential flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in special flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damages. 

(c) 	
The preservation and maintenance of the flood hazard areas of the Township in an undisturbed and natural condition provides for the protection of the Township watercourses, inland lakes and streams, and wetlands by minimizing the threat of existing and future pollution. 


(Comp. Ords. 1986, § 26.411) 
Sec. 8-044. Statement of purpose and objectives. 
(a) 	
It is the purpose of this Article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific flood hazard areas by provisions designed to: 

(1) 	
Restrict or prohibit uses which threaten the health, safety and property due to water, erosion or pollution or by flood heights or velocities. 

(2) 	
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 

(3) 	
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 

(4) 	
Control filling, grading, dredging and other land development which may increase pollution, erosion or flood damage. 

(5) 	
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 

(b) 	
The objectives of this Article are: 

(1) 	
To protect human life and health. 

(2) 	
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects. 

(3) 	
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 

(4) 	
To minimize prolonged business interruptions. 

(5) 	
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains. 

(6) 	
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and land development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas. 

(7) 	
To provide a means whereby potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 

(8) 	
To minimize disturbance to the floodplains which would result in damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation, a loss of fish or other beneficial aquatic organisms, a loss of wildlife and vegetation from the destruction of their habitat.

(2) 	
The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 

(3) 	
mudflows, and 



(b) 	
The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this definition.

Division 1. Generally 
Sec. 8-171. Title. 
This Article shall be known and cited as the "Waterford Township Wetlands Ordinance." 
Sec. 8-172. Findings. 
It is recognized by the Township Board that wetlands conservation is a matter of Township concern inasmuch as a loss of a wetland, and particularly in accumulation with other losses of wetlands, will deprive the people of the Township or others of flood and/or stormwater control, wildlife habitat, protection of groundwater resources and provision of valuable watersheds and recharging groundwater supplies, pollution treatment, erosion control and sources of nutrients. It is further recognized by the Township Board that rapid growth, the spread of land development, and increasing demands upon natural resources, have resulted in the shrinkage of the critically necessary domain of wetlands and have had the effect of encroaching on, despoiling, polluting or eliminating many wetlands, and other natural resources, and the public trust therein, and that preservation of the remaining wetlands in an undisturbed and natural condition shall be and is necessary to maintain important physical, aesthetic, recreational and economic assets for existing and future residents of the Township and of this State.

Sec. 8-176. Definitions. 
In addition to those rules of construction and definitions contained in Sections 1-002 and 8-001, the following words and phrases, when used in this Article, shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them: 
Act 	means the Wetland Protection regulations in Part 303 of the Natural Resources and 
Environmental Protection Act, MCL 324.30301 – 30323, as amended. Board or Wetlands Board means the Township Planning Commission. Contiguous means a permanent surface water connection or other direct physical contact with an 
inland lake or stream or watercourse. Seasonal means a condition or event which occurs annually during a specific time of the year as a result of reoccurring weather conditions characteristic to such time of the year.  Soils: 
(1) 	
Poorly drained soils are those general organic soils from which water is removed so slowly that the soil remains wet for a large part of the time. The water table is commonly at or near the surface during a considerable part of the year. Poorly drained conditions are due to a high-water table, to a slower permeable layer within the soil profile, to seepage, or to some combination of these conditions. 

(2) 	
Very poorly drained soils are those soils from which water is removed from the soil so slowly that the water table remains at or on the surface a greater part of the time. Soils of this drainage class usually occupy larger or depressed sites and are frequently ponded.  


Structure means any assembly or materials above or below the surface of the land or water, including but not limited to, houses, buildings, plants, bulkheads, piers, docks, rafts, landings, dams, sheds or waterway obstructions. 
Temporary 	means a time period as specified in the use permit, or if unspecified, shall mean an uninterrupted time period less than nine (9) months in duration. Wetlands has the same meaning as defined in Section1-002 and the Act.

(9) 	
The site provides erosion control by serving as a sedimentation area and filtering basin, absorbing silt and organic matter. 

(10) 	
The site provides sources of nutrients in water food cycles and nursery grounds and sanctuaries for fish. 

(c) 	
In connection with the determination whether the wetland is essential to the preservation of the natural resources of the Township, the property owner may make an election and response under subparagraph (1) or (2) below, relative to each noncontiguous wetland area less than two 

(2)
 acres: 

(1) 	
In lieu of having the Township Engineer proceed with the analysis and determination, the property owner may acknowledge that one or more of the criteria in subparagraphs (b)(1) through (10) above, exist on the wetland in question, including a specification of the one (1) or more criteria which do exist; or

ARTICLE V WELLHEAD PROTECTION 
Division 1. Generally 
Sec. 8-231. Title. 
This Article shall be known and cited as the "Waterford Township Wellhead Protection Ordinance." 
Sec. 8-232. Purpose. 
(a) 	The purpose of the Waterford Charter Township Wellhead Protection Ordinance (WHPO) is to safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of persons served by the Township's Public Water 
Supply System (TPWSS) by achieving the Township’s Master Plan goal to protect designated 
groundwater supplies from contamination resulting from the improper storage, handling, use, production, or discharge of Regulated Substances within areas surrounding existing and proposed municipal drinking water wells and wellfields. 
(b) 	
Appropriate land-use regulations will be imposed specifically to the One (1) Year Time-of-Travel (TOT) Capture Zone, the Five (5) Year TOT Capture Zone, and the Ten (10) Year TOT Capture Zone associated with each of the Township's drinking water wells and wellfields. In addition, the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be encouraged within these Wellhead Protection Areas to minimize the risk of spills, leaks, and other discharges into groundwater supplies. 

(c) 	
It is the intent of this WHPO to minimize public and private losses due to contamination of the public water supply. In addition, it is desired to minimize regulations on land use for those activities that are not a threat to the TPWSS, avoid expenditure of public money for costly pollution remediation projects, and minimize business interruptions while protecting the groundwater and providing a safe potable water supply now and for future generations. 


Sec. 8-233. Compliance with existing federal, state, and local regulations. 
Facility Operators subject to regulation under this WHPO must comply fully with all existing applicable federal, state, and local regulations in addition to any of the requirements established in this WHPO. 
Sec. 8-234. Authority and applicability. 
(a) 	
This WHPO is enacted pursuant to the powers granted by laws of the State of Michigan including the statutory authority granted in Public Act 33 of 2008, the Michigan Planning Enabling Act (as amended) and other relevant laws of the State. This WHPO applies to all land uses and activities in the Township and within the boundaries of the areas delineated on the Wellhead Protection Areas Map adopted as provided in this WHPO. 

(b) 	
It shall be the responsibility of any person owning real property and/or owning or operating a business within the limits of the Township to make a determination of the applicability of this WHPO as it pertains to property and/or business under his ownership or operation, and his failure to do so shall not excuse any violations of this WHPO. 

(c) 	
Nothing contained in this WHPO shall be construed so as to interfere with any existing or future lawful requirements that may be, or heretofore were, imposed by any other public body authorized to enact sanitary, health or water pollution abatement restrictions so long as such requirements are consistent with, or more stringent than, the stated purpose of this WHPO. Nothing contained in this WHPO shall be construed so as to interfere with the duties and powers of the Township or its agents. 

(d) 	
Should any part or provision of this WHPO be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of the WHPO as a whole or any part thereof other than the part held to be invalid.

Division 4. Use Regulations in Wellhead Protection Areas 
Sec. 8-261. Prohibited facilities and land uses 
(a) 	
The insurance of a healthy and safe water supply that is the primary purpose of this WHPO establishes a responsibility to recognize the different levels of potential risk associated with the location of certain facilities and land uses within the proximity of a TPWSS well and/or wellfield. As a result of this responsibility, the following facilities and land uses are prohibited within all one-year, five-year, and ten-year TOT capture zones: 

(1) 	
Land uses requiring licensing by the Township in accordance with Waterford Code of Ordinances, Distressed Vehicle, Junk, Salvage, and Dismantling Yards. 

(2) 	
Commercial sanitary/solid waste landfills. 

(3) 	
Use of a Regulated Substance exceeding fifty-five (55) gallons aggregate for liquid materials or four-hundred forty (440) pounds aggregate for dry weights. 

(4) 	
Use of oil, waste oil, or similar liquid petroleum-type products for dust suppression. 

(5) 	
The disposal of shingles, asphalt, and/or lead-based or lead containing materials in an unlicensed landfill. 

(6) 	
Use of fly ash or other ash material as fill material. This prohibition does not apply where fly ash is used as a component in cement, concrete, or cinder block. 

(7) 	
Installation of underground storage tanks (USTs), except as permitted by the Township in accordance with the procedures established in the current Zoning Ordinance and other pertinent Ordinances. 

(8) 	
Installation of water wells for the purpose of drinking water, irrigation, or any other purpose other than the monitoring and/or sampling of monitoring or test wells in association with S.E.A. recognized groundwater contamination studies or approved by the Township, when public water is reasonably available. 

(9) 	
Any land use that fails to receive a Determination of Compliance from the Public Works Official where such a Determination of Compliance is required by the current Zoning Ordinance. 

(b) 
Additionally, the following land use is prohibited in the ten-year TOT capture zone: 


(CHAPTER 8, ARTICLE V, DIVISION 4 , SECTION 8-261 cont.) 
CHAPTER 8 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION AND CONTROL 
(1) 	
Permanent storage of regulated substances in trucks, trailers, tankers, or rail cars where storage, handling, or use of a Regulated Substance exceeds one thousand (1,000) gallons aggregate for liquid materials or eight thousand (8,000) pounds aggregate for dry weights. 

(c) 	
The list of facilities and land uses prohibited by this WHPO is not exhaustive and represents the state of present knowledge and most common description of said facilities and land uses. As it becomes apparent to the Public Works Official that other classes of facilities or land uses also present a health and safety danger to the TPWSS, the prohibited facilities and land uses listing in this section of this WHPO may be expanded after a joint analysis of a facility or land use class is prepared by the Public Works Official and Zoning Official, reviewed and recommended by the Planning Commission, and approved as an amendment of this WHPO by the Township Board. 


Sec. 8-262. Impact of changing technologies upon prohibited facilities and land uses. 
As evidence becomes available to the Public Works Official of industry-wide adoption of new technologies used in the operation and conduct of identified facility and land use classes where there are changes to non-risk materials or methods, facility and land use classes may be removed by the Township Board from the prohibited listing in Section 8-261. In such instances, the Public Works Official and the Zoning Official, after conferring with an expert geologist and other qualified professionals and preparing a written analysis, may propose to the Township Board that a facility or land use be deleted when it is demonstrated convincingly that the facility or land use no longer poses a pollution hazard. 
Sec. 8-263. Determination of compliance for facilities within wellhead protection areas. 
(a) 	
In those zoning districts identified in the Waterford Township Zoning Ordinance where land use classes are listed requiring review by the Public Works Official, all requests received by the Zoning Official to establish or expand such a land use on a zoning lot shall be forwarded to the Public Works Official for a Determination of Compliance. A Determination of Compliance shall be prepared and issued by the Public Works Official to ensure that a requested land use is in compliance with the requirements of this WHPO. When the Public Works Official determines that a land use request for a zoning lot governed by this Section does not comply with the regulations of this WHPO as it would establish a prohibited facility or land use, the Zoning Official and Planning Commission shall not grant permission to establish such a land use on the specified zoning lot. 

(b) 	
In order to accomplish this duty in a fair and consistent manner, the Public Works Official shall prepare and, after consultation with the Township Engineer and the Zoning Official, adopt a set of standards for evaluation and issuance of Determinations of Compliance. The Public Works Official may incorporate into this set of standards a list of exempted activities allowed by land use classes requiring a Determination of Compliance, provided that such exemptions do not violate the prohibitions established in Section 8-261. 


Sec. 8-264. Existing non-conforming facilities and land uses. 
(a) 	
Any facility or land use existing as of the effective adoption date of, or amendment to, this WHPO that is considered a prohibited facility or land use is permitted to continue operation as a non-conforming facility or land use provided it remains otherwise lawful and remains in compliance with the regulations and limitations established for nonconformities by the current Zoning Ordinance. 

(b) 	
An existing facility made non-conforming solely by application of this WHPO shall be treated as non-conforming only as to those uses prohibited by this WHPO. Existing uses not prohibited or otherwise regulated by this WHPO remain conforming such that they may be expanded or otherwise altered without violation of this WHPO. 

(c) 	
In the event such non-conforming use shall pose a direct hazard to the wellhead, the Township may require that a Spill Control Plan be prepared, in accordance with Sections

Accordingly, in order to prevent profiteering, to the full extent authorized by law the Township Board shall not approve the transfer of a class C liquor license within three (3) years of the date of the original issuance of the license.

(b)

DIVISION 2. Bonds and Performance Guarantees. 
Sec. 14-151. Purpose and Scope 
The purpose of this Division is to establish the authority and procedures for bonds, performance guarantees, and other forms of financial security that are required by any provision in this Code to assure completion of improvements, compliance with a provision of this Code or a permit, certificate, or approval issued under this Code, or other stated purpose, which are referred to in this Division as

(b) 	
All bonds shall be subject to the Township’s right to require an increase in the amount to assure that at all times the bond is sufficient to fully pay for or assure compliance with all purposes and conditions for which it was required.

(b)  	
At the written request by the person that provided a bond and after a progress review and inspection, the Township may approve a reduction of the bond to an amount that remains sufficient for the purposes for which the bond was originally required, provided that no reduction shall occur until the project or work for which the bond was required is at least 50 percent complete and all fee and other obligations for the project to the Township are satisfied.

Full or partial refunds of cash bonds shall be made payable solely to the person who provided the cash (payor on a check), or an assignee of that person and right to receive the refund. Refunds will be sent by first class mail to the address specified on the bond receipt. If the refund is returned undeliverable, it shall be held by the Township and paid to the person entitled to it upon written demand and payment instructions. If such a demand is not received by the Township within one (1) year after the date of refund, the cash bond shall be deemed forfeited and deposited in the general fund of the Township.

A bond shall be forfeited to the Township if: (i) a condition of the bond, or the Code, permit, certificate, or approval that required the bond, is not satisfied and complied with within 7 days of the deadline for that compliance, or (ii) if a licensee or holder of a permit, certificate, or approval fails to timely request a required Township compliance inspection or review. Before forfeiting a bond, the Township will provide at least 30 days written notice of its intention to do so to the persons that provided the bond, the principal and any sureties on the bond, and the licensee or holder of the permit, certificate, or approval that required the bond.

(b) 	
This chapter is further intended to minimize disruption, disturbance and damage to the Township's rights-of-way, to exercise reasonable control over and monitor the use of the same, and to maintain aesthetic, quality, and property values by requiring those persons who seek to disrupt and/or use a Township right-of-way by constructing, installing, locating, operating, using and/or maintaining improvements, including utilities and telecommunications, gas, and/or electric transmission systems therein, to obtain a disruption permit and/or a use permit and pay fair and reasonable permit fees. 

(c) 	
The Township further finds that requiring the payment of the application and permit fees when authorized by law will assist in protecting the Township's interests in its rights-of-way, by allowing the Township to cover some of its costs of maintaining, monitoring, and ensuring quality control with regard to its rights-of-way and related records. 

(d) 	
This chapter is further intended to regulate access to and ongoing use of public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers for their telecommunications facilities while protecting the public health, safety, and welfare and exercising reasonable control of the public rights-of-way in compliance with the Metropolitan Extension Telecommunications Rights-of-Way Act No. 48 of the Public Acts of 2002 ("Act") and other applicable law, and to ensure that the

SHOT CLOCK PROVISIONS FROM MCL 460.1315. 
[Subsections (2)(a)-(c), (f), (g), and (i)-(o), and (3) -(8) are not shot clock provisions and are omitted.] 
(1) 
This section applies to activities of a wireless provider within the public right-of-way. 

(2) 
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5), an authority may require a permit to collocate a small cell wireless facility or install, modify, or replace a utility pole on which a small cell wireless facility will be collocated if the permit is of general applicability. The processing of an application for such a permit is subject to all of the following: 

(d) 
Within 25 days after receiving an application, an authority shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is complete. If the application is incomplete, the notice shall clearly and specifically delineate all missing documents or information. The notice tolls the running of the time for approving or denying an application under subdivision (h). 

(e) 
The running of time period tolled under subdivision (d) resumes when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the authority's notice of incompleteness. If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the authority shall notify the applicant in writing not later than 10 days after receiving the supplemental submission that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing documents or information. The time period may be tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices under the procedures identified in subdivision (d). Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that was not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness. 

(h) 
The authority shall approve or deny the application and notify the applicant in writing within the following period of time after the application is received: 

(i) 
For an application for the collocation of small cell wireless facilities on a utility pole, 60 days, subject to the following adjustments: 

(A) 
Add 15 days if an application from another wireless provider was received within 1 week of the application in question. 

(B) 
Add 15 days if, before the otherwise applicable 60-day or 75-day time period under this subparagraph elapses, the authority notifies the applicant in writing that an extension is needed and the reasons for the extension. 



(ii) 
For an application for a new or replacement utility pole that meets the height requirements of section 13(5)(a) [Ordinance Section 14.5-109] and associated small cell facility, 90 days, subject to the following adjustments: 

(A) 
Add 15 days if an application from another wireless provider was received within 1 week of the application in question. 

(B) 
Add 15 days if, before the otherwise applicable 90-day or 105-day time period under this subparagraph elapses, the authority notifies the applicant in writing that an extension is needed and the reasons for the extension. 








If the authority fails to comply with this subdivision, the completed application is considered to be approved subject to the condition that the applicant provide the authority not less than 7 days' advance written notice that the applicant will be proceeding with the work pursuant to this automatic approval. 
47 CFR 1.6003 REASONABLE PERIODS OF TIME TO ACT ON SITING APPLICATIONS. 
(a) 
Timely action required. A siting authority that fails to act on a siting application on or before the shot clock date for the application, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, is presumed not to have acted within a reasonable period of time. 

(b) 
Shot clock period. The shot clock period for a siting application is the sum of— 


(CHAPTER 14.5, SHOT CLOCK APPENDIX cont.) 
(1) The number of days of the presumptively reasonable period of time for the pertinent type of application, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section; plus 
(2) The number of days of the tolling period, if any, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. 
CHAPTER 14.5 RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT 
(c) 
Presumptively reasonable periods of time— 

(1) 
Review periods for individual applications. The following are the presumptively reasonable periods of time for action on applications seeking authorization for deployments in the categories set forth in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section: 

(i)

(iv) Review of an application to deploy a facility other than a Small Wireless Facility using a new structure: 150 days. 

(2) 
Batching. 

(i) 
If a single application seeks authorization for multiple deployments, all of which fall within a category set forth in either paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (iii) of this section, then the presumptively reasonable period of time for the application as a whole is equal to that for a single deployment within that category. 

(ii) 
If a single application seeks authorization for multiple deployments, the components of which are a mix of deployments that fall within paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and deployments that fall within paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, then the presumptively reasonable period of time for the application as a whole is 90 days. 




(iii) Siting authorities may not refuse to accept applications under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. 

(d) 
Tolling period. Unless a written agreement between the applicant and the siting authority provides otherwise, the tolling period for an application (if any) is as set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section. 

(1) 
For an initial application to deploy Small Wireless Facilities, if the siting authority notifies the applicant on or before the 10th day after submission that the application is materially incomplete, and clearly and specifically identifies the missing documents or information and the specific rule or regulation creating the obligation to submit such documents or information, the shot clock date calculation shall restart at zero on the date on which the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the siting authority to render the application complete. 

(2) 
For all other initial applications, the tolling period shall be the number of days from— 

(i) 
The day after the date when the siting authority notifies the applicant in writing that the application is materially incomplete and clearly and specifically identifies the missing documents or information that the applicant must submit to render the application complete and the specific rule or regulation creating this obligation; until 

(ii) 
The date when the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the siting authority to render the application complete; 


(iii) But only if the notice pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is effectuated on or before the 30th day after the date when the application was submitted; or 

(3) 
For resubmitted applications following a notice of deficiency, the tolling period shall be the number of days from— 




(i) The day after the date when the siting authority notifies the applicant in writing that the applicant’s supplemental submission was not sufficient to render the application complete and clearly and specifically identifies the missing documents or information that 
need to be submitted based on the siting authority’s original request under paragraph (d)(1) 
or (2) of this section; until 
(CHAPTER 14.5, SHOT CLOCK APPENDIX cont.) 
(ii) The date when the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the siting authority to render the application complete; 
CHAPTER 14.5 RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT 
(iii) But only if the notice pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section is effectuated on or before the 10th day after the date when the applicant makes a supplemental 
submission in response to the siting authority’s request under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of 
this section. 
(e) Shot clock date. The shot clock date for a siting application is determined by counting forward, beginning on the day after the date when the application was submitted, by the number of calendar days of the shot clock period identified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and including any pre-application period asserted by the siting authority; provided, that if the date calculated in this manner is a “holiday” as defined in § 1.4(e)(1) or a legal holiday within the relevant State or local jurisdiction, the shot clock date is the next business day after such date. The term “business day” means any day as defined in § 1.4(e)(2) and any day that is not a legal holiday as defined by the State or local jurisdiction. 
SHOT CLOCK PROVISIONS FROM 47 CFR 1.6100 
[Subsections (a) and (b) are not shot clock provisions and are omitted.]

ARTICLE VI VACATION OF SUBDIVISION STREETS 
Sec. 15-110. Intent and purpose 
It is the intent and purpose of this article to establish the authority and procedure for vacating certain streets dedicated as part of the subdivision of land under the Land Division Act, Act 288 of the Public Acts of 1967, as amended, and to provide standards for Township Board consideration of petitions for vacation. It is the further intent and purpose of this article to clarify and reflect the law in the State of Michigan that the Township Board’s jurisdiction to vacate streets is limited, and even when exercised, may not be sufficient to vest title in vacated street areas without relief in the circuit court. 
(Ord. of 3-11-1996, § 1) 
Sec. 15-111. Jurisdiction 
(a) 	
Concurrent jurisdiction. The Township Board and the circuit court have concurrent jurisdiction to consider petitions for the vacation of streets dedicated to the public as part of the subdivision of land under the Land Division Act following abandonment of such streets by the governing street agency, except as provided in the next subparagraph.  

(b) 	
Exclusive circuit court jurisdiction. The Circuit Court has exclusive jurisdiction, and the Township does not have jurisdiction, to consider the vacation of:  

(1) 	
Subdivision streets not dedicated for public use. 

(2) 	
Public streets having any part within twenty-five (25) meters of a lake or the general course of a stream. 

(c) 
For streets that the Township board does not have jurisdiction to vacate, if requested or required by law and without requiring the petition and processing in Sections 15-112 and 15-113, by Resolution the Board may state its position regarding a pending circuit court action that seeks vacation of a publicly dedicated street to the Township. 


(Ord. of 3-11-1996, § 1) 
Sec. 15-112. Petitions for vacation

Any and all additional facts known to the petitioner relative to: 

a. 	
The use or non-use of the street to be vacated.

Preliminary review. Upon receipt of a petition by the Township Clerk, copies shall be distributed to the Township Supervisor, Building Official, Zoning Official, Township Engineer, Public Works Official, Police Chief and Fire Chief. Such officials shall undertake a review and provide a report to the Township Board, to be filed with the Township Clerk for distribution, providing a recommendation on whether the petition for vacation of the street should be granted. If a recommendation is that the petition should be denied, the reasons for such denial should be stated. In addition, such report shall include a recommendation to the Township Board with regard to any conditions or reservations that should be made in the event the petition for vacation is granted, such as, the reservation of right-of-way for drainage and/or utilities, fire access, or similar public interests.

(2) 	
If the Township Board finds that the street sought to be vacated has not been dedicated and accepted for public use as part of the establishment of a subdivision, or that any part of the street to be vacated is within twenty-five (25) meters of a lake or the general course of a stream, the Board shall deny the petition for vacation on the ground that the Board lacks jurisdiction to vacate such a street. 

(3) 	
If the Township Board has not otherwise denied the petition for vacation in accordance with subparagraphs (1) or (2), above, and if the Board tentatively determines that the petition for vacation may be granted, the Board shall set a date for a public hearing on the petition. The Board may require the petitioner to submit additional information and documentation on or before a date specified by the Board, for consideration at the public hearing. 

(d)

Sec. 15-114. Standards for decision making 
In arriving at its decision on a petition for vacation at the conclusion of a public hearing, the following standards for decision making shall be considered by the Township Board: 
(a) 
If objections to the petition for vacation are presented which create a material question as to whether the street is necessary for the promotion or protection of the public health, safety and general welfare, the petition for vacation may be denied by the Board. 

(b) 
The Township Board may adopt a resolution granting the petition if it is found by the Board that there are no material questions as to whether the street is necessary for the promotion or protection of the public health, safety and general welfare, and that there are no reasonable objections presented. In reaching its conclusions on these issues, the Board shall take into consideration: 

(1) 	
Whether any property intended to be served by the street would be landlocked, considering property improvements and divisions previously made, as well as those likely to occur in the future. 

(2) 	
Whether access to any one (1) or more properties, natural features, or natural resources would be terminated, and the nature of any objections with regard to such termination. 

(3) 	
The positive and negative impacts of a transfer of ownership of the land to be vacated to adjacent property owners upon vacation of the street, including impact relating to law enforcement and fire and emergency medical services, views of natural features and resources, buffering, and other public or private purposes, services, rights, or interests, and the likelihood of losing effective control of land which is used or usable for maintaining grades relative to drainage and/or the installation, repair and/or maintenance of utilities, telecommunications facilities, or other subdivision improvements. 

(4) 	
The present or future need for the right-of-way for through traffic purposes. 

(5) 	
Any impact vacation would have on future right-of-way planning. 

(6) 	
Other considerations which are relevant to the particular facts and circumstances attendant to the street sought to be vacated.

(b) 	
Specific pollutant prohibitions. No user shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following limitations: 

(1) 	
Compatible pollutants: See appendix C. 

(2) 	
Non-compatible pollutants. No user shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following, expressed in mg/l: Arsenic (As) 1.0 Cadmium (Cd) See Appendix C Chromium (Cr) 25.0 Copper (Cu) 2.5 Cyanide (CN) (available) 1.0 Iron (Fe) 1000.0 Lead (Pb) 1.0 Nickel (Ni) 5.0 Silver (Ag) 1.0 Zinc (Zn) 7.3 Total phenolic compounds 1.0 or see appendix B All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 136. 

a. 	
The limitation for total PCB is non-detect. Total PCB shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 608, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one (1) or more samples indicate detectable levels of total PCB, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the total PCB concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with 56-3-66.1(d). 

b. 	
The limitation of mercury (Hg) is non-detect. Mercury (Hg) shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 245.1, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/1, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one (1) or more samples indicate detectable levels of mercury, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the mercury concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with 56-3-66.1(d). All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 136. 




(CHAPTER 17, ARTICLE IV, DIVISION 4, SECTION 17-292(b) cont.) CHAPTER 17 WATER AND SEWERS 
(3) 	
Compliance period. Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this section, the department shall notify all industrial users operating under an effective wastewater discharge permit of the requirement to submit a compliance report within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of this section. The compliance report shall demonstrate the user's compliance or non-compliance with these limitations, and, in the event of non-compliance, include the submission of a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with the stated limitation. In no event shall a compliance schedule exceed eighteen (18) months from the effective date of this section. An industrial user who does not demonstrate compliance may petition the department for a second extension as part of an administrative consent order. The department shall include appropriate monitoring, reporting, and penalties into an administrative consent order that relates to a second extension, and shall enter into such an agreement only upon a good-faith showing by the industrial user of the actions taken to achieve compliance with this provision. 

(c) 	
National Categorical Pre-treatment Standards. All users shall comply with the applicable National Categorical Pre-treatment Standards and requirements promulgated pursuant to the act as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Subchapter N, Effluent Guidelines and Standards, which are hereby incorporated by reference and with all other applicable standards and requirements, provided, however, that where a more stringent standard or requirement is applicable pursuant to state law or regulation, or to this division, then the more stringent standard or requirement shall be controlling. Affected dischargers shall comply with applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. part 403 and as established by the department. The National Categorical Pre-treatment Standards which have been promulgated as of the effective date of this section are delineated in appendix A. 

(1) 	
Intake water adjustment. Industrial users seeking adjustment of National Categorical Pre­treatment Standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in their intake water must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.15. Upon notification of approval by the department, the adjustments shall be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are not effective until incorporated into an industrial user's permit. 

(2) 	
Modification of National Categorical Pre-treatment Standards. The department may apply to the 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or to the S.E.A., whichever is appropriate, for authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and procedures in 40 
C.F.R. 403.7. Such authorization may be granted only when the POTW treatment plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for which a removal credit is being sought, provided, that any limitation of such pollutant(s) in the NPDES permit neither are being exceeded nor pose the prospect of being exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted. Where such authorization is given to the department, any industrial user desiring to obtain such credit shall make an application to the department, consistent with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. 403.7 and of this division. Any credits which may be granted under this section may be subject to modifications or revocation as specified in 40 C.F.R. 403.7, or as determined by the department. A requisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the industrial user pay a surcharge based upon the amounts of such pollutants removed by the POTW, such surcharge being based upon fees or rates which the Water Board may establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits shall reflect, or be modified to reflect, any credit granted pursuant to this section. 

(3) 	
New sources. Industrial users who meet the new source criteria shall install, maintain in operating condition, and 'start-up' all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pre-treatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not to exceed ninety 

(90) days, new sources must meet all applicable pre-treatment standards. 

(4) 	
Concentration and mass limits. When limits in a categorical pre-treatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the department may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to the individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in accordance with Sections 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(4) and shall be deemed pre-treatment standards for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. 1317(d) and of this division. Industrial users will be 


(CHAPTER 17, ARTICLE IV, DIVISION 4, SECTION 17-292(c)(4) cont.) 
CHAPTER 17 WATER AND SEWERS 
required to comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(5) 	
Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pre-treatment standards-baseline report. Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pre-treatment standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under Section 40 C.F.R. 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pre-treatment standards and currently discharging into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit to the department a report containing the information listed in 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(1)--(7). Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to the director or regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40 C.F.R. 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to resubmit this information. At least ninety (90) days before commencement of any discharge, each new source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pre-treatment standard shall submit to the department a report which contains the information listed in 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(1)--(5). In such report, new sources shall include information concerning the method of pre-treatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pre-treatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the information requested in 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(4) and (5). 

(d) 	
Dilution prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an application pre­treatment standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use of process water, or in any way dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pre-treatment standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation or requirement imposed by the Township, the City of Detroit or by the State. 

(e) 	
Hauled in wastewater. Any waste material or wastewater which is hauled into or within the service region for discharge to the POTW is subject to the requirements of this division including, but not limited to, permits, inspection, monitoring and enforcement. Unloading liquid or solid waste from hauling vehicles, directly or indirectly, into the POTW, with or without the benefit of pre-treatment, is prohibited unless the person proposing to unload such waste has applied for and received a permit from the department for unloading such waste in accordance with the Water Board's rules pertaining thereto. The discharger shall be subject to applicable terms and conditions, surcharges, fees or rates as established by the Water Board. Hauled in wastewater shall only be discharged at points designated by the POTW after authorization or approval issued pursuant to the general permit requirement specified in this division. The department may establish specific limitations for sludge from municipally owned or operated POTW treatment plants which are different than the specific limitations in this division. 

(f) 	
Centralized waste treatment. It is unlawful for a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility to discharge any industrial waste or wastewater into the POTW without a wastewater discharge permit from the department. Any authorization granted, or permit issued, by the department to a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall specify the type of wastewater for which treatment is provided, and discharge approval is sought, from the POTW. Unless such industrial waste or wastewater is determined by the department to require further authorization, a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility that has submitted an application to, and received previous approval from, the department to discharge wastewater is not required to obtain further authorization from the department before discharging such wastewater. 


An industrial user, that provides centralized waste treatment services and files an application for the treatment and discharge of such types of wastewater to the POTW, shall provide the following minimum information in support thereof. 
(1) 	
The general nature, course and process(es) generating the type of wastewater. Any wastewater, which is generated from those processes and is subject to national categorical pre-treatment standards as delineated in appendix A shall be so designated; 

(2) 	
The identity of the toxic pollutants known or suspected to be present in the wastewater; 


(CHAPTER 17, ARTICLE IV, DIVISION 4, SECTION 17-292(f) cont.) 
CHAPTER 17 WATER AND SEWERS 
(3) 	
At least one (1) sample report showing the results of an analysis for the EPA priority pollutants for each type of wastewater for which application is made in subsection (f)(1) of this section;

(5) 	
The identity of the materials and/or pollutants whose transport or treatment are regulated by the EPA, by the State, or by any other governmental agency. Upon request, the centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall provide a copy of its permit and/or license to the department; and 

(6) 	
Other information requested by the department including, but not limited to, information required by this division or by rules adopted by the Water Board. The discharge from a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility will be deemed approved for those specific types of wastewater delineated in a permit and, upon issuance of such permit in accordance with the procedures contained in this article, will be deemed approved for discharge into the POTW. The centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall comply with all applicable provisions contained in this article regarding permits. In furtherance of its obligations as control authority, the department may include in the permit a requirement to report as selected intervals the information mandated in subsections (1) through (6) of this section. 


All users granted a permit under this section shall maintain records which, at a minimum, identify the source, volume, character, and constituents of the wastewater accepted for treatment and disposal. These records may be reviewed at any time by the department. 
(g) 	Groundwater discharges. Unless authorization has been granted by the department, the 
discharge of any groundwater into the POTW is prohibited. The department may authorize the discharge of groundwater resulting from maintenance and related activities of gas, steam, or electrical utilities through the use of general permits. Subject to appropriate reporting requirements, the general permit shall authorize discharge in accordance with the terms of the permit. Utilities shall comply with this provision within one hundred eighty (180) days after its adoption. 
If a person who proposes to discharge groundwater resulting from purge, response activity, or UST projects, has applied for and received a permit from the department, the department may authorize the discharge of such wastewater. Permits shall be issued in accordance with the procedures contained in this article or in accordance with any rules adopted by the Water Board. 
(h) 	
Township rights of revision. The City of Detroit and the Township reserve the right to establish rules or regulations adopted by the Water Board, additional or more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW. Ninety (90) days after adoption by the Water Board, industrial users shall comply with such rules and regulations. 

(i) 	
Accidental discharges. 

(1) 	
Each industrial user not in possession of a currently approved spill prevention plan or slug control plan, shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article, and all significant industrial users shall submit to the department detailed plans which show facilities and operating procedures to be implemented to provide protection against such accidental discharges. Facilities and measures to prevent and abate accidental discharges shall be implemented, provided and maintained at the owner's or industrial user's cost or expense. Unless the significant industrial user has an approved spill prevention or slug control plan, all existing significant industrial users shall complete and submit such a plan within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this section. New significant industrial users shall submit such a plan prior to the time they commence discharging. 


For purposes of this section, the information provided shall include the approximate average and maximum quantities of such prohibited materials or substances kept on the premises in the form of raw materials, chemicals and/or waste therefrom and the containment capacity for each. Only substances that are in a form which could readily be carried into the POTW and constitute a concentration of five (50 percent or greater in the raw material, chemical solution or waste material, are required to be reported. Volumes of less than fifty-five (55) gallons, or the equivalent thereof, need not be reported unless lesser quantities could cause pass through or 
(CHAPTER 17, ARTICLE IV, DIVISION 4, SECTION 17-292(i)(1) cont.) 
CHAPTER 17 WATER AND SEWERS 
cause interference with the POTW. The industrial user shall promptly notify the department of any significant changes or modifications to the plan including, but not limited to, a change in the contact person, or substance inventory. 
(2) 	
At least once every two (2) years, the department shall evaluate whether a significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges, as defined at 40 C.F.R. 403.8(f)(2)(v). Unless otherwise provided, all significant users shall complete, implement, and submit such a plan within thirty (30) days of notification by the department. 

(j) 	
Notification requirements. Unless a different notice is provided by this division or applicable law, within one (1) hour of becoming aware of a discharge into the POTW which exceeds or does not conform with federal, state or Township laws, rules, regulations or permit requirements, or which could cause problems to the POTW, or which has the potential to cause the industrial user to implement its plan prepared in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, the industrial user shall telephone the department at its control center and notify the department of the discharge. The notification shall include the name of the caller, the location and time of discharge, the type of wastewater, the estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited pollutants and estimated volume, and the measures taken, or being taken, to abate the discharge into the POTW. Within five (5) calendar days after the discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences and when required by the department, the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit may be modified to include additional measures to prevent such future occurrences. Such notification shall not relive the industrial user of any expense, cost of treatment, loss, damages, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other environmental impairment or any other damage to person or property. 

(k) 	
Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board, or other prominent place, advising employees whom to contact in the department in the event of an actual or excessive or prohibited discharge. 

(l) 	
Recovery of costs. Any user discharging in violation of any of the provisions of this article, which produces a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the department's POTW, or causes the department to violate its NPDES permit, shall be liable to the department for any expense, loss, damage, penalty or fine incurred by the department because of said violation or discharge. Prior to assessing such costs, the department shall notify the user of its determination that the user's discharge was a proximate cause of such damage, obstruction, impairment, or violation of the city's NPDES permit and the department's intent to assess such costs to the user. Any such notice shall include written documentation which substantiates the determination of proximate cause and a breakdown of costs estimates. Failure to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this article. Such charge shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any penalties or remedies provided under this division, or this Code, or other statutes and regulations, or at law or in equity. 

(m) 	
Hazardous waste notification. All industrial users, who discharge into the Township collection system, shall notify the department in writing of any discharge of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.12(p). 

(n)

The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 

(ii) 	
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 


(iii) 	The industrial user properly notified the department as described in subsection (c)(2) of this section. 

(4) 
Bypass approval. Where it meets all conditions in subsection (c)(3) of this section, the department may approve an anticipated bypass. Where one (1) or more of the measurements taken for any pollutant defined in this article during a six-month period exceed by any magnitude the daily maximum non-detect limit for the same parameter, the industrial user may develop and implement pollution prevention initiatives, or a BMP, as part of its response. The 


(CHAPTER 17, ARTICLE IV, DIVISION 4, SECTION 17-299(C)(4) cont.) 
department may, as part of an administrative order, also require development of a BMP as a part of the department's enforcement response. Upon approval of the department, these pollution prevention initiatives, or BMPs shall be made an enforceable part of the wastewater discharge permit. Industrial 
CHAPTER 17 WATER AND SEWERS 
users shall provide, at six-month intervals, analytical results and certifications in support of its implementation of an approved pollution prevention initiative or BMPs. Upon demonstration of compliance, the industrial user may request to be relieved of this implementation requirement. 
(d) 	
Emergency suspensions and orders. The department may order suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater discharge permit where, in the opinion of the department, such suspension is necessary to stop any actual or threatening discharge which presents or may present an imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, interferes or may interfere with the POTW, or causes or may cause the City of Detroit to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Any person notified of a suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event the department provides information notification under this section, written confirmation and an order shall be provided within twenty-four (24) hours. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with any suspension or revocation order, the department shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection or services, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or danger to any individual or the environment. In the event such steps are taken, the director shall notify the industrial user within twenty-four (24) hours in writing of such action and order, and the specific recourse available. In any event, the department shall provide the industrial user with an opportunity for a hearing before the director, or his designated representative, within ten (10) days of such action. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement to the department within fifteen (15) days of the occurrence describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. Upon proof of elimination of the non­complying discharge, the department shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the sewer or wastewater treatment service. 

(e) 	
Notice of violation. Except in the case of an actual threatened discharge as specified in subsection (d) of this section, whenever the department has reason to believe that any industrial user has violated or is violating this article, the department shall serve a written notice stating the nature of the violation upon such industrial user. Where applicable, the department shall pursue appropriate escalating enforcement action as defined within its approved enforcement response plan. The failure of the department to issue a notice of violation shall not preclude the department from escalating its enforcement response. 

(f) 	
Administrative actions. Whenever the department has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, or a pre-treatment standard or requirement or any prohibition of this article, the department, except in the case of emergency or flagrant violation, may initiate appropriate administrative enforcement action in order to compel the industrial user to eliminate or to remedy such violation as soon as possible. 

(1) 


(i) 	Conferences. The department may order any person, who violated this division, to attend a conference wherein the department may endeavor to cause the user to eliminate or remedy the violation by establishing an enforceable compliance schedule. The notice of violation shall be served at least ten (10) days before the scheduled conference and shall set forth the date and time, and place thereof. The conference shall be conducted by a representative of the department. The industrial user shall present a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with this article. Nothing contained herein shall require the department to accept or agree to any proposed plan or schedule, or to prevent the department from proceeding with a show cause hearing as set forth in subsection (2) of this section. If the attendees agree upon a compliance schedule, the user and the 
(CHAPTER 17, ARTICLE IV, DIVISION 4, SECTION 17-299(f)(1)(i) cont.) 
department's duly authorized representative may enter, by consent, into a compliance agreement or an administrative order setting forth the terms of such agreement. An 
CHAPTER 17 WATER AND SEWERS 
industrial user must exhibit good faith and expeditious efforts to comply with this article and any procedures, requirements and agreements hereunder. 
(ii) 	Compliance schedules. The user and the department may agree upon a schedule which sets forth the terms and conditions, and time periods or schedules for completion of actions to remedy or eliminate the causes of violation. These schedules may be developed as part of a compliance agreement, or an administrative consent order. Schedules developed under this subsection shall adhere to the following conditions: 
a. 
The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of upgraded or additional pre-treatment facilities, or to the implementation of additional operation and maintenance procedures required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pre-treatment requirements and standards including, but not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, and completion construction; 

b. 
No single increment referred to in subsection 1. of this section shall exceed nine (9) months; 

c. 
Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to be met on such date and, if not, the date which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason(s) for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule; and 

d. 
Any deviations from the compliance schedule may result in the industrial user being found in violation of this division. 


(iii) 	Administrative orders. The department may order any industrial user, who violates or continues to violate this division or a duly issued permit, to install and to properly operate devices, treatment facilities, or other related appurtenances. In addition, orders may contain such other requirements as might reasonably be necessary and appropriate to address the violation including the installation of pre-treatment technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices, implementation of a waste minimization assessment to identify and implement feasible source reduction, and recycling practices to reduce the generation or release of pollutants at the facility. An order may be either an administrative consent order, which is the result of an agreement, or a unilateral administrative order. 
(2) 	Show cause hearing. The department may order any industrial user who violates this division or allows such violation to occur, to show cause before the department why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served upon the industrial user specifying the time and place of a hearing before the department regarding the violation, the reason(s) why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the industrial user to show cause before the department why any proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally, or by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made upon any agent or officer of a corporation, or its authorized representative. 
(i) 	
Hearing proceeding. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures adopted by the Water Board. A hearings officer shall conduct the show cause hearing and take the evidence, and may: 

a. 
In the name of the Water Board, issue notices of hearing requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearing; 

b. 
Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Director for action thereon. 



(ii) 	
Transcript. At any show cause hearing held pursuant to this division, testimony shall be recorded by a court reporter. 


(CHAPTER 17, ARTICLE IV, DIVISION 4, SECTION 17-299(f) cont.) 
(3) 	Actions. After a show cause hearing has been conducted, the hearings officer shall issue an order to the industrial user directing any of the following actions: 
CHAPTER 17 WATER AND SEWERS 
(i) 	
Immediate compliance with the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit or with any application limitation, condition, restriction or requirement of this article, or applicable local, state or federal law or regulation; 

(ii) 	
Pre-treatment of waste by installation of adequate treatment equipment or proper operation and maintenance of existing treatment equipment be accomplished within a specific time period; 


(iii) 	Submission of compliance reports on effluent quality and quantity as determined by self-monitoring and analysis during a specified time period;

(viii) 	A finding the user has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation either of this article or of a duly issued permit, did not occur. 
(4) 	Public notification of significant noncompliance. The department shall publish in the largest daily newspaper published in the City of Detroit and the Township a list of all industrial users shall be provided with a copy of the proposed notice at least thirty (30) days before publication and allowed an opportunity to comment as to its accuracy. 
(g) 	Legal actions. 
(1) 	
Criminal action: Any user, who violated any provision of this article including the failure to pay any fees, fines, charges, or surcharges imposed hereby, or any condition or limitation of a permit issued pursuant thereto, or who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division or wastewater discharge permit, or who tampers with or knowingly rendered inaccurate any monitoring devise required under this division, is guilty of a violation of this division and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided in Section 1-010(a) of this Code. The department, consistent with the terms and conditions of the delegation agreement entered into with the Township is hereby authorized, through its counsel, to seek prosecution of criminal charges against any person violating any provision of this article. 

(2) 
Civil action: Whenever the department has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, a pre-treatment standard or requirement or any requirement of this article, the director may commence a civil action to compel compliance in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the user from discharging, and/or to obtain appropriate relief to remedy the violations. The department or Water Board may also seek additional legal and/or equitable relief. The commencement of suit does not constitute an exclusive election of remedies and does not prohibit the department, director, Water Board, City of Detroit or the Township from commencing action in federal court for discharges believed to be in violation of this division, state and federal requirements contained in the Clean Water Act, the City of Detroit's NPDES permit, or other applicable laws or requirements. In addition, the City of Detroit and/or the Township may recover the reasonable attorney fees, court costs, court reports' fees, and other unusual expenses related to enforcement activities or litigation against the person found to have violated this article, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder. 

(3) 	
All fines, costs, and penalties which are imposed by any court of competent jurisdiction shall be payable to the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and the Township, where applicable.

(a) 	Before any connection shall be made to any water main, application for same shall be made in writing to the water department by the owner on the premises to be served and a tapping permit secured. Such applications shall be made on forms provided by the water department. The owner, user, and/or applicant for a water tapping permit by such application impliedly agrees to abide by 
CHAPTER 17 WATER AND SEWERS 
(CHAPTER 17, ARTICLE IV, DIVISION 5, SEC. 17-329(A) cont.) 
all rules and regulations of the water department in all respects, but more especially with those regarding the responsibility for the payment of water and/or sewer billings. 
(b) 	
All supply and service pipes shall be of type "K" copper or polyethylene plastic pipe of size and quality as approved by the water department. All fittings and connections, underground, shall be approved by the water department. 

(c) 	
No water shall be passed through any service pipe, as defined herein, unless the installation of said pipe(s) is in conformance with the Code of Ordinances or other applicable regulations and has been installed under the supervision and inspection of Township staff or their designated representative. For each service pipe installed after January 1, 2008, only one (1) domestic master meter may be installed. Such meter can be installed inside the premises, or in a meter pit for commercial applications. Any proposed connection through which water may pass from one (1) property or premise to another, or within multiple occupancies, shall be only as set forth in Section 17-344, or as may be specially approved by the Director. 

(d) 	
Excessive or unnecessary use or waste of water, whether caused by carelessness or by defective or leaky plumbing or fixtures, is strictly prohibited. For disregard of, or repeated violation of this requirement, the water may be turned off by the water department. 

(e) 	
Service pipes shall be the responsibility of a licensed plumber, or a homeowner exercising his constitutional privilege as provided in Section 141 of the State plumbing code, and all the fixtures and attachments put in on the premises in connection therewith, must conform to character, design and quality to the laws of the State and the State plumbing code as adopted by the Township Board. 

(f) 	
All service pipes shall enter the building under the foundation with a minimum of five (5) feet of cover in yard areas, six (6) feet of cover in all drive and parking areas.

No supply pipe of less than one-inch copper tube size is permitted. Supply pipes of larger size shall be determined by the water department. 

(i) 	
The charges for installation of supply pipes, supply lines in excess of one hundred (100) feet, and meters, referred to as "tapping charge," shall incur the fee(s) for installation as established in accordance with Section 17-001 of this Chapter. 

(1) 	
All new meter installations shall have a remote reading system as furnished by the DPW. 

(2) 
For larger sizes than listed above, the charge shall be the actual cost of installation plus twenty-five (25) percent thereof. Upon receipt of the application for service requiring such larger sizes, an inspection of the premises shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures established by the Public Works Official and, unless service is rejected for cause, the applicant will be required to deposit with the Public Works Official an amount which, in the judgment of the Public Works Official is sufficient to cover the charge therefor. The DPW will then complete the installation and will keep or cause to be kept a detailed record of the cost, including labor and materials, and will add thereto the twenty-five (25) percent surcharge to cover the cost of administration, depreciation of equipment, and other related costs and expenses. If the deposit exceeds such total charge, the excess will be refunded, but if the total charge exceeds the deposit, the balance shall be paid by the applicant before service is commenced. 

(j) 	
At the time application is made for a water service connection to a building under construction, applicant must pay a flat rate for water usage as determined by the Public Works Official. Such fee for construction water shall entitle the applicant to water for construction purposes for a period of not more than three (3) months. Where water is provided, without a meter, for construction of a building, any wasting of water, whether caused by carelessness or by defective fixtures is strictly prohibited. For disregard of, or repeated violation of this requirement, the water may be turned off by the water department. The water service shall not be turned on again until an agreement is reached between the parties involved.

This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Charter Township of Waterford Electric and Gas Supply Franchise Ordinance." 
(Ord. of 6-26-2000) 
Sec. 18-002. Purpose and findings 
(a) 
Pursuant to Section 29 of Article 7 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, use of the highways, streets, alleys and other public places for operation of a public utility requires the consent of the Township and the transaction of local business in the Township by a public utility requires that a franchise first be obtained. This ordinance is adopted for the purpose of confirming and providing the process, terms and conditions for suppliers of electricity and natural gas to obtain the required consents and franchises and to fully exercise the Township's constitutional authority which includes the reasonable control of its highways, streets, alleys and public places. 

(b) 
As a result of regulatory changes that have or may occur, and interpretations of existing laws, at the state and federal levels, specifically including the Michigan Public Service Commission (Deregulation), the persons that may be authorized to supply electricity and natural gas to customers in the Township are no longer limited to the public utility that owns and operates the facilities used to deliver electricity and natural gas to customers. This ordinance is adopted in recognition of the deregulation which has and may continue to occur, with the intent and purpose of confirming that all persons supplying electricity or natural gas to customers in the Township are required to have a franchise as provided in this ordinance, regardless of whether it is required as a condition of state or federal regulatory permits, approvals or certificates. 

(c) 
The Township will incur costs and expenses in reviewing and acting on franchise requests, and upon granting a franchise, monitoring and enforcing its terms and conditions, the Township and such costs and expenses should be paid by franchise applicants and holders as provided in this ordinance.

SECTION 2-205. ODOR
The emission of odors that are readily detectable at any point along lot lines and that result in a public nuisance or health hazard beyond such lot lines is prohibited.
SECTION 2-206. NOISE
1. General Requirements. No operation or activity shall be carried on that causes or creates measurable noise levels that are unreasonably loud or that unreasonably interfere with the peace and comfort of others, or that exceed the maximum noise level limits prescribed in Table A below, as measured at any point on property adjacent or in close proximity to the zoning lot on which the operation or activity is located.
2. Method and Units of Measurement. The measuring equipment and measurement procedures shall conform to the latest American National Standards Institute (ANSI) specifications. The sound measuring equipment shall be properly calibrated before and after the measurements. Because sound waves having the same decibel (Db) level “sound” louder or softer to the human ear depending upon the frequency of the sound wave in cycles-per-second (that is, depending on whether the pitch of the sound is high or low) an A-weighted filter constructed in accordance with ANSI specifications shall be used on any sound level meter used to take measurements required in this Section. All measurements below are expressed in Db(A) to reflect the use of the A-weighted filter.
3. Table of Maximum Noise Levels. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, noise levels shall not exceed the limits set forth in the following Table A:

4. Background Noise. Where existing background noise exceeds the maximum permitted levels specified in Table A, the noise caused or created by a specific operation or activity may exceed the levels specified in the Table, provided that the sound level on property adjacent or in close proximity to the lot or parcel on which the operation or activity is located does not exceed the background noise level. For purposes of this subsection, background noise shall mean noise being produced by permitted uses conducted in a legally-accepted manner from all sources other than those occurring on the lot or parcel on which the operation or activity is located. Background noise levels shall be determined by measurement at substantially the same time and location as the noise levels caused or created by the complained-of operation or activity.
5. Intermittent or Other Unreasonable Sounds. Intermittent sounds or sounds characterized by pure tones might be a source of complaints, even though the measured sound level does not exceed the permitted level in Table A. Such sounds shall be prohibited when found to be unreasonably loud or to unreasonably interfere with the peace and comfort of others. In making such determination, the following shall be considered:
A. The proximity of the sound to sleeping facilities;
B. The nature of the use from which the sound emanates and the area where it is received or perceived;
C. The time (day or night) the sound occurs; and
D. The duration of the sound.
6. Variances. An application for a variance from the provisions of this Section may be submitted to the ZBA. The owner or operator of equipment on the property shall submit a statement regarding the effect of noise from the equipment on the overall noise level in the area. The statement shall also include a study of background noise levels, predicted levels of noise measured at the boundary line due to the proposed operation, and justification for the variance. If it appears to the ZBA, in the course of its review of the applicant's application and statement, that the expertise of a sound engineer or other expert shall be necessary in order to review the application, the ZBA shall be authorized to obtain a reasonable escrow for consulting fees from the applicant and retain such expert for such purposes. Upon review of the request for a variance, the ZBA may grant a variance where the ZBA Variance/Appeal Review Standards are found to have been satisfied by the applicant and where such relief would be within the spirit and intent of this ordinance, would not adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare, and would not be materially injurious to surrounding properties and improvements. The ZBA may impose conditions of operation in granting a variance.
7. Exemptions. Noise resulting from the following activities shall be exempt from the maximum permitted sound levels provided such activity occurs in a legally-accepted manner:
A. Temporary construction and demolition activity that occurs between 7:00 am and 7:00 pm;
B. Performance of emergency work, including snow removal;
C. Warning devices necessary for public safety, such as police, fire, and ambulance sirens, tornado and civil defense warning devices, train horns, and sounds emitted in the course of the performance of emergency work;

SECTION 2-302. BUILDING GRADES
The grade of any building or structure constructed in the Township shall observe the following requirements:
A. Any building or structure requiring yard space, as determined by minimum setback requirements established under this Zoning Ordinance, shall be located at such an elevation that a sloping grade will be maintained in order to cause the surface water to flow away from the walls of the structure. Yards shall be graded in such manner as will prevent the accumulation of surface water on the property and not increase the natural flow or run-off of surface water onto adjacent properties.
B. When a new building or structure is to be constructed on a vacant site between two (2) existing buildings or structures on adjacent sites, the grade shall be established in such manner as to harmonize with the respective grades of the adjoining sites so as to prevent surface water run-off onto any such adjoining sites.
C. An established surface drainage grade shall not be altered in a manner or to an extent that would materially obstruct or deter the normal surface drainage.
SECTION 2-303. MOVED BUILDINGS AND MOVED STRUCTURES
Any previously occupied or used building or structure that is moved within or into a district to be placed upon a foundation shall be considered a new building or structure and shall be subject to all provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and the Waterford Code of Ordinances.

DIVISION 2-4 - STREET RIGHTS-OF-WAY, TRANSPORTATION ACCESS, PARKING, AND LOADING STANDARDS FOR ALL LAND USES
SECTION 2-400. PURPOSE AND INTENT
The standards established in this Division are intended to provide safe and efficient access to zoning lots, to prevent congestion on streets, to provide clearly defined parking and loading areas that are separated from streets and access-ways; to minimize conflicts between nonmotorized and motorized traffic; to facilitate proper stormwater runoff; to clearly delineate the availability and arrangement of vehicle parking spaces, and to ensure the availability of barrier-free access for persons with disabilities.
SECTION 2-401. STREET RIGHTS-OF-WAY
A street system shall be required to serve all zoning lots. The street system, whether public or private, shall be designed so that the right-of-way is of sufficient width to provide safe and efficient access for emergency and service vehicles to each zoning lot as determined by the Fire Chief, as well as the effective location and maintenance of public utilities to be located within the right-of-way lines as determined by the Township Engineer; these requirements are intended to be accomplished without sacrificing minimum building setback requirements that shall be measured from the nearest right-of-way line. All private streets shall be dimensioned and constructed in accordance with the Township Engineering Standards and the Waterford Code of Ordinances, Subdivision and Land Management Regulations. Prior to site plan approval of a development containing a proposed private right-of-way, a legal instrument providing for the creation and maintenance of the private right-of-way and formatted for recording with the Oakland County Register of Deeds shall be submitted to the Township Attorney and Township Engineer for review to ensure that the private right-of-way will be constructed and perpetually maintained in accordance with the Township Engineering Standards, and to ensure that the Township shall in no event be held liable for the costs of road signs, traffic control signs, maintenance, lighting, or snow removal. A street agency may use a zoning lot as a temporary construction staging and batching area for public street construction and maintenance after consultation with and authorization by the Zoning Official.
SECTION 2-402. ACCESS MANAGEMENT
In order to promote traffic calming, reduce vehicle turning conflict points, and overall traffic safety, the Township establishes the following access management requirements:
A. Vehicular access drives from all zoning lots shall be designed, dimensioned, located, and limited in number in accordance with the Township Engineering Standards to provide safe and reasonable access for zoning lots as well as to ensure proper geographic separation between each access drive, access drives and intersections, and access drives and adjacent zoning lots zoned for less intensive land uses.
B. Access drive construction within public rights-of-way shall be under permit from the applicable street agency.
C. In those zoning districts where off-street parking facilities are required, it is the Township’s objective to significantly reduce potential traffic congestion and improve safety conditions through the reduction of access drives and enable access between adjoining zoning lots. In order to achieve this objective, when zoning lots are subject to development review and approval through one or more of the procedures required by ARTICLE IV, APPLICATIONS AND PROCEDURES, and it is determined by the Township that no interior circulation problems will result, the Township shall require that a final site plan provide the location of, and require the recording of easements and/or agreements providing for the future linkage to adjoining zoning lots through the construction and maintenance of:
(1) Joint-access driveways that will allow access to parking facilities on more than one zoning lot, and/or
(2) Cross-access interior drives that will allow vehicles to move from one zoning lot to another without re-entering the abutting street,
at such time that adjoining zoning lots both possess joint-access and/or cross-access on the respective final site plans. Easements and/or agreements shall be established to provide the necessary joint-access or cross-access rights in a form and substance acceptable to the Township Attorney prior to the granting of a building permit, and shall be recorded prior to the granting of any certificate of occupancy.

SECTION 2-403. CLEAR VISION AREAS
It shall be unlawful for any person to allow any plant material or any other item or materials which screens visibility in such areas requiring clear vision for traffic, such as on a curve, at the corner of any street intersection, or at any driveway intersection. Trees shall be permitted where all branches are not less than eight (8) feet above the street level. Such unobstructed street and driveway intersections shall be calculated by mapping a triangle formed by measuring along each right-of-way, from their point of intersection, a distance of twenty-five (25) feet and drawing a straight line between these two points. In the case of a driveway intersection for any land use, the required twenty-five (25) feet sides of the triangles are taken from the points where each side of the drives cross the right-of-way line. In cases of nonconforming building setback lines, the triangle shall be mapped for the total distance less than the twenty-five (25) feet (Please also refer to Figures VII-58 through VII-61 on Pages VII-31 and VII-32 in Article VII). The minimum clear vision area may be increased by the Planning Commision during the applicable review process if the Planning Commission finds that topography or other physical site characteristics increase the visibility risks.
SECTION 2-404. NONMOTORIZED PATHWAYS
Nonmotorized pathways shall be provided as an integral part of all developments so as to permit safe and convenient pedestrian access throughout the development, particularly along its street system; the Planning Commission may waive this requirement for any area of the development where it finds that the establishment of nonmotorized pathway will increase safety risks, does not enhance accessibility to other areas of the development, or motorized and nonmotorized traffic can safely share a segment of the street system due to the lack of through-traffic. All zoning lots adjacent to a street identified in the Community Nonmotorized Pathway Master Plan shall be required to construct nonmotorized pathway linkages along the abutting street right-of-way as a condition of approval for a final site plan; the Planning Commission may waive this requirement if it finds that the scope of the development, combined with a limited through-traffic pattern, would allow nonmotorized traffic to safely share the street system. All nonmotorized pathways shall be constructed in conformance with the Township Engineering Standards.
SECTION 2-405. OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS

DIVISION 2-5 - SIGN STANDARDS FOR ALL LAND USES
SECTION 2-500. PURPOSE AND INTENT
Signs include all those devices containing one or more sign message units which convey an identification, information, or message to persons on the same or neighboring properties or street roadways. Properly developed signs guide users to a destination or convey a message without creating unnecessary confusion, congestion, distraction, or other hazards. In this manner, the basic purposes of the sign are achieved while protecting the rights of the general public. To these ends, the purpose and intent of this Division shall be:
A. To set forth conditions and requirements for all signs regardless of district boundaries.
B. To establish requirements regarding the construction and maintenance of signs and also the removal of any unauthorized signs placed within street rights-of-way.
C. To keep the number of sign messages at the level reasonably necessary to identify a business and its products.
D. To keep signs within a reasonable scale with respect to the buildings they identify.
E. To reduce visual distraction and obstructions to motorists traveling along, entering or leaving streets.
F. To promote a quality manner of display which enhances the character of the Township.
G. To regulate the placement and duration, and prevent the proliferation, of temporary and portable signs which create visual blight, negatively impact aesthetics and traffic safety, and result in an increase in the amount of signage otherwise allowed.
SECTION 2-501. BASIC REQUIREMENTS
1. Permanent Sign Approval Required. All permanent signs proposed in conjunction with a proposed development shall be reviewed and approved through the same review and approval process as the development. All other permanent signs being erected, relocated or structurally altered shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with Section 4-015. Building permit issuance shall be based on the approved plan. No permanent sign shall be erected, installed, altered, or relocated without an approved plan and building permit.
2. Permanent Sign Construction and Maintenance. All permanent signs shall be constructed in compliance with the Waterford Code of Ordinances, Buildings and Building Regulations and all other applicable ordinances and regulations, shall be of sturdy construction to withstand normal natural elements, and shall be properly maintained and free from rust, paint chipping, or any other condition causing such sign to be in a state of disrepair. All electrical wiring associated with freestanding signs and entranceway signs shall be installed underground. Signs that are not abandoned signs or obsolete signs and which have missing sign message units, burned-out sign illumination, or other damaged or missing sign components for more than thirty (30) consecutive days shall be considered improperly maintained and may be issued a civil infraction.
3. Signs in the Rights-of-Way.
A. No sign shall be located in, project into or overhang a public right-of-way or easement (Please also refer to Figure VII-48 on Page VII-24 in Article VII) except as follows:
(1) Signs provided by local, county, state or federal governments.
(2) Required legal notices.
(3) Mailboxes and newspaper delivery boxes.
(4) Entranceway signs where permitted in this Zoning Ordinance.
(5) Election signs where permitted in this Zoning Ordinance.
B. Signs otherwise prohibited from location in a public right-of-way or easement which are not removed following verbal notification of violation, a written correction notice by the Township, or by legal notice published annually in a newspaper of general circulation within the Township, may be removed by the Township. Signs located in, projecting into or overhanging a public right-of-way or easement may be removed immediately by the Township if such sign poses a clear safety hazard either physically or due to blockage of view. With respect to temporary or portable signs, any sign which is located in, projects into, or overhangs a public right-of-way or public easement in violation of this Zoning Ordinance, the Zoning Official may remove said sign without notice. Before any removed sign is returned to its owner, a fee in an amount established by resolution of the Township Board shall be paid to cover all costs of pickup, storage, and administrative processing. Any sign which is removed from the public right-of-way or public easement in accordance with this Section, shall be deemed abandoned if the owner of the sign does not reclaim it within fifteen (15) days of the date of its removal, after which the Township may dispose of the sign.

4. Clear Vision Area. No sign shall be erected, established, or maintained in those areas described in Section 2-403 as areas to be kept clear of obstructions to visibility.
5. Sign Area. The area of a sign for purposes of computing the maximum size permissible by this Zoning Ordinance shall be calculated by measuring the sign face area. Maximum size assumes a two (2) sided sign. For example, a sign with a maximum sign area of one hundred (100) square feet actually provides two hundred (200) square feet of sign area. In instances where three or more sided signs are proposed, the aggregate size of all sign surfaces plus connecting sides shall not exceed the permissible size of a two (2) sided sign. These requirements are set forth in the respective district standards. If an applicant or owner is, in fact, using the sign frame, sign enhancement features, or sign base to convey a message or information through the application of sign message units, such portion of the sign structure possessing such sign message units shall be added into the computation of the total sign area (Please also refer to Figure VII-49 on Pages VII-25 in Article VII).
6. Painted Signs. Signs shall not be painted directly upon the roof of any building or structure. Painted signs may be incorporated as wall signage, where permitted, provided it conforms to Sections 2-507.
7. Vehicle Signs.
A. Unlawful Vehicle Signs. It shall be unlawful to park, place, or store a vehicle or trailer on which there is a vehicle sign on private or public property for the purpose of advertising a business or products, or for the purpose of directing people to a business or business activity.
B. Presumption. There shall be a presumption that subsection A, above, has been violated if the vehicle sign is visible from a street and one or more of the following circumstances exists:
(1) the vehicle sign is attached to a vehicle or trailer that is unregistered or not in good repair;
(2) the vehicle sign is larger in any dimension than or extends beyond any surface of the vehicle or trailer to which it is attached;
(3) the vehicle sign is attached to a vehicle or trailer that is parked or stored in a public right-of-way or an area not designed, designated, or commonly used for parking;
(4) the vehicle sign is attached to a vehicle or trailer that is regularly parked or stored in a front yard, side yard, or section of an off-street parking facility that abuts a street, when there are other areas of the property designed, designated, or available for the parking or storage of the vehicle or trailer that are not visible from the street or do not abut streets; or
(5) the vehicle sign is attached to a vehicle or trailer that is regularly parked or stored within fifty (50) feet of a street, when there are other areas of the property designed, designated, or available for the parking or storage of the vehicle or trailer that are more distant from the street or not visible from the street.
C. Rebuttal of Presumption. The presumption set forth in subsection B, above, may be rebutted by evidence showing all of the following:
(1) the vehicle is temporarily parked in a particular location in the course of conducting personal activities or business activities that involve the loading or unloading of goods for customers, providing services to off-site customers, conducting off-site business, or engaging in work breaks;
(2) the activities in subsection (1), above, are being actively undertaken during the period of such parking;
(3) the activities in subsection (1), above, require the presence of the vehicle for purposes of transporting equipment, people, supplies, or goods necessary for carrying out such activities; and
(4) the activities in subsection (1), above, are not, other than incidentally, related to advertising, identifying, displaying, directing, or attracting attention to an object, person, institution, organization, business, product, service, event, or location.
8. Obsolete Signs, Abandoned Signs, and Nonconforming Signs. It is the intent of this Section to recognize the existence of obsolete signs, abandoned signs, and nonconforming signs as nonconforming structures that are contrary to the best interests of the community. It is considered as much a subject of public health, safety and welfare as is the prohibition of the establishment of new signs in violation of the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Township, as expressed in this Zoning Ordinance, to remove obsolete signs, abandoned signs, and nonconforming signs as expeditiously as is reasonable and as circumstances permit, having due regard for the rights of the parties concerned, as nonconforming structures in accordance with Sections 2-702 and 2-704. In instances where a zoning lot containing an obsolete sign, abandoned sign, or nonconforming sign structure must undergo major site plan review, in accordance with Section 4-004.3, the Planning Commission may impose the removal of such signs as a condition of final site plan approval.

SECTION 2-510. ELECTION SIGNS
Given the purpose and intent of this Division, but recognizing the importance of the protections given to political speech under the state and federal constitutions, the Township desires to provide more lenient requirements for election signs than for other similar types of temporary signs in the Township and to regulate such signage only to the extent required to achieve the Township's zoning objectives while concurrently affording a reasonable opportunity to communicate election messages. Therefore, the Township exempts temporary election signs from the obligation to meet design and structural requirements, from application, permit and inspection requirements, and from other requirements in view of the fact that, unlike other signs in the Township, including other types of temporary signs, election signs, as defined in this ordinance, are not intended to be displayed on a permanent basis, are erected in a manner and constructed of materials that are not able or intended to withstand exposure to the elements for an extended period of time, and are not anticipated to be constructed, placed, screened or otherwise established in the same manner as permanent signs. Consequently, the regulations in this Section are intended and imposed to protect safety, avoid blight and litter, preserve the general welfare of the community, and otherwise achieve the purpose and intent of this Division in the most narrow and least restrictive way possible and while respecting and preserving the First Amendment constitutional rights of individuals to engage in political speech by way of erecting election signs.

DIVISION 2-6 - USE RESTRICTIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION 2-600. WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES
1. Purpose and Intent. It is the general purpose and intent of the Township to carry out the will of the United States Congress by authorizing communication facilities needed to operate wireless communication systems. However, it is the further purpose and intent of the Township to provide for such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character, property values and aesthetic quality of the Township at large. In fashioning and administering the provisions of this Section, attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing interests. Recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless communication services and coverage, it is the further purpose and intent of this Section to:
A. Facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless communication facilities.
B. Establish predetermined districts or zones of the number, shape, and in the location, considered best for the establishment of wireless communication facilities, subject to applicable standards and conditions.
C. Recognize that operation of a wireless communication system may require the establishment of facilities in locations not within the predetermined districts or zones. In such cases, it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon neighborhoods and areas within the Township. Consequently, more stringent standards and conditions should apply to the review, approval and use of such facilities.
D. Ensure that wireless communication facilities are situated in appropriate locations and relationships to other land uses, structures and buildings.
E. Limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid adverse impact upon existing population, transportation systems, and other public services and facility needs.
F. Promote the public health, safety and welfare.
G. Provide for adequate information about plans for wireless communication facilities in order to permit the Township to effectively plan for the location of such facilities.
H. Minimize the adverse impacts of technological obsolescence of such facilities, including a requirement to remove unused and/or unnecessary facilities in a timely manner.
I. Minimize the negative visual impact of wireless communication facilities on neighborhoods, community land marks, historic sites and buildings, natural beauty areas and public rights-of-way. This contemplates the establishment of as few wireless communication facilities structures as reasonably feasible, and the use of structures which are designed for compatibility, including the use of existing wireless communication facilities structures and the avoidance of lattice structures that are unnecessary, taking into consideration the purposes and intent of this Section.
J. The Township Board finds that the presence of numerous wireless communication facilities tower structures, particularly if located within residential areas, would decrease the attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the Township. This, in turn, would have an adverse impact upon property values. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the adverse impact from the presence of numerous relatively tall wireless communication facilities tower structures having low architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most persons, that the absence of regulation would result in a material impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values and further recognizing that this economic component is an important part of the public health, safety and welfare.
2. Permitted Uses. Subject to the standards and conditions set forth in subsection 6.A of this Section, wireless communication facilities shall be considered permitted uses under the following circumstances:
A. An existing structure which will serve as an attached wireless communication facility within a zoning district listed in subsection 3 of this Section, where the existing structure is not, in the discretion of the Zoning Official, proposed to be either materially altered or materially changed in appearance.
B. A proposed collocation upon an attached wireless communication facility which had been pre-approved for such collocation as part of an earlier approval by the Township.

(ARTICLE II, DIVISION 2-6, SECTION 2-600.2 cont.)
C. An existing structure which will serve as an attached wireless communication facility consisting of a utility pole located within a right-of-way, where the existing pole is not proposed to be modified in a manner which, in the discretion of the Zoning Official, would materially alter the structure and/or result in an impairment of sight lines or other safety interests.
D. A wireless communication facility structure established within a right-of-way having an existing width of more than 204 feet.
E. An existing structure of an essential service which will serve as an attached wireless communication facility within any zoning district, where the existing structure is not, in the discretion of the Zoning Official, proposed to be either materially altered or materially changed in appearance.
3. Special Approval Uses. If it is demonstrated by an applicant that there is no reasonable difference of opinion that a wireless communication facility may not reasonably be established as a permitted use under subsection 2 of this Section, then, subject to the standards and conditions set forth in subsections 6.A and B below, wireless communication facilities may be authorized as a special approval use by the Planning Commission under Section 4-006:
A. Within any zoning district other than R-1, R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, R-1D, R-1E, R-M1, R-M2, or R-MH, and
B. On a zoning lot containing a minimum area of forty (40) acres that is owned by the Township or other governmental entity, a public or private school or religious entity or institution.
4. Planned Unit Development Uses. If it is demonstrated by an applicant that there is no reasonable difference of opinion that a wireless communication facility may not reasonably be established as a permitted use under subsection 2 of this Section, then, subject to the standards and conditions set forth in subsections 6.A and B below, wireless communication facilities may be authorized through a planned unit development by the Planning Commission and Township Board under Section 4-005 within any nonresidential zoning district permitting planned unit developments.
5. Special Approval Uses in Non Permitted Districts or Zones. If it is demonstrated by an applicant that there is no reasonable difference of opinion that a wireless communication facility may not reasonably be established as a permitted use under subsection 2 of this Section or as a special approval use under subsection 3 of this Section, a wireless communication facility may be permitted elsewhere in the Township as a special approval use by the Planning Commission under Section 4-006 subject to all the criteria and standards of subsection 6 below.
6. General Regulations.

Any such information which is trade secret and/or other confidential commercial information which, if released would result in commercial disadvantage to the applicant, may be submitted with a request for confidentiality in connection with the development of governmental policy, MCL 15.243(1)(g). This Zoning Ordinance shall serve as the promise to maintain confidentiality to the extent permitted by law. The request for confidentiality must be prominently stated in order to bring it to the attention of the Township.
E. The name, address and phone number of the person to contact for engineering, maintenance and other notice purposes. This information shall be continuously updated during all times the facility is on the premises.
F. The owner or duly authorized representative of all ownership interest in the land on which the wireless communication facility is proposed to be located shall sign the application. In addition, if a licensed entity intended to be the operator on the facility does not sign the application, approval shall be restricted as provided in subsection 6 above.
8. Collocation.
A. Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the Township to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless communication facilities and attached wireless communication facilities within the community, and encourage the use of existing structures consistent with the statement of purpose and intent, set forth in subsection 1 of this Section. Each licensed provider of a wireless communication facility must, by law, be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the United States Congress. However, particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the policy of the Township that all users should collocate on existing wireless communication facilities and attached wireless communication facilities in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this Section, as stated above, and as stated in subsection 1. If a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it, where collocation is feasible, the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled, in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy, intent and purpose of the Township. The provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with the policy of the Township.
B. Feasibility of Collocation. Collocation shall be deemed to be “feasible” for purposes of this Section where all of the following are met:
(1) The wireless communication provider entity under consideration for collocation will undertake to pay market rent or other market compensation for collocation.
(2) The site on which collocation is being considered, taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is able to provide structural support.
(3) The collocation being considered is technologically reasonable, e.g., the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure and equipment.
(4) The height of the structure necessary for collocation will not be increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the Township, taking into consideration the several standards contained in subsection 6 of this Section.
C. Requirements for Collocation
(1) Special approval by the Planning Commission for the construction and use of a new wireless communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible collocation is not available for the coverage areas and capacity needs.
(2) All new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be designed and constructed so as to accommodate collocation.
(3) The policy of the community is for collocation. Thus, if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to alter or allow alteration of a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible collocation, such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be altered, expanded or extended in any respect.

(ARTICLE II, DIVISION 2-6, SECTION 2-600.8.C(4) cont.)
(4) If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible collocation, and this requires the construction and/or use of a new wireless communication support structure, the party failing or refusing to permit a feasible collocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy, intent and purpose of the Township, and, consequently such party shall take responsibility for the violation, and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless communication support structure within the Township for a period of five (5) years from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the collocation. Such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the ZBA if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which, in this context, shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five (5) year prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication services, or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services.
D. Procedural Incentive. Review of an application for collocation, and review of an application for a permit for use of a facility permitted under subsection 2 of this Section shall be expedited by way of review through Section 4-004.1. The Zoning Official may permit a single concept plan sheet graphically depicting the revised collocation configuration of the existing wireless communication facility as the principal review document during this review process. This concept plan, when approved, shall be incorporated as an addendum to the active site plan case file for the wireless communication facility that is subject to the collocation.
9. Removal.
A. A condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility shall be adequate provision for removal of all or part of the facility by users and owners upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events:
(1) When the facility has not been used for one hundred eighty (180) days or more. For purposes of this Section, the removal of equipment from the facility, or the cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of radio signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse.
(2) Six months after new technology is available at reasonable cost as determined by the Township Board, which permits the operation of the communication system without the requirement of the support structure or with a support structure which is lower and/or more compatible with the area.
B. The situations in which removal of a facility is required, as set forth in subsection 9.A above may be applied and limited to portions of a facility.
C. Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal, specified in subsection 9.A above, the property owner or persons who had used the facility shall immediately apply or secure the application for any required demolition or removal permits, and immediately proceed with and complete the demolition/removal, restoring the premises to an acceptable condition as reasonably determined by the Zoning Official.
D. If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has not been lawfully completed within sixty (60) days of the applicable deadline, and after at least thirty (30) days written notice, the Township may remove or secure the removal of the facility or required portions thereof, with its actual cost and reasonable administrative charge to be drawn, collected and/or enforced from or under the security posted at the time application was made for establishing the facility.
E. The person who had used the facility shall immediately notify the Zoning Official in writing if and as soon as use of a facility ceases.
10. Effect and Approval.
A. Subject to subsection 10.B below, final approval under this Section shall be effective for a period of six (6) months.
B. If construction of a wireless communication facility is commenced within two (2) miles of the land on which a facility has been approved, but on which construction has not been commenced during the six month period of effectiveness, the approval for the facility that has not been commenced shall be void thirty (30) days following notice from the Township of the commencement of the other facility unless the applicant granted approval of the facility which has not been commenced demonstrates that it would not be feasible for it to collocate on the facility that has been newly commenced.

(ARTICLE II, DIVISION 2-6, SECTION 2-601.1 cont.)
SECTION 2-601. REGULATIONS FOR ADULT ENTERTAINMENT USES
1. Purpose and Intent.
A. In the development and execution of this Section, it is recognized that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or when one (1) or more of them are located in near proximity to a residential zone or other sensitive land uses, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects shall not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood or other sensitive land uses. These special regulations are itemized in this Section. These controls are for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses within any one (1) area, or to prevent deterioration or blighting of nearby residential neighborhoods and other sensitive land uses. These controls do not legitimize activities, which are prohibited in other Township ordinances.
B. The provisions of this Section are not intended to offend the guarantees of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or to deny adults access to these types of businesses and their products, or to deny such businesses access to their intended market. Neither is it the intent of this Section to legitimize activities that are prohibited by Township ordinance or state or federal law. If any portion of this Section relating to the regulation of adult businesses is found to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Township intends said portion to be disregarded, reduced, and/or revised so as to be recognized to the fullest extent possible by law. The Township further states that it would have passed and adopted what remains of any portion of this Section relating to regulation of adult businesses following the removal, reduction, or revision of any portion so found to be invalid or unconstitutional.
2. Findings and Rationale.
A. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the Township Board, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporated in the cases of:

as well as the following articles on adult regulated uses:
“Local Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses” (2006); “Protecting Communities from Sexually Oriented Businesses” (Chapter 6, Appendices C and D) (2002); “Zoning and Free Speech: A Review of Adult Entertainment Case Law” (1991); “Local Regulation of Lawful Sex Businesses” (1999); “Zoning Ordinances and Free Speech” (2000); “Regulating Sexually Oriented Businesses” (1997); “Everything You Wanted to Know About Regulating Sex Businesses” (Chapters 2, 4 and 6); “Regulating Sex Businesses” (1996); “Sexually Oriented Businesses An Insider’s View” (2002); and “Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence” (1998),
the Township Board finds:
(1). Adult entertainment uses, as defined in Section 1-007, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
(2). Adult entertainment uses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other such uses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of such uses in one area.
(3). Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the Township has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the Township's rationale for this ordinance, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the Township's interest in regulating adult entertainment uses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future adult entertainment uses that may locate in the Township. The Township finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this Section are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
3. Dispersal Requirement. A building containing an adult entertainment use shall not be located within one thousand (1,000) feet from the property line of a zoning lot containing another adult entertainment use nor within five hundred (500) feet from the property line of any zoning lot containing one or more of the following uses:
A. Any single-family or multiple-family residential use.
B. Any Class "C" establishment licensed by the Michigan Liquor Control Commission.
C. Recreational facilities (See Recreational Facilities in Section 1-007).
D. Schools (See Educational Facilities in Section 1-007).
E. Cultural facilities (See Cultural Facilities in Section 1-007).
F. Institutional facilities (See Institutional Facilities in Section 1-007).

J. All uses identified as regulated uses in Section 2-602.
4. Measurement of Dispersal Distance. For the purpose of this Section, the dispersal of adult entertainment uses shall be measured by making a straight line, without regard to intervening buildings, structures, or objects, from the nearest portion of the building or structure used as a part of the premises where an adult entertainment use is conducted, to the nearest property line of any zoning lot containing such uses listed in subsection 2 above.
5. Acceptable Zones. Adult entertainment uses shall be prohibited from all zoning districts except C-3 and C-4 zoned zoning lots that comply with all requirements of this Section.
6. Free Standing Building Required. All adult entertainment uses shall be contained in a free standing single-use building. Enclosed malls, shopping centers, common wall buildings, and multi-uses within the same building do not constitute a free standing building.
7. Display Content. No adult entertainment use shall be conducted in any manner that permits the observation of any material depicting, describing or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas, as defined under Adult Entertainment Use in Section 1-007, from any public way or from any property not regulated as an adult entertainment use. This provision shall apply to any display, decoration, sign, show window or other opening.
SECTION 2-602. ANTI-BLIGHT REGULATION
1. Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this Section is to regulate the location and operation of certain uses identified in this Section within the Township, and to minimize the negative secondary effects of such uses. Based upon studies undertaken and reported by numerous other communities in Michigan and across the United States, which have been studied by the Township and found to have relevance and application to the Township, it is recognized that the uses identified in this Section, because of their very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics when concentrated with certain other uses under certain circumstances thereby causing negative secondary effects upon nearby residential, educational, religious, and other similar public and private uses. The regulation of such uses is necessary to ensure that their negative secondary effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of surrounding areas and will not negatively impact the health, safety, and general welfare of Township residents. The provisions of this Section are not intended to offend the guarantees of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or to deny access to these types of uses and their products, or to deny such uses access to their intended market. Neither is it the intent of this Section to legitimatize activities that are prohibited by Township ordinance or state or federal law. If any portion of this Section relating to the regulation of the uses identified in this Section is found to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Township intends said portion to be disregarded, reduced, and/or revised so as to be recognized to the fullest extent possible by law. The Township further states that it would have passed and adopted what remains of any portion of this Section relating to regulation of the uses identified in this Section following the removal, reduction, or revision of any portion so found to be invalid or unconstitutional.
2. Regulated Uses. The following uses are considered “regulated uses” for the purposes of this Section:

(ARTICLE II cont.)
DIVISION 2-7 – NONCONFORMITIES
SECTION 2-700. PURPOSE AND INTENT
It is recognized that there exists zoning lots, buildings, structures, and uses of land, buildings, and structures within the districts established by this Zoning Ordinance and subsequent amendments which were lawful before this Zoning Ordinance or an amendment to this Zoning Ordinance was adopted but would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted if conducted under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance. It is therefore the intent of this Zoning Ordinance to permit these lawful nonconformities to exist until they are abandoned, destroyed, discontinued, or removed, but also to discourage their survival through restrictions that will provide for their gradual elimination and transformation into permitted uses and conforming buildings and structures. It is further the intent of this Section that after passage of this Zoning Ordinance or an amendment to this Zoning Ordinance, nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses shall not be expanded, extended, or enlarged by any means other than as allowed in this Section. Any nonconforming building, structure, or use which cannot be proved conclusively to have been lawfully existing prior to the enactment or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed illegal and shall be brought into conformance with the regulations of this Zoning Ordinance through concerted and timely effort.
SECTION 2-701. NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
Any lot of record that does not meet the required lot width and lot area for the zoning district in which it is located shall be considered as carrying forward the original intent of the creation of the lot of record for development purposes when principal buildings and customary accessory buildings and structures can be constructed on such lots of record in conformance with all setback, height, impervious surface, and floor area requirements.
SECTION 2-702. NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
Nonconforming buildings and nonconforming structures may continue to be utilized so long as they remain otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No such building or structure shall be allowed to expand and/or undergo substantial improvement. Such buildings and structures may be altered in a way which either decreases its nonconformity upon its existing foundation to bring it in closer conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, or does not expand the nonconforming portion of a building or structure. It is recognized that in some instances a strict prohibition against expansion of a nonconforming building or structure may create an undue hardship on the property owner. In such instances, non-substantial improvements of such buildings and structures may be reasonable and necessary to preserve or improve the quality of the neighborhood or business district; provided such modifications do not threaten public health, safety or welfare nor prevent the reasonable use of neighboring property. The following improvements to nonconforming buildings and structures shall not be considered expansions or substantial improvements under this Section:
(1) Maintenance repairs, and modifications required by the Building Official to eliminate unsafe conditions.
(2) Improvements to existing parking, loading, and landscaping areas that result in a more conforming site, provided that such improvements shall comply with the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
(3) Construction of a vertical addition to an existing building or structure that will comply with all height and story restrictions of the zoning district, provided the exterior walls and overhangs of the vertical addition shall extend no closer to any property line than the existing building/structure footprint.
B. Should any portion of a nonconforming building or structure, including those improvements allowed under Section 2-702.A, be abandoned in accordance with Section 2-704, building permits for reconstruction shall not be issued by the Building Official until site plan approval is received in accordance with Section 4-004.
C. Should such building or structure sustain substantial structural damage, it shall thereafter be reconstructed in conformance to all regulations for the district in which it is located.
D. Should such building or structure be moved for any reason, for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.

(ARTICLE II, DIVISION 2-7 cont.)
SECTION 2-703. NONCONFORMING USES
In general, nonconforming uses are declared by this Zoning Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the district involved. Nonconforming uses shall be governed by the following restrictions designed to eliminate nonconforming uses and replace them with permitted uses conforming to all district regulations as rapidly as is permitted by law:
A. No nonconforming use shall be resumed on a zoning lot if the nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted use for any length of time.
B. No nonconforming use shall be intensified, enlarged, extended, moved or altered on a zoning lot.
C. No nonconforming use shall be resumed on a zoning lot where the principal building has been abandoned in accordance with Section 2-704.
D. No nonconforming use shall be changed to a different nonconforming use.
E. No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of a zoning lot from its specific location on the effective date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance, or an amendment to this Zoning Ordinance.
SECTION 2-704. ABANDONMENT
Any nonconforming building, nonconforming structure, or nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned, and such buildings, structures, and uses shall not be resumed thereafter if any of the following conditions apply:
A. When the owner declares or otherwise makes evident an intent to discontinue such use as existed at the time of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance or an amendment to this Zoning Ordinance.
B. When the nonconforming building, structure, or use has been replaced by a conforming building, structure, or use.
C. Cessation of such nonconforming use or use of nonconforming building or nonconforming structure for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months shall result in a rebuttable presumption of the owner's and any lawful occupant's intent to permanently discontinue and abandon the nonconforming use, structure, or building. At any time after said twelve (12) consecutive month period, the Zoning Official may notify the owner and any occupants in writing of said presumption and such writing shall provide the owner and any occupants at least thirty (30) days to rebut the presumption in a writing addressed and delivered to the Zoning Official by certified mail with a return receipt. If the owner and occupants fail to provide written evidence rebutting the presumption within said thirty (30) day period, the owner’s and occupant's intent to discontinue and abandon the nonconforming use, building, or structure shall thereby be established. The notice from the Zoning Official shall be sent by certified mail with a return receipt to the owner and any occupants at the mailing address of the owner listed on the Township tax rolls and at the street address of the property in question if a building with an address exists at said location.
D. When a nonconforming building or nonconforming structure has sustained substantial structural damage, or has been lifted or moved from its existing foundation for any reason or period of time.
SECTION 2-705. NONCONFORMITIES UNDER CONSTRUCTION
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in plans, construction or designated use in conformance with an approved site plan in the event actual on-site construction of a building foundation has been lawfully initiated prior to the effective date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance or an amendment to this Zoning Ordinance and upon which actual construction, including associated demolition and excavation, has been diligently carried on, provided that the approved site plan work shall be completed within one (1) year from the effective date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance or an amendment to this Zoning Ordinance.
SECTION 2-706. USES UNDER SPECIAL APPROVAL PROVISIONS NOT NON-CONFORMING USES
Any use that is approved as a special approval use under Section 4-006 of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, and shall without further action be considered a conforming use, subject to all applicable special land use requirements and conditions.
SECTION 2-707. CHANGE IN TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP
A change in tenancy, ownership or management of any nonconforming use, building, or structure does not affect any established nonconforming rights, provided there is no change in the nature, character, or extent of such nonconforming use, building, or structure in conformity with the Zoning Ordinance.
SECTION 2-708. CLASS OF USE EXEMPTION
Religious facilities, cemetery establishments, educational facilities, governmental facilities, public utility facilities, and parks shall be exempt from the regulations of this Division.

B. Boundaries indicated as approximately following zoning lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines.
C. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the corporate limits of the Township shall be construed as following such limits.
D. Boundaries indicated as following shore lines shall be construed to follow such shore lines, and in the event of a natural change in the shore line shall be construed as moving with the actual shore line; boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streams, rivers, canals, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines.
E. Distances not specifically indicated on the zoning map shall be determined by reference to the legislative action of the Township Board establishing the zoning of the property.
F. Where physical features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the zoning map, or in other circumstances not covered by rules A through E above, the ZBA shall interpret the district boundaries upon written application or upon its own motion.
G. All streets, alleys, and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting upon such streets, alleys, or railroad rights-of-way.
H. Whenever any street, alley or other public way within the Township shall have been vacated by action of the responsible governmental entity, the vacated property, when legally attached to and combined with an adjoining zoning lot, shall assume without further action of the Township the zoning district designation, and shall be subject to the same zoning regulations of the adjoining zoning lot with which it was combined.
SECTION 3-104. ZONING OF VACATED AREAS
Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by final official governmental action, the vacated land shall automatically be classified in the zoning district as the property to which it is attached, and should such vacation be bordered on each side by different districts, the center of such vacated area shall be the dividing line.

DIVISION 3-3 - SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION 3-300. PURPOSE AND INTENT
The R-1 through R-1E Single-Family Residential Districts are intended to provide for environmentally sound areas of predominantly low-density, single-family dwellings, through the varying of lot sizes and the development options which will accommodate a broad spectrum of housing building sizes and designs appealing to the widest spectrum of the population. In addition to the five traditional single-family residential zoning districts, there is an overlay zoning district that is designed and intended to achieve two purposes: reserve and maintain zoning lots within residential developments throughout the Township for required private open space and neighborhood parks, and provide for creative lower density arrangements of single-family residential dwellings while accounting for and preserving the natural features including upland areas that are present on the zoning lots within the southwest section of the Township.
SECTION 3-301. PROHIBITED USES
It is the intent of this Division to specifically prohibit uses which are not listed in this Division as permitted or special approval uses. Subject to the provisions of ARTICLE II, Division 2-7, uses that are being conducted upon zoning lots within these districts that are not listed as permitted or special approval uses within the district shall be deemed in violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
SECTION 3-302. REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO PROPERTIES IN THE R-1 THROUGH R-1E ZONING DISTRICTS

(B) within accessory buildings, such as a garage, or accessory structures constructed in accordance with the Waterford Township Building Code for such vehicle parking.
(C) in the side or rear yards, including such yards of contiguous lots improved and maintained for residential use.
Vehicles shall not be parked in any other portion of the front yard, or on residential zoning lots without a principal residential building.
(2) The following vehicles, equipment, and/or their attached apparatus are expressly prohibited from being parked on rights-of-way and nonmotorized pathways:

Parking of such vehicles shall only be permitted when the vehicles are in good repair, properly licensed and registered, and operated by an occupant of the principal building on the property. Any parking of personal commercial vehicles that are used in conjunction with the
operation of a business on a residential property that is prohibited by this Zoning Ordinance is also prohibited.
(4) No person shall elevate, block, or stabilize any vehicle outside of a garage, accessory building, or carport, except a registered vehicle with jack stands on the driveway for a period not to exceed forty-eight (48) hours in order to complete minor repairs to the vehicle.

Such recreational vehicles shall not exceed thirteen (13) feet in height, shall be located between five (5) and ten (10) feet from the principal building or an accessory building, and located no closer than twenty (20) feet from the front lot line.
Solely for purposes of this limitation, recreational vehicles used in conjunction with one another such as a boat mounted upon a boat trailer shall be considered as one recreational vehicle provided that all vehicles are in good repair.

(ARTICLE III, DIVISION 3-3, SECTION 3-302 cont.)
2. Raising and Keeping of Animals. It is recognized that the keeping of an unlimited number of domestic animals within residential districts for a considerable period of time detracts from and, in many instances, is detrimental to the healthful and comfortable use of such districts. The keeping of the following domestic animals is permitted, subject to the following regulations and limitations:
(A) Container Pets;
(B) Household pets, if there are not more than three (3) such pets of any one genus and no more than a total of five (5) household pets, boarded or kept on a single zoning lot, except that a litter of puppies or a litter of kittens may be kept for a period not exceeding five (5) months from birth, unless otherwise permitted under this Zoning Ordinance;
(C) Non-household domestic animals:
(i) Domestic small livestock as a special approval use on zoning lots less than five (5) contiguous acres in size, subject to the review and approval of the use in accordance with Section 4-006 and any conditions, such as the number of such animals, maintenance requirements, and location and type of containment areas, hereinafter imposed for each such use.
(ii) Domestic small livestock are permitted on zoning lots five (5) contiguous acres or greater in size.
(iii) Domestic hoofed livestock, if there are no more than three (3) such animals, the zoning lot is at least five (5) contiguous acres in size, and the character of the neighborhood within a one quarter (¼) mile radius reflects an average zoning lot size of not less than three (3) acres, unless otherwise permitted under this Zoning Ordinance.
The keeping of the above domestic animals shall not be permitted to constitute a nuisance to persons living in the surrounding area. Upon receipt of a written complaint filed by a neighbor with the Township stating the domestic animals constitute a nuisance, the ZBA shall hold a hearing with notice to all property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the property where the animals are kept. The ZBA shall determine whether the domestic animals constitute a nuisance under Sections 2-205 and/or 2-206 and also determine whether the Right to Farm Act applies. If the ZBA determines the domestic animals have and will likely continue to constitute a nuisance, and that the Right to Farm Act is not applicable, the domestic animals shall not be kept on the property after the removal date set by the ZBA. If, in the opinion of the ZBA, where the Right to Farm Act is not applicable and there is reason to believe that timely measures will be taken to alleviate the nuisance associated with the domestic animals, the ZBA may permit the domestic animals to remain and may establish criteria and a timeline for revocation of such permission. This process shall also be used by the ZBA to make decisions on zoning lots where the keeping of domestic animals was granted through special approval use by the Planning Commission under the previous zoning ordinance and is now not permitted under this Zoning Ordinance.
3. Accessory Buildings, Accessory Structures, and Accessory Uses. Accessory buildings and accessory structures shall in no instance be located in a right-of-way unless otherwise permitted. The following accessory buildings, accessory structures, and accessory uses (Unless otherwise referenced, for definitions of specific types of buildings, structures, and uses listed in this subsection, see the respective subdefinitions under Building, Structure, or Use in Section 1-007) shall be permitted in single-family residential districts as secondary and clearly incidental to the principal use and principal building on the same zoning lot when they are established and maintained in conjuction with the permitted principal use, or use granted special approval by the Planning Commission; provided that, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, it is in compliance with Sections 3-900 and 3-901 and all other applicable provisions in this Zoning Ordinance and the Waterford Code of Ordinances:
A. Accessory buildings and accessory structures, subject to all of the following conditions:
(1) A building permit is obtained when required, and such building or structure is inspected and approved by the Building Official.
(2) All other approval processes, when required by applicable sections of this Zoning Ordinance, are followed and approvals are received.
(3) There must be a principal building on the zoning lot to which the subject building or structure is accessory.
(4) Where an accessory building or accessory structure is structurally attached to a principal building or is less than ten (10) feet distant from a principal building, it must conform to the setback requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.

5. Residential Zoning Lot Development Limitations. In all single-family residential districts, only one principal building shall be placed on a zoning lot.
6. Dwellings in other than Principal Buildings. Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered to provide a dwelling unit shall be considered the principal building on a zoning lot and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Zoning Ordinance, there shall not be more than one such building on each zoning lot.
7. Fences. Fences shall follow the contour of the ground upon which they are secured, subject only to the flexibility limitations of the fencing materials used. Therefore, the height at any given location along a fence shall be measured from a point on the ground perpendicular to the fence height point being measured. Where pre-constructed fence panels limit fencing from following the ground’s contour between the fence posts upon which a fence panel is secured, the height of the fence shall be measured from the closest point on the ground perpendicular to where the fence panel is secured to a fence post. All fences of any kind located in single-family residential districts shall conform to the following regulations (Please also refer to Figures VII-62 through VII-65 on Pages VII-33 and VII-34 in Article VII):
A. Fences may be located on any property line provided that no fence shall be higher than four (4) feet above the grade plane in any required front yard or lake front yard, or on any lot line bordering a required front yard or corner street front yard. Fences located on any other property line shall be no higher than six (6) feet above the grade plane. For zoning lots with an immediate grade differential along the property line, the intent of this subsection is to allow the maximum fence height to be measured from the highest points of the grade differential along the property line, provided the fence height is not a clear vision obstruction to the movement of motorized and nonmotorized traffic.
B. All fences shall be constructed of materials listed in the SPL Manual to meet all standards of the Waterford Code of Ordinances, Buildings and Building Regulations and shall be adequately maintained to be safe and in good condition.
C. Fences located off the property line and not within any required yard shall not exceed eight (8) feet in height above the grade plane.
D. Barbed wire, spikes, nails or any other sharp pointed protrusions of any kind are prohibited on top or on the sides of any fence, wall or protective barrier. For purposes of this subsection, the term “sharp pointed protrusions” shall be defined as meaning all fence material extending above the highest continuous horizontal fence component and possessing a horizontal surface area at the tip of each protrusion that is less than 0.0625 square inch, with the width and/or depth of this horizontal surface area measuring less than 0.25 lineal inch.
E. Electrical fences above grade shall be prohibited.
8. Screening and Landscaping.
A. Development of zoning lots requiring single-family residential plot plan review in accordance with Section 4-010 are exempt from the requirements of this subsection. Effective screening and landscaping of larger single-family residential developments is vital to the general welfare and continued vitality of all land uses in the Township. Screening is necessary for certain uses in order to make them more compatible with adjacent uses and to protect the adjacent uses from the effects of noise, light, traffic, litter and other negative or incompatible characteristics. Similarly, landscaping together with the proper utilization and preservation of existing natural features is important in land development because it can enhance the community’s quality of life, improve property values, reduce the harsh characteristics of intensive development, and help to make all land uses more compatible.
B. In order to achieve these objectives, all properties within the single-family residential zoning districts requiring major site plan review shall comply with the following requirements in the manner provided in the SPL Manual:
(1) All landscape areas identified on an approved landscape plan shall be continuously maintained in a healthy, growing condition using irrigation systems and maintenance standards without limitation, identified in the SPL Manual. Failure to maintain such landscaped areas in such a manner, including removal and replacement of dead or diseased plant materials, shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.

(ARTICLE III, DIVISION 3-3, SECTION 3-302.8.B cont.)
(2) A greenbelt possessing a minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be provided along all major arterial streets, minor arterial streets, and collector streets. The Planning Commission may require the enhancement of such a greenbelt with a landscaping screen or increase the width of the greenbelt when a residential development abuts a major arterial street and it determines that a larger greenbelt is necessary pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.
(3) Landscaping and street trees shall be installed and maintained.
C. The Planning Commission may grant a special exception allowing for a reduction or waiver in the landscape area and/or landscape material required under this subsection, but only if such landscaping or screening would serve no useful purpose or would entail substantial noneconomic hardship for the developer relative to achieving the benefits and objectives stated in this subsection. In addition to the above factors, the Planning Commission shall base its decision on the following considerations along with any other relevant information:
(1) The character, scope, and site design of the proposed use of the property.
(2) The character, design and uses of the adjacent properties.
(3) The natural features, including the terrain, trees, and other vegetation, of the property.

A. Vehicle Parking.
(1) Parking of licensed and operable personal vehicles not prohibited under this Section is permitted in the established parking area.
(2) The following vehicles, equipment, and/or their attached apparatus are expressly prohibited from being parked on rights-of-way and nonmotorized pathways:

5. Fences. Fences shall follow the contour of the ground upon which they are secured, subject only to the flexibility limitations of the fencing materials used. Therefore, the height at any given location along a fence shall be measured from a point on the ground perpendicular to the fence height point being measured. Where pre-constructed fence panels limit fencing from following the ground’s contour between the fence posts upon which a fence panel is secured, the height of the fence shall be measured from the closest point on the ground perpendicular to where the fence panel is secured to a fence post.

Fences located on any other property line shall be no higher than six (6) feet above the grade plane. For zoning lots with an immediate grade differential along the property line, the intent of this subsection is to allow the maximum fence height to be measured from the highest points of the grade differential along the property line, provided the fence height is not a clear vision obstruction to the movement of motorized and nonmotorized traffic.
B. All fences shall be constructed of materials listed in the SPL Manual to meet all standards of the Waterford Code of Ordinances, Buildings and Building Regulations and shall be adequately maintained to be safe and in good condition.
C. Fences located off the property line and not within any required yard shall not exceed eight (8) feet in height above the grade plane.
D. Barbed wire, spikes, nails, or any other sharp pointed protrusions of any kind are prohibited on top of or on the sides of any fence, wall, or protective barrier. For purposes of this subsection, the term “sharp pointed protrusions” shall be defined as meaning all fence material extending above the highest continuous horizontal fence component and possessing a horizontal surface area at the tip of each protrusion that is less than 0.0625 square inch, with the width and/or depth of this horizontal surface area measuring less than 0.25 lineal inch.
E. Electrical fences above grade shall be prohibited.
6. Screening and Landscaping.
A. Effective screening and landscaping is vital to the general welfare and continued vitality of all land uses in the Township. Screening is necessary for certain uses in order to make them more compatible with adjacent uses and to protect the adjacent uses from the effects of noise, light, traffic, litter and other negative or incompatible characteristics. Similarly, landscaping together with the proper utilization and preservation of existing natural features is important in land development because it can enhance the community’s quality of life, improve property values, reduce the harsh characteristics of intensive development, and help to make all land uses more compatible.
B. In order to achieve these objectives, all properties within the multiple-family residential zoning districts shall comply with the following requirements in the manner provided in the SPL Manual:

(1) All landscape areas identified on an approved landscape plan shall be continuously maintained in a healthy, growing condition using irrigation systems and maintenance standards, without limitation, identified in the SPL Manual. Failure to maintain such landscaped areas in such a manner, including removal and replacement of dead or diseased plant materials, shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
(2) A greenbelt possessing a minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be provided along all major arterial streets, minor arterial streets, and collector streets. The Planning Commission may enhance such a greenbelt with a landscaping screen or increase the width of the greenbelt when a residential development abuts a major arterial street and it determines that a larger greenbelt is necessary pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.
(3) A greenbelt possessing a minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be provided on the same zoning lot along all property lines abutting single-family residential zoning districts and previously developed office, commercial, and higher intensity use zoning districts which lack buffering screening and landscaping in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. The Planning Commission may require the enhancement of such a greenbelt with a landscaping screen or increase the width of the greenbelt along a shared property line with a commercial or higher intensity use zoning district when it determines that a larger greenbelt is necessary pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.
(4) A combination of interior landscape areas shall be provided to: achieve traffic safety through effective definition of off-street parking areas, enhance positive drainage from buildings and impervious surface areas, and to provide for the general welfare of the residents. The total area of interior landscaping provided shall include, but not be limited to, landscaping near building entrances, along building foundations, along pedestrian walkways, along service areas, and in off-street parking areas.
(5) All waste material container areas required as part of a site plan shall be screened and maintained.
C. The Planning Commission may grant a special exception allowing for a reduction or waiver in the landscape area and/or landscape material required under this subsection, but only if such landscaping or screening would serve no useful purpose or would entail substantial noneconomic hardship for the developer relative to achieving the benefits and objectives stated in this subsection. In addition to the above factors, the Planning Commission shall base its decision on the following considerations along with any other relevant information:
(1) The character, scope, and site design of the multiple-family development, especially the proximity of buildings, parking areas, and common use or recreational areas to the residential property intended to be screened.
(2) The character, design, and use of the adjacent properties to be screened.
(3) The natural features, including the terrain, trees, and other vegetation that may act as a natural screen or buffer.

(ARTICLE III, DIVISION 3-5, SECTION 3-502 cont.)
5. Fences. Fences shall follow the contour of the ground upon which they are secured, subject only to the flexibility limitations of the fencing materials used. Therefore, the height at any given location along a fence shall be measured from a point on the ground perpendicular to the fence height point being measured. Where pre-constructed fence panels limit fencing from following the ground’s contour between the fence posts upon which a fence panel is secured, the height of the fence shall be measured from the closest point on the ground perpendicular to where the fence panel is secured to a fence post. All fences of any kind located in public districts shall conform to the following regulations (Please also refer to Figures VII-62 through VII-65 on Pages VII-33 and VII-34 in Article VII):
A. Fences may be located on any property line provided that no fence shall be higher than four (4) feet above the grade plane in any required front yard or lake front yard, or on any lot line bordering a required front yard or corner street front yard. Fences located on any other property line shall be no higher than six (6) feet above the grade plane. For zoning lots with an immediate grade differential along the property line at the point of an abutting residential zoning district, the fence or wall shall be constructed with a base measurement from the high point of the grade along the property line, provided the fence height is not a clear vision obstruction to the movement of motorized and nonmotorized traffic.

C. Fences located off the property line and not within any required yard shall not exceed eight (8) feet in height above the grade plane.
D. Spikes, nails or any other sharp pointed protrusions of any kind are prohibited on top or on the sides of any fence, wall, or protective barrier. For purposes of this subsection, the term “sharp pointed protrusions” shall be defined as meaning all fence material extending above the highest continuous horizontal fence component and possessing a horizontal surface area at the tip of each protrusion that is less than 0.0625 square inch, with the width and/or depth of this horizontal surface area measuring less than 0.25 lineal inch. Barbed wire is prohibited on the sides, but may be placed on top of fences, walls, or protective barriers provided that the barbed wire cradles shall consist of no more than three (3) strands of wire and shall face into the property which it is to protect.
E. Electrical fences above grade shall be prohibited.
6. Screening and Landscaping.
A. Effective screening and landscaping is vital to the general welfare and continued vitality of all land uses in the Township. Screening is necessary for certain uses in order to make them more compatible with adjacent uses and to protect the adjacent uses from the effects of noise, light, traffic, litter and other negative or incompatible characteristics. Similarly, landscaping together with the proper utilization and preservation of existing natural features is important in land development because it can enhance the community’s quality of life, improve property values, reduce the harsh characteristics of intensive development, and help to make all land uses more compatible.
B. In order to achieve these objectives, all properties within the public zoning districts shall comply with the following requirements in the manner provided in the SPL Manual:
(1) All landscape areas identified on an approved landscape plan shall be continuously maintained in a healthy, growing condition using irrigation systems and maintenance standards without limitation, identified in the SPL Manual. Failure to maintain such landscaped areas in such a manner, including removal and replacement of dead or diseased plant materials, shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
(2) A greenbelt possessing a minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be provided along all major arterial streets, minor arterial streets, and collector streets. The Planning Commission may enhance such a greenbelt with a landscaping screen or increase the width of the greenbelt when a residential development abuts a major arterial street and it determines that a larger greenbelt is necessary pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.
(3) A greenbelt possessing a minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be provided on the same zoning lot along all property lines abutting single-family and multiple-family residential zoning districts and previously developed office, commercial, and higher intensity use zoning districts which lack buffering screening and landscaping in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. The Planning Commission may require the enhancement of such a greenbelt with a landscaping screen or increase the width of the greenbelt along a shared property line with a commercial or higher intensity use zoning district when it determines that a larger greenbelt is necessary pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.

(ARTICLE III, DIVISION 3-5, SECTION 3-502.6.B cont.)
(4) A combination of interior landscape areas shall be provided to: achieve traffic safety through effective definition of off-street parking areas, enhance positive drainage from buildings and impervious surface areas, and to provide for the general welfare of the residents. The total area of interior landscaping provided shall include, but not be limited to, landscaping near building entrances, along building foundations, along pedestrian walkways, along service areas, and in off-street parking areas.
(5) All waste material container areas required as part of a site plan shall be screened and maintained.
C. The Planning Commission may grant a special exception allowing for a reduction or waiver in the landscape area and/or landscape material required under this subsection, but only if such landscaping or screening would serve no useful purpose or would entail substantial noneconomic hardship for the developer relative to achieving the benefits and objectives stated in this subsection. The Planning Commission may grant such a waiver exclusively for the proposed use, reserving the right to require establishment of all landscape requirements when there is a change of use. When such a temporary waiver is approved by the Planning Commission, such waiver shall be recorded on the property in such form and language acceptable to the Township Attorney. In addition to the above factors, the Planning Commission shall base its decision on the following considerations along with any other relevant information:
(1) The character, scope, and site design of the proposed use of the property.
(2) The character, design, and uses of the adjacent properties to be screened.
(3) The natural features, including the terrain, trees, and other vegetation that may act as a natural screen or buffer.

5. Screening and Landscaping.
A. Effective screening and landscaping is vital to the general welfare and continued vitality of all land uses in the Township. Screening is necessary for certain uses in order to make them more compatible with adjacent uses and to protect the adjacent uses from the effects of noise, light, traffic, litter and other negative or incompatible characteristics. Similarly, landscaping together with the proper utilization and preservation of existing natural features is important in land development because it can enhance the community’s quality of life, improve property values, reduce the harsh characteristics of intensive development, and help to make all land uses more compatible.
B. In order to achieve these objectives, all properties within the office zoning districts shall comply with the following requirements in the manner provided in the SPL Manual:
(1) All landscape areas identified on an approved landscape plan shall be continuously maintained in a healthy, growing condition using irrigation systems and maintenance standards without limitation, identified in the SPL Manual. Failure to maintain such landscaped areas in such a manner, including removal and replacement of dead or diseased plant materials, shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
(2) A greenbelt possessing a minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be provided along all major arterial streets, minor arterial streets, and collector streets. The Planning Commission may enhance such a greenbelt with a landscaping screen or increase the width of the greenbelt when a residential development abuts a major arterial street and it determines that a larger greenbelt is necessary pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.
(3) A greenbelt possessing a minimum width of ten (10) feet or a minimum five (5) feet wide buffer area containing a fence wall shall be provided on the same zoning lot along all property lines abutting single-family and multiple-family residential zoning districts and previously developed commercial and higher intensity use zoning districts which lack screening and landscaping along such property lines in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. The Planning Commission may require the enhancement of such a greenbelt with a landscaping screen or increase the width of the greenbelt along a shared property line with a commercial or higher intensity use zoning district when it determines that a larger greenbelt is necessary pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.
(4) A combination of interior landscape areas shall be provided to: achieve traffic safety through effective definition of off-street parking areas, enhance positive drainage from buildings and impervious surface areas, and to provide for the general welfare of the residents. The total area of interior landscaping provided shall include, but not be limited to, landscaping near building entrances, along building foundations, along pedestrian walkways, along service areas, and in off-street parking areas.
(5) The required landscaping under this subsection shall be installed prior to receiving a final certificate of occupancy.
(6) All waste material container areas required as part of a site plan shall be screened and maintained.
C. The Planning Commission may grant a special exception allowing for a reduction or waiver in the landscape area and/or landscape material required under this subsection, but only if such landscaping or screening would serve no useful purpose or would entail substantial noneconomic hardship for the developer relative to achieving the benefits and objectives stated in this subsection. The Planning Commission may grant such a waiver exclusively for the proposed use, reserving the right to require establishment of all landscape requirements when there is a change of use. When such a temporary waiver is approved by the Planning Commission, such waiver shall be recorded on the property in such form and language acceptable to the Township Attorney. In addition to the above factors, the Planning Commission shall base its decision on the following considerations along with any other relevant information:
(1) The character, scope, and site design of the proposed use of the property.
(2) The character, design, and uses of the adjacent properties to be screened.
(3) The natural features, including the terrain, trees, and other vegetation that may act as a natural screen or buffer.

DIVISION 3-7 - COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION 3-700. PURPOSE AND INTENT
The C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-UB, and C-UL Commercial Districts are designed to provide for a range of commercial development and uses in the Township, while at the same time preserving the general welfare of adjacent and nearby residential areas. This Division establishes six (6) commercial districts, each of which is designed for certain locations where its specific combinations of use, area, bulk, and other requirements will provide a scope of commercial uses compatible with the surrounding area. In determining uses for inclusion in each district, intensity factors including trip generation characteristics, trade and service area characteristics, typical hours of operation, and other determinants of use compatibility and transition have been considered.
In addition to the six (6) traditional commercial zoning districts, overlay zoning districts may be adopted and included in this Division as amendments to this Zoning Ordinance to implement the Master Plan goals identified for the areas designated as Planned Destination, Regional Commerce, Central Community Business, Commercial Corridor Gateways, and the Historic District. Overlay districts that are adopted as part of this Zoning Ordinance shall be designed and intended to apply and promote innovative design principles, apply a balanced mixture of land uses, improve and enhance nonmotorized transportation infrastructure, apply traffic calming measures, effectively manage stormwater, and provide for effective emergency vehicle access. Overlay zoning districts, when adopted as part of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be limited to zoning lots completely within the boundaries of the areas specified in the purpose statement of each overlay district. The intent of overlay districts is to include development parameters that, when identified conditions are met, the use and promotion of innovative design principles can be achieved through the flexible application of the standards found in Sections 3-900 and 3-901 for the underlying zoning district.
SECTION 3-701. PROHIBITED USES
It is the intent of this Division to specifically prohibit uses which are not listed in this Division as permitted or special approval uses.

5. Screening and Landscaping.
A. Effective screening and landscaping is vital to the general welfare and continued vitality of all land uses in the Township. Screening is necessary for certain uses in order to make them more compatible with adjacent uses and to protect the adjacent uses from the effects of noise, light, traffic, litter and other negative or incompatible characteristics. Similarly, landscaping together with the proper utilization and preservation of existing natural features is important in land development because it can enhance the community’s quality of life, improve property values, reduce the harsh characteristics of intensive development, and help to make all land uses more compatible.
B. In order to achieve these objectives, all properties within the commercial zoning districts shall comply with the following requirements in the manner provided in the SPL Manual:
(1) All landscape areas identified on an approved landscape plan shall be continuously maintained in a healthy, growing condition using irrigation systems and maintenance standards without limitation, identified in the SPL Manual. Failure to maintain such landscaped areas in such a manner, including removal and replacement of dead or diseased plant materials, shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
(2) A greenbelt possessing a minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be provided along all major arterial streets, minor arterial streets, and collector streets. The Planning Commission may enhance such a greenbelt with a landscaping screen or increase the width of the greenbelt when a residential development abuts a major arterial street and it determines that a larger greenbelt is necessary pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.
(3) A transitional yard (See Yard in Section 1-007) incorporating a minimum ten (10) feet wide greenbelt with a landscaping screen, or a minimum five (5) feet wide greenbelt with a fence wall, shall be provided on the same zoning lot along all property lines abutting single-family and multiple-family residential zoning districts. For uses listed in Sections 3-705.5 and 3-706.5, the Planning Commission may require a transitional yard greenbelt width up to thirty (30) feet containing a fence wall and/or a landscaping screen pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.
(4) A greenbelt possessing a minimum width of ten (10) feet or a minimum five (5) feet wide buffer area containing a fence wall shall be provided on the same zoning lot along all property lines abutting previously developed office and higher intensity use zoning districts which lack screening and landscaping in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. The Planning Commission may require the enhancement of such a greenbelt with a landscaping screen or increase the width of the greenbelt up to twenty (20) feet along a shared property line with a higher intensity use zoning district when it determines that a larger greenbelt is necessary pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.
(5) A combination of interior landscape areas shall be provided to achieve traffic safety through effective definition of off-street parking areas, enhance positive drainage from buildings and impervious surface areas, and to provide for the general welfare of the residents. The total area of interior landscaping provided shall include, but not be limited to, landscaping near building entrances, along building foundations, along pedestrian walkways, along service areas, and in off-street parking areas.
(6) The required landscaping under this subsection shall be installed prior to receiving a final certificate of occupancy.
(7) All waste material container areas required as part of a site plan shall be screened and maintained.
C. The Planning Commission may grant a special exception allowing for a reduction or waiver in the landscape area and/or landscape material required, but only if full screening would serve no useful purpose or would entail substantial noneconomic hardship for the developer relative to the positive screening benefit to adjacent properties. The Planning Commission may also grant such a waiver exclusively for the proposed use, reserving the right to require establishment of all landscape requirements when there is a change of use. When such a temporary waiver is approved by the Planning Commission, such waiver shall be recorded on the property in such form and language acceptable to the Township Attorney. In addition to the above factors, the Planning Commission shall base its decision on the following considerations along with any other relevant information:
(1) The character, scope, and site design of the proposed use of the property.
(2) The character, design, and uses of the adjacent properties to be screened.
(3) The natural features, including the terrain, trees, and other vegetation that may act as a natural screen or buffer.

B. All fences shall be constructed of materials listed in the SPL Manual to meet all standards of the Waterford Code of Ordinances, Buildings and Building Regulations and shall be adequately maintained to be safe and in good condition.
C. Spikes, nails, or any other sharp pointed protrusions of any kind are prohibited on top of or on the sides of any fence, wall, or protective barrier. For purposes of this subsection, the term “sharp pointed protrusions” shall be defined as meaning all fence material extending above the highest continuous horizontal fence component and possessing a horizontal surface area at the tip of each protrusion that is less than 0.0625 square inch, with the width and/or depth of this horizontal surface area measuring less than 0.25 lineal inch. Barbed wire is prohibited on the sides, but may be placed on top of fences, wall or protective barriers provided that the barbed wire cradles shall consist of no more than three (3) strands of wire and shall face into the property which it is to protect.
D. Electrical fences above grade shall be prohibited.
E. Fences along property lines shall have no openings for vehicular traffic except as may be approved by the Fire Chief.
5. Screening and Landscaping.
A. Effective screening and landscaping is vital to the general welfare and continued vitality of all land uses in the Township. Screening is necessary for certain uses in order to make them more compatible with adjacent uses and to protect the adjacent uses from the effects of noise, light, traffic, litter and other negative or incompatible characteristics. Similarly, landscaping together with the proper utilization and preservation of existing natural features is important in land development because it can enhance the community’s quality of life, improve property values, reduce the harsh characteristics of intensive development, and help to make all land uses more compatible.
B. In order to achieve these objectives, all properties within the higher intensity use zoning districts shall comply with the following requirements in the manner provided in the SPL Manual, unless otherwise provided by this Zoning Ordinance:
(1) All landscape areas identified on an approved landscape plan shall be continuously maintained in a healthy, growing condition using irrigation systems and maintenance standards without limitation, identified in the SPL Manual. Failure to maintain such landscaped areas in such a manner, including removal and replacement of dead or diseased plant materials, shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
(2) A greenbelt possessing a minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be provided along all major arterial streets, minor arterial streets, and collector streets. The Planning Commission may require the enhancement of such a greenbelt with a landscaping screen or increase the width of the greenbelt when a residential development abuts a major arterial street and it determines that a larger greenbelt is necessary pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.

(3) A transitional yard (See Yard in Section 1-007) incorporating a minimum thirty (30) feet wide greenbelt with a landscaping screen and a fence wall shall be provided on the same zoning lot along all property lines abutting single-family and multiple-family residential zoning districts. For uses listed in Sections 3-806.5 and 3-807, the Planning Commission may require a transitional yard greenbelt width up to fifty (50) feet containing a fence wall and a landscaping screen pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.
(4) A greenbelt possessing a minimum width of twenty (20) feet buffer area containing a fence wall shall be provided on the same zoning lot along all property lines abutting previously developed office and commercial use zoning districts which lack screening and landscaping in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. The Planning Commission may require the enhancement of such a greenbelt with a landscaping screen or increase the width of the greenbelt up to thirty (30) feet when it determines that a larger greenbelt is necessary pursuant to standards set forth in the SPL Manual.
(5) A combination of interior landscape areas shall be provided to: achieve traffic safety through effective definition of off-street parking areas, enhance positive drainage from buildings and impervious surface areas, and to provide for the general welfare of the residents. The total area of interior landscaping provided shall include, but not be limited to, landscaping near building entrances, along building foundations, along pedestrian walkways, along service areas, and in off-street parking areas.
(6) The required landscaping under this subsection shall be installed prior to receiving a final certificate of occupancy.
(7) All waste material container areas required as part of a site plan shall be screened and maintained.
C. The Planning Commission may grant a special exception allowing for a reduction or waiver in the landscape area and/or landscape material required, but only if full screening would serve no useful purpose or would entail substantial noneconomic hardship for the developer relative to the positive screening benefit to adjacent properties. The Planning Commission may also grant such a waiver exclusively for the proposed use, reserving the right to require establishment of all landscape requirements when there is a change of use. When such a temporary waiver is approved by the Planning Commission, such waiver shall be recorded on the property in such form and language acceptable to the Township Attorney. In addition to the above factors, the Planning Commission shall base its decision on the following considerations along with any other relevant information:
(1) The character, scope, and site design of the proposed use of the property.
(2) The character, design, and uses of the adjacent properties to be screened.
(3) The natural features, including the terrain, trees, and other vegetation that may act as a natural screen or buffer.

Waterford Township Zoning Ordinance ARTICLE III - ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Page III-71
ADOPTED FEBRUARY 22, 2010, EFFECTIVE MARCH 10, 2010, AMENDED THROUGH APRIL 3, 2019
(ARTICLE III, DIVISION 3-9 cont.)
SECTION 3-901. FOOTNOTES GOVERNING ZONING LOT, AREA, AND BULK REGULATIONS
Footnote 1 - In all zoning districts a tax parcel must conform as a zoning lot to all requirements of the Schedule of Regulations for the Zoning District in which it is located before it can be developed, with the following exceptions:
A. In the A-1, Airport District, tax parcels established by the County of Oakland as lease property within areas of a County-owned zoning lot shall possess such setbacks within tax parcels as established by the County of Oakland. If such tax parcels are established along a State highway or County road, the setbacks required by Section 3-900 shall be required within the tax parcel.
B. Tax parcels established within areas of a zoning lot by the Township for purposes of identifying lease property for wireless communication facilities regulated by Section 2-600 shall not require setback requirements within the boundaries of such tax parcels.
C. As part of a condominium development that is not a site condominium, the Planning Commission may exempt areas within individual tax parcels established as condominium units from the setback requirements of Section 3-900 where such condominium developments conform to all other Zoning Ordinance requirements.
Footnote 2
A. The intent of establishing a maximum impervious surface for the development of a zoning lot is:
(1) to ensure that each zoning lot possesses sufficient surface area to provide onsite stormwater drainage capacity that will prevent all but the most catastrophic flow of stormwater from flowing onto neighboring properties,
(2) to prevent an excessive total impervious surface area that would severely restrict or eliminate such onsite stormwater drainage capacity,
(3) to make certain that there is sufficient area on a zoning lot for the installation and maintenance of required landscaping and natural buffering, and
(4) to implement Master Plan Goal Six, To Ensure and Enforce Land Use Development Practices that are Sensitive to Waterford’s Natural Environment.
B. The availability of new engineering techniques for stormwater control and green building practices may be utilized to increase the maximum impervious surface on a zoning lot after review and approval by the Township Engineer. The Township Engineer may authorize an increase in the maximum impervious surface for a zoning lot provided that such increases shall not supersede or reduce required yard setbacks, open space, and landscape buffering; and shall conform to the Township Engineering Standards and the following limitations:
(1) For zoning lots in the R-1 through R-1E zoning districts:
(A) The total impervious surface area within the required front yard of a zoning lot shall not exceed a maximum of thirty-five (35) percent of the total required front yard area.
(B) The impervious surface for the zoning lot shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the lot area.
(2) For zoning lots in the R-M1 and R-M2 zoning districts, the impervious surface for the zoning lot shall not exceed seventy-five (75) percent of the lot area.
(3) For zoning lots in all nonresidential zoning districts, the impervious surface for the zoning lot shall not exceed ninety (90) percent of the lot area.
Footnote 3 - A lot of record that is part of a subdivision plat approved prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance shall be considered in conformance with the lot area and lot width standards of this Zoning Ordinance when such lot of record can conform to all of the following:
A. All buildings shall be contained within a building envelope where the front yard and rear yard setbacks are each a minimum of thirty-five (35) feet;
B. All buildings and building appurtenances shall be contained within a building envelope where each side yard setback shall be a minimum of five (5) feet and where applicable comply with Footnote 7.A; and
C. The principal building shall conform to the minimum floor area requirement for the zoning district in which the lot of record is located.
Waterford Township Zoning Ordinance ARTICLE III - ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Page III-72
ADOPTED FEBRUARY 22, 2010, EFFECTIVE MARCH 10, 2010, AMENDED THROUGH APRIL 3, 2019
(ARTICLE III, DIVISION 3-9, SECTION 3-901 cont.)
Footnote 4 - The historical development pattern of Waterford’s lakefront zoning lots is diverse, where many lake shorelines were developed with deeper lakefront yard building setbacks than the minimum required by the Zoning Ordinance. Because of such diversity, establishing a uniform lakefront yard building setback may threaten the established character of lakefront neighborhoods and established open views of the lakefront. In order to protect the established character of lakefront neighborhoods, ensure compatibility with the scale of surrounding homes, and protect established open views of the lakefront, the setback from the shoreline of any building erected after the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be less than the average shoreline setback of buildings within two hundred (200) feet in both directions, as calculated by the Building Official, except as otherwise permitted by this Zoning Ordinance (Please also refer to Figure VII-66 on Page VII-35 in Article VII).
Footnote 5 – After the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, when a zoning lot conforming to the minimum lot area requirement is proposed to be subdivided, in accordance with the procedures established in the Waterford Code of Ordinances, Subdivision and Land Management Regulations, into one or more zoning lots not conforming to the minimum lot area, the Township shall require rezoning of the resultant zoning lots to a zoning district established under the same Division as the zoning district of the parent zoning lot and where the minimum lot area of the resultant zoning lot(s) will be conforming (i.e., a 25,000 sq. ft. zoning lot in the C-3 General Business zoning district that is subdivided into resultant 10,000 sq. ft. and 15,000 sq. ft. zoning lots shall each be required to be rezoned to the C-2 Small Business zoning district).
Footnote 6 – Zoning lots established in this zoning district will not conform to this minimum lot area requirement unless the buildable area (See Buildable Area in Section 1-007) of such zoning lots is equal to or exceeds the minimum lot area.
Footnote 7
A. Where the side yard of a zoning lot within a zoning district abuts both a street right-of-way and the required front yard of one or more zoning lots within the same zoning district, the required setback for such side yards shall align with the required front yard setback of the abutting zoning lot(s) and conform to all regulations for required front yards.
B. Where the side yard of a zoning lot within a nonresidential zoning district abuts both a street right-of-way and the required front yard of one or more zoning lots within a residential zoning district, building setbacks for the nonresidential zoning lot shall align with the required front yard setback of the abutting residential zoning lot(s). Fencing not to exceed a height of six (6) feet may be installed along such shared nonresidential/residential property lines to provide effective screening, provided that such fencing does not interfere with clear vision areas.
Footnote 8
A. Buildings within developments in the R-1E, Single Family Attached, R-M1, Low Density Multiple Family, and R-M2, Multiple Family zoning districts shall possess the following minimum setback requirements:
(1) A minimum setback of thirty-five (35) feet shall be required between all buildings and the development exterior property lines (Please also refer to Figure VII-67 on Page VII-36 in Article VII).
(2) The minimum setback between any building and any common interior access drive within the development shall be twenty-five (25) feet.
(3) The minimum setback between any building and any off-street parking facility within the development shall be twenty-five (25) feet.
(4) For buildings not separated by a common interior access drive or off-street parking facility within the development:
(A) The minimum side-to-side distance between buildings shall be twenty (20) feet.
(B) The minimum side-to-rear and side-to-front distance between buildings shall be thirty-five (35) feet.
(C) The minimum rear-to-rear distance between buildings shall be fifty (50) feet.
(D) The minimum front-to-front distance between buildings shall be seventy-five (75) feet.
B. The Planning Commission may increase these minimum setbacks for a proposed development where physical site conditions and design considerations, in the opinion of the Fire Chief, Building Official, or Township Engineer, require such increases to provide for fire safety, storm drainage, building maintenance, emergency vehicle access, nonmotorized pathways, underground utilities, or snow clearance.

Footnote 9
A. Dwelling units within developments in the R-M1, Low Density Multiple Family and R-M2, Multiple Family zoning districts shall possess the following minimum floor area requirements:
Dwelling Unit Type Total Floor Area (sq. ft.)
Efficiency unit Three-hundred fifty (350)

Three bedroom unit Nine-hundred (900)
Four or more bedroom unit Nine-hundred (900) plus one-hundred-twenty (120) per bedroom above three (3)
B. The length of each individual building within developments in the R-M1, Low Density Multiple Family and R-M2, Multiple Family zoning districts shall not exceed the maximum length established by the Fire Chief and Building Official for purposes of fire safety.
Footnote 10 – For independent living facility (See Elder Care Facilities in Section 1-007) developments in the R-M2, Multiple Family zoning district, provided that all other applicable Zoning Ordinance requirements can be met, the Planning Commission may:
A. Increase the maximum dwelling units per buildable acre for an independent living facility development up to a maximum of twenty (20) units per buildable acre; and
B. Increase the maximum height of proposed buildings for an independent living facility development up to a maximum of six (6) stories and seventy (70) feet in height.
Footnote 11 – For dwelling unit condominiums, the minimum lot area, width, and yard setbacks and compliance with them shall be determined as provided in Section 4-004.4.D.

B. If an applicant(s) is submitting a variance request as a result of code enforcement action, an application shall have the effect of staying all enforcement proceedings in furtherance of the action being appealed unless the Zoning Official certifies to the ZBA that, by reason of facts stated in such certification, a stay would cause substantial prejudice to the public health, safety, and welfare, or to an adjoining property owner, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed unless specifically determined by the ZBA, or by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(ARTICLE VI, DIVISION 6-1, SECTION 6-100.4 cont.)
D. In all variance and appeal proceedings, it shall be the applicant(s)’s responsibility to provide information, plans, testimony and/or evidence from which the ZBA may make the required findings. The Zoning Official and other persons may, but shall not be required, to provide information, testimony, and/or evidence on a variance or appeal request. The fact that a Township representative does not appear and/or present information, testimony and/or evidence on a particular variance or appeal request shall not be considered or construed as being a waiver of the right to make such a presentation at a later date or an acknowledgment that the information, testimony and/or evidence does not exist, and shall not be evidence, in and of itself, that a variance or appeal should be granted. The ZBA may table a case to obtain clarification on application information, or to require a certified survey completed by a State of Michigan licensed land surveyor to obtain recorded and measured dimensions of the property lines when the ZBA determines it to be necessary to ensure accuracy of the variance plan, or other such information necessary for the ZBA to make an informed decision.
E. For variance requests, the ZBA may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the request, limiting its decision to the applicability of the review standards outlined in subsection 5. The ZBA may impose reasonable conditions in connection with dimensional variance requests. Such conditions shall be related to the valid exercise of the police power granted to meet the intent and purpose of this Zoning Ordinance. Conditions imposed with respect to the approval of a variance shall be recorded as part of the ZBA minutes, and shall remain unchanged except upon the mutual consent of the ZBA and the landowner following notice and hearing before the ZBA. The ZBA may require that such conditions be recorded with the Oakland County Register of Deeds as an affidavit detailing the relief granted and conditions imposed.
F. For appeals of administrative actions, the ZBA review shall be limited to the record of the administrative decision being appealed, and the ZBA shall not consider new information which had not been presented to the Zoning Official or decision-making body from whom the appeal is taken. If the applicant(s) supplies documentation which supports the fact that newly discovered relevant information exists, the ZBA may remand the decision to the Zoning Official for further review. The ZBA shall not substitute its judgment for that of the Zoning Official or Building Official being appealed, and the appeal shall be limited to determining, based upon the record, whether the Zoning Official’s or Building Official’s decision was contrary to the explicit or implied expression of intent and the terms and provisions of the applicable section of the Zoning Ordinance.
G. For appeals of Planning Commission Special Approval decisions, the ZBA review shall be limited to the record of the Planning Commission decision being appealed, and whether such decision reasonably addressed the review and approval criteria of Section 4-006. The ZBA shall not consider new information which had not been presented to the Planning Commission from whom the appeal is taken. If the applicant(s) supplies documentation which supports the fact that newly discovered relevant information exists, the ZBA may remand the decision to the Planning Commission for further review. The ZBA shall not substitute its judgment for that of the Planning Commission, and the appeal shall be limited to determining, based upon the record, whether the Planning Commission’s decision was contrary to the explicit or implied expression of intent and the terms and provisions of of Section 4-006.
H. For Zoning Ordinance interpretation requests, the ZBA shall make such decision so that the spirit and intent of this Zoning Ordinance shall be observed. Text interpretations shall be limited to the issues presented, and shall be based upon a reading of the Zoning Ordinance as a whole, and shall not have the effect of amending the Zoning Ordinance. Map interpretations shall be made based upon rules in the Zoning Ordinance, and any relevant historical information. In carrying out its authority to interpret the Zoning Ordinance, the ZBA shall consider reasonable and/or practical interpretations which have been consistently applied in the administration of the Zoning Ordinance. Prior to deciding a request for an interpretation, the ZBA may table the case to confer with staff and/or consultants to determine the basic purpose of the provision subject to interpretation and any consequences which may result from differing decisions. A decision providing an interpretation may be accompanied by a recommendation for consideration of an amendment of the Zoning Ordinance.
I. All decisions and findings of the ZBA shall, in all instances, be the final administrative decision as of the meeting at which the decision has been made, and the date of such meeting shall be deemed to be the date of notice of the decision to the applicant(s), and shall be subject to judicial review as may be provided by law. To the extent that decisions are requested or required to be in writing, the decision as recorded in the ZBA meeting minutes shall constitute the written decision.

J. Unless otherwise indicated elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance or as specified by the ZBA, the timeframe for acting upon and implementing variances granted by the ZBA shall be one calendar year after the date of the ZBA’s decision. The ZBA may extend such timeframe upon the written request of the applicant(s). Failure to act upon the variances granted within such timeframe, or to request an extension of the timeframe from the ZBA, shall render such variances null and void.
K. In such instances where variances are granted for a development undergoing site plan review, the ZBA may authorize the Zoning Official to grant a reasonable extension of the timeframe for acting upon and implementing variances granted by the ZBA, in such instances where approval of a final site plan will be delayed beyond the twelve month approval period, as a result of lengthy outside governmental agency reviews and approvals. The Zoning Official shall consider such requests based on the facts of the case and render a final decision in writing. An applicant may appeal an extension denial by the Zoning Official to the ZBA. Failing same, the final approval shall be null and void, and the applicant shall be required to submit a new application subject to the then existing provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
5. ZBA Review Standards. Variance-granting authority shall be exercised in accordance with a ZBA finding of practical difficulties requiring demonstration by the applicant of all of the following:
A. Strict compliance with restrictions governing area, setback, frontage, height, bulk, density or other non-use matters, will unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or will render ordinance conformity unnecessarily burdensome.
B. The variance will do substantial justice to the applicant, as well as to other property owners.
C. A lesser variance than requested will not give substantial relief to the applicant and/or be consistent with justice to other property owners.
D. The need for the variance is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not generally applicable in the area or to other properties in the same zoning district.
E. The problem and resulting need for the variance has not been self-created by the applicant and/or the applicant's predecessors.
F. The spirit of the Zoning Ordinance will be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
