members should only be present for their testimony.
The Mayor, Acting President of the Board of Aldermen or Presiding Officer should read
the charge and the accused should enter a plea.
If the plea is guilty, the Board should move to the discipline phase.
If the plea is not guilty, the hearing should continue.
Both the accused and the Chair of the investigatory committee shall be allowed to speak
and present witnesses. Neither party is bound by the rules of evidence.
At the conclusion of the evidence, the Board should debate in accordance with Board
rules and Robert's Rules of Order and then vote on guilty or innocent.
If the vote is innocent, the matter is resolved.
If the vote is guilty, the hearing moves into the discipline phase.
The disciplinary phase.
The Board may choose a punishment that it deems acceptable. Punishment could
include one (1) or more of the following:
No discipline.
Public or private reprimand.
Public or private apology.
Impeachment.
All punishment requires a majority vote of the Board except impeachment which requires
a two-thirds (2/3) vote.
A member who has been charged is deprived of all rights of membership including
voting rights and a two-thirds (2/3) vote would not include the charged member.
Therefore, with eight (8) Aldermen, a two-thirds (2/3) vote would require five (5)
votes of the remaining Aldermen.
A motion for impeachment should only contain one (1) name. If a motion for
impeachment contains more than one (1) name, then all members are entitled to

Section 110.240. Vidoe Conference Voting Policy.
[Ord. No. 3465, 6-3-2019]
Meetings Using Video Conference Technology.
Policy Statement. While it is legally permissible for members of the City's public governmental
bodies to attend meetings and vote via video conference transmission, a member's use of
video conference attendance should occur sparingly. Because it is good public policy for
citizens to have the opportunity to meet with their elected officials face-to-face, elected
members of a public governmental body should endeavor to be physically present at all
meetings unless attendance is unavoidable after exercising due diligence to arrange for
physical presence at the meeting. The purposes of attendance by video conference include to
accommodate the public governmental body as a whole to allow meetings to occur when
circumstances would otherwise prevent the physical attendance of a quorum of the body's
members and to ensure that all members may participate in business of the City.
Video Conference Defined. For purposes of this Section "video conference" or "video
conferencing" shall refer to a means of communication where at least one (1) member of a
public government body participates in the public meeting via an electronic connection made
up of three (3) components: 1) a live video transmission of the member of the public
governmental body not in physical attendance; 2) a live audio transmission allowing the
member of the public governmental body not in physical attendance to be heard by those in
physical attendance; and 3) a live audio transmission allowing the member of the public
governmental body not in physical attendance to hear those in physical attendance at a
meeting. If at any time during a meeting one (1) or more of the elements of a video
conference becomes compromised (e.g., if any participants are unable to see, hear, or fully
communicate), then the video conference participant is deemed immediately absent, and this
absence should be reflected in the minutes. A video conference participant's absence may
compromise a quorum in which case the applicable Missouri laws shall take effect regarding a
broken quorum.
Frequency Of Use Of Video Conference Attendance. A member of a public governmental
body shall not attend more than three (3) meetings via video conference in a rolling twelvemonth
period. In keeping with the policy stated in Subsection (A)(1) above, attendance via
video conference should only occur sparingly and for good cause. Such good cause shall be
at the discretion of the member seeking to attend by video conference.
Physical Location. Members of the public may not participate in a public meeting of a
governmental body via video conference. The public wishing to attend a meeting and elected
officials not participating via video conferencing of a meeting shall participate at the physical

location where meetings of the public governmental body are typically held, or as provided in
a notice provided in accordance with the Sunshine Law. The public governmental body shall
cause there to be provided at the physical location communication equipment consisting of an
audio and visual display, and a camera and microphone so that the member(s) of the public
governmental body participating via video conferencing, the members of the public
governmental body in physical attendance, and the public in physical attendance may actively
participate in the meeting in accordance with rules of meeting decorum. The communication
equipment at the physical location of the meeting must allow for all meeting attendees to see,
hear, and fully communicate with the video-conferencing participant.
Voting. Elected members of a public governmental body attending a public meeting of that
governmental body via video conference are deemed present for purposes of participating in
a roll call vote to the same effect elected members of a public governmental body in physical
attendance at a public meeting of that governmental body are deemed present. As indicated
in Subsection (A)(2) above, if any component of the video conference communication fails
during the meeting, the member attending the meeting by video conference whose
connection failed shall be deemed absent immediately upon such failure, and if the public
governmental body was in the act of voting, the voting shall stop until all of the components of
video conference attendance are again restored and the video conference participant's
presence is again noted in the minutes.
Closed Meetings. In a meeting where a member of a public governmental body is
participating via video conferencing and the meeting goes into a closed session, all provisions
of Missouri law and City ordinances relating to closed sessions apply. Upon the public
governmental body's vote to close the meeting, all members of the general public shall not be
present. Likewise, a member of a public governmental body participating via video
conferencing must ensure there are no members of the public present at his or her location to
see, hear, or otherwise communicate during the closed session. The member must also take
all reasonable precautions to guard against interception of communication by others. Failure
to ensure the requirements of this Subsection may result in corrective action by the full public
governmental body in accordance with City regulations.
Minutes. In the meeting, whether in open or in closed session, the minutes taken should
reflect the member, if any, participating via video conference; the members in physical
attendance; and members, if any, absent.
Emergency Meetings. In the event that emergency circumstances create impossibility for the
members of a public governmental body to physically attend, the body as a whole may meet,
and if necessary vote, by video conference. Examples of such emergency circumstances,
include, but are not limited to, war, riot, terrorism, widespread fire, or natural disaster such as
earthquake, tornado, hurricane, flood, or blizzard. To the extent possible in such
circumstances, the public governmental body shall use reasonable efforts to cause a physical
location to be provided for public attendance and participation.
Any member who wishes to participate via video conference must notify the City Clerk at least
twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the meeting so that the proper equipment may be set up.

individual member of the public governmental body. Any votes taken during a closed meeting shall
be taken by roll call. All public meetings shall be open to the public and public votes and public
records shall be open to the public for inspection and duplication. All votes taken by roll call in
meetings of a public governmental body consisting of members who are all elected, shall be cast
by members of the public governmental body who are physically present and in attendance at the
meeting. When it is necessary to take votes by roll call in a meeting of the public governmental
body, due to an emergency of the public body, with a quorum of the members of the public body
physically present and in attendance and less than a quorum of the members of the public
governmental body participating via telephone, facsimile, Internet, or any other voice or electronic
means, the nature of the emergency of the public body justifying that departure from the normal
requirements shall be stated in the minutes. Where such emergency exists, the votes taken shall
be regarded as if all members were physically present and in attendance at the meeting.
A journal or minutes of open and closed meetings shall be taken and retained by the public
governmental body including, but not limited to, a record of any vote taken at such meeting. The
minutes shall include the date, time, place, members present, members absent, and a record of

accommodate the anticipated attendance by members of the public and at a time reasonably
convenient to the public unless for good cause such a place or time is impossible or impractical.
Every reasonable effort shall be made to grant special access to the meeting to handicapped or
disabled individuals.
When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24) hours' notice, or at a place
that is not reasonably accessible to the public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the
public, the nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall
be stated in the minutes.
Section 120.080. Segregation of Exempt Material.
If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure, as well as material which is
exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make
the non-exempt material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies provided
herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a
separation of exempt from non-exempt information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person
requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe the material
exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat
the purpose of the exemption.
Section 120.090. Custodian Designated — Response To
Request For Access To Records.

State, may seek judicial enforcement of the requirements of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
Suits to enforce Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., shall be brought in the Circuit Court for the
County in which the public governmental body has its principal place of business. Upon service of
a summons, petition, complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim in a civil action brought to enforce the
provisions of Sections 610.010 to 610.027, RSMo., the custodian of the public record that is the
subject matter of such civil action shall not transfer custody, alter, destroy or otherwise dispose of
the public record sought to be inspected and examined, notwithstanding the applicability of an
exemption pursuant to Section 610.021, RSMo., or the assertion that the requested record is not a
public record until the court directs otherwise.
Once a party seeking judicial enforcement of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., demonstrates
to the court that the body in question is subject to the requirements of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., and has held a closed meeting, record or vote, the burden of persuasion shall be
on the body and its members to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body or a member
of a public governmental body has knowingly violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the
public governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00). If the court finds that there is a knowing violation of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the court may order the payment by such body or member of all costs
and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully establishing a violation. The court shall
determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the

Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body or a member
of a public governmental body has purposely violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the
public governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00). If the court finds that there was a purposeful violation of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., then the court shall order the payment by such body or member of all
costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully establishing such a violation. The
court shall determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction,
the seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body or member of a public
governmental body has violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body has violated
any provision of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., a court shall void any action taken in
violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., if the court finds under the facts of the particular
case that the public interest in the enforcement of the policy of Sections 610.010 to 610.026,
RSMo., outweighs the public interest in sustaining the validity of the action taken in the closed
meeting, record or vote. Suit for enforcement shall be brought within one (1) year from which the
violation is ascertainable and in no event shall it be brought later than two (2) years after the
violation. This Subsection shall not apply to an action taken regarding the issuance of bonds or
other evidence of indebtedness of a public governmental body if a public hearing, election or
public sale has been held regarding the bonds or evidence of indebtedness.
A public governmental body which is in doubt about the legality of closing a particular meeting,
record or vote may bring suit at the expense of that public governmental body in the Circuit Court
of the County of the public governmental body's principal place of business to ascertain the
propriety of any such action, or seek a formal opinion of the attorney general or an attorney for the
governmental body.
Section 120.110. Fees For Copying Public Records —
Limitations.
Except as otherwise provided by law, each public governmental body shall provide access to and,
upon request, furnish copies of public records subject to the following:
Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted under Section 32.091,
RSMo., shall not exceed ten cents ($.10) per page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9) by
fourteen (14) inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to exceed the average hourly
rate of pay for clerical staff of the public governmental body. Research time required for
fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based on the
scope of the request, the public governmental body shall produce the copies using employees
of the body that result in the lowest amount of charges for search, research, and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the person requesting the records
may request the public governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge
when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial
interest of the requester.
Fees for providing access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes
or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices, and for paper copies larger than nine (9) by fourteen (14) inches shall

Any Judge hearing violations of municipal ordinances may, when in his/her judgment it may seem
advisable, grant a parole or probation to any person who shall plead guilty or who shall be
convicted after a trial before such Judge. When a person is placed on probation, he/she shall be
given a certificate explicitly stating the conditions on which he/she is being released.
In addition to such other authority as exists to order conditions of probation, the Court may order
conditions which the Court believes will serve to compensate the victim of the crime, any
dependent of the victim, or society in general. Such conditions may include, but need not be
limited to:
Restitution to the victim or any dependent of the victim in an amount to be determined by the
Judge; and
The performance of a designated amount of free work for a public or charitable purpose or
purposes as determined by the Judge.
A person may refuse probation conditioned on the performance of free work. If he/she does so,
the Court shall decide the extent or duration of sentence or other disposition to be imposed and
render judgment accordingly. Any County, City, person, organization or agency or employee of a
County, City, organization or agency charged with the supervision of such free work or who
benefits from its performance shall be immune from any suit by the person placed on parole or
probation or any person deriving a cause of action from him/her if such cause of action arises from
such supervision of performance, except for intentional torts or gross negligence. The services
performed by the probationer or parolee shall not be deemed employment within the meaning of
the provisions of Chapter 288, RSMo.
The Court may modify or enlarge the conditions of probation at any time prior to the expiration or
termination of the probation term.
Section 125.210. Right of Appeal.
In any case tried before the Municipal Judge, except where there has been a plea of guilty or where

Court Judge or upon assignment before an Associate Circuit Court Judge. An application for a trial de
novo shall be filed within ten (10) days after judgment and shall be filed in such form and perfected in
such manner as provided by Supreme Court rule.
Section 125.220. Appeal From Jury Verdicts.
In any case tried with a jury before an Associate Circuit Judge, a record of the proceedings shall be
made, and appeals may be had upon that record to the appropriate Appellate Court.
Section 125.230. Breach of Recognizance.
In the case of a breach of any recognizance entered into before a Municipal Judge or an Associate
Circuit Court Judge hearing a municipal ordinance violation case, the same shall be deemed forfeited
and the Judge shall cause the same to be prosecuted against the principal and surety, or either of
them, in the name of the municipality as plaintiff. Such action shall be prosecuted before a Circuit
Court Judge or Associate Circuit Court Judge, and in the event of cases caused to be prosecuted by a
Municipal Judge, such shall be on the transcript of the proceedings before the Municipal Judge. All
monies recovered in such actions shall be paid over to Municipal Treasury to the General Revenue
Fund of the municipality.

Section 215.030. Conspiracy.
Guilt for an offense may be based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense when a person, with

or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such offense.
It is no defense to a prosecution for conspiring to commit an offense that a person, who knows
that a person with whom he or she conspires to commit an offense has conspired with another
person or persons to commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other person or
persons.
If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he or she can be found guilty of only one
offense so long as such multiple offenses are the object of the same agreement.
No person may be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense unless
an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or
her or by a person with whom he or she conspired.
Exceptions.

after conspiring to commit the offense, he/she prevented the accomplishment of the
objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his/her
criminal purpose.
The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of renunciation of criminal purpose
under Subsection (E)(1).
For the purpose of time limitations on prosecutions:
A conspiracy to commit an offense is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when
the offense or offenses which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be
committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he or she conspired;
If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him/her only if
he/she advises those with whom he/she has conspired of his/her abandonment or he/she
informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his/her
participation in it.
A person shall not be charged, convicted or sentenced on the basis of the same course of conduct
of both the actual commission of an offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense.
Note: Under certain circumstances this offense can be a felony under state law.
Section 215.040. Accessories Before The Fact.

offense so aided, assisted, abetted, counseled, hired or procured to be committed.

property;
Conceals or aids or abets the concealment of the property from the owner;
Sells, encumbers, conveys, pawns, loans, abandons or gives away the leased or rented
property or any part thereof, without the written consent of the lessor, or without informing the

Returns the property to the lessor at the end of the lease term, plus any agreed upon
extensions, but does not pay the lease charges agreed upon in the written instrument, with

The provisions of this Section shall apply to all forms of leasing and rental agreements including,
but not limited to, contracts which provide the consumer options to buy the leased or rented
personal property, lease-purchase agreements and rent-to-own contracts. For the purpose of
determining if a violation of this Section has occurred, leasing contracts which provide options to
buy the merchandise are owned by the owner of the property until such time as the owner
endorses the sale and transfer of ownership of the leased property to the lessee.
Evidence that a lessee used a false, fictitious, or not current name, address, or place of
employment in obtaining the property or that a lessee fails or refuses to return the property or pay

motor vehicle has not been returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease
or rental agreement, the lessor may notify the local law enforcement agency of the failure of the
lessee to return such motor vehicle, and the local law enforcement agency shall cause such motor
vehicle to be put into any appropriate State and local computer system listing stolen motor
vehicles. Any Law Enforcement Officer which stops such a motor vehicle may seize the motor

property to the local law enforcement agency, and such law enforcement agency may within five

Section, and that failure to immediately return the property may subject such person to arrest for
the violation.
This Section shall not apply if such personal property is a vehicle and such return is made more
difficult or expensive by a defect in such vehicle which renders such vehicle inoperable if the
lessee shall notify the lessor of the location of such vehicle and such defect before the expiration
of the lease or rental agreement or within ten (10) days after proper notice.

as to avoid returning it to the owner commits the offense of property damage pursuant to Section

Venue shall lie in the County where the personal property was originally rented or leased.

Section 215.1190. Passing Bad Checks.
A person commits the offense of passing a bad check when he/she:

any other form of presentment involving the transmission of account information for the
payment of money knowing that it will not be paid by the drawee or that there is no such
drawee; or

which is actually received by the defendant. Such notice may include the service of
summons or warrant upon the defendant for the initiation of the prosecution of the check or checks
which are the subject matter of the prosecution if the summons or warrant contains information of
the ten-day period during which the instrument may be paid and that payment of the instrument
within such ten-day period will result in dismissal of the charges. The requirement of notice shall
also be satisfied for written communications which are tendered to the defendant and which the
defendant refuses to accept.
Note: Under certain circumstances this offense can be a felony under state law.

Section 215.1870. Synthetic Stimulants and Bath Salts.
Purpose and Intent. The Harrisonville Board of Aldermen finds and declares that the products and
synthetic substances described hereunder are commonly used as alternatives to amphetamines,
cocaine, ecstasy and other illegal drugs. The Board of Aldermen further finds that these synthetic
substances are particularly appealing to teenagers and youth, who believe these substances are
safer because they are legal, however, these synthetic substances can be dangerous to users in
the short term and the long-term effects are not yet known. The Board of Aldermen finds that the
products which contain these synthetic substances often use a disclaimer that the product is "not
for human consumption" to avoid regulations that require the manufacturer to list the product's
active ingredients. The Board of Aldermen finds that drug designers and chemists have and can

quickly create new synthetic drugs once federal or state law makes a particular synthetic drug
illegal. As such, the Board of Aldermen finds there is a need to declare illegal the sale, offer for
sale, purchase with intent to sell and public display for sale of synthetic substances that mimic
illegal controlled substances, even though such synthetic substances have not yet themselves
been categorized as illegal controlled substances under federal or state law. The Board of
Aldermen further finds that it is proper and necessary for the Board of Aldermen to exercise its
authority to safeguard and protect the public health, safety and welfare by taking this action.

substance is marketed not for the purpose of human consumption, and regardless of how the
substance is labeled, including but not limited to bath salts, insect repellant, plant food, herbs,
incense, iPod cleaner, nutrient, dietary supplement or spice.
SYNTHETIC STIMULANT
Any chemical or mixture of chemicals, however packaged, that has a stimulant effect on the
central nervous system and is structurally similar to cathinone, methcathinone, amphetamine,
methamphetamine, cocaine, MDMA or any other substance listed in the definition of
"structurally similar" above, or related salts, isomers, and salts of isomers, as listed in the
controlled substance schedules in Chapter 195, Revised Statutes of Missouri, or otherwise
prohibited by federal or state law. "Synthetic stimulant" shall also include any chemical or
mixture of chemicals, however packaged, that mimics the pharmacological effects of
cathinone, methcathinone, amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, MDMA or any other
substance listed in the definition of "structurally similar" above, or related salts, isomers, and
salts of isomers. Packaging that indicates, suggests or implies that a product mimics the
pharmacological effects of cathinone, methcathinone, amphetamine, methamphetamine,
cocaine, ecstasy or any other substance listed in the definition of "structurally similar" above,
shall create a presumption that the product mimics the effects of the substance. "Synthetic
stimulant" shall not include any substance currently listed in the controlled substance
schedules in chapter 195, Revised Statutes of Missouri, or otherwise prohibited by federal or
state law, as such may be amended from time to time.
Unlawful To Sell, Offer, Gift Or Display. It shall be unlawful for any person, business, store, or
employee to sell, offer to sell, gift, barter, trade or publicly display for sale any synthetic stimulant
bath salts as defined herein or any synthetic stimulants as defined herein.
Possession Unlawful. It is unlawful for any person to knowingly possess, inhale or ingest any
synthetic stimulant bath salts as defined herein or any synthetic stimulants as defined herein.
If Congress, a federal agency, the Missouri General Assembly or Missouri agency with such
authority amends federal or state law to include a particular substance or otherwise enacts or
amends a federal or state law providing for criminal penalties for the prohibitions of substances set
forth in this Section, then upon the effective date of such enactment or amendment, the provisions
of this Section addressed by federal or state law shall no longer be deemed effective. Any
violations of this Section committed prior to such law so enacted may be prosecuted.
Seizure And Destruction Of Synthetic Stimulant Bath Salts And Synthetic Stimulants. Synthetic
stimulant bath salts and synthetic stimulants as defined and prohibited herein, may be seized by
law enforcement officers and may be destroyed in the same manner used to destroy narcotics and
contraband substances, after its use for evidentiary purposes in any judicial proceeding is no
longer required.
Marketing. Synthetic drugs are rarely, if ever, suitable for their marketed uses. For example, a
synthetic drug in the form of a powder might be marketed as "glass cleaner," even though the
powder cannot reasonably be used to clean glass.
Sales Location. Synthetic drugs are typically sold in liquor stores, some shops and gas stations,
yet synthetic drugs are marketed as products that are not typically sold by these businesses. For
example, synthetic drugs are often marketed as bath salts, spice, incense, potpourri, skin
treatments, cleaning products and plant food; however, these types of products are typically not
sold in liquor stores, smoke shops or gas stations.
Warning Labels. Synthetic drugs often use warning labels such as "not for human consumption"
and "not for purchase by minors." Bona fide bath salts, incense, cleaning products and the like do
not typically bear such labels. Of particular relevance are labels that indicate a given product does
not contain chemical compounds banned by State synthetic drug laws, which bona fide bath salts,
incense, cleaning products and the like would not have any reason to advertise.

Price. Synthetic drugs are typically more expensive than products that are used for the synthetic
drug's marketed use. For example, a synthetic drug marked as "glass cleaner" might be priced at
fifty dollars ($50.00) for one-eighth (1/8) of an ounce, while bona fide glass cleaner is priced at
approximately five dollars ($5.00) for twenty-six (26) ounces.
(Reserved)
Similarity To Illicit Street Drugs. Synthetic drugs often resemble illicit street drugs and/or use brand
names and packaging that are designed to make the product appear similar to illicit street drugs.
For example, many synthetic drugs are sold as white powders packaged in vials (resembling
cocaine) or dyed green to appear similar to marijuana. Additionally, brand names are often similar
to street slang for illicit drugs and have no relation to the products that are purportedly being sold.
These brand names are always changing, but include "Eight Ballz," "Spice," "Black Mamba," "K-
2," "Puff," "Sugar Sticks," "Green Buddha," "Diablo Botanical Incense," "Mr. and Mrs. Marley,"
"Cloud 9 Incense," and a group of synthetic drugs marked as from "The Spice Guy."
Penalty.
Any person or business convicted of violating Subsection (B) or (C) of this Section shall be
guilty of an offense and upon plea of guilty of the City of Harrisonville Codes or a finding of
guilt shall be fined up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) and/or ninety (90) days in the County
Jail. A separate offense shall be deemed committed to each sale, offer to sell, gift, or public
display for sale.
Any person or business convicted of violating the terms of the ordinance shall have their
business license revoked by the City of Harrisonville.

Section 215.2380. Theft of Cable Television Service.
A person commits the offense of theft of cable television service if he/she:
Knowingly obtains or attempts to obtain cable television service without paying all lawful
compensation to the operator of such service, by means of artifice, trick, deception or device;
Knowingly assists another person in obtaining or attempting to obtain cable television service
without paying all lawful compensation to the operator of such service;
Knowingly connects to, tampers with or otherwise interferes with any cables, wires or other
devices used for the distribution of cable television if the effect of such action is to obtain
cable television without paying all lawful compensation therefor; or
Knowingly sells, uses, manufactures, rents or offers for sale, rental or use any device, plan or
kit designed and intended to obtain cable television service in violation of this Section.
Any cable television operator may bring an action to enjoin and restrain any violation of the
provisions of this Section or bring an action for conversion. In addition to any actual damages, an
operator may be entitled to punitive damages and reasonable attorney fees in any case in which
the court finds that the violation was committed willfully and for purposes of commercial
advantage. In the event of a defendant's verdict the defendant may be entitled to reasonable
attorney fees.

or conductor, which is connected in such a manner as to permit the use of cable television service
without the same being reported for payment to and specifically authorized by the operator of the
cable television service shall be sufficient to support an inference which the trial court may submit
to the trier of fact, from which the trier of fact may conclude that the accused has committed the
crime of theft of cable television service.
If a cable television company either:
Provides unsolicited cable television service; or
Fails to change or disconnect cable television service within ten (10) days after receiving
written notice to do so by the customer, the customer may deem such service to be a gift
without any obligation to the cable television company from ten (10) days after such written
notice is received until the service is changed or disconnected.
Nothing in this Section shall be construed to render unlawful or prohibit an individual or other legal
entity from owning or operating a video cassette recorder or devices commonly known as a

signals for his/her own use.

yellow shall be used except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights
shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
Green indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the
same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow,
may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
Steady yellow indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in Section 315.070, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian
shall then start to cross the roadway.
Steady red indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except as provided in paragraph
(b) of this Subsection.
The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the
intersection in obedience to a red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a
right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as
directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the State Highways and

pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this Section shall be applicable except as to those provisions
which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "Walk" or "Don't Walk" or
appropriate symbols are in place, such signals shall indicate as follows:
"WALK": Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of
the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
"WAIT" or "DON'T WALK": No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of
such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his/her crossing on the walk
signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone while the wait signal is showing.
Section 315.080. Flashing Signals.
Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal, it shall
require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes,
drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a
limit line when marked or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to
proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent
flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with
caution.
This Section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles
approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules as set forth in Section
335.090 of this Title.
Section 315.090. Lane Direction Control Signals.

and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds
twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to
the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen
(14) feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles. The provisions of this
Subsection shall not apply to any trailer which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand
signals of the operator or of the signaling device upon the vehicle pulling such trailer; provided
further, that the provisions of this Section as far as mechanical devices on vehicles so
constructed that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of such
vehicle as above provided shall only be applicable to new vehicles registered within this State
after the first (1st) day of January, 1954.
Section 340.200. Stopping For School Bus.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway upon meeting or overtaking from either direction any
school bus which has stopped on the highway for the purpose of receiving or discharging any
school children and whose driver has in the manner prescribed by law given the signal to stop
shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus
resumes motion or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State Law:
Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading". Each school bus subject to the provisions of Sections
304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device
approved by the State Board of Education which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.
Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school system which has a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted
entirely in front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels, and which is used
for the transportation of school children shall be equipped with a crossing control arm. The
crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from
the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right side of the
front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri school children
who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading
or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to
drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district has the
authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or
more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to
stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a
stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers
should proceed with caution and, in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the

school bus with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at
any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided
by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2)
lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the
road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred
(500) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder
and a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in
each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such
time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or
overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite
direction on a highway containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading
zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or controlled access highway at a point where
pedestrians are not permitted to cross the roadway.
The driver of any school bus driving upon the highways of this state, after loading or unloading
school children, shall remain stopped if the bus is followed by three (3) or more vehicles until such
vehicles have been permitted to pass the school bus, if the conditions prevailing make it safe to do
so.
[Ord. No. 3227 §1, 1-21-2013]
If any vehicle is witnessed by a peace officer or the driver of a school bus to have violated the
provisions of this Section and the identity of the operator is not otherwise apparent, it shall be a
rebuttable presumption that the person in whose name such vehicle is registered committed the
violation. In the event that charges are filed against multiple owners of a motor vehicle, only one
(1) of the owners may be convicted and court costs may be assessed against only one (1) of the
owners. If the vehicle that is involved in the violation is registered in the name of a rental or leasing
company and the vehicle is rented or leased to another person at the time of the violation, the
rental or leasing company may rebut the presumption by providing the peace officer or
prosecuting authority with a copy of the rental or lease agreement in effect at the time of the
violation. No prosecuting authority may bring any legal proceedings against a rental or leasing
company under this Section unless prior written notice of the violation has been given to that
rental or leasing company by registered mail at the address appearing on the registration and the
rental or leasing company has failed to provide the rental or lease agreement copy within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of such notice.

Section 340.210. Right-Of-Way At Intersection — Signs At
Intersections.
The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to a vehicle which
has entered the intersection from a different highway, provided however, there is no form of traffic
control at such intersection.
When two (2) vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on
the right. This Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from opposite
directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is attempting to or is making a left turn.
The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close

thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
The driver of a vehicle intending to make a left turn into an alley, private road or driveway shall
yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction when the making of
such left turn would create a traffic hazard.
The City may, on any section of road where construction or major maintenance operations are
being effected, fix a speed limit in such areas by posting of appropriate signs, and the operation of
a motor vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so posted shall be deemed prima facie
evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a violation of Section 340.160.
Section 340.220. Distance At Which Vehicle Must Follow.
The driver of a vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonably safe and
prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the
roadway. Vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or residence district in a
caravan or motorcade, whether or not towing other vehicles, shall be so operated, except in a funeral
procession or in a duly authorized parade, so as to allow sufficient space between each such vehicle
or combination of vehicles as to enable any other vehicle to overtake or pass such vehicles in safety.
This Section shall in no manner affect Section 304.044, RSMo., relating to distance between trucks
traveling on the highway.
Section 340.230. Placing Glass, Etc., On Street.
[CC 1977 §33-4]
Any person who has purposely, accidentally or by reason of an accident dropped from his/her person

injurious to the feet of persons or animals or to the tires or wheels of vehicles, including motor vehicles,
upon any street in the City shall immediately make all reasonable efforts to clear the street of the
substances.

rain within the City, the parking of vehicles on any street designated as an emergency snow route
within the City is prohibited until the snow, ice or freezing rain has been cleared to such an extent
as to permit the movement on the street of emergency vehicles, including Police cars, fire trucks
and ambulances.
Any person in possession of a vehicle or owner of a vehicle parked in violation of this Section shall
be precluded from defending the violation on the grounds that such person or owner was not able
to park the vehicle on adjoining property by reason of the snow or ice conditions or lack of space
to park thereon, including in the driveway or garage.
Any person found guilty of violating the provisions of this Section shall be subject to the penalties
provided for violating the provisions of this Code, provided that the minimum fine shall be fifty
dollars ($50.00).

Article III. Miscellaneous Provisions
Section 390.140. Financial Responsibility Required.
No owner of a motor vehicle registered in this State or required to be registered in this State shall
operate the vehicle, or authorize any other person to operate the vehicle registered, or maintain
registration of a motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle upon the streets
or the alleys of this City unless the owner maintains the financial responsibility as required in this
Section which conforms to the requirements of the laws of this State. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained
financial responsibility unless such person has financial responsibility which covers the person's
operation of the other's vehicle. However, no owner shall be in violation of this Subsection if
he/she fails to maintain financial responsibility on a motor vehicle which is inoperable or being
stored and not in operation.
For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall mean the ability to respond in
damages for liability on account of accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said
financial responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, in the
amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1)
person in any one accident and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the amount of fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of two (2) or more persons in
any one (1) accident and in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to
or destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.
Proof of financial responsibility may be shown by any of the following:
An insurance identification card issued by a motor vehicle insurer or by the Director of
Revenue of the State of Missouri for self-insurance. A motor vehicle liability insurance policy,
a motor vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the name and address of
the insurer, the name and address of the named insured, the policy number, the effective
dates of the policy and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five (5) digits
of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if the insurance policy covers five (5) or
more motor vehicles shall be satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance
identification card.
A certificate of the State Treasurer of a cash or security deposit according to Section 303.240,
RSMo.
A surety bond according to Section 303.230, RSMo.
An electronic image displayed on a smartphone or other mobile electronic device as specified
in Section 303.024.5, RSMo.
[Ord. No. 3267 §1, 2-24-2014]
Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the insured motor vehicle or by the
operator of the motor vehicle if the proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator
rather than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall exhibit the insurance
identification card on the demand of any Peace Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or
commercial vehicle inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident while
that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the officer's or inspector's duties.
However, no person shall be found guilty of violating this Section if the operator demonstrates to
the court that he/she met the financial responsibility requirements of Section 303.025, RSMo., at
the time the Peace Officer wrote the citation.

Penalty — Confiscation of False Evidence.
No person shall display evidence of insurance to a Law Enforcement Officer knowing there is no valid
liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle as required pursuant to this Article or knowing the
evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance. If
the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator for displaying invalid
evidence of insurance, the officer shall confiscate the evidence for presentation in court. Any person
convicted of violating this Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.
Section 390.160. Alteration, Production or Sale of Invalid
Insurance Card.

to the surface or physical condition of such highways, streets and alleys in the City, is hereby
authorized to limit such weights described under Section 395.050(A) to such an amount and in
such a manner as will preserve the economical use of such highways, streets and alleys by the

found to be within the limits of this Chapter after having been weighed on any State scale and
there is no evidence that any cargo or fuel has been added, no violation shall occur, but a
presumption shall exist that cargo or fuel has been added if upon reweighing on another State

Section 405.065. Planned Zoning Districts.
[Ord. No. 1825, 5-13-1991]
Some of the districts hereinbefore set forth shall have a separate and distinct counterpart known and
herein referred to as a planned district. A planned district shall be for the purpose of permitting and
regulating the uses heretofore permitted in the equivalent district and further provide for and encourage
latitude and flexibility in the location of buildings, structures, roads, drives, variations in yards and open
spaces all subsequent to approval of the plan by local officials. The purpose is to allow development of
tracts of land to their fullest extent and at the same time observe the general intent and spirit of these
regulations.
Planned Districts shall be as follows:
District "EP" Planned Estate District
District "RP-1" Planned Single-Family Residential District
District "RP-1M" Planned Manufactured Home Park District
District "RP-2" Planned Two-Family Residential District

[Ord. No. 1825, 5-13-1991]
The zoning of land in Harrisonville to one (1) of the planned districts ("EP" to "MP-2", inclusive)
shall be for the purpose of requiring orderly development on a quality level generally equal to that
of the equivalent standard zoning districts, but permitting variations from the normal and
established development techniques. The use of planned zoning procedures is intended to
encourage large scale development tracts, innovative and imaginative site planning, conservation
of natural resources and minimum waste of land. The following are specific conditions and
objectives of planned zoning:
A proposal to rezone land to a planned district shall be subject to the same criteria relative to
compliance with the general development plan, land use policies, neighborhood compatibility,
adequacy of streets and utilities and other elements, as is normal in rezoning deliberations.
The submittal by the developer and the approval by the City of development plans represents
a firm commitment by the developer that development will indeed follow the approved plans in
concept, intensity of use, aesthetic levels and quantities of open space.

Deviations in yard requirements, setbacks and relationship between buildings are acceptable
and may be approved within the limits set out in "Standards of Development" in this Section, if
it is deemed that other amenities or conditions will be gained to the extent that an equal or
higher quality of development will result than under standard zoning procedures.
Residential areas will be planned and developed in a manner that will produce more useable
open space, better recreational opportunities, safer and more attractive neighborhoods than
under standard zoning and development techniques.
Commercial areas will be planned and developed so as to result in attractive, viable and safe
centers and clusters, as opposed to strip patterns along thoroughfares. Control of vehicular
access, architectural quality, landscaping and signs will be exercises to soften the impact on
nearby residential neighborhoods and to assure minimum adverse effects on the street
system and other services of the community.
The developer will be given latitude in using innovative techniques in the development of land
not feasible under application of standard zoning requirements.
Planned zoning shall not be used as a refuge from the requirements of the equivalent district
as to intensity of land use, amount of open space or other established development criteria.
No use will be permitted in the planned district that is not clearly permitted in the equivalent
district.
Any building or portion thereof may be owned in condominium under appropriate Missouri
Statutes.
Section 405.075. Standard of Development in Planned Zoning
Districts.
[Ord. No. 1825, 5-13-1991]
The maximum height of buildings and structures shall be as set out in the equivalent district.
The intensity of land use, the floor area and bulk of buildings, the concentration of population, the
percentage of lot coverage, the amount of open space, light and air shall be generally equal to that
required in the equivalent zoning district.
The density of residential dwelling units, the parking requirements and the performance standards
shall be the same as in the equivalent district.
The permitted uses shall be the same as those permitted in the equivalent district, provided that
limitations may be placed on the occupancy of certain premises, if such limitation is deemed
essential to the health, safety or general welfare of the community.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may, in the process of approving preliminary and final
plans, approve deviations from the minimum standards in the equivalent district as follows:
Setbacks of buildings and paved areas from a public street may be reduced to seventy-five
percent (75%) of the ordinance requirement.
Setbacks of buildings and paved areas from a property line of the project (other than a street
line) may be reduced to eighty-five percent (85%) of the ordinance requirement.
Side yards between buildings may be reduced to zero.

Setbacks of buildings and paved areas from a freeway right-of-way line may be reduced to

A portion of the parking area required under this Chapter may remain unimproved until such
time as the Board of Aldermen deems it must be improved to serve the demand adequately.
The foregoing deviations may be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission only
where there is ample evidence that said deviation will not adversely affect neighboring
property, nor will it constitute the mere granting of a privilege. Reduction of setbacks or
other open space shall be compensated by additional open space in other appropriate
portions of the project. In all cases such deviations shall be in keeping with good land
planning principles and must be specifically set out in the minutes of the Commission,
as well as on plans and other exhibits in the record.
Section 405.080. Zoning Districts For Areas Annexed By The
City.
[Ord. No. 1825, 5-13-1991]

A.
All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time.
Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall
be discouraged.
Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and
development of a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have
acquired significance in their own rank and this significance should be recognized and
respected.
Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a
building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity.
Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, whenever possible.
In the event replacement is necessary, the new material shall match the material being
replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repairs or
replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of
features substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural
designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible.
Cleaning methods that will damage the historic building shall not be undertaken.
Contemporary design for alteration and additions to existing properties and for new
construction may be permitted when such alterations, additions or new construction do not
destroy significant historical or architectural or cultural material and such design is compatible
with the size, scale, color, material and character of the property neighborhood and
environment.
Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in a manner that if
such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity
of the structure would be unimpaired.
New buildings do not need to duplicate older styles of architecture, but must be compatible
with the architecture within the district. However, the scale, placement on lots and street
setback must conform with the scale, placement and setback of adjacent structures,
especially in the context of rows of buildings and streetscapes. Styles of architecture will be
controlled only to insure that their exterior design, materials and color are in harmony with
neighboring structures.
The Commission may consider economic hardship and other factors that may affect an
owner's ability to undertake or complete rehabilitation or other work under consideration.

Section 405.551. Accessory Public Utility Uses and Facilities —
All Districts.
[Ord. No. 3038 §2, 6-2-2008]
Every public utility, cable company, video services provider providing services by use of facilities
within the City shall comply with the supplemental regulations in this Section regarding the
placement of accessory utility facilities on public or private property. For purposes of this Section,
"accessory utility facilities" shall mean such facilities, including pedestals, boxes, vaults, cabinets
or other ground-mounted or below ground facilities, that directly serve the property or local area in
which the facility is placed, are not primarily for transmission or distribution to other locations, do
not materially alter the character of the neighborhood or area and otherwise are customarily found
in such areas. Unless otherwise required by law, accessory utility facilities shall not include fire
hydrants, street lighting facilities, traffic signals, mail depositories or other approved facilities
owned by the City, State or Federal Government. Except where limited by other provisions of City
ordinance, accessory utility facilities shall be subject to the following supplementary regulations:
Approval — design — location — application — notice. The design, location and nature of all
accessory utility facilities on private or public property shall require approval of the City, which
approval shall be considered in a non-discriminatory manner, in conformance with this
Section and subject to reasonable permit conditions as may be necessary to meet the
requirements of this Section. To that end, prior to any construction, excavation, installation,
expansion or other work on any accessory utility facility, the facility owner shall apply to the
City and submit detailed plans for the City's review and approval. Contemporaneous with
such application, the facility owner shall provide notice to all property owners within one
hundred eighty-five (185) feet of the location of the proposed construction, excavation or other
work. Such notice shall include a detailed description of the proposed work to be done, the
exact location of proposed work and the anticipated time and duration of the proposed work.
Notice shall be given at least five (5) business days prior to the commencement of any such
work. In considering individual applications or multiple location applications, the City shall
review the request to ensure the proposed accessory utility facilities do not impair public
safety, harm property values or significant sight lines or degrade the aesthetics of the
adjoining properties or neighborhood, taking into consideration reasonable alternatives. Any
material changes or extensions to such facilities or the construction of any additional
structures shall be subject to the requirements and approvals as set forth herein. Unless
otherwise prohibited, accessory utility facilities subject to this Subsection may be located in
minimum setback areas provided that all other requirements are met. To the extent permitted
by Section 67.2707.1(3), RSMo., the time, method, manner and location of facilities to be
located in the rights-of-way may be established or conditioned by the City to protect the
rights-of-way or to ensure public safety. An inspection fee shall be required as may be
established by the City to reimburse the City for the costs of review and inspection of
accessory utility facilities as may be permitted by applicable law.
General regulations. The following general regulations apply to all accessory utility facilities:
All such facilities shall be placed underground, except as otherwise provided in
Subsections (3) and (4) herein or as approved by special use permit.

All such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as not to emit
any unnecessary or intrusive noise.
Abandoned facilities shall be removed within thirty (30) days thereafter at the cost of the
utility. All facilities for which use has commenced shall be deemed abandoned after six
(6) continuous months of non-use. Land from which abandoned facilities are removed,
whether private or public property, shall be restored within thirty (30) days of removal by
the facility owner or have costs of such remedies charged to the facility owner. The
facility owner shall restore the land using similar plantings or sod of the same type of
grass immediately surrounding the land and shall replace all existing plantings damaged
by the removal work with like plantings and shall replace all damaged existing grass
areas with sod of the same type of grass as was damaged.
Unless otherwise restricted, utility poles for authorized above ground lines or facilities
may be permitted up to thirty-five (35) feet in height, except for arterial roads where such
poles may be authorized on one (1) side of such roads at up to sixty (60) feet in height,
where utilities are not otherwise required to be placed underground; provided that such
poles shall be no higher than necessary, maintained so as to avoid leaning from upright
position and without use of guy wires crossing rights-of-way or pedestrian routes except
where approved by the City as necessary due to the lack of feasible alternatives.
Accessory utility facilities placed in designated historic areas may be subject to additional
requirements regarding the placement and appearance of facilities as may be necessary
to reasonably avoid or reduce any negative impact of such placement.
Any damage to landscaping or vegetation on private or public property during installation
or maintenance of facilities shall be remedied by the facility owner within thirty (30) days
of such damage; provided that nothing herein shall apply to landscaping or improvements
installed or maintained without authorization of the City or in violation of any easement
rights of the facility owner.
No facility may be located so as to interfere or be likely to interfere with any public
facilities or use of public property or contrary to any site distance regulation of the City.
All such facilities proposed to be located within a historic district or upon a historic
landmark shall be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with
the provisions set forth in Article XVI of this Chapter 405 of the City Code.
All utility facilities not authorized by this Subsection or specifically addressed elsewhere
in this Code shall be authorized only by a special use permit pursuant to Section 405.525
of the City Code.
Residential districts. In residential districts and rights-of-way adjacent thereto, accessory utility
facilities less than three and one-half (3.5) feet in height and covering less than eight (8)
square feet in area may be installed above ground with the prior approval of the City. Except
as otherwise may be authorized herein, any larger facility shall be installed underground or
authorized to be installed above ground only by special use permit. All above ground facilities,
where authorized, shall be placed in the rear yard wherever practical. If locating these
facilities in the rear yard is not practical, then such facilities may be located in the side yard.
Such facilities shall not be located in the front yard or within the public rights-of-way unless
otherwise approved by the City upon a determination that all other alternatives are not
feasible.
Non-residential districts. In non-residential districts and rights-of-way adjacent thereto,
accessory utility facilities with a height of less than five (5) feet and covering less than sixteen
(16) square feet in area may be installed above ground with the prior approval of the City.
Except as otherwise may be authorized herein, any larger facility shall be installed
underground or authorized to be installed above ground only by special use permit. All above

locating these facilities in the rear yard is not practical, then such facilities may be located in
the side yard. Such facilities shall not be located in the front yard or within the public rights-ofway
unless otherwise approved by the City upon a determination that all other alternatives are
not feasible.
Landscape screening. A sightproof landscape screen shall be provided for all authorized
above ground facilities taller than three (3) feet in height or covering in excess of four (4)
square feet in area. Such screen shall be required to sufficiently conceal the facility. A
landscape plan identifying the size and species of landscaping materials shall be submitted
by the utility and approved by the City prior to installation of any facility requiring landscape
screening. The utility shall be responsible for the installation, repair, maintenance or
replacement of screening materials. Alternative screening or concealment may be approved
by the City to the extent it meets or exceeds the purposes of these requirements. Facilities
located in rear yards may be exempted from screening where located so as not to be visible
from:
Any public property, and
More than two (2) residential dwelling units.
Any required screening shall be completed within the timeframe set forth in
the permit required under this Section or not less than thirty (30) days from
issuance of the permit, if not otherwise stated. Where the ground facility
serves exclusively one (1) or more homes directly adjacent to the facility and
is not a common facility, the City may waive the landscaping requirement.
Compliance with other laws. All accessory utility facilities shall be subject to all other
applicable regulations and standards as established as part of the City Code including, but
not limited to, building codes, zoning requirements and rights-of-way management regulations
in addition to the supplementary regulations herein. The provisions of this Section shall not
apply to any circumstance or entity in which application under such circumstances is preempted
or otherwise precluded by superseding law or to the extent City Officer charged with
enforcement reasonably determines that public safety would be negatively impacted by any
specific application.

time as the Board of Aldermen deems it must be improved to adequately serve current
parking demand. A permit for construction of such delayed improvement may be issued
only after the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Aldermen are satisfied
that the initial occupancy of the premises will be adequately served by the lesser number
of spaces and only after approval by both bodies of a final development plan indicating
clearly the location, pattern and circulation to and from the initial and the delayed parking

Section 405.570. Landscaping and Screening.
[Ord. No. 1825, 5-13-1991]
All plans submitted in support of a building permit application, except for single-family and twofamily
dwellings and excluding buildings in Districts "CBD-1", "CBD-2" and "C-2", shall hereafter
include a landscape plan and include screening where appropriate. Districts "R-4", "C-O", "C-1",
"C-2", "M-1" and "M-2" shall provide proper screening when abutting Districts "E", "R-1", "R-1M",
"R-2" and "R-3". Screening shall consist of screening fences, natural screening (earthen berms,
shrubs, trees, bushes, etc.) or a combination of screening methods. The screening shall be
constructed in such a manner that will protect the visual integrity, sound integrity and overall
quality of the adjoining residential areas. All land areas which are to be unpaved or not covered by
buildings shall be brought to finished grade, planted to grass or other ground cover and receive
trees and shrubs in reasonable quantity and size except that where a planting area between
paved areas is six (6) feet or less in width, ornamental rock or other similar ground cover may be
permitted by the City Administrator. That area between the curb of the public street and the
property line shall likewise be brought to finish grade and grass and shade trees installed. In no
case may this area be paved or covered with materials other than grass except at approved
driveways which shall be paved.
Purpose.
The purpose of such landscaping is to provide greenery to visually soften paved areas
and buildings, provide shade, give maximum absorption of surface water and generally
enhance the quality and appearance over the entire area of the project.
Shade trees shall be planted on all projects and shall include such species as ash,
sycamore, maple, oak or comparable trees suitable to the growing environment which
prevails. Shade trees shall be of two (2) to two and one-half (2½) inch trunk diameter or
greater, measured one (1) foot above the ground.
Trash enclosures required. All multi-family residential projects and all commercial, office and
industrial projects shall include, on the landscape plan, a detailed drawing of enclosure and
screening methods to be used in connection with trash bins on the property. No trash bin shall
be visible from off the property and a permanent masonry or frame enclosure shall be
provided each such bin.

ARTICLE XXII. Board of Zoning Adjustment
Section 405.610. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 1825, 5-13-1991]
The Board of Zoning Adjustment may grant variances from the provisions of this Chapter in harmony
with its general purpose and intent and may vary them only in specific instances hereinafter set forth.
The Board of Zoning Adjustment, based on standards hereafter prescribed and after hearing, may
decide that there are practical difficulties or particular hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter
of these regulations. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement or decision of the party appealed from or to issue an order or variance
or to decide in favor of an appellant.
Section 405.615. Standards.
[Ord. No. 1825, 5-13-1991]
The Board of Zoning Adjustments may vary the provisions of this Chapter as authorized in this
Section, but only when it shall have made findings based upon evidence presented to it in the
following specific cases:
The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under
the conditions allowed by the regulations governing the district in which it is located;
The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances;
The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.

For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the Board of Adjustment shall also, in
making the determination of whether there are practical difficulties or particular hardship, take into
consideration the extent to which the following facts, favorable to the applicant, have been
established by the evidence:
The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific
property involved would bring a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a
mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulation were to be carried out;
The conditions upon which the petition for variance is based would not be applicable
generally to other property within the same zoning classification;
The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person having an interest in the
property at any time after the effective date of this Chapter;
The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare in the neighborhood
in which the property is located;
The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property
or substantially increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public safety or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
The Board of Adjustment may require such conditions and restrictions upon the premises to be
benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this Section
to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variance upon other property in the
neighborhood and to implement the general purpose and intent of this Chapter. Failure to maintain
such conditions or restrictions as may have been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation
of such variance.
Section 405.620. Procedure.
[Ord. No. 1825, 5-13-1991; Ord. No. 3426, 1-2-2018]
A variance shall be decided by the Board of Adjustment only after a hearing before the Board of
Adjustment and in compliance with other requirements of applicable Statutes of the State of
Missouri.
Persons making applications appealing to the Board of Adjustment shall deposit with the City, at
the time of filing such appeal, a filing fee ("Filing Fee") in the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00)
to cover the costs of staff time to process the application, and the costs of publication of notice of
the appeal and public hearing. Such Filing Fee shall be paid to the City for deposit to the credit of
the General Fund of the City. Such deposited Filing Fee shall be refunded to the petitioner upon
written request; provided that no publication of notice of hearing thereon has been ordered by the
Board of Adjustment; and provided that no hearing thereon was held. There shall be no
publication of notice of hearing and no hearing by the Board of Adjustment unless such Filing Fee
deposit shall be delivered to the City at the time of application.
If the petition to the Board of Adjustment is for an appeal from a decision of the Building
Official and the Board of Adjustment should rule against the petitioner, the petitioner shall be
liable to the City for all costs expended for any hearing on the petition.
In all cases where petitioner seeks variance from present ordinances, petitioner shall be liable
and pay all costs expended upon any public hearings.
Provided, in the event the future costs of staff time and the publication of notice, as calculated
by the City Administrator, shall exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00), the City Administrator
may determine a new Filing Fee amount, which shall become effective after the City

ARTICLE XXV. Mechanic Street Overlay District
Section 405.650. Statement of Intent.
[Ord. No. 3197 §1, 12-5-2011]
The purpose of this overlay district designation is to encourage development that will be an asset to
Harrisonville. This corridor represents a gateway into Harrisonville and, as such, gives a "first
impression" of the City for visitors and residents. Therefore, it is important that this area be attractive
and functional. Mechanic Street is much more visible and is adjacent to higher traffic counts than most
residential areas. Therefore, it shall be developed with a mix of residential and light commercial uses.
The intent of this overlay is to allow certain light commercial uses, while keeping the overall residential
feel to the corridor. Mixed uses, both residential and non-residential, are encouraged in this overlay
district.
Section 405.655. West Mechanic Corridor Overlay District
Designated.
[Ord. No. 3197 §1, 12-5-2011]
The Mechanic Street Corridor Overlay District shall generally include the area along Mechanic Street in
the original part of Harrisonville. The geographic boundaries shall be established within the ordinance
that outlines the geographic boundaries of said overlay district. In the event that a question arises
concerning the application of this Chapter to a particular property, the Director of Community
Development shall make a determination about the applicability. The Director of Community
Development's interpretation may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission.

Comprehensive Plan.
To provide for adequate light, air and privacy, to secure safety from fire, flood and other

To protect the character and the social and economic stability of all parts of the City and to
encourage the orderly and beneficial development of the community through appropriate
growth management techniques.
To protect and conserve the value of land throughout the City and the value of buildings and
improvements upon the land and to minimize the conflicts among the uses of land and
buildings.
To guide public and private policy and action in order to provide adequate and efficient
transportation, water, sewer, schools, parks, recreation and other public facilities.
To provide the most beneficial relationship between the uses of land and buildings and the
circulation of traffic throughout the City, having particular regard to the avoidance of
congestion in the streets and highways and the pedestrian traffic movements appropriate to
the various uses of land and buildings and to provide for the proper location and width of
streets and building lines.
To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for subdivisions and
resubdivisions in order to further the orderly layout and use of land and to ensure proper legal
descriptions and monumenting of subdivided land.
To ensure that public facilities and services are available concurrent with development and
will have a sufficient capacity to serve the proposed subdivision and that the City will be
required to bear no more than its fair share of the cost of providing the facilities and services

through requiring the developer to pay fees, furnish land or establish mitigation measure to
ensure that the development provides its fair share of infrastructure needs generated by the
development.
To prevent the pollution of air, streams and ponds; assure the adequacy of drainage facilities;
to safeguard the water table and to encourage the wise use and management of natural
resources throughout the municipality in order to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of
the City and the value of the land.
To preserve the natural beauty and topography of the City and to ensure appropriate
development with regard to these natural features.
To provide for open spaces through the most efficient design and layout of the land, including
the use of average density in providing for minimum width and area of lots, while preserving
the density of development as established in the zoning ordinance of the City.
To ensure that land is subdivided only when subdivision is necessary to provide for uses of
land for which market demand exists and which are in the public interest.
To remedy the problems associated with inappropriately subdivided land, including premature
subdivision, excess subdivision, partial or incomplete subdivision, scattered and low-grade
subdivision.

full compliance. No final plat shall be recommended for approval unless such
modifications are included to the satisfaction of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
If the preliminary plat is not in compliance with all requirements, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall recommend disapproval of the preliminary plat.
If the preliminary plat is not approved, the subdivider may modify the preliminary plat and resubmit
it to the Planning and Zoning Commission. If the plat is amended and resubmitted

plans shall be filed with the office of the Community Development Director and City Engineer thirty
(30) days prior to the date of the meeting on which the plat is to be heard. The copies of the final
plat and all appropriate information shall then be transmitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for a recommendation and then forwarded to the Board of Aldermen for approval.
Official Submission Date. For the purpose of these Subdivision Regulations the date of the regular
meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission at which the final approval of the subdivision
plat, including any adjourned date thereof, is closed, shall constitute the official submittal date of
the plat at which the sixty (60) day period required by Section 89.420, RSMo., for formal approval
or disapproval of the plat will commence.
Action By The Planning And Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
recommend approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the final plat. If the Planning and
Zoning Commission recommends disapproval of the final plat, it shall advise the subdivider of the
reasons for such recommendation. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend

land for public purposes within thirty (30) days after the first (1st) meeting of the Board of
Aldermen. The action of the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Aldermen shall be
conveyed to the subdivider within ten (10) days of the meeting of the Board of Aldermen at which
the plat was considered. If the final plat is disapproved, the subdivider shall be notified of the
reasons for such disapproval. Acceptance of the dedication shall be shown over the signature of
the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk. If the Board of Aldermen rejects any dedications on the
final plat, they shall advise the subdivider of the reasons for such rejection. In approving or
disapproving a final plat, the Board of Aldermen may consider any matter that affects the welfare
of the City.
Staged Development Of Final Plat. The foregoing provisions of these Subdivision Regulations to
the contrary notwithstanding, an approved preliminary plat may be submitted for final approval in
separate geographic units rather than as a whole, provided the following conditions are met:
Each unit of a plat of subdivision for single-family residences shall contain an area of
sufficient size based on physical conditions and ability to install improvements economically.
Such units should, if possible, contain at least twenty (20) lots.
The approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission upon the advice of the City Engineer
as to the feasibility of such development, in separate units, including the feasibility of the
proposed sequence of development shall be secured.
A final plat of at least one (1) unit shall be submitted for approval within one (1) year from the
date of approval of the preliminary plat and final plats of all such units shall be submitted for
approval within five (5) years from date that the preliminary plat was approved. The City upon
application of the subdivider may from time to time grant extensions on time within which to
submit final plats, provided that each such extension shall be for no more than one (1) year.
All steps required for the approval of final plats, including the recording thereof, shall be
adhered to with respect to each unit so submitted.
Building And Other Permits. No building permits or occupancy certificates shall be issued for a
building or structure on any lot, tract or parcel of any subdivision that is subject to the provisions of
these Subdivision Regulations until a copy of the recorded plat of subdivision is available for
examination by the official charged with issuing building permits and/or occupancy certificates. No
such permits or certificates shall be issued until there has been compliance with all of the
provisions of these Subdivision Regulations and conditions of plat approval. Building permits will
not be issued until all public improvements are installed and accepted by the City of Harrisonville.
Recording Of The Final Plat. No plat shall be recorded or filed with the office of the Recorder of
Deeds until such plat has been approved by the Board of Aldermen; all dedications of rights-ofway,
easements and other property have been accepted by the Board of Aldermen; and the
design and financing of all improvements has been agreed to by both the subdivider and the
Board of Aldermen. The financial responsibility for the cost of recording the plat with the Recorder
of Deeds shall be borne solely by the subdivider. The subdivider must record the final plat within
one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of approval or such plat is null and void.
Applications For Vacation Of Streets Or Reservations. Copies of the application shall be filed in
both the office of the City Clerk and the office of the City Engineer. The application shall be
accompanied by a legal description and survey or such other drawing acceptable to the City
Engineer depicting the street, alley or public reservation sought to be vacated and the properties
and property ownership surrounding said street, alley or public reservation.
Applications to vacate a street, alley, utility easement or other public reservation by ordinance
may only be considered at a public hearing following notice to surrounding property owners
as provided in these Subdivision Regulations and publication notice as hereinafter provided.
Notice shall be published for two (2) consecutive weeks in an official City newspaper. The
notice shall state that an application for vacation has been fled, describing the property fully

and that a hearing thereon before the Board of Aldermen will be held on a date certain after
the completion of such publication notice, naming the day on which the hearing will be held
and that at such time and place all persons interested can appear and be heard concerning
the application.
The Community Development Director may determine that it would be advisable to obtain the
recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission concerning a vacation application
prior to the public hearing before the Board of Aldermen. In that event, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall hold its own public hearing on the application following publication
notice and notice to surrounding property owners in accordance with the provisions for public
hearings. At the conclusion of any such hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
submit its recommendation on the application to the Board of Aldermen.
At the time designated in the publication notice for its hearing, the Board of Aldermen shall
proceed to hear the application or may adjourn the hearing from time to time to some day and
hour certain, as deemed necessary, and which adjournment shall be noted upon the record of
the proceedings thereof. At the hearing, the Board of Aldermen shall hear such testimony as
may be presented or required in order to fully understand the true nature of the application
and the property of granting the same.
The Board of Aldermen shall approve the application if it determines from the evidence that:
Due and legal notice has been given by publication as required herein.
No private rights will be injured or endangered by the vacation.
The public will suffer no loss or inconvenience thereby and that in justice to the applicant
or applicants the application should be granted.
Dedications Of Rights-Of-Way.
When a land use permit or building permit is requested on a lot or tract abutting a public
street, the Community Development Director shall determine that adequate right-of-way exists
on that portion of the public street abutting the property. The minimum right-of-way shall be
determined based upon the classification of the abutting street. Classification of the abutting
street shall be determined by reference to the Comprehensive Plan and the major street plan;
or, if the classification is not designated on any of such documents, the City Engineer shall
determine the street classification by reference to existing or planned land uses of abutting
properties and the major street plan.
Once the street classification has been determined, right-of-way requirements shall be
calculated in an amount equal to one-half (½) of the total right-of-way requirement established
for such street classification in the major street plan. Where the property lies on both sides of
the public street, the right-of-way requirement shall be equal to the amount set forth in said
plan.
No special use permit, zoning amendment or building permit shall be issued for any lot or
tract where the abutting right-of-way does not clearly comply with the right-of-way
requirements until title for the additional required right-of-way has been conveyed to the City
by plat or deed and accepted by the Board of Aldermen.
Any requirement for dedication of right-of-way pursuant to this Section may be waived by the
Director of Community Development or City Engineer where the permit being requested does
not result in a change or expansion of use of the property or an increase in the square
footage of any building.
Easements/dedications. Where development or construction will require easements and rightof-
way dedications outside subdivision plat boundaries, no approval of construction plans for

Section 410.330. Comprehensive Plan.
[Ord. No. 2766 §1(120.330), 4-1-2002]
No subdivision shall conflict with the Comprehensive Plan of the City of Harrisonville, Missouri.
Section 410.340. Access.
[Ord. No. 2766 §1(120.340), 4-1-2002]
If a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed limited access highway or arterial street, the
City may require frontage roads (marginal access roads), parallel streets, shared drives utilizing
access easements or other methods (such as reverse frontage lots with access control and screening
provisions along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, etc.) as may be necessary for
adequate protection of properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic and to provide
safe and attractive roadways.
Section 410.350. Streets.
[Ord. No. 2766 §1(120.350), 4-1-2002]
In any new subdivision, the street layout shall conform to the arrangement, width and location
indicated on the Comprehensive Plan. Streets shall be designed and located in proper relation to
existing and proposed streets, to the terrain, to such natural features as streams and tree growth,
to public convenience and safety, to the proposed use of the land served by such streets and to
the most advantageous development of the adjoining area. Each lot within the subdivision shall
provide access to a dedicated public street unless otherwise allowed for in Section 410.340.
Proposed streets shall extend to the boundary line of the tract being subdivided unless prevented
by topography or other physical conditions; or unless in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning
Commission such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision or for the advantageous development of the adjacent tracts.
The standards within these Subdivision Regulations recognize and reference subdivision streets
by functional classification.
Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a limited access roadway or where
lots back onto a public street (double frontage lots), the subdivision shall provide the following
treatment:
In residential districts a buffer strip at least fifty (50) feet in depth shall be provided in addition
to the normal lot depth required. The strip may be a part of the platted lots or a separate tract
of land and shall have the following restriction lettered on the face of the plat:
"This strip reserved for the planting of trees or shrubs; the building of structures or fences
hereon is prohibited."

A landscape plan for all areas along the fifty (50) foot buffer strip shall be submitted to and
approved by the Community Development Department. The landscape plan shall be
submitted with the preliminary plat. Improvements indicated on the landscape plan shall be
established by the developer prior to the issuance of building permits or certificates of
occupancy. All landscaping must be established according to the Guidelines for Landscaping
Along Arterial Roadways.
In commercial and industrial districts adjacent to limited access highways, no parallel street
shall be less than one hundred twenty (120) feet from said right-of-way or limited access
highway.
Streets shall intersect each other at right angles unless otherwise dictated by topography or other
factors of good design.
The number of intersections along arterial streets shall be held to a minimum. Wherever
practical, the distance between such intersections shall not be less than one thousand three
hundred (1,300) feet.
Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a minimum radius of fifteen (15)
feet. A greater radius may be required by the City Engineer where anticipated traffic justifies
such a requirement.
Streets parallel to a limited access highway shall, when intersecting a major street, highway
or a collector street, be located at a minimum distance of two hundred (200) feet from said
right-of-way, highway or collector street. Such distance, when desirable and practical, shall be
determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for the future separation
of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
Local streets need not continue across arterial streets; but, if the centerline of such local
streets approach the major streets from opposite sides thereof within one hundred fifty (150)
feet, the City Engineer may require an appropriate easement(s) to accommodate drainage
facilities, pedestrian traffic or utilities.
The minimum right-of-way of all proposed streets shall be as follows:
Type of Street Minimum Right-of-Way
Arterial 80 feet minimum
Collector 60 feet minimum
Local 50 feet minimum
Every cul-de-sac shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way
diameter of one hundred (100) feet.
Unless necessitated by exceptional terrain and subject to the approval of the City Engineer, the
maximum street grades shall not exceed the following:
Type of Street Maximum Grade in Percentage
Arterial 6%
Collector 8%
Local 10%
Cul-de-sac (excluding turnaround) 12%
Alleys 10%
All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves and be designed for safe
stopping sight distance as determined by the City Engineer using APWA and/or Federal

Highway Administration Design Criteria.
Wherever practical, street grades shall be established in such a manner to avoid excessive
grading or promiscuous removal of ground cover and tree growth and a general leveling of
the terrain. Grades so established will reduce hazards by maintaining adequate sight
distance for classification of streets and design speeds.
The centerline radius of a horizontal curve shall be as follows:
Type of Street Minimum Curve Radius
Major Arterial 1091 feet
Minor Arterial 700 feet
Industrial/Commercial Collector 500 feet
Residential Collector 300 feet
Residential Local 185 feet
Residential Access 100 feet
A minimum tangent length of one hundred (100) feet shall be provided between curves of
opposite direction on arterial and collector streets. The City Engineer due to local conditions
may require a greater tangent length.
The developer may request a waiver to the above minimums based on engineering
considerations of topography, length of street, number of curves and other factors which
may dictate a lesser radius.
Street Names. Street names shall be suggested by the developer and approved by the City at the
time of the final plat approval.
Sight Triangle.
The intersection sight distance should be sufficient to permit a vehicle on the minor leg of the
intersection to cross the traveled way without requiring the approaching through traffic to slow
down. To allow this, an area free of visual obstruction is required at every corner of an
intersection. This area is known as the sight triangle.
All corner lots within the City limits, except those in the Central Business District, shall (at a
minimum) have a sight triangle from a point twenty (20) feet along the minor roadway to a
point consistent with the table below along the major roadway. Such an area shall be and
remain free of visual obstructions higher than two (2) feet above the roadway surface. Within
the Central Business District the sight triangle shall conform as closely as possible to the
above specifications for sight distance as approved by the City Engineer.
Road Type Clear Distance Required
Arterial 215 feet
Collector 170 feet
Local 130 feet
Cul-De-Sac Streets. Cul-de-sac streets shall be not more than six hundred (600) feet in length
measured from the centerline of the cul-de-sac to the centerline of the connecting street (eight
hundred (800) feet in subdivisions of one-half (½) acre or larger lots). Exceptions may be made
where topographic or other unusual existing conditions so require. Cul-de-sacs shall terminate
with a minimum outside property line turnaround radius of fifty (50) feet and a minimum curb line
radius of thirty-nine (39) feet. Cul-de-sacs up to one hundred (100) feet in diameter may be
required depending upon the length of the cul-de-sac and the surrounding land uses. The use of a
"T" design for the cul-de-sac's terminus may be considered for cul-de-sacs of short length (less
than two hundred (200) feet) when specifically approved by the City Engineer.

Decorative Islands. When specifically approved by the Board of Aldermen, islands to be used for
landscaping, statuary or other decorative purposes may be constructed by a developer in a
dedicated reserve in the center of a cul-de-sac or other roadway pavement section. Decorative
islands shall not be approved if their installation would in any way impede traffic or create unsafe
conditions as determined by the City Engineer.
If decorative islands are approved, the developer shall, as a condition of such approval, assign full
responsibility for maintenance of such islands to the homeowners' association created by the
developer for the subdivision. Provisions of the homeowners' association articles of agreement
related to such maintenance shall be reviewed and approved by the Board of Aldermen before
approval of the final plat.
Street Names And Signs. Street names shall not duplicate names of any existing street in
Harrisonville and adjacent areas except where a new street is a continuation of an existing street.
Street names that are spelled differently but sound the same shall be avoided. Generally, no street
should substantially change direction without a change in street name. The street name pattern
shall be continued except as approved by the City. Proposed street names are subject to staff
review and approval. Light reflecting street signs, approved by the City Engineer, will be provided
and installed by the City at all street intersections.
Street Classification. The classification of all streets shall be determined by the Board of
Aldermen. Street classification in new subdivisions shall first be determined by the City Engineer
and Community Development Director when the preliminary plat of a subdivision is submitted. The
final classification shall be determined by the Board of Aldermen as approval of the final plat is
made by the Board.
Standard Street Sections And Details. The Subsections which follow set forth standard street
sections and details which are to be used for future local, collector and arterial streets constructed
within the City of Harrisonville.
Design for persons with disabilities. Access ramps for disabled persons shall be installed
whenever new curbing or sidewalks are constructed or reconstructed in the City of
Harrisonville. Such ramps shall conform with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards
subject to review and approval by the City Engineer. These standards shall apply to any City
street or connecting street for which curbs and sidewalks are required by this Chapter or on
which curb and sidewalk have been prescribed by the Board of Aldermen.
Approval of grades. Profiles of streets shall be submitted to and approved by the City
Engineer. Submittal information required for review of the preliminary plat shall include
preliminary street profiles. Final calculated street profiles will be required in submittal of
construction plans required during review of the final plat.
Maximum and minimum grades. The grades of all streets shall not be greater than the
maximum grades for each classification as set forth in this Section, except where
topographical conditions unquestionably justify a departure from this maximum as determined
by the City Engineer. The minimum grade shall be at least one percent (1%) wherever
possible.
Compaction requirements for cut and fill areas. All fill areas within the street right-of-way shall
be compacted to ninety-five percent (95%) of standard maximum density. Layers shall be
placed in depths not to exceed ten (10) inches loose material. All embankment materials and
compaction methods shall be subject to approval of the City Engineer. In cut areas, the top of
the subgrade under areas to be paved shall be scarified and compacted to a minimum depth
of six (6) inches to not less than ninety-five percent (95%) of standard maximum density at
optimum moisture. Maximum density shall be determined in accordance with requirements of
the standard compaction test.

Approval of subgrade. The City Engineer shall approve the subgrade before any base course
or surface is placed thereon. The subgrade shall be so constructed that it will be uniform in
density throughout. The entire width and length shall conform to line, grade and typical cross
section shown on the plans or as established by the City Engineer. If any settling or washing
occurs or where hauling results in ruts or other objectionable irregularities, the contractor shall
reshape and reroll the subgrade before the base or surfacing is placed.
Sewer and water work before base construction. No base course work may proceed on any
street until all trenching for storm sewers, sanitary sewers and water lines within an area
extending one (1) foot behind curbs has been properly backfilled satisfactory to the City
Engineer. Wherever possible, the developer shall schedule installation of gas or buried
electric utility lines so that trenches for such lines can be properly backfilled before street
base course construction.
Final grade of utility appurtenances. Manholes, storm sewers, fire hydrants, water meters,
inlets and utility valves shall be adjusted to meet the proper grade of street or yard areas to
the satisfaction of the City Engineer.
Exceptions For Existing Improvements.
Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently having any
or all required improvements as previously set out and where such improvements meet the
requirements of this Section and are in good condition as determined by the Board of
Aldermen upon its consideration of the opinion of the City Engineer, no further provision need
be made by the subdivider to duplicate such improvements. However, where such existing
improvements do not meet said requirements as determined by the Board of Aldermen upon
its consideration of the opinion of the City Engineer, the subdivider shall provide for the repair,
correction or replacement of such improvements so that all final improvements will then meet
said requirements as determined by the Board of Aldermen upon its consideration of the
recommendation of the City Engineer.
Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently abutting or
continuing any existing public street of less than the minimum required right-of-way width or
roadway width, land shall be dedicated so as to provide a minimum street right-of-way width
established by these Subdivision Regulations or by the policy of the Board of Aldermen.
Furthermore, the subdivider of such proposed subdivision shall provide additional roadway
pavement meeting at least the minimum standards set by these Subdivision Regulations and
the Board of Aldermen. The Board of Aldermen shall determine what adjustment to make
where the aforesaid widening merges with existing streets which are of smaller width at the
boundary of such proposed subdivision. The Board of Aldermen may reduce the minimum
roadway system width in the proposed subdivision if the extension of such roadway is already
improved at both ends of such roadway and the roadway in the proposed subdivision is one
thousand (1,000) feet or less in length.
Section 410.360. Blocks and Lot Design.
[Ord. No. 2766 §1(120.360), 4-1-2002]
The lengths, widths and shape of blocks shall be suited for the planned use of the land, zoning
requirements and need for convenient access, control and safety of street traffic and the limitations
and opportunities to the terrain. Block lengths in residential areas shall not, as a general rule, be more
than one thousand (1,000) feet in length between street lines unless dictated by exceptional terrain or
other limiting factors of good design. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots
of appropriate depth except where otherwise required to separate residential development from
through traffic. Pedestrian ways or crosswalks of not less than ten (10) feet in width may be provided
near the center and entirely across any block which is one thousand (1,000) feet or more in length
where deemed essential in the opinion of the City to provide adequate pedestrian circulation or access

Section 410.370. Large Lots or Parcels.
[Ord. No. 2766 §1(120.370), 4-1-2002]
When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged
in such a manner as to allow for the opening of future streets and logical further resubdividing of the
parcel. Lot splits are prohibited in final platted subdivisions where additional buildable lots are created.
Section 410.380. Lot Design.
[Ord. No. 2766 §1(120.380), 4-1-2002]
The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation and the minimum setback lines shall be
appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use
contemplated.
Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the zoning regulations unless established in
accordance with this Section.
The depth of a lot shall not exceed three (3) times its width.
Residential lots adjacent to arterial streets shall be platted with extra depth to permit increased
distances between the buildings and traffic ways. Therefore, variations from the above lot design
standards are appropriate when lots directly abut buffer areas.
Where lots front upon a cul-de-sac or curved street having a radius of two hundred (200) feet or
less, the minimum lot widths set forth above shall be measured at the building setback line along
an arc parallel to the right-of-way of such cul-de-sac or curved street. Such lots shall also be laid
out so that their lot frontage, as measured on the arc of such right-of-way line, is not less than fifty
percent (50%) of the required lot width measured at the building setback line.
The area of the street right-of-way shall not be included and calculated in the area of the lot with
respect to minimum lot area requirements of these Subdivision Regulations or of any zoning
regulation applicable to the property. Lots shall be required to have more than the minimum area
dimensions provided for in this Section where such greater area or dimensions are required to
meet the yard requirements of the subdivision and zoning regulations.
Double frontage and reverse frontage lots are discouraged but may be approved at the time of
preliminary plat approval where necessary to provide separation of residential development from
through traffic or overcome specific disadvantages of terrain and orientation.
The depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and industrial purposes shall
be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use
and development contemplated.
Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit appropriate building setback from
and orientation to both streets.
Frontage and side yard setback requirements shall be the same on both sides of the street for
residential structures to provide a consistent line of sight throughout the entire subdivision.
Recorded final plats and current preliminary plats shall be exempt from this Section.

Section 410.390. Easements.
[Ord. No. 2766 §1(120.390), 4-1-2002]
The City Engineer may require general utility easements of adequate width along lot lines where
necessary or advisable for poles, wires, conduits, sanitary sewers, gas, water, power and other
utility lines as dictated by the plans of the developer to provide utility connections. The following
are established as minimum width for any general utility easements:
Front line easements — ten (10) feet on one (1) side of the public street.
Side line easements — five (5) feet.
Rear line easements — seven and one-half (7½) feet if adjacent to a general utility easement
of at least five (5) feet in width, otherwise ten (10) feet in width.
Suitable drainage easements as required by the City Engineer shall be dedicated on the
subdivision plat to provide for the natural drainage of storm water through the platted area and in
consideration of proposed improvements. The minimum width for drainage easements shall not be
less than fifteen (15) feet for closed conduits and twenty (20) feet for open channels but, in any
case, shall provide for conveyance of a 100-year storm flow with additional width of not less than
ten (10) feet for construction and maintenance equipment and operations. Any variations to these
standards should be noted on the final plat certified by the City Engineer. These drainage ways
shall be improved to the extent necessary to properly accommodate storm flows in a manner to
eliminate erosion and possible loss and damage to life, land and property. The location, width and
alignment of such drainage easements and the improvements shall be subject to the approval of
the City Engineer.
Section 410.400. Office, Commercial and Industrial Subdivisions.
[Ord. No. 2766 §1(120.400), 4-1-2002]
At a minimum, roads in commercial, office and industrial subdivisions shall be designed as
collector streets.
Provisions shall be made for adequate street access, off-street parking and loading, varying lot
sizes, avoidance of face to face relationships with residential lots and shall utilize traditional land
use patterns where possible.
In each commercial, office and industrial subdivision, each principal structure shall be constructed
on its own lot.
Section 410.410. Quality of Park Sites.
[Ord. No. 2766 §1(120.410), 4-1-2002]
Land designated for park and recreation use must be suitable for such use and receive the
approval of the Board of Aldermen. Such dedication of land or cash-in-lieu payments shall be
assessed and collected prior to approval of the final plat but after approval of the preliminary plat.
If the allocation for park open space exceeds ten (10) acres, the determination of one (1) or more
parcels shall be made by the City Administrator subject to the approval of the Board of Aldermen.

shall reimburse the subdivider an amount equal to the difference between the actual cost of
the arterial street and a collector street as estimated by the City.
If a subdivision abuts an existing/planned collector or arterial roadway, the City may require
the subdivider to construct the portion of the roadway that abuts the proposed subdivision.
There shall be an adequate number of points of ingress to and egress from the subdivision to
ensure sound traffic engineering design, smooth traffic flow into and out of all portions of the
subdivision (based upon the projected traffic generation from the subdivision and projected
traffic on both existing and future streets adjacent to a subdivision) and the public's safety. In
determining whether the subdivision provides for an adequate number of points of ingress
and egress, all relevant factors shall be considered including, but not limited to, the following:
Residential subdivisions. As a general rule, one (1) point of ingress to and egress from the
subdivision shall be required for each fifty (50) dwelling units in the subdivision. Each required
point of ingress to and egress from the subdivision shall be located so as to best serve the
traffic generated by the subdivision.
Non-residential subdivisions. The adequacy of the number of points of ingress to and egress
from non-residential subdivisions shall be determined as a part of and based on the
consideration of the site plan for the proposed development. The plat for such development
shall show the same number of ingress and egress points as are shown on the approved site
plan. If no site plan has been approved, all approvals of the preliminary plats shall be
conditioned upon the final plat being consistent with the site plan with respect to the number
of points of ingress to and egress from the subdivision.
General factors.
Traffic accumulation. The level of traffic using each point of ingress to and egress from
the subdivision should not exceed the level of traffic that the type of street proposed (i.e.,
local, collector, etc.) is designed to accommodate according to the design standards
included in Street Specifications and Standards published by the Kansas City
Metropolitan Chapter of the American Public Works Association.
Access for emergency vehicles. The points of ingress to and egress from the subdivision
should be adequate to ensure that emergency vehicles can gain access to all proposed
uses within the subdivision whenever necessary.
Intersection of points of ingress to and egress from the subdivision with streets abutting
the subdivision. The impact of injecting traffic from the proposed subdivision into the
existing street network shall be mitigated by location, design and control measures
consistent with the standards of traffic engineering.
Access to major street. The proposed subdivision or each section of the proposed
subdivision with fifty (50) or more lots shall have direct access to a major street (i.e.,
collector or arterial) within or abutting the proposed subdivision; provided that, as
provided in Section 410.480(E), access to individual lots shall not be allowed from an
arterial or a limited-access collector in a residential development, if access from an
interior street is available.
With respect to:
A subdivision that is a portion of a larger area planned as a phased and related
development and for which a master development plan (preliminary development
plan) must be submitted with the preliminary plat of the area first to be subdivided,
pursuant to Section 410.240 of this Chapter, and

To a final plat for a subdivision that covers an area that is less than that covered by
the related preliminary plat.
The determination of the adequacy of points of ingress and egress
shall be made independently for and considering the cumulative
effect of each proposed phase of the development or subdivision,
as the case may be.
Administrative guidelines. The Community Development Director is authorized, as deemed
necessary, to prepare administrative guidelines to augment, implement and provide further
details and examples of methods and manners of complying with the minimum design
standards of this Section and to assist City staff, the Planning and Zoning Commission and
the Board of Aldermen in evaluating whether a proposed subdivision complies with the
minimum design standards.

Any plat may be vacated using the following procedures:
The record owner or owners of all property in the addition shall submit a written instrument, to
which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring all or part of the same to be vacated
and the applicant for vacation shall set forth in additional form that all record owners of such
interest in the property have joined in the application. When lots have been sold, the owners
of all the lots in such plat must join in the execution of such written instrument.
Such an instrument shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Board of
Aldermen in like manner as plats of subdivisions. The Board of Aldermen may reject any such
instrument which abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its public uses, easements,
improvements, streets or alleys or reserve such public rights in the vacation.
Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved and recorded or filed in like
manner as plats of subdivisions; and, being duly recorded or filed, shall operate to destroy the
force and effect of all recording of the plat so vacated and to divest all public rights in the

Section 410.620. Dedication of Park Sites and Cash-In-Lieu
Payments.
[Ord. No. 2766 §1(120.620), 4-1-2002]
Subdivision plats shall show dedication of land for park uses in the amount of the required
parkland dedication prior to final plat approval at:
Locations designated in the adopted Comprehensive Plan.
Locations determined jointly by the subdivider and the City Administrator and reviewed by the
Planning and Zoning Commission in consultation with Parks and Recreation Board.
When the required parkland dedication is less than four (4) acres, the City may require the open
space to be located at a suitable place at the periphery of the subdivision so a more usable tract
will result when additional open space is obtained when adjacent land is subdivided.
When the required parkland dedication is less than two (2) acres, then either the City
Administrator may require the developer to pay or the developer may elect to pay, as a condition
of final plat approval, a cash-in-lieu payment instead of land dedication.
If the subdivider and City Administrator are unable to agree upon the location of the land to be
dedicated as required by this Section, then the Planning and Zoning Commission in consultation
with Parks and Recreation Commission will require the subdivider to pay a cash-in-lieu payment
instead of land dedication as a condition of final plat review.
The subdivider may, at the subdivider's sole option prior to the approval of the final plat, pay a
cash-in-lieu payment instead of land dedication for park sites.
When the cash-in-lieu payment is made, the subdivider shall deposit with the City Administrator a
cash payment without recourse or the right of recovery equal to the required parkland dedication
multiplied by the current year's price for the calendar year in which the final plat is approved by the
Board of Aldermen, less a credit that any land actually dedicated for park purposes bears to the
required parkland dedication.

[Ord. No. 2772 §1, 5-20-2002]
The provisions and criteria of this Chapter shall extend and apply to all land within the corporate limits
of the City and to appropriate unincorporated land in Cass County. Any person, firm, association,
corporation or business proposing to construct buildings or develop land shall make application to the
City Engineer for approval of a on-site storm water management plan and issuance of a drainage
permit as specified herein. Provisions expressed herein shall be the minimum storm water
management requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted
by State Statute. If site characteristics indicate that complying with these minimum requirements will
not provide adequate designs or protection for local property or residents, it is the designer's
responsibility to exceed the minimum requirements as necessary. The City Engineer or designee shall
be responsible for the coordination and enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter.

City Engineer that one (1) of the following exists:
The installation of storm water management facilities would not reduce downstream flood
peaks; or
The City Engineer determines that storm water management facilities are not needed to
control developed peak discharge rates and installing such facilities would not be in the best
interest of the City.
The requirements, or portions thereof, of Section 415.150(A) may not be waived if the City
Engineer determines that not controlling downstream flood peaks would increase known
flooding problems or exceed the capacity of the downstream drainage system.
A waiver shall only be granted after a written request is submitted by the applicant along with
the preliminary storm water management plan and containing descriptions, engineering
analysis, drawings, and any other information that is necessary to evaluate the proposed land
disturbing activity. A separate written waiver request shall be required if there are subsequent
additions, extensions or modifications which would alter the approved storm water runoff
characteristics to a land disturbing activity receiving a waiver. The City Engineer will conduct a
review of the request for a waiver within a reasonable period of time.
Discharge velocities shall be reduced to provide a non-erosive velocity.

Storm water detention facilities shall be designed to detain storm water runoff for the
development only. Runoff from tributary areas upstream of the facility shall be calculated for
future conditions; the detention facility shall be designed to safely pass this flow without
detaining it.
Evaluation of existing storm water management facilities, either upstream or downstream of
the site, shall be done assuming fully developed conditions for the watershed.
Where additional storm water management facilities are required to satisfy the minimum control
requirements, the following measures are examples of what may be used:
Storm water detention basins;
Facilities designed to encourage overland flow, slow velocities of flow, and flow through buffer
zones;
Infiltration channels or basins.
Where detention structures are used, designs which consolidate these facilities into a limited
number of large structures will be preferred over designs which utilize a large number of small
structures.
Storm water management plans can be rejected by the City Engineer if they incorporate structures
and facilities that will demand considerable maintenance, will be difficult to maintain, or utilize
numerous small structures if other alternatives are physically possible.
The storm water management facilities within the City (including both public and private portions)
will be designed to the same engineering and technical criteria and standards as outlined in the
Storm Water Management Design Manual or as described herein. The City Engineer's review will
be the same whether the portion of the system will be under public or private control/ownership.
Erosion control measures shall be established for any development one (1) acre or larger. Best
Management Practices (BMP) shall be utilized to reduce downstream effects of sediment-laden
runoff.
Maintenance of private facilities shall be described in the plans and shall be the responsibility of
the owner. Failure of owner to maintain these facilities shall result in the City taking appropriate
action to mitigate such maintenance problems.

Regional detention means off-site centralized storm water storage facilities planned and
designed to accommodate runoff from several developments or sub-watershed drainage
areas and with a controlled release rate in accordance with the applicable provisions
contained herein and approved by the City Engineer.
The City Engineer shall have the authority to establish a regional storm water detention facility
based on land availability, hydrologic characteristics, topography, development, hazard mitigation,
watershed conditions, benefit cost and any other criteria deemed appropriate.
It shall be the duty of the City Engineer to determine if a proposed development will qualify for
participation in a regional detention basin in lieu of constructing on-site detention. Participation
shall only be approved/required when it has been determined that allowing non-detained runoff
from the proposed development does not have an adverse impact on the watershed. The impact
shall be determined by the City Engineer after submittal and approval of the final storm water
management plan in accordance with Section 415.130 and as certified by a professional engineer.
The per acre participation fee shall be established by the total cost of a regional detention basin
divided by the total acres of potential developed area in the watershed.
The total cost of a regional detention basin shall include, but is not be limited to, the following:
land acquisition, appraisals, legal costs, other easements, permits, administration,
engineering, inspections, surveys, construction and maintenance.
The City Engineer shall utilize the Comprehensive Plan to determine the potential developed
area in a watershed.
Each year beginning January 1, 2004, the City Engineer shall adjust the participation fee to
reflect contemporary pricing and the construction cost shall be adjusted using the construction
cost index. Any adjustment to the participation fee, including supporting calculations, shall be
filed with the City Clerk.
The participation fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of building permits.
The participation fee collected shall be designated for regional storm water detention and shall be
used for or applied to the construction and maintenance of a regional detention basin and
expenses incidental thereto.
The decision of the City Engineer regarding participation cannot be appealed to the Board of
Zoning Adjustments.
Request for participation shall be made to the City Engineer on an application form provided by
the Public Works Department which shall include the final storm water management plan.

land disturbing activity. Sediment storage volumes may be predicted by the Universal Soil
Loss Equation or methods acceptable to the City Engineer.
Storm water runoff and drainage to a single outlet from land disturbing activities which disturb
ten (10) acres or more shall be controlled during the land disturbing activity by a sediment
basin where sufficient space and other factors allow these controls to be used until the final
inspection. The sediment basin shall be designed and constructed to accommodate the
anticipated sediment loading from the land-disturbing activity and meet a removal efficiency of
eighty percent (80%) suspended solids or 0.5 ML/L peak settable solids concentration,
whichever is less. The outfall device or system design shall take into account the total

Article I. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and
Purposes
Section 420.010. Statutory Authorization.
[Ord. No. 2751 §1(170.010), 1-21-2002; Ord. No. 2924 §1(170.010), 6-20-2005]
The legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section 89.020, RSMo., delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health,
safety and general welfare. Therefore, the Board of Aldermen of Harrisonville, Missouri, ordains as
follows.
Section 420.020. Findings of Fact.
[Ord. No. 2751 §1(170.020), 1-21-2002; Ord. No. 2924 §1(170.020), 6-20-2005; Ord. No. 2960 §1, 3-
16-2006; Ord. No. 3220 §1, 11-5-2012]
Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of Harrisonville,
Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood
heights and velocities; and
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a
series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on
the particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could
be expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as
delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS and illustrative materials dated
January 2, 2013, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis
of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more
than one (1) foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that
would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still
subject to inundation by the base flood.

It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to
minimize those losses described in Article I, Section 420.020(A); to establish or maintain the
community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined
in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR
60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding or
cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.

[Ord. No. 2751 §1(170.090), 1-21-2002; Ord. No. 2924 §1(170.090), 6-20-2005]
The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on
rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams
and bridge openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway
and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage.
This Chapter shall not create a liability on the part of the City of Harrisonville, any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
Section 420.100. Severability.
[Ord. No. 2751 §1(170.100), 1-21-2002; Ord. No. 2924 §1(170.100), 6-20-2005]
If any Section, clause, provision or portion of this Chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a
court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter shall not be affected thereby.

No permit for floodplain development shall be granted for new construction, substantial
improvements and other improvements, including the placement of manufactured homes, within
any numbered or unnumbered A Zones and AE Zones unless the conditions of this Section are
satisfied.
All areas identified as unnumbered A Zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation of the 100-year
flood; however, the base flood elevation is not provided. Development within unnumbered A Zones
is subject to all provisions of this Chapter. If Flood Insurance Study data is not available, the
community shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data
currently available from Federal, State or other sources.
Until a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements or other
development, including fill, shall be permitted within any numbered A Zone or AE Zone on the
FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community.
All new construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvements, prefabricated structures,
placement of manufactured homes and other developments shall require:
Design or adequate anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy;
Construction with materials resistant to flood damage;

below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, the State inventory of historic places or local inventory of
historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's
continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause,
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that:
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and
Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such
notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this
Chapter.
Section 420.250. Conditions For Approving Variances For
Accessory Structures.
[Ord. No. 2751 §1(170.260), 1-21-2002; Ord. No. 2924 §1(170.250), 6-20-2005]
Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case-bycase
analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following
conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Article V, Sections 420.230 and
420.240 of this Chapter.

The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure in accordance with Article IV, Section 420.150(D)(1) of this
Chapter. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific
flood-related forces, including hydrostatic, buoyancy and hydrodynamic and debris impact
forces.
Any mechanical, electrical or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood
elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed
enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with
Article IV, Section 420.150(D)(4) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening
requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year
flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in
accordance with Article IV, Section 420.160(3) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway
encroachment provisions of Article IV, Section 420.180(2) of this Chapter. No variances may
be issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway, if any increase in flood
levels would result during the 100-year flood.
Equipment, machinery or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.
No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be
paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official
that:
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and
Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such
notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this
Chapter.
Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community
and a registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain
development permit for construction.

[Ord. No. 2764 §1(140.010), 4-1-2002]
It is hereby determined and declared by the Board of Aldermen that certain areas of the City exhibit
obsolete platting; substandard or unsanitary conditions; inadequate planning; ineffective design or
arrangement of buildings; lack of adequate public facilities such as streets and utilities; or physical
deterioration due to age or poor property maintenance; that such conditions result in progressive
deterioration in a loss of population by the areas, causes a wasteful expenditure of public funds, impair
the economic value of land, limit reinvestment and place a financial burden upon the City due in part to
a low return on taxes; that multiple land parcels under separate ownership frequently exist in
conjunction with such areas; that correction of such conditions is difficult to implement on a parcel-byparcel
basis; that it is impossible and uneconomic for individual owners to independently undertake to
remedy such conditions; that as a result of these elements of blight, progressive deterioration can be
expected to continue; that such conditions further the acquisition of adequate areas, at fair prices, the
clearance of such areas through demolition of existing obsolete, decadent, inadequate, unsafe or
unsanitary buildings and the redevelopment of such areas under proper supervision with appropriate
planning as to urban design, land use and construction policies; that the clearance, replanning,
rehabilitation and redevelopment of such areas which include all areas of the City, including the central
business district, are necessary for protection of the public welfare, the creation of jobs for current
residents of the City and serve a public purpose for which private property may be acquired by
purchase or eminent domain; and therefore, the necessity of the provisions herein enacted is hereby
declared as a matter of legislative determination to be in the public interest.

Sign Limitations.
Sign Height. Sign height shall be measured from the ground elevation at the base of the
Sign to the highest element of the Sign.
Signs Indirectly Illuminated. Indirectly illuminated Signs shall not allow light to spill directly
onto adjoining property.
Animated Signs. Electronic animated Signs are permitted Signs. In order to prevent
unreasonable intrusions into the right of privacy of the public and protect the safety of the
public, the applicant may propose, and the City may condition its approval to require
operational limitations, such as hours of operation, mode of operation, brightness or
frequency of display change. No electronic message panel shall be permitted unless the
Governing Body determines than the following conditions will be met:
The message area of the panel must be oriented toward a local thoroughfare street
or highway and shall not exceed one (1) lumen from any existing residence within a
three hundred (300) foot radius of the Sign.
The mode of operation for the panel display shall be limited to the fade-in/fade-out
mode where a message appears on the Sign, is dissolved or turned off, and another
message takes its place, not to exceed a change of message or animated image
more than six (6) per minute. The display area of the panel shall not be operated to
attract the attention of viewers through flashing displays.
The proposed message panel will not endanger traffic safety given its size, height,
color, brightness, mode of operation and its relationship to surrounding traffic
patterns, speeds and roadway geometrics.
The proposed message panel shall be designed as an integral part of a larger Sign
package for the Parcel.
No portion of the animation or electronic message panel shall exceed the height limit
for the Sign in the subject district.
Animated Signs permitted by the provisions of this Section shall comply with all other
Sign Regulations.
Computation Of Sign Area.
To determine compliance with the maximum allowable Sign Face Areas permitted under
these Sign Regulations, the area of a Sign shall be considered the Sign Face Area
unless otherwise stated.
Sign Face Area. The Sign Face Area shall be computed within the smallest rectangle
enclosing the limits of a Sign Face, or the combination of the areas of all such rectangles
delimiting each Sign Face, together with any frame or material, texture or color forming
an integral part of the Sign Face or used to differentiate the Sign Face from the structure
upon which it is placed.
The computation of the area of a Sign Face Area shall not include the structure,
supports or uprights on which the Sign Face is placed or any portions of a Sign
Structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely
structural or decorative in nature, other than those portions contained within the
rectangle that delimits the Sign Face.
For any Sign on which the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures colors or
other design elements routinely change or are intended to be changed from time to
time, the Sign Face Area shall include the entire area within which any words,

Face, or Sign Face module. The area of the Sign Structure shall include the entire
Sign Structure, including the Sign Face Area.
For multi-faced Signs, when the Sign Face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back), or
where the interior angle formed by the faces is forty-five degrees (45°) or less, the
area of the Sign Face shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For all other
multi-faced Signs, the area of the Sign Face shall be the total area on all Sign Face
sides that can be viewed at one time from any angle.
On Lots where more than one (1) Sign is located, the total gross area of all the Signs
shall not exceed the maximum gross area specified in Appendix A and B. The Maximum

Traffic Safety.
No Sign shall be maintained at any location where, by reason of its position, size, shape
or color, it may obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of, or be confused with
any traffic or railroad control Sign, signal or device, or where it may interfere with,
mislead, confuse, or endanger the safety of the traveling public.
Any Sign located within three (3) feet of a driveway approach or within a parking area
shall have its lowest elevation at least ten (10) feet above the curb level.
No Sign shall be placed so as to be located within or project over any public right-of-way,
unless permitted by the Planning Commission following consideration and determination
of conformance with the following criteria:
Signs projecting over the sidewalk in the "CBD-1" Central Business District may be
permitted, provided that no Sign projected over a sidewalk shall cause potential
injury to pedestrians.
Regardless of any Section contained in the Code, the City shall have the right to
remove or relocate any Sign within the public right-of-way as may be necessary to
maintain, improve or expand infrastructure and other public improvements within the
existing public right-of-way. Removal, relocation or other necessary action shall be at
the expense of the developer, property owner, building owner and/or association
responsible for the Sign or to which the Sign is associated.
Under no circumstances shall any Sign be placed in the Sight Triangle set forth in
Section 410.160 of the Code as defined by the City's Subdivision Regulations.
Landscaping. Ground Signs, Monument Signs and Elevated Signs shall be landscaped as
required in these Sign Regulations. Landscaping consisting of trees, bushes, or ornamental
shrubs shall be provided for all ground Signs, Monument Signs and Elevated Signs. One (1)
area or group planting shall be provided for each ten (10) square foot of Sign Face Area, but
not less than four (4) plantings shall be provided. Landscaping shall extend no less than three
(3) feet from the base of the Sign.
Section 435.140. Regulations Relating To Billboards.
[Ord. No. 3456, 1-7-2019]
Billboards shall be regulated under this Section 435.140, and if a regulation in this Section
435.140 conflicts with another regulation contained in these Sign Regulations, then the regulation
in this Section 435.140 shall take priority and apply.
Permit Required. In addition to the Sign permit required by this Chapter, a building permit
shall be obtained from the Director of Codes prior to installation or placement of any Billboard.
Billboards shall be constructed and maintained in conformance with all Building Code and

National Electrical Code requirements. Plans required for issuance of a building permit for a
Billboard shall be certified as to conformance with all structural and wind-load resistive
standards of the Building Code by a registered design professional in the State of Missouri.
Purpose. Billboards targeting messages at drivers on Missouri State highways and roadways
within the City have a significant adverse impact on the safety of the traveling public when
such structures because of their size, lighting, spacing, location, height or design distract or
confuse travelers, interfere with vision, or obscure traffic signs or signals. Billboards targeting
messages at drivers on the interstate and Missouri State highways within the City also have a
significant adverse aesthetic impact on the community when such structures dominate the
surrounding environment both visually and physically with their large sizes, bright lighting,
close spacing, intrusive locations and great heights. Therefore, the erection and placement of
Billboards along Missouri State highways and roadways within the City are subject to
reasonable regulations relative to size, lighting, spacing, location and height to avoid adverse
safety impacts; and to adapt the State Highway Commission standards so that in-town
Billboards are compatible with urban land uses, where neighbors are closer to one another
than in open rural areas. Avoiding such adverse impacts is intended to further the substantial
public interest in protecting private investment in adjoining properties and public investment in
the interstates and highways, promote the recreational value of public travel, preserve the
natural beauty of the community, provide a favorable first impression of the community and
promote the safety of public travel.
Special Use Permit Required For A Billboard. In addition to complying with the terms of these
Sign Regulations, a special use permit must be obtained in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the Zoning Regulations, and to ensure the Billboard complies with Federal and
State laws and regulations.
Placement Of Billboards. The following conditions and/or situations shall be considered to
determine the legal placement of all Billboards, including, but not limited to, State and Federal
laws and regulations:
Billboards shall be located on private property.
A Billboard shall not be located closer than one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet from
any other Billboard. Spacing shall be determined based on Signs that have received a
Special Use Permit or that are Signs established as legal non-conforming uses.
Billboards having received prior authorization or that are a legal non-conforming use shall
have priority over a later applicant in determining compliance with the spacing
restrictions. Where two (2) different applications conflict with each other, so that only one
(1) of the applications may be granted, the first application received by the City will be the
first considered for approval. The second application shall remain pending until resolution
of the first application. The second applicant shall be advised, in writing, if the first
application considered is granted, and the second application shall be automatically
denied. If the first application is denied, the second application shall then be considered.
Billboards shall not be located adjacent to or within one thousand five hundred (1,500)
feet of any interchange, intersection at grade or safety rest area that is existing or
approved for construction. The one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet shall be measured
from the beginning or ending of the pavement widening at the exit from or entrance to the
main traveled way or, if there is no pavement widening, then from the midpoint of the
intersection.
To preserve adjoining property values and avoid adverse aesthetic impacts, Billboards
shall not be located within one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet of land zoned for
residential purposes.
Billboards shall be permitted only within six hundred sixty (660) feet of the nearest edge
of the rights-of-way of Interstate 49.

Billboards shall be permitted only in the following zoning districts: "C-2," "M-1."
No Billboard shall be permitted to be mounted, attached or affixed to a building rooftop or
the walls of any building.
Lighting Of Billboards.
Billboards shall not include any revolving or rotating beam or beacon of light that
simulates any emergency light or device.
Billboards shall not include any flashing, intermittent or moving light or lights.
Billboards may be lighted by external lighting, such as floodlights, thin line and
gooseneck reflectors, provided the light source is directed upon the face of the Billboard
and is effectively shielded so as to prevent beams or rays of light from being directed into
any portion of the main traveled way of the interstate or highway or into any portion of
adjacent properties and the lights are not of an intensity so as to cause glare, impair the
vision of the driver of a motor vehicle, or otherwise interfere with a driver's operation of a
motor vehicle.
Billboards shall not be illuminated so that it interferes with the effectiveness of, or
obscures, an official traffic Sign, device or signal.
Billboards shall not have a maximum average lighting intensity level that exceeds twenty
(20) foot-candles.
Size Of Billboards. The Sign Face Area of Billboards shall not exceed a maximum area for
any one (1) Sign of one thousand two hundred (1,200) square feet with a maximum height of
thirty (30) feet and a maximum length of sixty (60) feet, inclusive of border and trim but
excluding the base or apron, supports and other structural members. The maximum size
limitations shall apply to each side of a Billboard Sign Structure, and Billboards may be placed
back to back, double faced, or in a V-type construction with not more than two (2) displays to
each facing, but the Billboard structure shall be considered as one (1) Billboard.
Setbacks And Height Of Billboards.
To provide a safety zone to prevent injury or property damage from collapse caused by
acts of nature or other causes, Billboards shall meet the following minimum Safety
Setback Requirements from all points of the Sign:
At least ninety (90) feet from the Billboard's nearest edge to the rights-of-way of any
Federal or State highway;
At least ninety (90) feet from all property lines on which the Billboard is located, and
all roofed structures including roofed structures located on the Parcel on which the
Billboard is located; and
At least ninety (90) feet from any other structure that would require a building permit
for its construction including structures located on the Parcel on which the Billboard
is located.
To provide a further safety zone to prevent injury or property damage from collapse of
Billboards caused by acts of nature or other causes, Billboards shall not exceed thirty
(30) feet in height above the rights-of-way grade from which it is viewed. In cases where
the grade at the location of the proposed Billboard is higher than the right-of-way grade
adjacent to which it is located, the City may require the overall height of the Sign to be
lowered as a condition of granting a permit to prevent the Sign from unreasonably
detracting from the visibility of other neighboring Signs or properties.

The application for the Billboard Sign permit shall contain documentation to the
satisfaction of the City that the applicant has secured the legally enforceable right to
prevent the erection of structures within the Safety Setback Requirement zones. No
building permit shall be issued for construction of any building within the Safety Setback
Requirement zone.
Service Drives To Billboards. Billboards shall be accessible by means of a paved drive that is
internal to the Lot or Parcel on which the Billboard is located. All vehicles, equipment and
people used to build, service, maintain and repair the Billboard must confine their activity so
as not to interfere with pedestrian or vehicular traffic on public roads.
Additional Information Required Prior To Permitting Of A Billboard.
Billboards shall not be permitted by the City until a permit has been issued by the
Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission.
Billboards shall not be permitted before the applicant has submitted the following
certifications from the appropriate professionals registered in Missouri:
Certification from a professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri that the
soil and subsoil surface is capable of accepting the projected loads of the Billboard;
Certification from a professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri as to the
electrical portion of the Billboard;
Certification from a professional engineer registered in the State of Missouri as to the
structural strength of the Billboard; and
A certified boundary survey from a surveyor registered in the State of Missouri of the
Billboard site and its Safety Setback Requirement zones.
Billboards shall not be permitted before the applicant has submitted a Billboard survey to
indicate the relative vertical and horizontal distances between the proposed Billboard and
all other Billboards within one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet. If by reason of height,
size or spacing the proposed Billboard unreasonably detracts from the visibility of other
neighboring Billboards or properties, the City may require reasonable modification of the
Billboard's dimensions to cure these deficiencies as a condition to granting a permit.
Billboards shall not be permitted before the applicant has submitted to the City financial
security in the form of a bond, letter of credit or other financial security as approved by
the Director of Codes; a right of access; and any other measures necessary and
sufficient to ensure removal of Billboards that are not validly permitted or that constitute a
nuisance.
Inspection Of Billboards. Owners of all Billboards shall be required to submit an inspection to
the City concerning a sign's structural integrity as deemed necessary by the City from time to
time upon reasonable notice to the owner or operator of the property on which the Billboard is
located. Failure to submit a report shall result in the immediate revocation of the Sign's
permit.

When, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works, any sidewalk, curb, gutter or driveway is out
of repair, which was not caused by any action of the property owner, said Director of Public Works
may cause the same to be reconstructed or put in good substantial repair and pay the cost
thereof.
If the repairs are required as a direct result of actions by the property owner, occupants, or agents
thereof, the Director of Public Works shall cause a notice to be sent by United States mail,
directed to the apparent owner of the real estate in front of which said repair is to be made, as said
ownership or taxpayer is shown on the real estate tax records of the Cass County Assessor's

designated by ordinance, but in no event less than twenty (20) days of the date of the notice. After
the expiration of such time, the Director of Public Works may cause the reconstruction or repair to
be made through City forces or by contract when the owner has not complied with the notice. The
work may be done as separate projects for each location or as a project combining several
separate locations.
In due course, after the work is completed at a single location or at several locations combined in
one (1) project, the Director of Public Works shall cause the cost to be determined, and for this
purpose may base the same on unit costs for a project involving the work in front of several
parcels of land.
The Director of Public Works shall thereupon certify to the Director of Finance the cost of the work
done in front of and adjacent to each parcel of land fronting or abutting on the side of the street on
which the work was done, giving a description of each parcel of land so charged with sufficient
accuracy to identify the same, and the amount of the special assessment against the same. The
assessment provided for herein may be payable in one (1) installment, or the Board of Alderman

Chapter 520. Blasting Regulations
Section 520.010. Title.
[Ord. No. 2761 §1(150.010), 3-19-2002]
This Chapter shall be known as the "Blasting Regulations" and may be cited as such and will be
referred to in this Chapter as the "code".
Section 520.020. Severability.
[Ord. No. 2761 §1(150.020), 3-19-2002]
In any case where a provision of this code is found to be in conflict with a provision of any other
ordinance or other legislation of the City existing on the effective date of this code, the provision which
establishes the higher standard for the promotion and protection of the safety, welfare and health of the
people shall prevail. If any part of this Chapter should be declared invalid for any reason, such
decisions shall not affect the remaining portions of this code.
Section 520.030. General Provisions.
[Ord. No. 2761 §1(150.030), 3-19-2002]
Blasting will be permitted in accordance to these blasting regulations. Blasting shall be done only
by people experienced in the handling of explosives and in accordance with the recommendations
of the AGC Manual of Accident Prevention in Construction and OSHA regulations. In locations
where flying rock may be present, additional overburden shall be ready for use and/or in place
before denotation. All trenching operations utilizing explosives shall be suitably backfilled to
prevent any fly rock endangerment to persons or property. The use of these procedures does not
relieve the contractor of responsibility for damage to life and property but acts only as an added
assurance to the owner that damage will not occur.
The Public Works Department and Fire Department will be the authority regarding the storage,
handling, use and control of explosives used in construction projects.
The requirements of the current Fire Code regarding explosives and blasting agents, as adopted
by the City of Harrisonville, shall be considered part of these blasting regulations.
The contractor shall be responsible for all damage caused by the blasting operations and shall be
responsible for responding to all complaints. Suitable methods shall be employed to confine all
materials lifted by blasting within the limits of the excavation or trench. All rock, which cannot be
handled and compacted as earth, shall be kept separate from other excavated materials and shall
not be mixed with backfill or embankment materials except as specified or directed.
The handling and use of explosives shall conform to the regulations of the Federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Department of Transportation.
NFPA 495, ATF Publication 5400.7 and DOT CFR 49 may be used as references in enforcing
these regulations.

license has been issued.
A separate license shall be required for each place of business. Every license issued under
the provisions of this Chapter shall particularly describe the premises at which intoxicating

application and the Clerk may transfer such license to permit the operation of the business of
the deceased for the remainder of the period for which a license fee has been paid by the
deceased. Whenever one (1) or more members of a partnership withdraws from the

originally licensed to continue to operate for the remainder of the period for which the license
fee has been paid without obtaining a new license.
In the event any licensee desires to change the location of his/her place of business in the

provided for an original application, except that no additional fee shall be charged and the
amended license, describing the new location, shall be issued immediately upon the approval

liquor to be used in connection with the business of a druggist in compounding medicines or as a

druggist, after he/she procures a license therefor, from selling intoxicating liquor in the original
package but not to be drunk or the packages opened on the premises where sold; and provided
further, that nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as limiting the right of a physician to
prescribe intoxicating liquor in accordance with his/her professional judgment for any patient at
any time or prevent a druggist from selling intoxicating liquor to a person on prescription from a
regularly licensed physician as above provided.

Section 700.490. Determination of Amount of Use.
[CC 1977 §35-63; Ord. No. 2692 §1, 1-15-2001]
The amount of sewage discharged to the sewage system of the City shall be determined by the
quantity of water metered to the user. The City shall have and retain the right to choose the use of
either or both the BOD analysis and/or the COD analysis in the determination to allow or not allow
partial or total use of the sewage works or any portion of the sewage works to any user. In the
case of a single user whose water usage is measured by several meters, the total water usage for
all the meters shall be the basis on which sewer service charges are computed and not on the
basis of each separate meter reading. Each person, firm, corporation, association, institution or
establishment from whose property or premises sewage in any quantity is discharged into the
sewage system of the City, but whose water usage is not metered, is hereby required to meter, at
its source, at their own expense, the quantity of water used, with an appropriate meter to be
approved by the City, and to pay a monthly sewer service charge based upon the amount of water
thus metered to be computed in like manner as provided in Section 700.480.
If a commercial or industrial user desires to establish eligibility for a sewage service volume base
of less than one hundred percent (100%) of monthly water usage, he/she may at his/her sole
expense:
Install a sewage meter acceptable to the City to measure the volume of liquid actually
discharged into the sewage system from his/her premises. Such meter shall be maintained
and calibrated by the user and the readings from the meter shall be taken at least once
monthly and shall be provided to the City on a monthly basis. In the event a sewage meter is
installed, the rate schedule as set forth in Section 700.480 shall be applied to:
The volume of sewage entering the sewage system as measured by the meter, or
A calculated volume based on the percentage of metered water usage discharged to the
sewage system as determined by the historical comparison of water usage and metered
sewage.
In lieu of a sewage meter the user may install auxiliary water meter(s) to measure that portion
of water used which is diverted from entering the sewage system. In the event an auxiliary

the total volume of water usage before the sewage service charge schedule is applied.
After the end of one (1) year after adoption of this Article (December 15, 1986), no refunds,
allowances or reductions from the one hundred percent (100%) water use base will be granted
commercial or industrial users for any time period prior to approval of a sewage metering or
diverted water metering system.
Section 700.500. Determination of Extra Strength.
[CC 1977 §35-64; Ord. No. 2692 §1, 1-15-2001]
The City will perform analysis at intervals no greater than twelve (12) months to determine the
strength of sewage discharged by commercial and industrial users who discharge an annual
average volume of twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons or more of sewage per day and whose
wastes are subject to extra strength charges. Industrial and commercial users who discharge an
average of less than twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons per day and whose wastes are subject
to extra strength charges shall have their wastes analyzed as often as deemed necessary by the
City to obtain representative samples.
If any industrial or commercial user chooses not to accept the analytical determination made by
the City, they may at their sole expense employ an independent laboratory, acceptable to the City,
to conduct sampling and analysis of their wastewater. The time period and location for the
collection of the samples shall be designated by the City. The City and the independent laboratory
shall both preside over the collection of the samples and shall equally divide the final composite so
that duplicate analysis may be made.
If results of the analysis of the sewage sample made by both the City and the independent
laboratory are not comparable, the City may appoint a second (2nd) independent laboratory to
analyze the sewage. The sampling procedures used will be the same as those outlined above.
The results of these analyses, together with the previous results, shall be used to determine the
actual extra strength charges. The fee for the second (2nd) independent laboratory analysis shall
be shared equally between the City and the user.
If any industrial or commercial user improves the quality of their discharged sewage, the City will
re-evaluate the strength of the sewage if requested to do so by the user. The user will pay an
additional monitoring charge for the necessary sampling and analysis.
Section 700.510. Review of User Charge Rate Structure.
[CC 1977 §35-65; Ord. No. 2778 §1(35-65), 8-19-2002]
The user charge rate schedule shall be reviewed and adjusted if necessary, at least annually to:
Maintain the proportional distribution of operation, maintenance and replacement costs
among user classes.
Provide adequate revenues to cover operation, maintenance and replacement and capital
costs.
Provide for the establishment and maintenance of a sewer repair and replacement account
and such annual deposits as may be necessary to maintain a positive net fund balance in
such account for the life of any SRF loan.
Said annual deposit shall be set in the amount of sixty-six thousand one hundred thirty-five
dollars ($66,135.00).

Owners of property making application for connection to the Katy Trails sanitary sewer main will
be permitted to make such connection based upon the availability of capacity in the Katy Trails
sanitary sewer main and in the order that such applications are made to the City. At such point in
time as the City determines that there is no more availability in the Katy Trails sanitary sewer
main, it may, in its sole discretion, deny any application for connection to the Katy Trails sanitary
sewer main.
"Availability", as used in this Section, is defined to mean the capacity in the Katy Trails sanitary
sewer main as determined by the City. The City Engineer will, subject to final approval by the City
Administrator, determine "availability" in the City Engineer's discretion, considering all relevant
factors including, but not limited to, the following:
The elevation of the property for which sanitary sewer service to the Katy Trails sanitary
sewer main has been requested, the composition of the subterrain, the effect such connection
will have on the surrounding system and the public health and welfare.
Connection charges are hereby established and will be collected at a rate sufficient to recover the
costs of construction of the Katy Trails sanitary sewer main and connection thereto. Also,
connection charges may be used to pay principal and interest on sanitary sewer bonds, for the
fulfillment of agreements authorized by the Board of Aldermen of Harrisonville and finally for any
additional improvements to the Katy Trails sanitary sewer main.
All revenue from the connection charges for connections to the Katy Trails Sanitary Sewer Main
will be deposited in the Combined Water and Sanitary Sewer Fund.

reference is made in this Article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American
Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and
to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analysis involved
will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and
suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas
pH analyses are determined from periodic grab samples.)

Section 700.800. Water Tap Fees.
[Ord. No. 3356 §1, 3-21-2016[1]]
The water tap fees to be charged by the City of Harrisonville for water taps or connections to Cityowned
mains shall be as follows:
Authority. As to authority in the creation of the water tap fee, the City is exercising its local
authority, including its Police powers pursuant to Chapters 79, 88 and 91, RSMo., as
amended. The aforementioned provisions authorize and require the City to provide and
finance water service facilities and to provide for the health, safety and general welfare of the
City.
Intent.
It is the intent of this Section to establish a water system user's fee imposed upon new
connections to the City's water system and not to levy a "tax" or fee as such term is used
in Article X, Section 22, of the Missouri Constitution.
It is the intent of this Section to impose a water tap fee, payable prior to approval of a
new water service connection, in an amount based upon the demand for water
attributable to the new connection cost of constructing water service facilities needed to
serve the new connection.

Connection fees based on transformer capacity (Volts, Phases & KVA) will be calculated by
the procedures in this Section and collected from persons desiring to make new connections
or increased use of the Harrisonville electrical system before the issuance of an electrical
permit.
Computation And Approval Of Connection Fee. Electric fees shall be approved by the Board of
Aldermen.
[Ord. No. 3357 §1, 3-21-2016]
Three-phase electrical service. The connection fee for a three-phase site shall be calculated
by multiplying the KVA capacity of the transformer requested for the site by the current value
of a KVA multiplied by twenty-five percent (25%). The City of Harrisonville has elected to
waive seventy-five percent (75%) of the electric connection fee for three-phase customers.
The waiver is considered the City's investment in promoting economic development. Fees for
larger three-phase customers will be evaluated on an individual basis. If a large customer
would have a positive impact on the City of Harrisonville rate structure, a recommendation
may be presented to the Mayor and Board of Aldermen for consideration of a special electric
rate.
Single-phase electrical service. The connection fee for a single-phase site shall be calculated
by multiplying the KVA capacity of the transformer requested for the site by the current value
of a KVA multiplied by twenty-five percent (25%) of the electric connection fee for singlephase
customers. The waiver is considered the City's investment in promoting economic
development.

* Impact fees for this size of electrical customer and larger will be evaluated on an
individual basis, 24/5 or 24/7 hours of operation could have a positive impact on the
City of Harrisonville's rate structure with the current power provider. Recommendations
may be presented to the Mayor and Board of Aldermen for consideration of special
rates.
Electric Connection Fee Redetermination And Credits.
Redetermination of electric connection fee occurs when the existing transformer for a site is
replaced by a larger transformer or additional transformers are set adding additional electrical
consumption capacity to the site. This will result in an increased connection fee. The parcel
owner will be billed for the difference between the initial connection fee and the increased
connection fee. If not paid within sixty (60) days from billing, the additional fee shall accrue
late charges at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month and, if not paid by the
time of certification of total connection fee by the Administrator, shall be levied against the
parcel on the next regular November tax bill and shall be subject to all other collection actions
authorized by law.
If a smaller capacity transformer is set replacing a larger capacity existing transformer, no
refund of the connection fee will be made. A connection fee credit will be issued to the owner
of the land when these circumstances arise. Such credit shall be limited to that specific site. If
a subsequent change in development of the parcel (for which electrical connection fee credits
have been issued) results in larger capacity transformers being set, the credit will apply to
calculation of the new connection fee.
