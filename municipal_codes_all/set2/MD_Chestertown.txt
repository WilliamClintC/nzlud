property of the town for the payment of such bonds, notes, or other evidences
of indebtedness and interest thereon, without limitation of amount. All bonds

the principal of and the interest on all other bonds, notes or other
evidences of indebtedness, hereafter issued under the authority of this

municipally owned property, facility or project. Such bonds are to be payable
as to both principal and interest solely from the revenues of any portion or
all of such property, facilities or projects as are financed by such revenue
bonds. Such bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness to which the town's
faith and credit or taxing power are pledged and all such bonds shall contain
on their faces a statement to that effect.

effective. The Mayor and Council shall have the right to reject all bids and

basis determined by the Council.



   (b)   The amount assessed against any property for any project or
improvement shall not exceed the value of the benefits accruing to the
property therefrom, nor shall any special assessment be levied which shall
cause the total amount of special assessments levied by the town and
outstanding against any property at any time, exclusive of delinquent
installments, to exceed fifty per centum (50%) of the assessed value of the
property after giving effect to the benefit accruing thereto from the project
or improvement for which assessed.



   (c)   When desirable, the affected property may be divided into
different classes to be charged different rates, but except for this, any
rate shall be uniform.

extent of the proposed project, the kind of materials to be used, the
estimated cost of the project, the portion of the cost to be assessed, the
number of installments in which the assessment may be paid, the method to be
used in apportioning the cost, and the limits of the proposed area of
assessment. The notice shall also state the time and place at which all
persons interested, or their agents or attorneys, may appear before the
Council and be heard concerning the proposed project and special assessment.
Such notice shall be given by sending a copy thereof by mail to the owner of
record of each parcel of property proposed to be assessed and to the person
in whose name the property is assessed for taxation and by publication of a
copy of the notice at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the
town. A certificate of publication and mailing of the copies of the notice
shall be presented at the hearing which certificate shall be deemed proof of
notice. Failure of any owner to receive the mailed copy shall not invalidate
the proceedings. The date of hearing shall be set at least ten and not more
than thirty days after completion of publication and service of notice as
provided in this section. Following the hearing, the Council, in its
discretion may vote to proceed with the project and may levy the special
assessment.



   (e)   Any interested person feeling aggrieved by the levying of any
special assessment under the provisions of this section shall have the right
to appeal to the circuit court for the county within ten days after the
levying of any assessment by the Council.



   (f)   Special assessments may be made payable in annual or more
frequent installments over such period of time, not to exceed thirty years
and in such manner as the Council may determine. The Council shall determine
on what date installments shall be due and payable. Interest may be charged
on installments at the rate to be determined by the Council.



   (g)   All special assessments installments shall be overdue six
months after the date on which they become due and payable. All special
assessments shall be liens on the property and overdue special assessments
including interest shall be collected in the same manner as town taxes or by
suit at law.

misdemeanor under the authority of this charter, unless otherwise provided

day shall constitute a separate offense.



   (B)   (1)   Infractions. The council shall by official act
declare the violation of which ordinance or ordinances shall be an
infraction, or infractions, and for each such violation, a specific fine
shall be set. This fine shall never exceed $100 for any single, initial
violation, or $200 for each repeat or continuing violation. The fine shall be
expressed as a discrete amount rather than being expressed in terms of a
maximum or minimum amount. The authority to declare infractions and set fines
shall not be delegated by the council to any other administrative or
legislative body.



      (2)   Issuance of citation. Those code enforcement officials
authorized by the Council to enforce this code may deliver a citation to any
person alleged to be committing an infraction. A copy of the citation shall
be retained by the town and shall bear the certification of the enforcing
official attesting to the truth of the matter set forth in the citation. The
citation shall contain at a minimum the following information:

         (c)   The location and time that the infraction occurred
or was observed;

specified in the law violated. The fine is payable by the recipient of the
citation to the Town within 20 calendar days of receipt of the citation.



      (4)   No formal hearing by Town. The Town shall not conduct
any formal hearing for those persons in receipt of a citation of infraction.
Any offender so cited may pay the fine as indicated in the citation or elect

from requesting, either personally or through an attorney, additional
information concerning the infraction.



      (5)   Election to stand trial. A person receiving the citation
for an infraction may elect to stand trial for the offense by notifying the
Town in writing of his intentions of standing trial. The notice shall be
given at least 5 days prior to the date of payment as set forth in the
citation. Upon receipt of the notice of the intention to stand trial, the
Town shall forward to the district court having venue a copy of the notice

infractions shall be remitted to the general fund of the Town.



      (6)   Failure to pay fine. If a person receiving a citation
for an infraction fails to pay the fine for the infraction by the date of
payment set forth on the citation and fails to file a notice of his intention
to stand trial for the offense, a formal notice of the infraction shall be
sent to the offender's last known address. If the citation has not been
satisfied within 15 days from the date of the notice, he shall be liable for
an additional fine not to exceed twice the original fine. If after 36 days
the citation has not been satisfied, the Town may request adjudication of the
case through the District Court. The District Court shall promptly schedule
the case for trial and summon the defendant to appear.



      (7)   Conviction not criminal offense. Conviction of a
municipal infraction, whether by the District Court or by payment of the fine
to the town, is not a criminal conviction for any purpose, nor does it impose
any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by a criminal conviction.



      (8)   Court proceedings and rights of accused. In any
proceeding for a municipal infraction, the accused shall have the same rights
as for the trial of criminal cases. He shall have the right to cross-examine
witnesses against him, to testify or introduce evidence in his own behalf and
to be represented by an attorney of his own selection and at his own expense.

Section 88.  Separability.



   If any section or part of section of this charter shall be held invalid
by a court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the
remainder of this charter nor the context in which such section or part of
section so held invalid shall appear, except to the extent that an entire
section or part of section may be inseparably connected in meaning and effect
with the section or part of section to which such holding shall directly
apply.



Section 89.  "Town" construed to mean "city".



   Whenever in this article the word "Town" shall appear, it shall be
taken and construed to mean also the word "City".

Section A1–104.  Establishment of Urban Renewel [Renewal] Agency.



   (a)   A municipality may itself exercise all the powers granted by
this appendix, or may, if its legislative body by ordinance determines the
action to be in the public interest, elect to have the powers exercised by a
separate public body or agency.



   (b)   In the event the legislative body makes that determination, it

in the municipality the activities authorized by this appendix.



   (c)   The ordinance shall include provisions establishing the number

effective date of the ordinance, are vested in the public body or agency
established by the ordinance.



Section A1–105.  Powers Withheld from the Agency.



   The agency may not:



   (a)   Pass a resolution to initiate an urban renewal project
pursuant to Section A1-106 of this appendix.



   (b)   Issue general obligation bonds pursuant to Section A1-109 of

the municipality shall adopt a resolution which[:]



   (a)   Finds that one or more slum or blighted areas exist in the
municipality;



   (b)   Locates and defines the slum or blighted areas;



   (c)   Finds that the rehabilitation, redevelopment, or a combination

Section A1–107.  Preparation and Approval of Plan for Urban Renewal
Project.



   (a)   In order to carry out the purposes of this appendix, the
municipality shall have prepared an urban renewal plan for slum or blighted
areas in the municipality, and shall approve the plan formally. Prior to its
approval of an urban renewal project, the municipality shall submit the plan
to the planning body of the municipality for review and recommendations as to
its conformity with the master plan for the development of the municipality
as a whole. The planning body shall submit its written recommendation with
respect to the proposed urban renewal plan to the municipality within 60 days
after receipt of the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of
the planning body or, if no recommendations are received within the 60 days,
then without the recommendations, the municipality may proceed with a public
hearing on the proposed urban renewal project. The municipality shall hold a
public hearing on an urban renewal project after public notice of it by
publication in a newspaper having a general circulation within the corporate
limits of the municipality. The notice shall describe the time, date, place
and purpose of the hearing; shall generally identify the urban renewal area
covered by the plan; and shall outline the general scope of the urban renewal
project under consideration. Following the hearing, the municipality may
approve an urban renewal project and the plan therefor if it finds that:



      (1)   A feasible method exists for the location of any
families who will be displaced from the urban renewal area in decent, safe
and sanitary dwelling accommodations within their means and without undue
hardship to the families or natural persons;



      (2)   The urban renewal plan conforms substantially to the
master plan of the municipality as a whole; and



      (3)   The urban renewal plan will afford maximum opportunity,
consistent with the sound needs of the municipality as a whole, for the
rehabilitation or redevelopment of the urban renewal area by private
enterprise.



   (b)   An urban renewal plan may be modified at any time. If modified
after the lease or sale of real property in the urban renewal project area,
the modification may be conditioned upon whatever approval of the owner,
lessee or successor in interest as the municipality considers advisable. In
any event it shall be subject to whatever rights at law or in equity as a
lessee or purchaser, or his successor or successors in interest, may be
entitled to assert. Where the proposed modification will change substantially
the urban renewal plan as approved previously by the municipality, the
modification shall be approved formally by the municipality, as in the case
of an original plan.



   (c)   Upon the approval by the municipality of an urban renewal plan
or any modification of it, the plan or modification shall be considered to be
in full force and effect for the respective urban renewal area. The
municipality may have the plan or modification carried out in accordance with
its terms.



Section A1–108.  Disposal of Property in Urban Renewal Area.



   (a)   The municipality may sell, lease or otherwise transfer real
property or any interest in it acquired by it for an urban renewal project to
any person for residential, recreational, commercial, industrial, educational
or other uses or for public use, or it may retain the property or interest
for public use, in accordance with the urban renewal plan and subject to
whatever covenants, conditions and restrictions, including covenants running
with the land, as it considers necessary or desirable to assist in preventing
the development or spread of future slums or blighted areas or to otherwise
carry out the purposes of this appendix. The purchasers or lessees and their
successors and assigns shall be obligated to devote the real property only to
the uses specified in the urban renewal plan, and may be obligated to comply
with whatever other requirements the municipality determines to be in the
public interest, including the obligation to begin within a reasonable time
any improvements on the real property required by the urban renewal plan. The
real property or interest may not be sold, leased, otherwise transferred, or
retained at less than its fair value for uses in accordance with the urban
renewal plan. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in
accordance with the urban renewal plan, the municipality shall take into
account and give consideration to the uses provided in the plan; the
restrictions upon, and the covenants, conditions and obligations assumed by
the purchaser or lessee or by the municipality retaining the property; and
the objectives of the plan for the prevention of the recurrence of slum or
blighted areas. In any instrument of conveyance to a private purchaser or
lessee, the municipality may provide that the purchaser or lessee may not
sell, lease or otherwise transfer the real property without the prior written
consent of the municipality until he has completed the construction of any or
all improvements which he has obligated himself to construct on the property.
Real property acquired by the municipality which, in accordance with the
provisions of the urban renewal plan, is to be transferred, shall be
transferred as rapidly as feasible in the public interest consistent with the
carrying out of the provisions of the urban renewal plan. Any contract for
the transfer and the urban renewal plan (or whatever part or parts of the
contract or plan as the municipality determines) may be recorded in the land
records of the county in which the municipality is situated in a manner so as
to afford actual or constructive notice of it.



   (b)   The municipality may operate temporarily and maintain real
property acquired by it in an urban renewal area for or in connection with an
urban renewal project pending the disposition of the property as authorized
in this appendix, without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) above,
for uses and purposes considered desirable even though not in conformity with
the urban renewal plan.



   (c)   Any instrument executed by the municipality and purporting to
convey any right, title or interest in any property under this appendix shall
be presumed conclusively to have been executed in compliance with the
provisions of this appendix insofar as title or other interest of any bona
fide purchasers, lessees or transferees of the property is concerned.



Section A1–109.  Eminent Domain.



   Condemnation of land or property under the provisions of this appendix
shall be in accordance with the procedure provided in the Real Property
Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.



Section A1–110.  Encouragement of Private Enterprise.



   The municipality, to the greatest extent it determines to be feasible
in carrying out the provisions of this appendix, shall afford maximum
opportunity to the rehabilitation or redevelopment of any urban renewal area
by private enterprise consistent with the sound needs of the municipality as
a whole. The municipality shall give consideration to this objective in
exercising its powers under this appendix.



Section A1–111.  General Obligation Bonds.



   For the purpose of financing and carrying out of an urban renewal
project and related activities, the municipality may issue and sell its
general obligation bonds. Any bonds issued by the municipality pursuant to
this section shall be issued in the manner and within the limitations
prescribed by applicable law for the issuance and authorization of general
obligation bonds by the municipality, and also within limitation as
determined by the municipality.



Section A1–112.  Revenue Bonds.



   (a)   In addition to the authority conferred by Section A1–111 of
this appendix, the municipality may issue revenue bonds to finance the
undertaking of any urban renewal project and related activities. Also, it may
issue refunding bonds for the payment or retirement of the bonds issued
previously by it. The bonds shall be made payable, as to both principal and
interest, solely from the income, proceeds, revenues, and funds of the
municipality derived from or held in connection with its undertaking and
carrying out of urban renewal projects under this appendix. However, payment
of the bonds, both as to principal and interest, may be further secured by a
pledge of any loan, grant or contribution from the Federal Government or
other source, in aid of any urban renewal projects of the municipality under
this appendix, and by a mortgage of any urban renewal project, or any part of
a project, title to which is in the municipality. In addition, the
municipality may enter into an indenture of trust with any private banking
institution of this State having trust powers and may make in the indenture
of trust covenants and commitments required by any purchaser for the adequate
security of the bonds.



   (b)   Bonds issued under this section do not constitute an
indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt
limitation or restriction, are not subject to the provisions of any other law
or charter relating to the authorization, issuance or sale of bonds, and are
exempted specifically from the restrictions contained in Sections 9, 10, and
11 of Article 31 (debts – public) of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Bonds
issued under the provisions of this appendix are declared to be issued for an
essential public and governmental purpose and, together with interest on them
and income from them, are exempt from all taxes.



   (c)    Bonds issued under this section shall be authorized by
resolution or ordinance of the legislative body of the municipality. They may
be issued in one or more series and:



      (1)   Shall bear a date or dates,



      (2)   Mature at time or times,



      (3)   Bear interest at a rate or rates,



      (4)   Be in a denomination or denominations,



      (5)   Be in a form either with or without coupon or registered,



      (6)   Carry a conversion or registration privilege,



      (7)   Have a rank or priority,



      (8)   Be executed in a manner,



      (9)   Be payable in a medium or payment, at a place or places,
and be subject to terms of redemption (with or without premium),



      (10)   Be secured in a manner, and



      (11)   Have other characteristics, as are provided by the
resolution, trust indenture or mortgage issued pursuant to it.



   (d)   These bonds may not be sold at less than par value at public
sales which are held after notice is published prior to the sale in a
newspaper having a general circulation in the area in which the municipality
is located and in whatever other medium of publication as the municipality
may determine. The bonds may be exchanged also for other bonds on the basis
of par. However, the bonds may be sold to the Federal Government at private
sale at less than par, and, in the event less than all of the authorized
principal amount of the bonds is sold to the Federal Government, the balance
may be sold at private sale at less than par at an interest cost to the
municipality which does not exceed the interest cost to the municipality of
the portion of the bonds sold to the Federal Government.



   (e)   In case any of the public officials of the municipality whose
signatures appear on any bonds or coupons issued under this appendix cease to
be officials of the municipality before the delivery of the bond, or, in the
event any of the officials have become such after the date of issue of them,
the bonds are valid and binding obligations of the municipality in accordance
with their terms. Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding,
any bonds issued pursuant to this appendix are fully negotiable.



   (f)   In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or
enforceability of any bond issued under this appendix, or the security for
it, any bond which recites in substance that it has been issued by the
municipality in connection with an urban renewal project shall be considered
conclusively to have been issued for that purpose, and the project shall be
deemed conclusively considered to have been planned, located and carried out
in accordance with the provisions of this appendix.



   (g)   All banks, trust companies, bankers, savings banks and
institutions, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations,
investment companies and other persons carrying on a banking or investment
business; all insurance companies, insurance associations, and other persons
carrying on an insurance business; and all executors, administrators,
curators, trustees, and other fiduciaries, may legally invest any sinking
funds, monies or other funds belonging to them or within their control in any
bonds or other obligations issued by the municipality pursuant to this
appendix. The bonds and other obligations shall be secured by an agreement
between the issuer and the Federal Government in which the issuer agrees to
borrow from the Federal Government and the Federal Government agrees to lend
to the issuer, prior to the maturity of the bonds or other obligations,
monies in an amount which (together with any other monies committed
irrevocably to the payment of principal and interest on the bonds or other
obligations) will suffice to pay the principal of the bonds or other
obligations with interest to maturity on them. The monies under the terms of
the agreement shall be required to be used for the purpose of paying the
principal of and the interest on the bonds or other obligations at their
maturity. The bonds and other obligations shall be authorized security for
all public deposits. This section authorizes any persons or public or private
political subdivisions and officers to use any funds owned or controlled by
them for the purchase of any bonds or other obligations. With regard to legal
investments, this section may not be construed to relieve any person of any
duty of exercising reasonable care in selecting securities.

§ 12-2  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.



   (A)   The town, recognizing that our system of representative
government is dependent in part upon the people maintaining the highest trust
in their public officials and employees, finds and declares that the people
have a right to be assured that the impartiality and independent judgment of
the public officials and employees will be maintained.



   (B)   It is evident that this confidence and trust is eroded when
the conduct of the town's business is subject to improper influence and even
the appearance of improper influence.



   (C)   For the purpose of guarding against improper influence, the
Mayor and Council enact this Public Ethics Law to require town officials and
employees to disclose their financial affairs and to set minimum standards
for their conduct of town business.



   (D)   It is the intention of the Mayor and Council that this chapter
be liberally construed to accomplish this purpose.

authorized to act, the disqualified public servant shall disclose the nature
and circumstances of the conflict and may participate or act.



   (D)   Employment restrictions.



      (1)   (a)   Except as permitted by decision of the
Commission when such interest is disclosed or when this employment does not
create a conflict of interest or appearance of conflict, a public servant may
not:



            1.   Be employed by, or have a financial interest
in, any entity subject to his or her authority or that of the town agency,
board, or commission with which he or she is affiliated or any entity which
is negotiating or has entered a contract with that agency, board, or
commission; or



            2.   Hold any other employment relationship which
would impair the impartiality or independence of judgment of the public
servant.



         (b)   This prohibition does not apply to:



            1.   A public servant who is appointed to a
regulatory licensing authority pursuant to a requirement that persons subject
to the jurisdiction of the authority be represented in appointments to it;



            2.   Subject to other provisions of law, including
§§ 12-7 and 12-8 of this chapter, a member of a board or a commission in
regard to a financial interest or employment held at the time of appointment,
provided it is publicly disclosed to the appointing authority and the
Commission; or



            3.   A public servant whose duties are
ministerial, if the private employment or financial interest does not create
a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest, as
permitted and in accordance with regulations adopted by the Commission.



      (2)   A former public servant may not assist or represent
another party other than the town for compensation in a case, contract, or

      (3)   A public servant may not assist or represent a party for
contingent compensation in any matter before or involving the town other than

intentionally use the prestige of his or her office for his or her own

by the official's or employee's governmental unit; or



         (d)   Is a lobbyist with respect to matters within the
jurisdiction of the official or employee.



      (4)   Division (F)(5) of this section does not apply to a gift:



         (a)   That would tend to impair the impartiality and the
independence of judgment of the official or employee receiving the gift;



         (b)   Of significant value that would give the
appearance of impairing the impartiality and independence of judgment of the
official or employee; or



         (c)   Of significant value that the recipient official
or employee believes or has reason to believe is designed to impair the
impartiality and independence of judgment of the official or employee.



      (5)   Notwithstanding division (F)(3) of this section, an

give in return for the participation of the official or employee in a panel
or speaking engagement at the meeting;



         (e)   Gifts of tickets or free admission extended to an
elected local official to attend a charitable, cultural, or political event,
if the purpose of this gift or admission is a courtesy or ceremony extended
to the elected official's office;



         (f)   A specific gift or class of gifts that the
Commission exempts from the operation of this division upon a finding, in
writing, that acceptance of the gift or class of gifts would not be
detrimental to the impartial conduct of the business of the town and that the
gift is purely personal and private in nature;



         (g)   Gifts from a person related to the official or
employee by blood or marriage, or any other individual who is a member of the
household of the official or employee; or



         (h)   Honoraria for speaking to or participating in a
meeting, provided that the offering of the honorarium is not related in any
way to the official's or employee's official position.

former public servant shall divulge to any unauthorized person confidential
information acquired in the course of holding his or her position in advance
of the time prescribed by the governing body, administrators, or other
applicable law for its release to the public.



   (H)   Members of a voting body shall avoid ex parte contact with
applicants or potential applicants, or potential interested persons who may
come before the voting body requesting approval or disapproval of a
particular application or project, and shall refrain from discussing with
such persons applications or projects which they have reason to believe will
come before them in their official capacity. The public has a right to expect
that decisions are made by evidence and exhibits presented on the record. Ex
parte communications received in violation of this division (H) shall be
placed in the record and disclosed to all parties, who shall then have ten
days within which to rebut them.



   (I)   Exemptions and waivers. The Commission may recommend to the
Mayor and Council that it grant exemptions to or modifications of this §
12-6 as to public servants serving as members of town boards and commissions,
when the Commission finds that the application of § 12-6 would constitute an
unreasonable invasion of privacy and would significantly reduce the
availability of qualified persons for public service, and that the exemption
or modification would not be contrary to the purposes of this chapter.

   (A)   The Commission may:



      (1)   Assess a late fee of $2 per day up to a maximum of $250
for a failure to timely file a financial disclosure statement required under
§§ 12-7 or 12-8 of this chapter;



      (2)   Assess a late fee of $ 10 per day up to a maximum of

      (3)   Issue a cease and desist order against any person found
to be in violation of this chapter.



   (B)   (1)   Upon a finding of a violation of any provision of
this chapter, the Commission may:



         (a)   Issue an order of compliance directing the
Respondent to cease and desist from the violation;



         (b)   Issue a reprimand; or

appropriate discipline of the respondent, including censure or removal if

information that is required under § 12-9 of this chapter;



         (b)   Impose a fine not exceeding $5,000 for each

required financial disclosure statement may constitute grounds for removal
from office.



      (2)   Any hearing by the Mayor and Council shall be conducted
in accordance with the following provisions:



         (a)   The Respondent must be given at least 20 days

tend to clear the respondent.



         (e)   The respondent or his or her representative shall
have an adequate opportunity to examine all documents and records to be used
at the hearing at a reasonable time before the date of the hearing as well as
during the hearing, to bring witnesses to establish all pertinent facts and
circumstances, and to question or refute any testimony or evidence, including
the opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. Upon the
request of the respondent, the Mayor and Council shall subpoena named
individuals to appear as witnesses at the hearing, if such action is
necessary to compel their attendance. Subpoenas issued pursuant to this §
12-10 shall be judicially enforceable.

   (E)   Mayor and Council action. The Mayor and Council shall, by

forfeiture or removal from office, termination from employment and a cease
and desist order, which must be enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction.



   (F)   Upon direction by the Commission or the Mayor and Council, the
Commission Attorney may file a petition for injunctive or other relief in the
Circuit Court for Kent County, or in any other court having proper venue for
the purpose of requiring compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The
court may:



      (1)   Issue an order to cease and desist from the violation; or



      (2)   Void an official action taken by a public servant with a
conflict of interest prohibited by this chapter when the action arises from
or concerns the subject matter of the conflict and if the legal action is
brought within 90 days of the occurrence of the official action, if the court
deems voiding the action to be in the best interest of the public, provided,
however, that the court may not void any official action appropriating public
funds, levying taxes, or providing for the issuance of bonds, notes, or other
evidences of public obligation; or



      (3)   Impose a fine of up to $5,000 for any violation of the

chapter, a person who is subject to the provisions of this chapter and who is
found by the Commission, Mayor and Council, or a court to have violated its
provisions may be subject to termination or such other disciplinary action as
may be warranted, or may be suspended from receiving payment of salary or
other compensation pending full compliance with the terms of an order of the
Commission, Mayor and Council, or a court.



   (H)   Any person who is subject to the provisions of this chapter

date of filing the report, statement, or record containing these items. These
papers and documents shall be available for inspection upon request by the
Commission or the Mayor and Council after reasonable notice.



   (I)   Duties.



      (1)   All public servants shall respond fully and truthfully
to any inquiries by the Town Attorney, the Commission or its attorney in
connection with the investigation of an alleged or potential violation of

      (2)   All public servants have a general duty to report any

make and adopt a Master Plan for the physical development of the
municipality, including any areas outside of its boundaries which, in the
Commission's judgment, bear relation to the planning of the municipality. The

territory, including, among other things, the general location, character,
and extent of streets, viaducts, subways, bridges, waterways, waterfronts,

fields, and other public ways, grounds, and open spaces; the general location
and extent of public utilities and terminals, whether publicly or privately

any of the foregoing ways, grounds, open spaces, buildings, property,
utilities, or terminals, as well as a zoning plan for the control of the
height, area, bulk, location, and use of buildings and premises. As the work
of making the whole Master Plan progresses, the Commission may, from time to
time, adopt and publish a part or parts thereof, any part to cover one or
more major sections or divisions of the municipality, or one or more of the
aforesaid or other functional matters to be included in the plan. The
Commission may, from time to time, amend, extend, or add to the plan.

make careful and comprehensive surveys and studies of present conditions and
future growth in the municipality and with due regard to its relation to
neighboring territory. The plan shall be made with the general purpose of
guiding and accomplishing a coordinated, adjusted, and harmonious development
of the municipality and its environs, which will, in accordance with present

prosperity, and general welfare, as well as efficiency and economy in the
process of development, including, among other things, adequate provisions
for traffic, the promotion of safety from fire and other dangers, adequate
provision for light and air, the promotion of the healthful and convenient
distribution of population, the promotion of good civic design and

successive parts of the plan, the parts corresponding with major geographical
sections or divisions of the municipality or with functional subdivisions of

municipality or of one or more major sections or districts thereof, no
street, square, park, or other public way, ground, or open space or public
utility, whether publicly or privately owned, shall be constructed or

the submission to the Planning Commission shall be by the board, commission,
or body having the jurisdiction, and the Planning Commission's disapproval

possession of the property so condemned upon first paying to the Clerk of the
Court the amount of the award and all costs taxed to date notwithstanding any

§ 81-1  FINDINGS.



   (A)   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified special
flood hazard areas within the boundaries of the Town of Chestertown. Special
flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which may result in
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Structures that are
inadequately elevated, improperly floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damage also contribute to flood losses.



   (B)   The Town of Chestertown, by resolution, agreed to meet the
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and was accepted for
participation in the program on February 15, 1984. As of that date, or as of
February 15, 1984, the initial effective date of the Town of Chestertown
Flood Insurance Rate Map, all development and new construction as defined
herein, are to be compliant with these regulations.



(Ord. 02-2014, passed 4-21-2014)



§ 81-2  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The Maryland General Assembly, in Md. Code, Land Use Article, Title 4,
has established as policy of the state that the orderly development and use
of land and structures requires comprehensive regulation through the
implementation of planning and zoning control, and that planning and zoning
controls shall be implemented by local government in order to, among other
purposes, secure the public safety, promote health and general welfare, and
promote the conservation of natural resources.  Therefore, the Mayor and
Council of the Town of Chestertown does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations.



(Ord. 02-2014, passed 4-21-2014)



§ 81-3  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare, and to:



   (A)   Protect human life, health and welfare;



   (B)   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction
practices in order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future;



   (C)   Minimize flooding of water supply and sanitary sewage disposal
systems;



   (D)   Maintain natural drainage;



   (E)   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units and its residents, by discouraging unwise design and
construction of development in areas subject to flooding;



   (F)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   (G)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   (H)   Minimize damage to public facilities and other utilities such
as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges;



   (I)   Reinforce that those who build in and occupy special flood
hazard areas should assume responsibility for their actions;



   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties
within and near flood-prone areas;



   (K)   Provide that the flood storage and conveyance functions of
floodplains are maintained;



   (L)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and



   (M)   Meet community participation requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
at 44 CFR Section 59.22.



(Ord. 02-2014, passed 4-21-2014)



§ 81-4  AREAS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.



   These regulations shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within
the jurisdiction of the Town of Chestertown, and identified in § 81-5.



(Ord. 02-2014, passed 4-21-2014)



§ 81-5  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS AND BFES.



   (A)   For the purposes of these regulations, the minimum basis for
establishing special flood hazard areas and base flood elevations is the
Flood Insurance Study for Kent County, Maryland and Incorporated Areas dated
June 9, 2014, or the most recent revision thereof, and the accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Map(s) and all subsequent amendments and revisions to the
FIRMs. The FIS and FIRMs are retained on file and available to the public at
Chestertown Town Hall.



   (B)   Where field surveyed topography or digital topography
indicates that ground elevations are below the closest applicable base flood
elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard on the
FIRM, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area.



   (C)   To establish base flood elevations in special flood hazard
areas that do not have such elevations shown on the FIRM, the Floodplain
Administrator may provide the best available data for base flood elevations,
may require the applicant to obtain available information from federal, state
or other sources, or may require the applicant to establish special flood
hazard areas and base flood elevations as set forth in §§ 8-13, 81-14 and
81-15 of these regulations.



(Ord. 02-2014, passed 4-21-2014)



§ 81-6  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.



   These regulations are not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing
regulations and ordinances, including subdivision regulations, zoning
ordinances, building codes, or any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any
other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern.



(Ord. 02-2014, passed 4-21-2014)



§ 81-7  INTERPRETATION.



   (A)   In the interpretation and application of these regulations,
all provisions shall be:



      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;



      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and



      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers
granted under state statutes.



   (B)   Notes referencing publications of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency refer to the most recent edition of those publications, are
intended only as guidance, and do not bind or alter the authority of the
Floodplain Administrator to interpret and apply these regulations.



(Ord. 02-2014, passed 4-21-2014)



§ 81-8  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   (A)   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific
and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur, and flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside of the special flood hazard areas or uses that
are permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage.



   (B)   These regulations shall not create liability on the part of
the Town of Chestertown, any officer or employee thereof, the Maryland
Department of the Environment (MDE) or the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), for my flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.



(Ord. 02-2014, passed 4-21-2014)



§ 81-9  SEVERABILITY.



   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.



(Ord. 02-2014, passed 4-21-2014)

any source (see FLOOD or FLOODING ).



   FLOODPROOFING or FLOODPROOFED. Any combination of structural and
nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to buildings or structures
which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real
property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents, such
that the buildings or structures are watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. [Note: State regulations at Md. Code 26.17.04.11(B)(7) do not allow
new nonresidential buildings in nontidal waters of the state to be
floodproofed.]



   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE. FEMA form that is to be completed, signed
and sealed by a licensed professional engineer or licensed architect to

technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a
designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective
Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property or
structure is not located in a special flood hazard area.



      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR): A revision based on
technical data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. A LETTER OF
MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F) , is a determination that a structure or
parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and
is, therefore, no longer exposed to flooding associated with the base flood.
In order to qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted
and placed in accordance with the community's floodplain management
regulations.



      (3)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A formal
review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other
project complies with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with
respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas. A CONDITIONAL LETTER OF
MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F) is a determination that a parcel of land
or proposed structure that will be elevated by fill would not be inundated by
the base flood if fill is placed on the parcel as proposed or the structure
is built as proposed. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood Insurance
Rate Map or Flood Insurance Study; upon submission and approval of certified
as-built documentation, a Letter of Map Revision may be issued by FEMA, to
revise the effective FIRM.



   LICENSED. As used in these regulations, licensed refers to
professionals who are authorized to practice in the State of Maryland by
issuance of licenses by the Maryland Board of Architects, Maryland Board of
Professional Engineers, Maryland Board of Professional Land Surveyors, and
the Maryland Real Estate Appraisers and Home Inspectors Commission.



   LIMIT OF MODERATE WAVE ACTION (LiMWA). Inland limit of the area
affected by waves greater than one and one-half feet during the base flood.
Base flood conditions between the VE Zone and the LiMWA will be similar to,
but less severe than those in the VE Zone.



   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a building or structure; the floor of an enclosure below the
lowest floor is not the lowest floor provided the enclosure is constructed in
accordance with these regulations. The lowest floor of a manufactured home is
the bottom of the lowest horizontal supporting member (longitudinal chassis
frame beam).



   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without
a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE .



   MARKET VALUE. The price at which a property will change hands between a
willing buyer and a willing seller, neither party being under compulsion to
buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. For the
purposes of these regulations, the MARKET VALUE of a building is determined
by a licensed real estate appraiser or the most recent, full phased-in
assessment value of the building (improvement) determined by the Maryland
Department of Assessments and Taxation.



   MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT (MDE). A principal department of
the State of Maryland that is charged with, among other responsibilities, the
coordination of the National Flood Insurance Program in Maryland (NFIP State
Coordinator) and the administration of regulatory programs for development
and construction that occur within the waters of the state, including
nontidal wetlands, nontidal waters and floodplains, and state and private
tidal wetlands (tidal wetlands). Unless otherwise specified, MDE refers to
the Department's Wetlands and Waterways Program.



   MIXED-USE STRUCTURE. Any structure that is used or intended for use for
a mixture of nonresidential and residential uses in the same structure.



   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The program authorized by the
U.S. Congress in 42 U.S.C. §§ 4001 - 4129. The NFIP makes flood insurance
coverage available in communities that agree to adopt and enforce minimum
regulatory requirements for development in areas prone to flooding (see
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA ).



   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures, including additions and improvements, and
the placement of manufactured homes, for which the start of construction
commenced on or after February 15, 1984, the initial effective date of the

these regulations, NONTIDAL WATERS OF THE STATE refers to any stream or body
of water within the state that is subject to state regulation, including the
100-year frequency floodplain of free-flowing waters. Md Code 26.17.04.01
states that "the landward boundaries of any tidal waters shall be deemed
coterminous with the wetlands boundary maps adopted pursuant to Environment
Article, § 16-301, Annotated Code of Maryland." Therefore, the boundary
between the tidal and nontidal waters of the state is the tidal wetlands
boundary.



   PERSON. An individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies.

living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.



   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). The land in the floodplain subject to
a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD
AREAS are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood
Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO,
A1-30, and A99, and Zones VE and V1-30. The term includes areas shown on
other flood maps that are identified in § 81-5.



   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab
or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any
work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home
on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation
of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does
it include the installation on the property of accessory structures, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For substantial improvements, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.



   STRUCTURE. That which is built or constructed; specifically, a walled
and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is
principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. For guidance on
anchoring above- and below-ground fuel tanks, see the FEMA publication on
Fuel Systems for New and Substantially Improved Buildings, available at
http://www.fema.gov/pdf/fima/pbuffd_chapter_3-2.pdf.



   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a building or
structure whereby the cost of restoring the building or structure to its
before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the
building or structure before the damage occurred. Also used as "substantially
damaged" structures. [Note: See "Substantial Improvement/Substantial Damage
Desk Reference" (FEMA P-758).]



   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the building or structure before the start
of construction of the improvement. The term includes structures which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:



      (1)   Any project for improvement of a building or structure
to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official prior to submission of an application for a permit and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or



      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that
the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure. [Note: See "Substantial Improvement/Substantial Damage
Desk Reference" (FEMA P-758).]



   TEMPORARY STRUCTURE. A structure installed, used, or erected for a

area that is being performed without an issued permit.  The failure of a
building, structure, or other development for which a permit is issued to be
fully compliant with these regulations and the conditions of the issued
permit. A building, structure, or other development without the required
design certifications, the elevation certificate, or other evidence of
compliance required is presumed to be a violation until such time as the
required documentation is provided.



   WATERCOURSE. The channel, including channel banks and bed, of nontidal
waters of the state.



   WATERS OF THE STATE. [See Md. Code, Environment Article, Title 5,
Subtitle 1.] Include:



      (1)   Both surface and underground waters within the
boundaries of the State subject to its jurisdiction;



      (2)   That portion of the Atlantic Ocean within the boundaries
of the state;



      (3)   The Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries;

(Ord. 02-2014, passed 4-21-2014)



§ 81-13  USE AND INTERPRETATION OF FIRMS.



   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of special flood hazard areas, floodplain
boundaries, and floodway boundaries. The following shall apply to the use and
interpretation of FIRMs and data:



   (A)   Where field surveyed topography indicates that ground
elevations:



      (1)   Are below the base flood elevation, even in areas not
delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be
considered as special flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of
these regulations;



      (2)   Are above the base flood elevation, the area shall be
regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a Letter
of Map Change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area.



   (B)   In FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation and floodway data have not been identified and in areas where FEMA
has not identified special flood hazard areas, any other flood hazard data
available from a federal, state, or other source shall be reviewed and
reasonably used.



   (C)   Base flood elevations and designated floodway boundaries on
FIRMs and in FISs shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other sources if such sources show reduced
floodway widths and/or lower base flood elevations.



   (D)   Other sources of data shall be reasonably used if such sources
show increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are
shown on FIRMs and in FISs.



   (E)   If a Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or a Preliminary
Flood Insurance Study has been provided by FEMA:



      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by
FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and shall replace the
flood hazard data previously provided from FEMA for the purposes of
administering these regulations;



      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination
by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall be deemed the best
available data pursuant to § 81-5(C) and used where no base flood elevations
and/or floodway areas are provided on the effective FIRM.



      (3)   Prior to issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by
FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data is permitted where the
preliminary base flood elevations, floodplain or floodway boundaries exceed
the base flood elevations and/or designated floodway widths in existing flood
hazard data provided by FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change
and/or appeal to FEMA.



(Ord. 02-2014, passed 4-21-2014)



§ 81-14  PERMITS REQUIRED AND EXPIRATION.



   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to begin any development
or construction which is wholly within, partially within, or in contact with
any flood hazard area established in § 81-5, including but not limited to:
filling; grading; construction of new structures; the substantial improvement
of buildings or structures, including repair of substantial damage; placement
or replacement of manufactured homes, including substantial improvement or
repair of substantial damage of manufactured homes; erecting or installing a
temporary structure, or alteration of a watercourse, until a permit is
obtained from the Town of Chestertown. No such permit shall be issued until
the requirements of these regulations have been met.



   (B)   In addition to the permits required in division (A) above,
applicants for permits in nontidal waters of the state are advised to contact
MDE. Unless waived by MDE, pursuant to Md. Code 26.17.04, Construction on
Nontidal Waters and Floodplains, MDE regulates the "100-year frequency
floodplain of free-flowing waters," also referred to as nontidal waters of
the state. To determine the 100-year frequency floodplain, hydrologic
calculations are based on the ultimate development of the watershed, assuming
existing zoning. The resulting flood hazard areas delineated using the
results of such calculations may be different than the special flood hazard
areas established in § 81-5. A permit from the Town of Chestertown is still
required in addition to any state requirements.



   (C)   A permit is valid provided the actual start of work is within
180 days of the date of permit issuance. Requests for extensions shall be
submitted in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. The Floodplain
Administrator may grant, in writing, one or more extensions of time, for
additional periods not exceeding 90 days each and provided there has been no
amendment or revision to the basis for establishing special flood hazard
areas and BFEs set forth in § 81-5.

setbacks. Base flood elevations shall be used to delineate the boundary of
flood hazard areas and such delineations shall prevail over the boundary of
SFHAs shown on FIRMs.



      (4)   Where floodways are not delineated or base flood
elevations are not shown on the FIRMs, the Floodplain Administrator has the
authority to require the applicant to use information provided by the
Floodplain Administrator, information that is available from federal, state,
or other sources, or to determine such information using accepted engineering
practices or methods approved by the Floodplain Administrator. [Note: See
"Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas: A Guide for
Obtaining and Developing Base (100-Year) Flood Elevations" (FEMA 265).]

performed in accordance with the requirements and specifications of MDE and
FEMA.



      (6)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses for
proposals in special flood hazard areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but has not delineated a floodway; such analyses shall demonstrate
that the cumulative effect of proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, or a lower
increase if required by MDE.



      (7)   For encroachments in floodways, an evaluation of
alternatives to such encroachments, including different uses of the site or
portion of the site within the floodway, and minimization of such

         (c)   A written evaluation of alternative methods
considered to elevate structures and manufactured homes, if the location is
in nontidal waters of the state and fill is proposed to achieve the elevation
required in § 81-34(A) or 81-35(A).



      (10)   For accessory structures that are 300 square feet or
larger in area (footprint) and that are below the base flood elevation, a
variance is required as set forth in §§ 81-44 through 81-47. If a variance
is granted, a signed Declaration of Land Restriction (Nonconversion
Agreement) shall be recorded on the property deed prior to issuance of the
certificate of occupancy.



      (11)   For temporary structures and temporary storage,
specification of the duration of the temporary use.



      (12)   For proposed work on existing buildings, structure, and
manufactured homes, including any improvement, addition, repairs,
alterations, rehabilitation, or reconstruction, sufficient information to
determine if the work constitutes substantial improvement or repair of
substantial damage, including but not limited to:



         (a)   If the existing building or structure was
constructed after February 15, 1984, evidence that the work will not alter
any aspect of the building or structure that was required for compliance with
the floodplain management requirements in effect at the time the building or
structure was permitted;



         (b)   If the proposed work is a horizontal addition, a
description of the addition and whether it will be independently supported or
structurally connected to the base building and the nature of all other

or structure before the improvement or, if the work is repair of damage,
before the damage occurred;



         (d)   Documentation of the actual cash value of all
proposed work, including the actual cash value of all work necessary to
repair and restore damage to the before-damaged condition, regardless of the
amount of work that will be performed. The value of work performed by the
owner or volunteers shall be valued at market labor rates; the value of
donated or discounted materials shall be valued at market rates.



      (13)   Certifications and/or technical analyses prepared or
conducted by a licensed professional engineer or licensed architect, as
appropriate, including:



         (a)   The determination of the base flood elevations or
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses prepared by a licensed

§ 81-47  LIMITATIONS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.



   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall make an affirmative decision on a
variance request only upon:



   (A)   A showing of good and sufficient cause. Good and sufficient
cause deals solely with the physical characteristics of the property and
cannot be based on the character of the improvement, the personal
characteristics of the owner/inhabitants, or local provision that regulate
standards other than health and public safety.



   (B)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of
these regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the
applicant.



   (C)   A determination that the granting of a variance for
development within any designated floodway, or flood hazard area with base
flood elevations but no designated floodway, will not result in increased
flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations.



   (D)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.



   (E)   A determination that the building, structure or other
development is protected by methods to minimize flood damages.



   (F)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to
afford relief, considering the flood hazard.

to, brush, limbs, yard waste, leaves, furniture, appliances, aggregates,
metals, lumber, and wood.



   GARBAGE.  Controlled non-recyclable waste materials that would
normally be discarded from within a single-family household and would be
collected by the town under the conditions of this chapter. This would
include, but not be limited to, food wastes, paper and plastic wrapping
materials from small packages, paper towels, tissues, disposable diapers,
cloth rags, and paint cans empty of paint. It would not include materials
that are being recycled, such as glass bottles, newspaper, aluminum and steel
cans, certain plastic containers, magazines, paper, and corrugated cardboard.



   RECYCLABLES.  Materials which the town or county recycles without
charge for the single-family residential property owner. At the time of the

   (A)   The town will pick up garbage twice weekly at each approved
unit stop. Garbage must be placed in the correct containers and shall not
exceed the approved amount. The town reserves the right to pick up garbage
once a week if necessary due to budgetary or staffing reasons, and also
reserves the right to refuse the pickup of recyclables co-mingled with
garbage. The maximum number of 20-gallon cans or trash bags will be two per
garbage day. Garbage containers shall be placed at the curb or in their
approved location no earlier than 6:00 p.m. on the evening before collection.



   (B)   No garbage other than that of the property owner in residence
shall be accepted, and the willful placement of non-residents' garbage shall
be treated as a municipal infraction as set forth in the enforcement section
of this chapter. Other violations treated as municipal infractions related to
garbage collection shall be:



      (1)   Placement of garbage containers or trash bags at the
curb prior to 6:00 p.m. on the evening before collection;



      (2)   Leaving garbage containers or trash bags at the curb
after 6:00 p.m. on the day of collection; and



      (3)   Placement of more than the allotted garbage cans or
trash bags at the curb for trash pick-up.



   (C)   The town further reserves the right to pick up the excess cans

its pickup;



      (2)   Up to 24 hours may be granted to accomplish the removal;
and



      (3)   If the trash is not removed within 24 hours, the town
can then take the following action:



         (a)    The trash can be immediately removed by the town
at the owner's expense. A bill will be sent for this service and a reasonable
fee will be established for the weight cost at the appropriate landfill and
the town's cost for picking up the trash. If the bill for this removal is not
paid within 30 days, 8% annual interest can be assessed monthly. If the bill
is unpaid at year's end, the balance can be placed as a lien on the property
and handled as an unpaid, overdue tax bill; and



         (b)   The town may add the penalty of a municipal
infraction for repeat offenses under the provisions of § 86(B) of the
Charter.

approve the proposed demolition, construction, reconstruction, or alteration,
moving, or demolition despite the fact the changes come within the provisions
of §§ 93-12 and 93-13 of this chapter, if the site or structure is an
impediment to a major improvement program which will be of substantial
benefit to the town, if retention of the site or structure would cause undue

property within the town, or the agent of the owner, to properly dispose of
litter located on the owner's property which is dangerous to public health,
safety, or welfare. The notice shall be sent by registered mail, addressed to
the owner at his or her last known address.



   (B)   Action upon noncompliance.  Upon the failure, neglect, or
refusal of any owner or agent so notified to properly dispose of litter
dangerous to the public health, safety, or welfare within ten days after
receipt of the written notice provided for in division (A) above, or within
20 days after the date of the notice in the event that the same is returned
to the town post office because of its inability to make delivery thereof,
provided that the same was properly addressed to the last known address of
the owner or agent, the Mayor and Council are hereby authorized and empowered
to pay for the disposing of the litter or to order its disposal by the town.



   (C)   Charge included in tax bill.  When the town has effected the
removal of the dangerous litter or has paid for its removal, the actual cost
thereof, plus accrued interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of
the completion of the work, if not paid by the owner prior thereto, shall be
charged to the owner of the property on the next regular tax bill forwarded
to the owner by the town. The charge shall be due and payable by the owner at
the time of payment of the bill.



   (D)   Recorded statement constitutes lien.  Where the full amount
due the town is not paid by the owner within 30 days after the disposal of
the litter as provided for in divisions (A) and (B) above, then in that case
the Mayor and Council shall cause to be recorded in the office of the Town
Manager a sworn statement showing the cost and expense incurred for the work,
the date the work was done, and the location of the property on which the
work was done. The recordation of the sworn statement shall constitute a lien
and privilege on the property and shall remain in full force and effect for
the amount due in principal and interest, plus costs of court, if any, for
collection until final payment has been made. The costs and expenses shall be
collected in the manner fixed by law for the collection of taxes and,
further, shall be subject to a delinquent penalty of 6% in the event that
same is not paid in full on or before the date the tax bill upon which the
charge appears becomes delinquent. Sworn statements recorded in accordance
with the provisions hereof shall be prima facie evidence that all legal
formalities have been complied with and that the work has been done properly
and satisfactorily and shall be full notice to every person concerned that
the amount of the statement, plus interest, constitutes a charge against the
property designated or described in the statement and that the same is due
and collectible as provided by law.

including the lamps, together with the parts required to distribute the
light, to position and protect the lamps, and to connect the lamps to the
power supply.



   FOOT-CANDLE.  A measure of illuminance or a measure of how bright a
light appears to the eye. One foot-candle is equal to one Lumen/ft2. As an
example, a typical 60-watt incandescent lamp (840 lumens) produces an
illuminance of 0.1 foot-candles at a distance of about 25 feet.

artificial light in the atmosphere and resulting in decreased ability to see
the natural night sky.



   LIGHT TRESPASS.  Any light emitted by an outdoor luminaire that shines
directly beyond the property on which the luminaire is installed, or
indirectly shines beyond the property on which the luminaire is installed at
a brightness (illuminance) that exceeds 0.1 foot-candles at the property line.



   LUMINAIRE.  See definition for FIXTURE.



   MANAGER.  The Town Manager.

§ 117-1  FINDINGS OF FACT; LEGISLATIVE INTENT; STATUTORY REFERENCE.



   (A)   (1)   Excessive noise, when unnecessary to the carrying on
of religious, political, civic, commercial, or other constitutionally
protected activities, or when not generated in the course of other activity
needful to the carrying on of daily life, creates a significant threat to
public health, safety, and welfare in an area of population density such as
the town;



      (2)   Those noises which are most detrimental to public
health, safety, and welfare in the town and which are least necessary to the
carrying on of any constitutionally protected or otherwise necessary activity
are those which are loud, boisterous, raucous, unseemly, or generated solely
for the purpose of the entertainment of a person or group of persons without
regard to the health, safety, and welfare of others who, because of
population density, are unable to avoid being subjected to the noises;



      (3)   There has been an alarming increase in the frequency and
volume of the noise, particularly with regard to loud parties and to the
plethora of portable sound-producing and sound-reproducing devices available
on the market today; and



      (4)   The Mayor and Town Council have received an increasing
number of complaints from the citizens of the town regarding the noise.



   (B)   It is hereby the intent of the Mayor and Town Council to enact
this legislation as a vehicle for the control and regulation of excessive
noise that poses a threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens
of the town without affecting or impacting upon any commercial, religious,
political, civic, or other constitutionally protected activity, except where
the impact is clearly indicated and where religious, civic, political,
charitable, or civic organizations provide entertainment, as in the case of
fund-raisers.



   (C)   Nothing in this chapter is intended to preempt or alter any of
the provisions of Md. Code, Transportation Article, Title 22, Subtitle 4 or
of Md. Code Article 27, § 121.

§ 142-1  INTENT.



   The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the
public health, safety and general welfare by establishing minimum
requirements and procedures to control the adverse impacts associated with
increased stormwater runoff. The goal is to manage stormwater by using
environmental site design (ESD) to the maximum extent practicable (MEP) to
maintain after development, as nearly as possible, the pre-development runoff
characteristics, and to reduce stream channel erosion, pollution, siltation,
sedimentation, and local flooding, and use appropriate structural best
management practices (BMP) only when necessary. This will restore, enhance,
and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of streams,
minimize damage to public and private property, and reduce the impacts of
land development.

   The provisions of this chapter, pursuant to the Environment Article,
Title 4, Subtitle 2, Md. Code, 2009 replacement volume, are adopted under the
Municipal Charter for the town and shall apply to all development or
redevelopment occurring within the incorporated area of the town. The
application of this chapter and the provisions expressed herein shall be the
minimum stormwater management requirements, and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statute. The town
shall be responsible for the coordination and enforcement of the provisions
of this chapter. Any development that has not received final approval for
erosion and sediment control and stormwater management plans by May 4, 2010,
shall comply with this chapter, unless the development or redevelopment is
granted an administrative waiver under Article III, § 142-6 of this chapter.

§ 142-9  VARIANCES.



   (A)   The town may grant, upon application, a written variance from
the stormwater requirements found in Article V of this chapter. A written
request for variance shall be provided to the town, and shall state the
specific variances sought and reasons for their granting.



   (B)   The variance shall comply, as nearly as possible, in every
respect to the spirit, intent, and purpose of this chapter; it being the
purpose of this provision to authorize the granting of variations only for
reasons of demonstrable unwarranted hardship, as distinguished from
variations sought by applicants for purposes or reasons of convenience,
profit, or caprice.



   (C)   The town shall evaluate the cumulative effects of other
developments that are relinquished from the requirements of stormwater
management.



   (D)   In order to grant a variance, the town must find the following:

performed on sites where existing land use is commercial, industrial,
institutional, or multi-family residential, and existing site impervious area
exceeds 40%.



   (A)   Stormwater management plans are required by the town for all
redevelopment, unless otherwise specified by watershed management plan
developed according to this chapter. Stormwater management measures shall be
consistent with the design manual.



   (B)   All redevelopment designs shall:



      (1)   Reduce impervious surface area within the limit of
disturbance (LOD) by at least 50% according to the design manual;



      (2)   Implement ESD to the MEP to provide water quality
treatment for at least 50% of the existing impervious surface area within the
limit of disturbance; or



      (3)   Use a combination of divisions (B)(1) and (2) for at
least 50% of the existing site impervious area.



   (C)   Alternative stormwater management measures may be used to meet
the requirements of division (B) if the applicant satisfactorily demonstrates
to the town that impervious area reduction has been maximized and ESD has
been implemented to the MEP. Alternative stormwater management measures
include, but are not limited to:



      (1)   An on-site structural best management practice;



      (2)   An off-site BMP to provide water quality treatment for
an area equal to or greater than 50% of the existing impervious area; or



      (3)   A combination of impervious area reduction, ESD
implementation, and an on-site or off-site structural BMP for an area equal
to or greater than 50% of the existing site impervious surface area within
the limit of disturbance.



   (D)   The town may develop separate policies for providing water
quality treatment for redevelopment projects if the requirements of divisions
(A) and (B) cannot be met. Any separate redevelopment policy shall be
reviewed and approved by the Maryland Department of the Environment, and may
include but not be limited to:



      (1)   A combination of ESD and an on-site or off-site
structural BMP;



      (2)   Retrofitting including existing BMP upgrades, filtering
practices and off-site ESD implementation;



      (3)   Stream restoration in the same 12-digit watershed as the
proposed development and an area restored equivalent to the area required for
treatment;



      (4)   Pollution trading with another entity;

not practicable.



   (F)   The determination of alternatives available may be made by the
town at the appropriate stage in the development review process. The town
shall consider the prioritization of alternatives in division (D) after it
has been determined that it is not practicable to meet the 2009 regulatory
requirements using ESD. In deciding the alternatives that may be required,
the town may consider factors, including but not limited to the following:



      (1)   Whether the project is in an area targeted for
development incentives such as a priority funding area;



      (2)   Whether the project is necessary to accommodate growth
consistent with the comprehensive plan; or



      (3)   Whether bonding or other financing mechanisms have been
secured based on an approved development plan.



   (F)   Stormwater management shall be addressed according to the new
development requirements in the design manual for any net increase in
impervious areas.

   142-12   Stormwater management measures



§ 142-11 STORMWATER MINIMUM CONTROL STANDARDS.



   Stormwater management shall be accomplished for all new development
according to the minimum requirements established in this section and the
design manual as follows:



   (A)   All planning techniques, nonstructural practices, and design
methods specified in the design manual shall be used to implement ESD to the
MEP. The use of ESD planning techniques and treatment practices shall be
exhausted before any structural BMP is implemented. Stormwater management
plans for development projects subject to this chapter shall be designed
using ESD sizing criteria, recharge volume, water quality volume, and channel
protection storage volume criteria according to the design manual. The MEP
standard is met when channel stability is maintained, pre-development
groundwater recharge is replicated, nonpoint source pollution is minimized,
and structural stormwater management practices are used only if determined to
be absolutely necessary.



   (B)   Control of the ten-year frequency storm event is required,
according to the design manual, if the town determines that additional
stormwater management is necessary because historical flooding problems
exist, and downstream floodplain development and conveyance system design
cannot be controlled.



   (C)   The town may require more than the minimum control
requirements specified in this chapter if hydrologic or topographic
conditions warrant, or if flooding, stream channel erosion, or water quality
problems exist downstream from a proposed project.



   (D)   Alternate minimum control requirements may be adopted subject
to approval by the Maryland Department of the Environment. The Maryland
Department of the Environment shall require a demonstration that alternative
requirements will implement ESD to the MEP and control flood damages,
accelerated stream erosion, water quality and sedimentation. Comprehensive
watershed studies may also be required.



   (E)   Stormwater management and development plans, where applicable,
shall be consistent with adopted and approved watershed management plans or
flood management plans as approved by the Maryland Department of the
Environment in accordance with the Flood Hazard Management Act of 1976.

      (3)   Structural stormwater management practices shall be
selected to accommodate the unique hydrologic or geologic regions of the
state.



   (C)   Alternative practices and measures.  Alternative ESD planning
techniques and treatment practices and structural stormwater measures may be
used for new development runoff control if the practices and measures meet
the performance criteria in the design manual and all subsequent revisions
and are approved by the Maryland Department of Environment. Practices used
for redevelopment projects shall be approved by the town.



   (D)   Recordation of practices and measures.  ESD techniques and
treatment practices and structural stormwater management measures used to

be recorded in the land records of Kent County, and remain unaltered by
subsequent property owners. Prior approval from the town shall be obtained
before any stormwater management practice is altered.



   (E)   Modification.  For purposes of modifying the minimum control
requirements or design criteria, the applicant shall submit an analysis to
the town of the impacts of stormwater flows downstream in the watershed. The
analysis shall include hydrologic and hydraulic calculations necessary to
determine the impact of hydrographic timing modifications of the proposed
development upon a dam, highway, structure, or natural point of restricted
stream flow. The point of investigation shall be established with the
concurrence of the town downstream of the first downstream tributary whose
drainage area equals or exceeds the contributing area to the project or
stormwater management facility.



   (F)   Specific design criteria.  The basic design criteria,
methodologies, and construction specifications, subject to the approval of
the town and the Maryland Department of Environment, shall be those of the

   (A)   For any proposed development, a phased stormwater management
plan shall be submitted to the town for review and approval. Unless otherwise
determined by the town, plans shall be submitted for the concept, site
design, and final stormwater management construction. When deemed appropriate
by the town due to minor cumulative impacts of the development, and when the
applicant has demonstrated that ESD standards have been met to the MEP, the
site design and final stormwater management construction phases may be
combined. Site plans, subdivisions, and building permits with a total
proposed lot coverage of 15%, and total land disturbance less than 20,000
square feet, may combine all review phases when the applicant has
demonstrated that ESD standards have been met to the MEP using the standard
plan. Site plans and building permits that meet the criteria outlined on
the  county Standard Stormwater Plan may utilize the standard stormwater
management plan.



   (B)   Conceptual stormwater management plans should be submitted
with conceptual/sketch site or subdivision plans and shall include sufficient
information for an initial assessment of the proposed project and proposed
stormwater management plan. The concept review process will review at a
conceptual level, the feasibility, design and environmental characteristics
of the proposal, with a goal to ensure that significant natural areas are
protected, and to determine if stormwater management can be provided
according the stormwater management measures identified in Article V, §
142-12 of this chapter.



   (C)   Following conceptual approval and where applicable in
conjunction with the preliminary site or subdivision plan, the applicant
shall submit a site development plan. The site development plan shall include
detailed designs for stormwater management and erosion and sediment control.
The site development plan process will review the plan to ensure that all
options for implementing ESD have been exhausted, and comments received
during conceptual review have been incorporated into the site development
plan.



   (D)   Following site development plan approval and where applicable
in conjunction with the final site or subdivision plan and the sediment and
erosion control plan, the applicant shall submit a final stormwater
management plan. The final stormwater management plan shall include
stormwater construction drawings, accompanied by a report that includes
sufficient information to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed runoff
control design. The final stormwater plan process will review the plan and
supporting documents for compliance with all applicable regulations, and to
ensure that when structural practices are used, all reasonable options for
implementing ESD have been exhausted.



   (E)   The town shall perform a comprehensive review of the
stormwater management plans for each phase of the site design. Coordinated
comments will be provided for each plan phase that reflects input from all
appropriate agencies, including but not limited to, the Kent Soil and Water
Conservation District, the Planning Commission and Chestertown Utilities. All
comments shall be addressed and reflected in the next phase of project design.



   (F)   The stormwater management plan shall not be considered
approved without the inclusion of the signature and date of the signature of
the town designee for approval of stormwater management plans.

§ 148-5  PROCEDURES FOR PLAT SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL.



   (A)   Preliminary conference.



      (1)   Before undertaking the preparation of a subdivision
plat, the subdivider shall have prepared a sketch of the property in
question, being drawn to approximate scale and showing the boundaries,
general topography, important physical features and other significant
information, as well as the proposed scheme for development of the property,
including the proposed street and lot locations, areas to be reserved for
public use, and proposed improvements.



      (2)   The subdivider shall then consult with the Planning
Commission or its staff in order to ascertain the location of proposed major
streets, highways, parks, playgrounds, school sites, and other planned public
improvements, and to determine the zoning regulations and other requirements
relating to, affecting, or applying to the proposed subdivision. The
subdivider shall also consult with the Engineer and the Health Officer on the
proposed street layout and the proposed facilities for sanitary sewage
disposal, storm drainage, and water supply to serve the proposed subdivision.
The purpose of these consultations is to assist the subdivider by furnishing
information and advice in order to expedite matters for the subdivider, save
him or her unnecessary expense, and promote the best coordination between the
plans of the subdivider and those of the town.



   (B)   Submission of preliminary plat.



      (1)   The subdivider shall then prepare a preliminary plat of
the proposed subdivision which conforms to the requirements for the
preparation of the plat as set forth in § 148-7 of this chapter. At least
two weeks prior to the regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission
at which action on the plat is desired, the following items shall be filed
with the Secretary of the Planning Commission:



         (a)   Three black-line or blue-line prints of the
preliminary plat;



         (b)   Supporting statements on required improvements and
proposed deed restrictions as set forth in § 148-7 of this chapter; and



         (c)   An application for the approval of the plat on a
form to be supplied by the Planning Commission.



      (2)   The preliminary plat shall be checked by the Planning
Commission or its staff for its conformity with the transportation plan and
other pertinent features of the comprehensive plan of the town, the
applicable zoning and other regulations, and the design principles and
standards and requirements for submission as set forth in this chapter.
Copies of the preliminary plat shall be referred for review and approval to
the Engineer, Health Officer, and other appropriate public officials
concerned with public improvements or health requirements.



   (C)   Preliminary plat approval.



      (1)   A hearing on the preliminary plat shall be held at the
next regular meeting of the Planning Commission. No hearing shall be held by
the Planning Commission until notice thereof shall have been sent to the
subdivider and to other interested parties as may be determined by the
Planning Commission. At the hearing, the Planning Commission shall submit its
findings and recommendations, together with those of the other public
officials to whom copies were referred. The Planning Commission shall either
tentatively approve or disapprove the preliminary plat, or it may approve the
plat subject to specific changes or modifications. One copy of the
preliminary plat, with any comments, shall be returned to the subdivider,
with other copies being retained in the files of the Planning Commission.



      (2)   Tentative approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid
for not more than six months. Unless a final plat, substantially in
accordance with the approved preliminary plat and including any required
changes or modifications, shall be filed with the Planning Commission within
six months from the date of approval of the preliminary plat, the Planning
Commission's approval thereof shall be deemed canceled; provided, however,
that the final plat may include only a portion of the area in the preliminary
plat and that final plats for remaining portions may be filed at a later date
without a new preliminary plat, but subject to any changes in the regulations
contained herein which are made after the six-month period.



   (D)   Installation of improvements.  Following tentative approval
of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall prepare and submit plans for
the installation of those improvements which he or she is required to make
under the provisions of this chapter. Copies of the improvement plans shall
be submitted to appropriate public officials for approval. Upon being
notified that the improvement plans have been approved, the subdivider shall
proceed with the installation of the improvements prior to filing a final
plat for the subdivision with the Planning Commission, except that in lieu of
completing the required improvements prior to the filing, the subdivider may
furnish the Mayor and Council with a cash deposit or performance bond
executed in accordance with the provisions of § 148-8(A) of this chapter.



   (E)   Submission of final plat.



      (1)   Following completion of the required improvements to the
satisfaction of the appropriate public officials or following the posting of
a performance bond or cash deposit in lieu of the completion, the subdivider
shall prepare a final plat of the subdivision. The final plat may be for all
the property included in the preliminary plat or it may be limited to any
portion thereof which is intended to be developed as a unit. Additional final
plats covering additional units of the property may be submitted later,
provided that the preliminary plat is still valid. Every final plat shall be
substantially in accordance with the tentatively approved preliminary plat,
including any changes or additions required by the Planning Commission as a
condition for its tentative approval, and it shall conform in every respect
with the requirements for the preparation of the plat as set forth in §
148-9 of this chapter.



      (2)   At least two weeks prior to the regularly scheduled
meeting of the Planning Commission at which action on the final plat is
desired, the subdivider shall file the following items with the Secretary of
the Planning Commission:



         (a)   Three copies of the plat on linen or dimensionally
stable plastic film;



         (b)   Six black-line or blue-line prints of the plat;



         (c)   A properly executed statement of dedication of all
streets in the subdivision to the appropriate jurisdiction, constituting an
irrevocable offer to dedicate for a period of not less than five years from
the date of its filing with the Planning Commission; and



         (d)   An application for approval of the plat on a form
to be supplied by the Planning Commission.



   (F)   Final plat approval and recording.



      (1)   Upon receipt by the Planning Commission of evidence of
the satisfactory completion of required improvements or the posting of a cash
deposit or performance bond therefor, the Planning Commission shall consider
approval of the final plat at its next regular meeting. If the final plat is
found to comply with the requirements of this chapter and with the
preliminary plat as approved, the Planning Commission shall approve the plat
and shall endorse the fact of the approval on each of the several copies
submitted by placing the signature of its Chairperson thereon.



      (2)   The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove the
final plat within 30 days after the filing of the plat with the Secretary of
the Planning Commission; otherwise, the plat shall be deemed to have been
approved, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the Planning
Commission on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this
requirement and consent to an extension of the period. The grounds for the
disapproval of any final plat shall be stated upon the record of the Planning
Commission.



      (3)   Upon approval of the final plat by the Planning
Commission, the three signed copies of the plat on linen or plastic film
shall be filed by the subdivider with the Clerk of the Circuit Court. The
signed black-line or blue-line prints shall be forwarded by the Planning
Commission to the Supervisor of Assessments, the state Department of Health,
the Health Officer, and the Engineer, with one print retained by the Planning
Commission and one print returned to the subdivider.



(Prior Code, § 148-5)  (Ord. passed 5-3-1975)



§ 148-6  DESIGN STANDARDS.



   (A)   General requirements.



      (1)   The subdivision layout shall conform in all essential
respects with the official transportation plan and other aspects of the
adopted comprehensive plan for the town.



      (2)   The subdivision layout shall be in full compliance with
the provisions of the zoning districts in which it is located.



      (3)   The subdivision layout shall be designed in accordance
with the principles and standards contained in this section and with the
objective of achieving the most advantageous development of the subdivision
and adjoining areas.



   (B)   Suitability of land.



      (1)   Land subject to periodic flooding shall not be
subdivided for residential occupancy nor for any other use which might
involve danger to health, life, or property or aggravate the flood hazard,
and the land within any proposed subdivision shall be reserved for uses which
will not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation.



      (2)   A plat for the subdivision of land with poor drainage or
other adverse physical conditions will be considered for approval only if the
subdivider shall agree to make whatever improvements are necessary, in the
judgment of the Planning Commission, to render the land safe and otherwise
acceptable for development.



   (C)   Street layout.



      (1)   The street layout shall be designed to create desirable
building sites while respecting existing topography, minimizing street
grades, avoiding excessive cuts and fills, and preserving trees to the
maximum extent possible.



      (2)   Streets shall be spaced to allow for blocks meeting the
dimensional requirements contained herein and to minimize the number of
intersections with existing or proposed major thoroughfares.



      (3)   Where the subdivision adjoins or embraces any part of a
major thoroughfare as designated on the transportation plan, the layout of
the subdivision shall provide for the platting and dedication of the part of
the major thoroughfare in the location and at the width indicated on the
plan, except that the subdivider shall not be required to dedicate that part
of the major thoroughfare which is in excess of 80 feet in width.



      (4)   Wherever deemed desirable to the layout of the
subdivision and adjoining areas, the Planning Commission may require the
planning and dedication of one or more collector streets or parts thereof to
serve the subdivision.



      (5)   Minor residential streets intended primarily for access
to individual properties shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by
through traffic.



      (6)   Streets shall be laid out to intersect one another at as
near to right angles as topography and the limiting factors of good design
will permit, and no street shall intersect another street at an angle of less
than 60 degrees.



      (7)   Proposed streets in the subdivision shall provide for
the continuation of existing, planned or platted streets on adjacent tracts,
unless the continuation shall be prevented by topography or some other
physical condition, or unless the extension is found by the Planning
Commission to be unnecessary for the coordination of development between the
subdivision and the adjacent tract.



      (8)   Where the Planning Commission deems it desirable or
necessary to provide access to adjacent tracts not presently subdivided,
proposed streets in the subdivision shall be extended to the boundary lines
with the adjacent tracts, and temporary turnarounds shall be provided at the
ends of the streets by means of temporary easements or otherwise.



      (9)   Where the subdivision abuts or contains a primary
highway as designated on the transportation plan, the Planning Commission may
require that measures be taken to reduce the impact of heavy traffic on the
residential lots abutting or fronting upon the highway and to afford
separation of through and local traffic through one of the following means.
The choice of the most appropriate method of accomplishing the desired
purpose in a specific instance shall be made by the Planning Commission,
giving consideration to topography and other physical conditions, the
character of existing and contemplated development in the subdivision and its
surroundings and other pertinent factors. Measures to reduce the impact of
heavy traffic on residential lots abutting or fronting upon the primary
highway may be accomplished through one of the following methods:



         (a)   By providing vehicular access to the lots by means
of a service drive separated from the major thoroughfare by a planting strip
and connecting therewith at infrequent intervals; or



         (b)   By designing reverse-frontage lots having access
only from a parallel minor street or from cul-de-sac or loop streets and with
vehicular access to the lots from the major thoroughfare prohibited by deed
restrictions or other means.



      (10)   Cul-de-sac streets, generally not exceeding 600 feet in
length, shall be permitted where they are necessitated by topographic
conditions or where, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, they are
appropriate to the type of development contemplated.



      (11)   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial
areas unless adequate access to parking and loading areas is provided by
other means. Alleys will not be permitted in residential areas, except for
providing rear access to row dwellings or where required by topographic or
other unusual conditions. In the absence of alleys, easements will be
required for utility lines or drainage facilities.



      (12)   Half streets will be prohibited except where they are
essential to the reasonable development of the proposed subdivision in
conformity with the other requirements of these regulations and where the
Planning Commission finds that it will be practicable to require dedication
of the remaining half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a
half street adjoins the proposed subdivision, the remaining half of the
street shall be platted within the subdivision.



      (13)   Private streets shall not be permitted in any proposed
subdivision.



   (D)   Street design standards.



      (1)   Right-of-way widths.  Right-of-way widths for primary
and secondary highways shall be as designated in the transportation plan and,
in any case, not less than 150 feet for primary highways and 80 feet for
secondary highways: provided, however, that widths above these minimums may
be required by state officials to meet particular traffic conditions.
Right-of-way widths for other street types shall be not less than 60 feet for
collector streets and commercial and industrial areas, 50 feet for minor
streets in residential areas, 40 feet for service drives, and 16 feet for
alleys.



      (2)   Roadway widths.



         (a)   Roadway widths for primary and secondary highways
shall be not less than the minimum specified by state officials, but in any
case not less than 24 feet with ten-foot shoulders.



         (b)   Roadway widths for other street types shall be not
less than the following:



            1.   For collector streets and minor streets in
multiple-family residential, commercial, and industrial areas, the roadway
width shall be not less than 40 feet with curbs and gutters, except that
streets serving lots of one acre or more may, with the approval of the
Planning Commission, have a minimum roadway width of 22 feet with eight-foot
shoulders;



            2.   For minor streets in single-family
residential areas and service drives, the roadway width shall be not less
than 30 feet with curbs and gutters, except that streets serving lots of one
acre or more may, with the approval of the Planning Commission, have a
minimum roadway width of 20 feet with six-foot shoulders on each side for
minor streets and on one side for service drives; and



            3.   For alleys, the roadway width shall be not
less than 12 feet.



         (c)   The town Planning Commission may reduce the street
standards of width in division (D)(2)(b)1. and 2. above in accordance with
good planning techniques.



      (3)   Cul-de-sac streets.  Cul-de-sac streets shall have a
circular turnaround of not less than 100 feet in diameter lo the street line
and with a roadway of not less than 80 feet in diameter, unless the Planning
Commission approves a T- or Y-back-around.



      (4)   Street grades.  Street grades shall not exceed 5% for
primary and secondary highways and collector streets and 8% for minor
streets, service drives, and alleys, except that the Planning Commission may
permit a variation of not greater than 2% from these maximums where
topographic conditions warrant. Street grades shall be not less than 0.5% at
the gutter. All changes in street grades of more than 1% shall be connected
by vertical curves with a minimum length of 50 feet or 15 times the algebraic
difference in the change in grade, whichever is greater.



      (5)   Curvature.  The radius of curvature on the center line
shall be not less than 400 feet for primary and secondary highways, 300 feet
for collector streets and 100 feet for minor streets, service drives, and
alleys. Between reversed curves, either of which has a radius of less than
200 feet, there shall be a tangent section at least 100 feet in length.



      (6)   Intersections.  Each property corner at street
intersections shall be rounded off by an arc, the radius of which shall be
not less than 20 feet, except that in a business area, a chord may be
substituted for the arc. Curbs at street intersections shall be rounded off
concentrically with the property lines. The design of the intersection should
provide clear sight distance for oncoming vehicles, and there should be a
suitable leveling of the street grade within and approaching the intersection.



   (E)   Blocks.



      (1)   Residential blocks shall normally not exceed 1,300 feet
in length nor be less than 500 feet in length between street lines. In any
residential block more than 800 feet in length, a crosswalkway of not less
than ten feet in width may be required, where necessary, to provide
convenient access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers and other
community facilities.



      (2)   Residential blocks shall normally be of sufficient width
to provide two tiers of lots of appropriate depth.



      (3)   Blocks for business or industrial use shall be of the
length and width as may be necessary to serve their prospective use,
including making adequate provision for off-street parking and for the
loading and unloading of delivery vehicles.



      (4)   Irregularly shaped blocks indented by cul-de-sac or
looped streets and containing interior parks or playgrounds will be
acceptable when they are properly designed, including making provision for
adequate parking and for the maintenance of the public or joint use
recreation area.



   (F)   Lots.



      (1)   Lot arrangement, design, and orientation shall be such
that all lots will provide satisfactory building sites which are properly
related to topography and the character of surrounding development.



      (2)   The dimensions and areas of all lots shall comply with
the requirements of the zoning district in which they are located, except
that in any case where public water supply and/or public sewerage is not
available or is not to be provided, all residential lots shall comply with
the minimum lot dimensions and areas established by the Health Officer or
state Department of Health, after appropriate water percolation tests, where
these requirements are greater than required under the zoning regulations.



      (3)   Excessive lot depth in relation to lot width shall be
avoided. A ratio of depth to width of two to one (2:1) shall be considered a
desirable maximum.



      (4)   Corner lots shall desirably have extra width to permit
an appropriate building setback from both streets in accordance with the
zoning regulations.



      (5)   Every lot shall abut upon and have access to a public
street.



      (6)   Double-frontage and reverse-frontage lots shall be
avoided, except where their use is essential to overcoming special
topographic problems or to separating residential development from heavy
street traffic.



      (7)   Residential lots fronting or abutting on major
thoroughfares shall desirably have extra lot depths and deeper building
setbacks.



      (8)   Lots adjoining a railroad line shall have extra lot
depth and shall provide for an appropriate means of buffering the lots from
the railroad line.



      (9)   Insofar as possible, side lot lines shall be
substantially at right angles or radial to the street line, except where a
variation to this requirement will provide an improved street and lot layout.



      (10)   The size and shape of lots intended for single-family
residential use shall be sufficient to permit the ultimate provision of a
garage on each lot, except that the Planning Commission may permit the
grouping of garages into a compound serving several lots.



   (G)   Easements.



      (1)   Where alleys are not provided in appropriate locations,
easements of not less than ten feet in width shall be provided, where
necessary, to meet public utility requirements. Easements of greater width
may be required along lot lines or across lots, where necessary, for the
extension of trunk sewers or other primary utility lines.



      (2)   Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by any stream,
watercourse, or drainageway, the subdivider shall make adequate provision for
the proper drainage of surface water, including the provision of easements
along the streams, watercourses, and drainageways.



      (3)   Utility easements in private rights-of-way or in
joint-use recreation areas may be permitted at the discretion of the Planning
Commission if the design considerations of the proposed subdivision warrant
the easements.



      (4)   No building or structure shall be constructed on any
easement without the written authorization of the Mayor and Council.



   (H)   Public sites and open spaces.



      (1)   Where the proposed subdivision includes lands proposed
for use as parks, playgrounds, playfields, public landings, or school sites
under the comprehensive plan, the subdivider shall indicate the location of
the lands on the subdivision plat and shall dedicate the lands to the
appropriate jurisdiction.



      (2)   Where deemed essential by the Planning Commission
considering the type and size of development proposed in the subdivision, the
subdivider may be required to dedicate sites and recreational facilities of a
character, extent, and location suitable to meeting the needs of the
development. In lieu of dedicating the additional areas, they may be reserved
for the common use of all property owners in the proposed subdivision through
deed restrictions.



(Prior Code, § 148-6)  (Ord. passed 5-3-1975)



§ 148-7  PRELIMINARY PLAT.



   (A)   General requirements.  The preliminary plat of the proposed
subdivision shall comply with the following general requirements with regard
to style and content.

subdivision, and the information shall be accurate and reliable.



      (3)   It shall show the general plan for the ultimate
development of the property, including so much of the surrounding area as may
be necessary for an adequate consideration of the land to be subdivided. The
plan shall be accurately drawn to scale, but surveyed dimensions are not
required.



   (B)   Information.  The preliminary plat shall be drawn in a clear
and legible manner and shall show the following information:



      (1)   The proposed subdivision name, which shall not duplicate
nor closely approximate the name of any other subdivision in the county;



      (2)   The names and addresses of the owner of record, the
subdivider, and the surveyor preparing the plat;



      (3)   The scale, date, north point and small-scale key map
showing the location of the proposed subdivision;



      (4)   The boundaries of the land being subdivided in heavy
outline, with the approximate dimensions of the property and the approximate
acreage contained therein;



      (5)   The names and locations of adjacent subdivisions and the
location of adjoining parcels of unplatted land, with the names of the owners
of record;



      (6)   The location of existing property lines, streets and

      (2)   A statement concerning any proposed deed restrictions to
be imposed by the owner.



(Prior Code, § 148-7)  (Ord. passed 5-3-1975)



§ 148-8  IMPROVEMENTS.



   (A)   Required improvements.



      (1)   The subdivider shall be required to provide and install,
or to enter into agreements to provide and install, certain minimum
improvements in the subdivision as a condition for approval of the final plat
by the Planning Commission. All required improvements shall be constructed in
accordance with the minimum requirements of these regulations and the
construction standards and specifications adopted by the Mayor and Council or
other governmental agency as may have jurisdiction over a particular
improvement. Nothing contained herein, however, shall be construed as
prohibiting the subdivider from installing improvements meeting higher
standards than the minimum requirements.



      (2)   Prior to filing the final plat with the Planning
Commission, the required improvements shall be completed, inspected, and
approved by the proper authorities, except that in lieu of completing all
improvements prior to submission of the final plat, the subdivider may
furnish the Mayor and Council with a cash deposit or a secured line of credit
or a performance bond executed by a surety company and running to the town.
The cash deposit or performance bond shall be in an amount sufficient to
cover the cost of the improvements required to be installed by the
subdivider, thereby ensuring the actual construction and installation of the
improvements prior to, and in no case later than, the time that the
improvements are needed to serve buildings placed on abutting lots. The cost
of required improvements shall be estimated by the Engineer or other
authority having jurisdiction. In the event of a dispute concerning the
amount of cash deposit or bond required, the Mayor and Council shall make the
final decision based upon at least two additional cost estimates.



   (B)   Minimum requirements.  The minimum requirements for the
installation of improvements in subdivisions shall be as follows.



      (1)   Roads and streets.



         (a)   All new roads and streets shall be constructed in
accordance with the minimum requirements of these regulations and the minimum
construction standards adopted by the Mayor and Council. Existing roads and
streets which do not meet these specifications with regard to width or type
of construction shall be widened and brought into conformity on that portion
of the road or street within or adjoining the subdivision; and



         (b)   The roadbed and roadway wearing surface shall be
constructed in accordance with applicable town standards. Curbs and gutters
shall be provided in all subdivisions where the average lot area is less than
one acre. Where curbs and gutters are not required, stabilized shoulders and
stabilized drainageways outside the shoulders shall be provided. Street name
signs of an approved design shall be erected at each new street or road
intersection.



      (2)   Surface drainage facilities.  The subdivision shall be
provided with storm drains, culverts, drainageways, or other works as are
necessary to collect and dispose of surface and stormwater originating on or
flowing across the subdivision in order to prevent inundation and damage to
streets, lots, and buildings.



      (3)   Water supply facilities.  Every subdivision shall
require a public water supply under the regulations of the state Department
of Health. Where a public source of water supply will not be available,
private on-site sources of water supply approved by the Health Officer shall
be provided.



      (4)   Sanitary sewerage facilities.  Every subdivision shall
require a public sewer system under the regulations of the state Department
of Health.



      (5)   Plantings.



         (a)   Street trees and other landscaping shall be
required by the Planning Commission on all new streets and parking lots of
over five cars. The proposed location and the species of plant material to be
used shall be subject to approval of the Planning Commission.



         (b)   It will be the responsibility of the developer to
landscape all public rights-of-way which are contained in the proposed
development. A minimum of one tree per each 35 feet of linear roadway will be
required. The preservation of existing trees along the right-of-way will
compensate for the required new plantings.



         (c)   All parking areas shall be landscaped with trees
planted at a rate of not less than one tree per 2,500 square feet of gross
parking area.



      (6)   Sidewalks.



         (a)   The minimum width of sidewalks shall be four feet
along all streets. The prepared subgrade shall consist of a four-inch
insulation course of stone or gravel. This material shall be compacted
thoroughly.



         (b)   The thickness of the concrete placed over the
prepared subgrade shall be at least four inches for standard sidewalks and
eight inches for all sidewalks which cross private driveways.



         (c)   Sidewalks shall be required on all streets, shall
be placed on at least one side of any road and may, at the discretion of the
Planning Commission, be required on both sides of the street.



      (7)   Streetlighting.  The subdivider shall make application
to the Planning Commission and Town Engineer for necessary streetlights.
Purchase and installation of the required lighting shall be the
responsibility of the subdivider.



      (8)   Community facilities.  All residential plans submitted
to the Planning Commission, preliminary or final, will be referred to the
county Department of Education for an advisory report and recommendation. The
Department of Education will determine the projected school population
anticipated from the subject development and compare the future school-age
population to existing and proposed school capacities in determining whether
that agency can endorse the development.



      (9)   Public utilities.  The subdivider shall place or cause
to be placed underground extensions of electric and telephone distribution
lines necessary to furnish permanent residential electric and telephone
service to new detached, semidetached, group, or townhouse single-family
residences within a new residential subdivision, or to new apartment
buildings in accordance with rules and regulations of the Public Service
Commission of the state, effective July 1, 1968, and subject to the further
order of that Commission.



      (10)   Off-street parking.



         (a)   Applicability.  Every subdivision plan which
shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval shall provide
off-street parking space and facilities in accordance with the requirements
of the town zoning ordinance.



         (b)   Design.



            1.   Parking spaces and all access and maneuvering
space for off-street parking shall be surfaced and maintained with a
dustless, all weather material, except for single-family and two-family
dwellings.



            2.   Every parking facility shall have a safe and
efficient means of vehicular access to a recorded street.



            3.   No driveway serving a parking facility shall
be closer than five feet from a side property line.



            4.   No motor vehicle shall be parked in any yard
or court closer than ten feet to any door, window, or other opening of a
dwelling, institution, or other property.



            5.   In the design of off-street facilities for
multiple dwellings, the public right-of-way shall not be obstructed by the
use of the same as aisle space or maneuvering space. Each off-street parking
facility shall provide sufficient maneuvering space within the boundaries of
the lot or lots on which it is located and shall be so designed that no
unreasonable difficulty or inconvenience will be entailed in making necessary
maneuvers for parking and removing a vehicle. Maneuvers shall not entail
driving over any other required parking space. The layout of parking areas
shall conform to the minimum dimensions for spaces and accessways.



            6.   Each parking facility shall be so designed
that ingress or egress to a parking space entails no backing maneuver across
a sidewalk or established footway nor a backing maneuver into or from the
public right-of-way.



            7.   Neither the turnaround diameter of a

§ 148-10  MODIFICATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.



   (A)   Unusual topography or other conditions.  Where, in the case
of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that strict compliance
with the requirements of this chapter would result in extraordinary hardship
to the subdivider because of unusual topography or other conditions which are
not self-inflicted, or that these conditions would result in inhibiting the
achievement of the objectives of these regulations, the Planning Commission
may vary, modify, or waive the requirements so that substantial justice may
be done and the public interest secured; provided, however, that the
variance, modification, or waiver will not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of this chapter or being contrary to the goals and
objectives of the comprehensive plan for the town. In no case shall any
variation, modification, or waiver be more than a minimum easing of the
requirements, and in no instance shall it result in any conflict with the
proposals of the adopted transportation plan for the town or the applicable
zoning regulations.



   (B)   Residential planned community districts.  Where land within
the incorporated territory of the town is proposed for development in
accordance with the provisions of the town zoning ordinance pertaining to the
establishment of a planned unit development, the requirements and conditions
for approval as set forth in that ordinance shall prevail in the case of any
conflict with these regulations; provided, however, that nothing in this
section shall be construed as permitting any exception from the requirements
of these regulations with regard to the design, arrangement, or improvement
of streets and highways within any proposed planned unit development.



   (C)   Approval.  Variances, modifications, and waivers from the
requirements of this chapter shall be granted only by the affirmative vote of
three-fourths of the members of the Planning Commission. In granting
variances, modifications, and waivers, the Planning Commission may require 
conditions as will, in its judgment, substantially secure the objectives of
the requirements so varied, modified, or waived.



(Prior Code, § 148-10)  (Ord. passed 5-3-1975)



§ 148-11  CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.



   (A)   The Mayor and Council may, from time to time, amend,
supplement, or change by ordinance the regulations herein established. Any
amendment or change may be initiated by resolution of the Mayor and Council
or by motion of the Planning Commission. Before taking action on any proposed
amendment or change, the Mayor and Council shall submit the same to the
Planning Commission for its recommendations and report. Failure of the
Planning Commission to report within 60 days after its first meeting
subsequent to the proposal being referred shall be deemed approval by the
Planning Commission.



   (B)   The Planning Commission may hold a public hearing on any
proposed amendment or change before submitting its report to the Mayor and
Council. Notice of the public hearing before the Planning Commission shall be
given at least 15 days prior to the hearing by publishing the time, the
place, and the nature of the hearing in a newspaper having general
circulation in the town. The published notice shall contain reference to the
place or places within the town where the full text of the proposed amendment
or change may be examined.

within the jurisdiction of these regulations, knowingly or with an intent to
defraud transfers or sells or agrees to sell or negotiates to sell any land
by reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of land
subdivision before the plat has been approved by the Planning Commission and
recorded or filed in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court shall
forfeit and pay a penalty of not more than $500 for each lot or parcel so
transferred or sold or agreed or negotiated to be sold, and the description
of the lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or
another document used in the process of selling or transferring shall not
exempt the transaction from the penalties or from the remedies herein
provided. The Mayor and Council may enjoin the transfer or sale or agreement
by action for injunction brought in any court of equity, or may recover the
penalty by civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. Every act or
omission in violation of this chapter shall be punishable as provided herein.
Where an act or omission is of a continuing nature, each and every day during
which the act or omission continues shall be deemed a separate misdemeanor.

   Any person aggrieved or any officer, department, board or bureau of the
town affected by any decision of the Planning Commission may, within 30 days
after the decision appealed from, file a notice of appeal with the Circuit
Court. Upon the hearing of the appeal, the decision of the Planning
Commission shall be presumed by the Court to be proper and to best serve the
public interest. The burden of proof shall be upon the appellant or
appellants to show that the decision appealed from was against the public
interest and that the Planning Commission's discretion in rendering its
decision was not honestly and fairly exercised, or that the decision was
arbitrary or procured by fraud or unsupported by any substantial evidence, or
was unreasonable, or that the decision was beyond the powers of the Planning
Commission and was illegal. The Court shall have the power to affirm, modify,
or reverse, in whole or in part, any decision appealed from, and may remand
any case for the entering of a proper order or for further proceedings as the
Court shall determine.

   It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person, firm, or town
department to top any street tree, park tree, or other tree on public
property. TOPPING is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs
larger than three inches in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree
so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely
damaged by storms or other causes or certain trees under utility wires or
other obstructions for which other pruning practices are impractical may be
exempted from this chapter at the determination of the Town Tree Committee.
Trimming performed by utility companies on any tree must be done in a manner
as to maintain aesthetic qualities of any tree (e.g., "tunnel pruning" is
recommended, "pollarding" or cutting of apical meristems is not permitted).
Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a property owner or his or her agent
from property trimming any tree on his or her own property or from trimming
limbs from neighboring properties that extend over his or her property line.

§ 156-7  TREE MAINTENANCE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.



   (A)   Every owner of any tree overhanging any street or right-of-way
within the town shall prune the branches so that the branches shall not
obstruct the light from any street lamp or obstruct the view of any street
intersection, and so that there shall be a clear space of eight feet above
the surface of the street or sidewalk. The owners shall remove all dead,
diseased or dangerous trees or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a
menace to the safety of the public.



   (B)   The town shall have the right to prune any tree or shrub on
private property, following a notice of intent to the property owner in
writing, when it interferes with the proper spread of light along the street
from a streetlight or interferes with the visibility of any traffic control
device or sign.



   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit an owner or his or her
agent from removing any tree on his or her own property or from trimming
limbs from neighboring properties that extend over his or her property line.



   (D)   Division (C) above shall not apply to the transportation or
maintenance of commercial nursery stock or in any case to trees with a
caliper of two inches or less as measured at four inches above ground level.

§ 156-8  REMOVAL OF DEAD OR DISEASED TREES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.



   The town shall have the right to cause the removal of any dead or
diseased trees on private property within the town when the trees constitute
a hazard to life and property or harbor insects or disease which constitutes
a potential threat to other trees within the town. The Town Tree Committee
will notify in writing the owners of the trees. Removal shall be done by the
owners at their own expense within 60 days after the date of service of
notice. In the event of the failure of owners to comply with the provisions,
the town shall have the authority to remove the trees and charge the cost of
removal on the owners' property tax notice.

   All stumps of street and park trees shall be removed below the surface
of the ground so that the top of the stump shall not project above the
surface of the ground.



(Prior Code, § 156-9)  (Ord. 5-81, passed 12-16-1981)

   It shall be unlawful for any person to prevent, delay, or interfere
with the Town Tree Committee or any of its agents while engaging in and about
the planting, cultivating, mulching, pruning, spraying or removing, as
authorized by this chapter, of any street trees, park trees, or trees on
private grounds.

form bars, buttons, or blocks which may contain perforations, ingredients, or
metallic elements especially designed to give effective traction on snow,

five tire manufacturing companies (Uniroyal, Goodyear, General, Goodrich and
Firestone) and so designated as a snow tire has embossed in the sidewall of
each tire a traction performance certification number. The sidewall of each
tire designated as a snow tire contains the letters "TPC" followed by a
four-digit number.

must be free of cuts, cracks, or other damage that exposes body cords, and
must have at least two thirty-seconds of an inch in depth of tread to be
legal for highway operation.

§ 164-25  DISCHARGE REPORTS.



   The town may require that any person discharging or proposing to
discharge wastewater into a public sewer file a periodic discharge report.
The discharge report may include, but is not limited to, nature of process,
volume, rates of flow, mass emission rate, production quantities, hours of
operation, number and classification of employees, or other information which
relates to the generation of waste, including wastewater constituents and
characteristics in the wastewater discharge. The report also may include the
chemical constituents and quantity of liquid or gaseous materials stored on
site even though normally they may not be discharged. In addition to
discharge reports, the town may require information in the form of wastewater
discharge permit applications and self-monitoring reports.



(Prior Code, § 164-25)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-26  DISCHARGE PERMITS.



   (A)   Optional.  All critical users proposing to connect or to
discharge into a public sewer may be required to obtain a wastewater
discharge permit before connecting to or discharging into a public sewer. For
purposes of this article, CRITICAL USER means any user whose user
classification is identified in the Standard Industrial Classifications (SIC)
Manual in any of Divisions A, B, D, E and I, and who:



      (1)   Has a discharge flow of 50,000 gallons or more per
average workday;



      (2)   Has a flow greater than 5% of the flow in the town's
wastewater treatment system;



      (3)   Has, in the wastes, toxic pollutants in amounts as
defined in standards issued under § 307(a), 33 U.S.C. § 1317(a) of the
Federal Clean Water Act; or



      (4)   Is found by the Manager to have significant impact,
either singly or in combination with other contributing industries, on the
treatment or collection system.



   (B)   Application.  Users seeking a wastewater discharge permit
shall complete and file with the town an application acceptable to and in the
form prescribed by the town and accompanied by the applicable fees.



   (C)   Conditions.  Wastewater discharge permits shall be subject to
all provisions of this article and all other regulations, user charges, and
fees established by the town.



   (D)   Transfer.  Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall
not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different
premises, or a new or changed operation.



   (E)   Revocation.  Any user who violates the following conditions
of the permit or of this article or applicable state and federal regulations
is subject to having the permit revoked:



      (1)   Failure of a user to report factually the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of the discharge;



      (2)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in
operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics;



      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for
the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or



      (4)   Violation of conditions of the permit.



(Prior Code, § 164-26)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-27  MONITORING FACILITIES.



   (A)   The town may require the user to construct, at the user's own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer or internal drainage systems, and also may
require sampling or metering equipment to be provided, installed, and
operated at the user's expense. The monitoring facility normally should be
situated on the user's premises, but the town, when a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, may allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will
not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.



   (B)   If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there
shall be accommodations to allow access for town personnel, such as a gate
secured with a town lock. There shall be ample room in or near the sampling
manhole to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis.
The manhole, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.



   (C)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the
sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the
town's requirements and all applicable town construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the town, unless a time extension is otherwise
granted by the town.



(Prior Code, § 164-27)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-28  INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.



   The town may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether or
not the purpose and all requirements of this article are being met. Persons
or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall
allow the town or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection or sampling or in
the performance of any of his or her duties. The town may set up on the
user's property those devices necessary to conduct sampling or metering
operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the
user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the town will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.



(Prior Code, § 164-28)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-29  PRETREATMENT.



   Users shall make wastewater acceptable under the limitations
established in this article before discharging to any public sewer. Any
facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the town
shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the town for review and shall be acceptable to the town before
construction of the facility. The review of the plans and operating
procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
town under this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to
the town.



(Prior Code, § 164-29)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-30  PROTECTION FROM ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.



   (A)   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this article. Protective
facilities shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection
shall be submitted to the town for review and shall be acceptable to the town
before construction of the facility.



   (B)   The review of plans and operating procedures shall not relieve
the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
provide the protection necessary to meet the requirements of this article.



(Prior Code, § 164-30)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-31  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.



   (A)   Notice to town.  Users shall notify the town immediately upon
accidentally discharging wastes in violation of this section to enable
countermeasures to be taken by the town to minimize damage to the public
sewer, treatment facility, treatment processes, and the receiving waters.
This notification shall be followed, within five days of the date of
occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the causes of the
accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future
occurrence. The notification will not relieve users of liability for any
expense, loss, or damage to the sewer system, treatment plant, or treatment
process, or for any fines imposed on the town on account of damage to the
sewer system, treatment plant, or treatment process.



   (B)   Notice to employees.  In order that employees of users be
informed of town requirements, users shall make available to their employees
copies of this article, together with other wastewater information and
notices which may be furnished by the town from time to time directed toward
more effective water pollution control. A notice shall be furnished and
permanently posted on the user's bulletin board advising employees whom to
call in case of an accidental discharge in violation of this article.



   (C)   Preventive measures.  Any direct or indirect connection or
entry point for persistent or deleterious wastes to the user's plumbing or
drainage system should be eliminated. Where that action is impractical or
unreasonable, the user shall label appropriately entry points to warn against
discharge of wastes in violation of this article.



(Prior Code, § 164-31)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-32  CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER.



   When the town finds that a discharge of wastewater has taken place, in
violation of prohibitions or limitations of this article or the provisions of
a wastewater discharge permit, the Director of Public Works may issue an
order to cease and desist and direct that those persons not complying with
the prohibitions, limits, requirements, or provisions:



   (A)   Comply immediately;



   (B)   Comply in accordance with a time schedule set forth by the
town; or



   (C)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of
a threatened violation.



(Prior Code, § 164-32)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-33  CORRECTION TIME SCHEDULE.



   When the town finds that a discharge of wastewater has been taking
place in violation of prohibitions or limitations prescribed in this article
or wastewater source control requirements, effluent limitations or
pretreatment standards, or the provisions of a wastewater discharge permit,
the town may require the user to submit for approval, with modifications as
it deems necessary, a detailed time schedule of specific actions which the
user shall take in order to prevent or correct a violation of requirements.



(Prior Code, § 164-33)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-34  APPEAL.



   (A)   Any user, permit applicant, or permit holder affected by any
decision, action, or determination, including cease-and-desist orders, made
by the Director of Public Works interpreting or implementing the provisions
of this article or in any permit issued under this article, may file with the
Director a written request for reconsideration within ten days of the
decision, action, or determination, setting forth in detail the facts
supporting the user's request for reconsideration.



   (B)   (1)   If the ruling made by the Director is unsatisfactory
to the person requesting reconsideration, the person, within ten days after
notification of the Director's action, may file a written appeal to the Town
Council. The written appeal shall be heard by the Council within 30 days from
the date of filing. The Council shall make a final ruling on the appeal
within 30 days of the close of the meeting.



      (2)   The Director's decision, action, or determination shall
remain in effect during the period of reconsideration.



(Prior Code, § 164-34)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-35  NUISANCE ABATEMENT.



   (A)   Discharges of wastewater in any manner in violation of this
article or of any order issued by the Director of Public Works as authorized

   (B)   A person creating a public nuisance is guilty of a misdemeanor.



(Prior Code, § 164-35)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-36  INJUNCTION.



   Whenever a discharge of wastewater is in violation of the provisions of
this article or otherwise causes or threatens to cause a condition of
contamination, pollution, or nuisance, the town may petition the Circuit
Court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both, as
may be appropriate in restraining the continuance of the discharge.



(Prior Code, § 164-36)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-37  HARMFUL OR DAMAGING DISCHARGES.



   When a discharge of wastes causes an obstruction, damage, or impairment
to town facilities, or increased costs of treating or management of effluent
or sludge, the town will add the total cost of corrective action to the user
charge or fee of the responsible user.



(Prior Code, § 164-37)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-38  VIOLATIONS; TERMINATION OF SERVICE.



   The town may revoke any wastewater discharge permit or terminate or
cause to be terminated wastewater service to any premises, if a violation of
this article is found to exist or if a discharge of wastewater causes or
threatens to cause a condition of contamination, pollution, or nuisance as
defined in this article. This provision is in addition to other statutes,
rules, or regulations authorizing termination of service for delinquency in
payment.



(Prior Code, § 164-38)  (Ord. 4-91, passed 8-5-1991)



§ 164-39  VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.

condition, or who discharges wastewater which causes pollution, or who
violates any cease-and-desist order, prohibition, effluent limitation,
national standard of performance, pretreatment, or toxicity standard is
liable for a sum not to exceed $500 for each day in which the violation
occurs, or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both.

CHAPTER 166:  TOWN-OWNED WATERFRONT PROPERTIES



Section



   166-1   Purpose



   166-2   Rules and regulations for the use of town-owned waterfront
properties



§ 166-1  PURPOSE.



   This chapter shall provide rules and regulations for vehicle parking,
dockage, removal of abandoned or unauthorized vehicles or vessels from
town-owned piers, bulkheads, parks, streets or other waterfront areas as
stated herein.



(Ord. 06-2010, passed 8-2-2010)



§ 166-2  RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE USE OF TOWN-OWNED WATERFRONT
PROPERTIES.



   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to tie any form of marine
vessel to a town-owned property that is marked or designated as for “no
dockage.”



   (B)   The town may designate, at its discretion, any area for “no
dockage” or “transient only” tie-ups.



   (C)   The town may remove or impound any unclaimed vessels from
“no dockage” areas 24 hours after notifying the owners of their
violation, and may fine the owners as prescribed in this chapter.
Notification of such boats may be accomplished by the posting of the vessel
if the owner cannot be reached. The owners will be liable for all costs of
removal of such vessels, including storage by the firm removing the vessel.
Removal and impoundment of abandoned or unclaimed vessels will be handled by
the Police Department, using the procedures outlined in Chapter 159,
Vehicles, Abandoned.



   (D)   The town will mark areas that it deems fit for automobile or
marine vessel parking, transient tie-up, or loading and unloading zones. The
town will also mark any waterside parking lots for no parking, limited
parking, or loading and unloading as it deems fit.



   (E)   Any vessel violating state or federal environmental laws will
be reported and removed immediately by the appropriate authorities. Sunken
vessels or unlicensed vessels will also be removed immediately at the owner's
expense.



   (F)   Violations of this chapter will be treated as municipal
infractions with fines as prescribed in the Charter. Notification of an
infraction may be accomplished by the posting of the vessel or vehicle. Each
day will represent a separate offense, with fines doubling after the first
day.

Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 9
§ 170-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the “Zoning Ordinance for Chestertown, Maryland.”
§ 170-2. Applicability.
This chapter shall apply to the incorporated territory of Chestertown, Maryland. It is the intent of this chapter that the extent of its applicability be automatically changed in accordance with the provisions hereof or provisions of state law which may affect the applicability of this chapter.
§ 170-3. Purpose and Authority.
The zoning regulations and districts as herein established have been made in accordance with the Chestertown Comprehensive Plan, as amended from time to time, to promote, in accordance with present and future needs, the health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity and general welfare of the citizens of Chestertown, Maryland, and to provide for efficiency and economy in the process of development, for the appropriate and best use of land, for convenience of traffic, walking, biking and circulation of people and goods, for the appropriate use and occupancy of buildings, for healthful and convenient distribution of the population, for protection against destruction of or encroachment upon historic areas, to promote sustainability principles, and to promote good civic design and arrangement, including the preservation and enhancement of the attractiveness and character of the Town. These regulations are also intended to provide for adequate public utilities and public services and facilities by regulating and limiting or determining the height and bulk of buildings and structures, the area of yards and other open spaces and the density of use. These provisions have been made with a reasonable consideration of, among other things, the existing use of property, the character of the Town and districts established herein and their peculiar suitability for particular uses and trends of growth or change and with a view toward conserving the value of land and buildings and encouraging sustainable and the most appropriate use of land throughout the incorporated territory of Chestertown, Maryland. This Ordinance is enacted under the authority granted by the General Assembly of Maryland, as provided in Article 66B, Annotated Code of Maryland, as amended.
§ 170-4. Compliance required.

§ 170-5. Location of buildings on lots of record required; number of buildings per lot.
Every building hereafter erected, reconstructed, converted, moved or structurally altered shall be located on a lot of record, and in no case shall there be more than one (1) primary structure on one (1) lot, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter.
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 10
§ 170-6. Encroachment of required yards or open space; reduction of lot area.
The minimum yards, height limits, parking spaces and open spaces, including lot area per family, required by this chapter for each and every building existing at the time of the passage of these regulations or for any building hereafter erected shall not be encroached upon or considered as required yard or open space for any other building, except as hereinafter provided, nor shall any lot area or lot dimension be reduced below the requirements of these regulations.
§ 170-7. Time limits established for construction and usage of accessory buildings.
No accessory building shall be constructed upon a lot more than six (6) months prior to the beginning of construction of the primary structure. No accessory building shall be used for more than six (6) months unless the primary structure on the lot is also being used or unless the primary structure is under construction.
§ 170-8. Uses not permitted prohibited.
For the purpose of this chapter, permitted uses are listed within the appropriate sections for each zoning district. Uses not listed under this ordinance are prohibited.
§ 170-9. District regulation tables considered part of regulations.
Height, area and bulk regulations applicable to each district are contained in a chart or table at the end of the chapter. The table and all of the notations and requirements which are shown in it or which accompany it shall be a part of these regulations and have the same force and effect as if all of the notions and requirements were fully set forth or described herein. In general, the regulations applicable to a particular district are contained in the table to the right of the district name and between the same sets of horizontal lines which include the district name. Regulations which apply to more than one (1) district are indicated by an extension across horizontal lines. The regulations contained in the table are supplemented or modified by regulations contained in other Articles of these regulations.
§ 170-10. Copies of pertinent supplementary tables, charts or schedules to be kept on file.
Whenever reference is made in this chapter to any other ordinance, chart, table, schedule or regulation which itself is not copied herein, a copy of such ordinance, chart, table, schedule or regulation shall be kept on file in the office of the Administrator and available for inspection and reference.

§ 170-11. Compliance with grading and sediment control provisions required.
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as relieving any person, firm or corporation from compliance with the provisions of Chapter 88, Grading and Sediment Control, of the Town of Chestertown.
§ 170-12. Severability
It is hereby declared to be the intention of the Town that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, and phrases of this Ordinance are severable, and if any such section, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase is declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction in a valid judgment or decree, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this ordinance since the same would have been enacted without the incorporation into this ordinance of such unconstitutional or invalid section, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase.
§ 170-13. Compliance with historic area zoning regulations required.2

§ 170-43. C-3 Neighborhood Commercial District.
A. Purpose. The primary purpose of this district is to accommodate commercial uses and services that provide shopping convenience to persons residing in adjacent residential neighborhoods while also providing for a mix of higher density residential uses. The district encourages forms of development that provide commercial services defining the streetscape, intermixed with various residential uses, incorporating mixed-use buildings with neighborhood-serving retail, personal service, office, and other non-residential uses on the ground floor along the street front and office and residential units above or behind commercial or service uses.
The Neighborhood Commercial District should be integrated physically with adjacent sites and be easily accessible by pedestrians, removing the appearance of an automobile dominated environment. In redevelopment or new construction, parking should be located behind or alongside storefronts with all commercial uses brought close to the street. Existing commercial uses, including parking lots, are under no constraints or obligations to change under this section.
Project and site plan review will require development that exhibits the physical design characteristics of pedestrian-oriented, storefront-style shopping streets, and promotes the health and well-being of residents by encouraging physical activity and greater social interaction.
B. Permitted uses. Certain enumerated uses in the C-1 General Commercial District and C-2 Downtown Commercial District, as well as residential uses described in R-5 Downtown Residential District. The sizes of retail stores are commensurate with smaller lot sizes. Retail buildings cannot exceed an aggregate size of twelve thousand (12,000) square feet on a single lot - see (10) Retail shops. No future outside, unenclosed storage will be considered in the district but existing legal outside storage will be allowed to continue. Residential uses as described in R-5 zoning are also allowed, subject to the conditions listed for their placement above and behind the primary commercial use.

§ 170-46B. IN Institutional District
A. Statement of Purpose and Intent. The Institutional (IN) District is established to recognize the Town’s major educational, medical and government facilities and institutions as important activity centers and traffic generators, accommodate the growth and development needs of these institutions, and coordinate the master plans of these institutions with the Town’s plans, policies and zoning standards.
The IN District is designed to facilitate development that may involve multiple buildings in multiple locations on a single campus setting over an extended period of time. The unique feature of the IN District is that, for major institutions with a campus of five (5) acres or more, it requires the creation of a detailed planning document, a Master Development Plan (MDP). For guidance on creating a MDP for the Institutional District,
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 65
see Appendix I.
The MDP provides comprehensive guidance to the institution, Town and Planning Commission as to the long term intentions of the institution, and the development being proposed. The MDP provides the highest quality internal planning and design while addressing and minimizing negative impacts on the neighborhood and community at large.
If no MDP exists for the planned development, all proposed uses shall be considered Conditional as defined earlier in the ordinance, and approval process shall be the same as the process for other conditional uses explained elsewhere in this ordinance. The approval process for the MDP shall be by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall provide a thirty (30) day public comment period prior to approving a MDP.
At the end of the thirty (30) day public comment period, the Planning Commission shall take an official vote accepting or rejecting the MDP. The Zoning Administrator, acting on behalf of the Planning Commission, may then begin accepting development proposals for individual structures and projects within the area of the MDP for review by the Planning Commission.
B. Permitted Uses. Specific types of permitted uses are those which provide a public service or fill a public need as described in the statement of intent, and consistent with the Master Development Plan if applicable. Permitted uses include but are not limited to the following:
(1) Government buildings or offices such as fire stations, court facilities, schools and community meeting or recreation halls.
(2) Colleges and Universities including dormitories.
(3) Research and development centers affiliated with an educational or other institution, including environmental, conservation, technology, and related office buildings, not including manufacturing.

§ 170-48. Planned unit development.
A. General regulations. It is the intent of these regulations to control the placement, design, use and density of well planned residential developments, which developments will offer a variety of building types and a more efficient overall use of land and, within these limits, permit the optimum amount of freedom and variety in the design and management of such varying types of residential structures, including one- and two-family units, townhouses and garden apartments within the areas designated. In connection with the intention of these regulations, the following objectives are sought to provide for the planned unit development:
(1) To provide a more attractive and varied living environment than would be possible through the strict application of the, R-2, R-3 and R-4, R-5 and R-6 District requirements.
(2) To encourage a more intimate, efficient and aesthetic use of open space.
(3) To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the development of land.
(4) To encourage variety in the physical development pattern of residential areas.
B. Planned unit development requirements.
(1) Permitted uses. Planned unit developments are contemplated to be primarily residential in nature; however, planned unit developments of sufficient size and appropriate character may have certain limited commercial development which is incidental to the planned unit development and is intended primarily for the use of the residents of the planned unit development. Specifically permitted uses are as follows:
(a) Single-family detached dwellings.
(b) Multifamily dwellings, attached or detached, including, but not limited to, one- and two-family units, townhouses and garden type apartments.

Such commercial establishments shall be an integral part of the plan for the planned unit development. The total aggregate area of all the commercial establishments and their parking areas shall not occupy more than five percent (5%) of the gross area of the planned unit development. Commercial areas shall be of the small neighborhood convenience type and may include laundry and dry-cleaning establishments, beauty parlors and barbershops and retail food establishments of less than three thousand five hundred (3,500) square feet. No commercial establishments shall be constructed until fifty percent (50%) of the total planned residential units are completed. Centers may include one (1) or more stores.
(g) Land and places for public assembly, recreation buildings, public buildings and accessory buildings or the reservation of lands for such uses as the Planning Commission may approve and/or require, if it is deemed that they are advantageous or necessary for the purpose of serving the planned unit development and local community.
(2) Location. Planned unit developments are conditional uses in the R-2, R-3 and R-4, R-5 and R-6 Residential Districts. In general, a planned unit development is contemplated in residential zones where tracts of suitable location, size and character exist. The uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed according to the requirements and procedures of this chapter. Planned unit developments shall be approximately located with respect to the general pattern of urban development, existing or proposed, and to existing public and private facilities and services.
(3) Computation of residential density.
(a) The total density in the planned unit development will not be greater than if conventionally developed. The total permitted dwelling units may be averaged over the entire planned unit development or clustered in various groupings. In an effort to provide a variety of housing types, sizes and costs, the formula for computing the residential density of a planned unit
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 70
development shall be based on the number of bedrooms permitted per gross acre of development. The multiplier factor shall be three (3) (the average number of bedrooms per home built in a conventional development).

§ 170-49. Planned redevelopment districts.
A. General regulations. Planned redevelopment districts are intended to encourage sound and comprehensive planning in previously developed areas of Chestertown. They shall allow a minor degree of deviation from the town's subdivision requirements and zoning regulations so that maximum flexibility in these areas may be reached. A planned redevelopment district shall be a special exception or variance in any zone. Uses shall continue to be restricted to those of the zone(s) falling within the district and zoning densities are never increased by the special exception process.
B. Administrative procedures.
(1) Planned redevelopment district initiation. Initiation of a planned redevelopment district shall be by application of a property owner or property owners with practical difficulties in adhering strictly to the zoning and subdivision ordinance in redeveloping their property.
(a) A statement of need for a planned redevelopment district and the practical difficulties in achieving it under the existing regulations.
(b) A statement of all the objectives to be achieved by a planned redevelopment district. This statement will list each variance of the existing regulations needed to achieve the redevelopment. These variances will be minor and to relieve multiple practical difficulties for problems with setbacks, heights, lot coverage, road dimensions, parking requirements to name a few.
(c) A plat, prepared by a licensed engineer or surveyor showing the location of the planned redevelopment district relative to surrounding areas of the town, showing property lines of the properties, existing zoning categories, location of all structures on the lots with existing setbacks, and showing existing uses within the planned redevelopment district and on all land adjoining the district, including all public lands and right-of-ways, the proposed use of each parcel of land in the planned redevelopment district, neighboring properties with current zoning, existing and proposed utilities, and all planned expansions or changes.
The Planning Commission will review the submittal and require all site plans, elevations information that would be submitted under preliminary site plan or preliminary subdivision review. No recommendation for approval will convey a
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 77
zoning density higher than the underlying zoning.
Upon approval of the planned redevelopment district project preliminary plan, the Planning Commission will forward the plan to the Board of Appeals with a complete list of variances recommended for approval under the plan.
(3) Approval of planned redevelopment district plan. The Board of Appeals shall review the planned redevelopment district project plan and other documents as finally approved and submitted by the Chestertown Planning and Zoning Commission. The Board of Appeals shall rule only on those areas within the statutory scope of its authority.
The Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on the proposed planned redevelopment district plan. Notice of the public hearing before the Board of Appeals shall be published once at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing by publishing the time, place and nature of the hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in the town. The published notices shall contain reference to the place or places within the town where the application may be examined. The Board of Zoning Appeals, in making its decision, shall be guided by the standards set forth in this chapter and also give consideration as to whether:
(a) The plans for the development are in general conformance with all elements of the Comprehensive Plan for the town and the character and nature of existing and contemplated development in the vicinity of the proposed development.
(b) The physical characteristics of the development will not adversely affect future development or the value of undeveloped neighboring areas or the use, maintenance and value of neighboring areas already developed.
(c) The development will secure for its residents and neighboring residents substantially the same benefits with respect to availability of light, air, open space and street access as would be provided by the application of the appropriate district regulations.
(d) The development will secure for its residents and neighboring residents substantially the same protection from fire, health hazards and other dangers as would be provided by application of the appropriate district regulations.
(e) The development will permit design features that would not be possible by the strict application of the appropriate district regulations.
(5) Community redevelopment projects. A community redevelopment project shall comply with all additional regulations as may be applicable under Town, County
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 78
State or Federal law.
C. Implementation. The approval of the Board of Appeals of the planned redevelopment district will enable the Planning and Zoning Commission to proceed to final approval of the proposed plan in accordance with their established process for final site plan and subdivision approval.
D. Deviation from compliance with subdivision regulations. In cases where subdivision or re-subdivision of lands is necessary to accomplish the purposes of the planned redevelopment district, the subdivision regulations of the town apply unless the application of the regulations is impractical arising from the character and nature of the planned redevelopment district. A deviation from the subdivision regulations may be made upon a finding that the subdivision regulations would not be practical, stating specifically the factual basis for such deviation. The standards set forth in Subsection B(3)(b) of this section shall also be used as considerations in determining whether subdivision deviations may be made.

prior to the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the town, which specifies the time, place and nature of the hearing. In addition, the Board shall cause the date, time, place and nature of the hearing to be posted conspicuously on the property in accordance with the rules of the Board. In exercising its powers, the Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and to that end shall have all the powers of the Administrator.
ARTICLE VIII
Variances and Conditional Uses
§ 170-64. Purpose.
The purpose of this Article is to provide for certain uses which cannot be well adjusted to their environment in particular locations, while offering full protection to surrounding properties by rigid application of the district regulations. These uses are generally of a public or semipublic character and are essential and desirable for the general convenience and welfare, but because of the nature of the use, the importance of its relationship to the Comprehensive Plan and possible impact not only on neighboring properties but on a large section of the town, these uses require the exercise of planning judgment on location and site plan.
§ 170-65. Application requirements; approval procedures.
A preliminary site plan complying with the requirements of Article II of this chapter shall accompany an application for approval of a variance or conditional use under this Article, together with such information as may be required for a determination of the nature of the proposed use and its effect on the Comprehensive Plan, the neighborhood and surrounding properties. Procedures for approval of a conditional use and approval and amendment of site plans are contained in this Article of this chapter. (See § 170-73.)
§ 170-66. Revocation of permits.
Permits issued under a variance or conditional use approval may be revoked by the Administrator for failure to comply with the conditions of approval or applicable regulations.
§ 170-67. Variances.
A. The Board shall have the power to grant variances from the yard, height, parking and area requirements of this chapter, so as to relieve practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships arising out of the strict application of the provisions of the chapter. The Board
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 88
shall grant the variance based on the criteria listed in Subsection B. In granting such variances, the Board may consider unusual characteristics of size, shape or topography of a property as well as any similar or shared conditions, setbacks or characteristics on adjacent or neighboring properties.
B. In order to grant a variance, the Board must find all of the following:
(1) That the variance will not cause a substantial detriment to adjacent or neighboring property.
(2) That the variance will not change the character of the neighborhood or district.
(3) That the variance is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the general intent of this chapter.
§ 170-68. Approvals limited by conditions.
Where conditional uses or variances are approved, the Board may impose conditions it deems necessary.
§ 170-69. Lapse of approvals.
After the Board of Appeals has approved a conditional use or granted a variance, the conditional use or variance so approved or granted shall lapse after the expiration of one (1) year, if no substantial construction or change of use has taken place in accordance with the plans for which a conditional use or variance was granted or if the Board does not specify some longer period than one (1) year for good cause shown, and the provisions of these regulations shall thereafter govern.
§ 170-70. Amendment procedures.
The procedure for amendment of a conditional use or variance already approved or a request for a change of conditions attached to an approval shall be the same as for a new application, except that where the Administrator determines the change to be minor relative to the original approval, he may transmit the same to the Board with the original record without requiring that a new application be filed.
§ 170-71. Preexisting conditional uses.
Any conditional use listed in § 170-74 of this chapter which is legally existing at the effective date of the regulations of this Article shall be considered a nonconforming use. Owners of
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 89
property with conditional uses which existed prior to the effective date of this regulation may apply to the Board of Appeals for conditional use status.
§ 170-72. Appeals.
Appeals to courts from a decision of the Board may be filed in the manner prescribed by law.
§ 170-73. Procedures for conditional use approvals.
A. The procedures for approval of a conditional use are the same as those prescribed for changes and amendments as set forth in § 170-65 of this chapter and, in addition, the procedures and requirements for approval of site plans as set forth below, together with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances governing the subdivision of land.
B. Where the provisions of this chapter require the submittal of site plans for a conditional use, the following regulations shall apply:
(1) Five (5) copies of a preliminary site plan shall be filed with the Board of Appeals. The preliminary site plan shall comply with the requirements of this Article and shall be accompanied by such other written or graphic material as may be necessary or desirable in aiding the decisions of the Board of Appeals.
(2) The Planning Commission shall review the site plan for compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The Planning Commission may make reasonable additional requirements, including, but not limited to, those which may be imposed by the Board of Appeals under this Article of this chapter, especially requirements as to utilities, drainage and the landscaping and maintenance thereof, lighting, signs and advertising devices, screening, access ways, curb cuts, traffic control, heights of buildings and setbacks of buildings necessary to protect adjoining uses. The site plan shall be amended in accordance with the requirements of the Planning Commission before being submitted to the Board of Appeals for its consideration. The Planning Commission shall forward to the Board of Appeals the application for approval of the site plan, supporting documents and the site plan along with the Planning Commission's recommendation.
(3) Following approval by the Board of Appeals, a final site plan in the form of a final plat shall be prepared, filed and recorded. This final plat shall comply with the specifications of the Board of Appeals, the requirements of this Article and applicable laws, regulations and ordinances governing the subdivision of land.
11Editor's Note: See Ch. 148, Subdivision of Land.
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 90
Permits shall be issued in accordance with the approved, filed and recorded plat.
(4) If required by the Board of Appeals, a surety bond shall be filed for or deposited in escrow with the town in an amount sufficient to insure the completion of such requirements as may be imposed by the Board of Appeals.

A. The following buildings, structures and uses shall be approved by the Board of Appeals, pursuant to this Article of this chapter, as conditional uses in all districts, except as otherwise provided in accordance with the procedures and standards of this Article, provided that the location is appropriate and not in conflict with the Comprehensive Plan; that the public health, safety, morals and general welfare will not be adversely affected; that adequate off-street parking facilities will be provided for the protection of surrounding property, persons and neighborhood values; and further provided that the additional standards of this Article are complied with. Unless otherwise specified in this Article or specified as a condition of approval, the height limits, yard spaces, lot area and sign requirements shall be the same as for other uses in the district in which the conditional use is located. Any variances that are part of a Conditional Use hearing must first be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission.

Nonconforming Uses
§ 170-75. Nonconforming use of land or buildings.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the use of land or buildings existing on January 1, 1974, may be continued although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof, subject to the provisions of § 170-84 of this chapter. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming use of land or a building has been changed to a more restricted nonconforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use. The nonconforming use of a building may be hereafter extended throughout those parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of the enactment of this chapter.
§ 170-76. Nonconforming signs.
Where any sign does not comply with the provisions of this chapter, such sign and any supporting structures may be maintained but shall not be replaced, reconstructed, moved, structurally altered, repainted or re-lighted except in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and may continue in use until December 31, 1976, subject to earlier removal under other provisions of this chapter. Removal, replacement, reconstruction, moving or structural alteration for any cause whatsoever shall be considered as a loss of nonconforming status. Supporting structures for nonconforming signs may continue in use for a conforming sign if said supporting structures comply in all respects to the applicable requirements of these regulations and other codes and ordinances. No permits for additional signs shall be issued for any premises on which there are any nonconforming signs.
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 96
§ 170-77. Discontinuance of nonconforming uses.
No building or portion thereof used, in whole or in part, for a nonconforming use in a residential district which remains idle or unused for a continuous period of two (2) years, whether or not the equipment or fixtures are removed, shall again be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which such building or land is located.
§ 170-78. Restoration and continuance of damaged nonconforming uses.
No building which has been damaged by any cause whatsoever to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the building immediately prior to damage shall be restored except in conformity with the regulations of this chapter, and all rights as a nonconforming use shall be terminated. If a building is damaged by less than fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value, it may be repaired or reconstructed and used as before the time of damage, provided that such repairs or reconstruction is substantially completed within twelve (12) months of the date of such damage.
§ 170-79. Intermittent or temporary use of nonconforming uses; partial use of lots or tracts.
The casual, intermittent, temporary or illegal use of land or buildings shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use, and the existence of a nonconforming use on a part of a lot or tract shall not be construed to establish a nonconforming use on the entire lot or tract.
§ 170-80. Existence of nonconforming uses; determination of classification in disputes.
Whether a nonconforming use exists shall be a question of fact; and in case of a dispute between the property owner and the Planning Commission, the question of the classification of use shall be decided by the Board of Appeals after public notice and hearing and in accordance with the rules of the Board.
§ 170-81. Alteration or extension of buildings nonconforming in height, area or bulk only.
A building nonconforming only as to height, area or bulk requirements may be altered or extended, provided that such alteration or extension does not increase the degree of nonconformity in any respect.
§ 170-82. Application of height, area or bulk regulations to nonconforming dwelling uses in industrial districts.
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 97
A dwelling nonconforming as to use in an industrial district shall be considered as a conforming use in application of the height, area and bulk requirements of this chapter.
§ 170-83. Certificate of nonconforming status required.
A certificate of nonconforming status shall be required for all nonconforming uses and signs. An application for a certificate of any nonconforming use shall be filed with the Administrator by the owner or his agent within twelve (12) months from the effective date of adoption of this chapter.
§ 170-84. Termination of certain nonconforming uses.
Certain nonconformities shall be terminated in accordance with the following provisions:
A. Within not more than two (2) years from the effective date of this chapter or an amendment of this chapter by which a use becomes nonconforming, the right to maintain any nonconforming junkyard shall terminate, and such nonconformity shall no longer be operated or maintained and must be removed.
ARTICLE X
Sign Regulations
§ 170-85. General requirements.
A. Permit requirements; inspection; fees. No sign, unless herein excepted, shall be erected, constructed, posted, altered or relocated except as provided in this Article and these regulations and until a permit has been issued by the Administrator. Before any permit is issued, an application especially provided by the Administrator shall be filed, together with three (3) sets of drawings and/or specifications, one (1) set to be returned to the applicant, as may be necessary to fully advise and acquaint the Administrator with the location, construction, materials, manner of illumination and/or securing or fastening, number of signs applied for and the wording of the sign or advertisement to be carried on the sign. All signs which are electrically illuminated shall require a separate electrical permit and inspection. All signs shall be erected on or before the expiration of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance of the permit; otherwise, the permit shall become null and void and a new permit shall be required. No sign shall be approved for use unless it has been inspected by the department issuing the permit and it is found to be in compliance with all requirements of this chapter and applicable technical codes. Fees for sign permits shall be in accordance with the schedule adopted by ordinance, a copy of which is maintained in the office of the Administrator.
B. Location. No sign, portable or otherwise, is to be placed or located to conflict with vision, clearance or other requirements of applicable traffic ordinances.
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 98
C. Number of permanent signs limited. Except as otherwise provided, these regulations shall be interpreted to allow one (1) permanent sign per occupancy. The combined sign area per store frontage may not exceed the smaller of the area permitted by the building's frontage length or the maximum sign area permitted by the zoning district.
D. Permitted signs for nonconforming business, commercial or industrial uses in residential districts. Permitted signs for a nonconforming business, commercial or industrial use in a residential district shall consist of those signs permitted in the B-1 Neighborhood Business District.
E. All signs subject to nonconforming use regulations. Except as otherwise specifically provided in these regulations, all signs shall be subject to the provisions of Article IX, which governs nonconforming uses.
F. Additional freestanding type signs permitted under certain conditions. In cases where a single property extends from parallel street to parallel street and the sign on the front cannot be seen from the rear, an additional sign of the freestanding type is allowed, the height of which cannot exceed seven (7) feet and the square footage of which cannot exceed ten (10) square feet.
G. Historic District signs. Prior to the issuance of a permit for the erection of a sign in the Historic District, a historic review certificate must be obtained. The salient factor to be considered in granting a historic review certificate for a sign in the Historic District is that the sign shall be compatible with the character of the building and its surroundings.
§ 170-86. Definitions.
For the purpose of this Article, certain terms and words pertaining to signs are hereby defined. The general rules of construction contained in Article III of this chapter are applicable to these definitions. The following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ACCESSORY SIGN – A sign relating only to uses of the premises on which the sign is located or products sold on the premises on which the sign is located or indicating the name or address of a building or the occupants or management of a building on the premises where the sign is located. The size of the sign shall not exceed one (1) square foot and must be mounted flat against the building.
DETACHED SIGN – A sign not attached to or painted on a building but which is affixed to the ground. A sign attached to a flat surface, such as a fence or wall, not a part of a building shall be considered a “detached sign.”
DOUBLE-FACED SIGN – A sign with two (2) parallel or nearly parallel faces, back to back, and located not more than twenty-four (24) inches from each other.
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 99
ENTRY-SERVED STOREFRONT – It shall be recognized when a business occupies a ground floor space and has an entrance leading directly into the place of business from the front of a building.
FLASHING SIGN – An illuminated sign on which the artificial or reflected light is not maintained stationary and constant in intensity and color at all times when in use. Any sign which revolves or moves, whether illuminated or not, shall be considered a “flashing sign.”
FLAT SIGN – Any sign attached to and erected parallel to the face of or erected or painted on the outside wall of a building and supported throughout its length by such wall or building and not extending more than nine (9) inches from the building wall. Such sign shall not exceed the square foot limit applicable in the particular district involved. The sign must be oriented so as to be read from a point perpendicular to the building.
ILLUMINATED SIGN – Any sign designed to give forth artificial light or designed to reflect light from one (1) or more sources of artificial light erected for the purpose of providing light for the sign.
INDIRECTLY ILLUMINATED SIGN – A sign which does not produce artificial light from within but which is back-lighted or illuminated by spotlights or floodlights not a part of or attached to the sign itself.
INTERNALLY LIGHTED, TRANSLUCENT SIGN – A sign of translucent nontransparent material which is illuminated from within but has no exposed or exterior bulbs, tubes or other light sources.
MANSARD-ROOF SIGN – A one-sided sign mounted on the mansard or false mansard roof. For purposes of this chapter, a “mansard roof” is a double sloped roof whose lower section rises steeply. A “false mansard roof” consists of a roofed surface attached high on the walls of a low-pitched or flat roofed building that attempts to give the illusion of a true structural mansard roof.
MARQUEE SIGN – A sign attached to a canopy or covering structure projecting from and attached to a building.
OCCUPANCY – Business conducted by an individual or group of individuals engaged in the sale of more than one (1) kind of merchandise or service shall not be interpreted as more than one (1) “occupancy,” unless separate and independent ownership of individual businesses can be shown.
PENT-ROOF SIGN – A one-sided sign mounted on a pent roof. For purposes of this chapter, a “pent roof” is any permanent pitched roof attached to and supported solely by the wall of a building and originating below the building's main cornice line. Porch roofs, canopies and marquees are not pent roofs. Pent roof signs shall be parallel with the building wall and shall not project horizontally beyond the pent roof's edges or above the building's main cornice line.
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 100

SIGN AREA – That area within a line which includes the outer extremities of all letters, figures, characters and delineations or within a line which includes the outer extremities of the framework or background of the sign, whichever line includes the larger area. The support for the sign background, whether it is columns, a pylon or a building or part thereof, shall not be included in the sign area. Only one (1) side of a double-faced sign shall be included in a computation of sign area. For other signs with more than one (1) face, each side shall be included in a computation of sign area.
TEMPORARY SIGN – A sign erected for no more than thirty (30) days.
WINDOW SIGN – Any sign attached to and erected parallel to the face of or erected or painted on the surface of a window and supported throughout its length by such window. For the purposes of this chapter, a window sign is considered a flat sign.

In cases of multiple occupancy of a building, only one (1) of the aforementioned projecting or freestanding signs may be erected, except that any ground floor, entry served storefront shall be entitled to its choice of one (1) of the aforementioned signs. Additional occupants are limited
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 102
to flat signs limited to four (4) square feet. Signs can only be lighted indirectly.
(4) Signs subject to permit in the CM Zone include temporary signs, permanent signs and accessory signs. Permanent signs are to be flat signs with a maximum area equal to one (1) square foot of sign for one (1) linear foot of store frontage but limited to forty (40) square feet. One (1) additional flat sign, if placed on the water side of a waterfront property and oriented to be read from boats on the water, is allowed. One (1) or, where applicable, two (2) flat signs per occupancy are allowed.
(5) Signs subject to permit in the C-3 Zone include temporary signs, permanent signs and accessory signs. Permanent signs can be flat signs with a maximum area equal to one (1) square foot of sign for one (1) linear foot of sign for one (1) linear foot of store frontage, not to exceed forty (40) square feet for each storefront. One (1) flat sign is permitted for each ground level storefront. In cases where a front yard setback equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) feet, a freestanding sign may be permitted if such sign does not exceed eight feet in height and twelve (12) square feet in area. Signs may be internally lighted unless the Historic District Commission determines that such lighting is inappropriate to the structure or property. Occupants that are behind or above the ground level storefront must share the sign area square footage allowed to the storefront facing the street.
D. Industrial district signs.
(1) This subsection applies to the LI-1 and LI-2 Zones.
(2) Signs subject to permit in the industrial zones include temporary signs and permanent signs. Permanent signs are to be flat signs which are limited in area to one hundred (100) square feet, with one (1) for each industry, and detached signs which are limited in area to fifty (50) square feet, in height to five (5) feet and in number to one (1) per platted parcel. Internally lighted, translucent signs are allowed.
E. Institutional district signs.
(1) This subsection applies to the IN Zone.
(2) Permanent signs subject to permit in the Institutional zone are temporary and permanent signs. Permanent signs are to be flat signs up to sixty (60) square feet for the primary building and up to forty (40) square feet for secondary buildings if the institution has multiple buildings. Detached signs of up to thirty (30) square feet may be substituted for flat signs for the primary building and twenty (20) square feet for secondary buildings on an either/or basis. Signs will be approved by the Planning Commission for compatibility with the other signs at the institution for color and design. Signs identifying the entire institution to the
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 103
public and on main thoroughfares will be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval on scale, design and appropriateness, without a specific square footage requirement.
§ 170-88. Exemptions to permit requirements.
The following signs are exempted from the provisions of these regulations and may be erected or constructed without a permit but in accord with the structural and safety requirements of applicable codes:
A. Official traffic signs or sign structures and provisional warning signs or sign structures, when erected or required to be erected by a governmental agency, and temporary signs indicating danger.
B. Non-illuminated signs, not to exceed one (1) square foot per sign, warning trespassers or announcing property as posted.

Off-Street Parking
§ 170-94. Off-street parking requirements.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, when any building or structure is hereafter erected or structurally altered or any building or structure hereafter is converted for the uses listed in the Table of Off-Street Parking Spaces included at the end of this chapter, accessory off-street parking spaces shall be as required in such table or as required in subsequent sections of this Article.
§ 170-95. Location of parking facilities; joint use.
A. All parking spaces required herein shall be located on the same lot with the building or use served, except that, where an increase in the number of spaces is required by a change or enlargement of use or where such spaces are provided collectively or used jointly by two (2) or more buildings or establishments, the required spaces may be located and maintained at a distance not to exceed three hundred (300) feet from an institutional building or some other nonresidential building served.
B. Up to fifty percent (50%) of the parking spaces required for theaters, public auditoriums, bowling alleys, dance halls and nightclubs and up to one hundred percent (100%) of the parking spaces required for a church auditorium may be provided and used jointly by
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 107
banks, offices, retail stores, repair shops, service establishments and similar uses not normally open, used or operated during the same hours as theaters, public auditoriums, bowling alleys, dance halls and nightclubs, and up to one hundred percent (100%) of parking spaces required for schools may be provided and used jointly by a church auditorium; provided, however, that written agreement thereto is properly executed and recorded as specified below.
C. In any case where the required parking spaces are not located on the same lot with the building or use served or where such spaces are collectively or jointly provided and used, such parking space shall be established by a recorded covenant or agreement as parking space to be used in conjunction with the principal use and shall be reserved as such through an encumbrance of the title of the property to be designated as required parking space, such encumbrance on the title of the property to be valid for the total period the use or uses for which the parking is needed are in existence. A certificate of recording of the covenant or agreement shall be furnished to the Administrator.
§ 170-96. Design standards.
Additional design standards for each zoning category can be found in Appendix I.
A. Minimum area. For the purpose of these regulations, an off-street parking space is an all-weather, surfaced area, not in a street or alley, having an area of not less than two hundred (200) square feet, exclusive of driveways, permanently reserved for the temporary storage of one (1) vehicle and connected with a street or alley by a paved driveway which affords ingress and egress for an automobile without requiring another automobile to be moved. In parking lots of five (5) or more spaces, up to twenty-five (25) percent of the spaces may be one hundred sixty-two (162) square feet, or nine (9) feet by eighteen (18) feet, and shall be designated for compact vehicles.
B. Drainage and maintenance. Off-street parking facilities shall be drained to eliminate standing water and prevent damage to abutting property and/or public streets and alleys. Off-street parking areas shall be maintained in a clean, orderly and dust free condition at the expense of the owner or lessee and shall not be used for the sale, repair or dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies. Stormwater management will use current best management practices such as permeable paving, vegetated buffer strips, rain gardens, and other techniques.
C. Separation from walkways and streets. Off-street parking spaces shall be separated from walkways, sidewalks, streets or alleys by a wall, fence, curbing or other approved protective device or by distance so that vehicles cannot protrude over publicly owned areas. Adjoining parking lots shall, wherever possible, be connected.
D. Entrances and exits. The location and design of entrances and exits shall be in accord with the applicable requirements of town traffic regulations and standards. Landscaping,
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 108
curbing or approved barriers shall be provided along lot boundaries to control the entrance and exit of vehicles or pedestrians.
E. Interior drives. Interior drives shall be of adequate width, structurally defined with curb and gutter and landscaped islands, to serve the particular design arrangement of parking spaces.
F. Marking. Parking spaces in lots of more than five (5) spaces shall be marked by painted lines or curbs or other means to indicate individual spaces. Signs or markers shall be used as necessary to ensure efficient traffic operation of the lot. Signs, markers and pavement markings shall conform to the standards approved by the Maryland State Highway Administration and endorsed by the United States Department of Transportation.
G. Lighting. Adequate lighting shall be provided if off street parking spaces are to be used at night. The lighting shall be arranged and installed to minimize glare on property in any residential district, and must comply with the Town’s Night Skies Ordinance 06-2009, adopted June 15, 2009.
H. Screening. When off-street parking areas for three (3) or more automobiles are located next to a residential district or to any lot upon which there is a dwelling as a permitted use under these regulations and where such parking areas are not entirely, visually screened from such lot by an intervening building or structure, there shall be provided a continuous visual screen with a minimum height of six (6) feet. Such screen may consist of a compact evergreen hedge or foliage screening using native plantings. The initial planting of the visual screen shall be three (3) feet tall, or a louvered wall or fence of substantial material shall be approved by the Planning Commission. The optimal screening sought by the Planning Commission is a combination of native plantings and structural solutions.
I. Construction material. All off-street parking facilities shall be paved with macadam, bituminous concrete or concrete, and the design and specifications therefore shall be subject to approval by the Planning Commission.
J. Landscaping. In off-street parking areas of three (3) or more spaces, the Planning Commission shall require landscaping to screen the parking area from any adjacent properties and street frontages. All required landscaping shall consist of plants native to the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Invasive plants shall be strictly avoided.
ARTICLE XII
Off-Street Loading Regulations
§ 170-97. Off-street loading spaces required.
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 109
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, when any building or structure is hereafter erected or structurally altered to the extent of increasing the floor area by twenty-five percent (25%) or more or any building is hereafter converted for the uses listed in the Table of Off-Street Loading Requirements included at the end of this chapter and when such buildings contain the floor areas specified in such table, accessory, off-street loading spaces shall be as required in such table or as required in subsequent sections of this Article.
§ 170-98. Buildings containing mixed uses.
Where a building is used for more than one (1) use or for different uses and where the floor area used for each use for which loading space is required is below the minimum for required loading spaces but the aggregate floor area used is greater than such minimum, then off-street loading space shall be provided as if the entire building were used for that use in the building for which the most spaces are required. In such cases, the Administrator may make reasonable requirements for the location of required loading spaces.
§ 170-99. Design standards.
A. Minimum size. For the purpose of these regulations, a loading space is a space within the main building or on the same lot which provides for the standing, loading or unloading of trucks and has a minimum area of five hundred forty (540) square feet, minimum width of twelve (12) feet, a minimum depth of thirty-five (35) feet and a vertical clearance of at least fourteen and one-half (14½) feet.
B. Loading space for funeral homes. Loading spaces for a funeral home may be reduced in size to ten (10) by twenty-five (25) feet and the vertical clearance reduced to eight (8) feet.
C. Drainage and maintenance. Off-street loading facilities shall be drained to eliminate standing water and prevent damage to abutting property and/or public streets and alleys and shall be surfaced with erosion resistant material in accordance with applicable specifications. Off-street loading areas shall be maintained in a clean, orderly and dust free condition at the expense of the owner or lessee and shall not be used for the repair, dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies.
D. Entrances and exits. The location and design of entrances and exits shall be in accord with applicable requirements of traffic regulations and standards. Where the entrance or exit of a building is designed for truck loading and unloading, such entrance or exit shall be designed to provide at least one (1) off-street loading space.

NOTES:
1. The use regulations for each district are not affected by the arrangement of uses in the table.
2. The parking requirements in the table are in addition to space for storage of trucks or other vehicles used in connection with any use.
3. The parking requirements in the table do not limit other parking requirements contained in the district regulations.
4. The parking requirements in the table do not limit special requirements which may be imposed with conditional uses pursuant to Article VIII of this chapter.
5. Floor area, as used in the table, shall be as defined in Article III of this chapter.
6. Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest whole number.
7. Except as otherwise provided, the number of employees shall be compiled on the basis of the maximum number of persons employed on the premises at one (1) time on an average day or average night, whichever is greater. Seasonal variations in employment may be recognized in determining an average day.
8. The parking space requirements for a use not specifically listed in the table shall be the same as for a listed use of similar characteristics of parking demand generation.
13Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
Zoning Ordinance – February 13, 2012 Page 113
9. In the case of mixed uses or uses with different parking requirements occupying the same building or premises or in the case of joint use of a building or premises by more than one (1) use having the same parking requirements, the parking spaces required shall equal the sum required for the various uses computed separately.
10. Whenever a building or use is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise to create a need, under the requirements of this chapter, for an increase in parking spaces of ten percent (10%) or more than those required before the change or enlargement, such additional spaces shall be provided on the basis of the change or enlargement. No additional spaces shall be required for the first change or enlargement which would result in an increase of spaces of less than ten percent (10%) of those required before the change or enlargement, but this exception shall not apply to a series of changes or enlargements which together result in a need for an increase in parking space of ten percent (10%) or more.
11. Whenever a building is built or enlarged or it is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise to create a need, under the requirements of this chapter, for an increase in parking spaces and is located in the C-2 Commercial Zone and the Historic District of Chestertown, a variance may be sought to relieve the property owner of some or all of the parking space requirements. The Board may grant such a variance if it finds that adequate public parking exists within three hundred fifty (350) feet of the proposed building or that providing a parking lot in the historical area would do substantial and irreparable harm to the Historic District area.
12. In cases of low rent public housing units owned, leased or operated by the Chestertown Housing Authority and housing developments for elderly persons, the Planning and Zoning Commission may determine and approve a reduction in the number of required spaces for such use by not more than fifty percent (50%) of the applicable regulations.

DESIGN GUIDELINES AND POLICY STATEMENT
DESIGN GUIDELINES AND POLICY STATEMENT
NEW CONSTR
NEW CONSTRUCTIONUCTION
A. General: The design of new construction is of utmost importance, whether it must harmonize with the character of the neighborhood and existing structures or if it begins the new development of raw land. The following guidelines and policy statement are not intended to require particular architectural styles or dictate one period over another. Instead, they are purposely general in nature and are intended to allow a range of design options which will encourage development compatible with the neighboring properties and the Town.
All new construction plans that come before the Planning and Zoning Commission must have been completed by an architect and/or engineer registered in the State of Maryland. This is in accordance with the State of Maryland policy concerning building codes and commercial and public buildings. It is not likely that the Planning Commission will handle any applications that fall under any other category, since in this regard industrial would be considered commercial or public and multi-family residential the same. If the building and site plans are boilerplate from another jurisdiction they can be deemed unresponsive to the general guidelines above, in that they were designed totally without regard to their placement in the Chestertown community. The applicant can then be asked to have their architect redesign the structure to conform with local conditions and architecture. Conversely, if the surrounding buildings were built without any regard to architectural design or to the community in general, the applicant can be asked to follow good design standards for the future growth of the Town.
The following factors should be taken into account when planning and designing new construction.
(1) Compatibility with surrounding architecture. The relationship between the width and height of the front façade of a building should be visually compatible with adjacent buildings. Additionally, the relationship of a building to the open spaces between it and adjoining buildings should be visually compatible with the spacing of adjacent buildings. This is not merely a discussion of the setbacks required by the applicable zoning. When one moves past a sequence of buildings, one experiences the proportion of the width to height of the buildings as well as a rhythm of recurrent building masses to the open spaces between them. For example, if a series of narrow two story buildings is interrupted by a new, wide, one story building of the same height as the other two story buildings, the result is a very incompatible streetscape.
(2) Height. The height of a proposed building should be visually compatible with adjacent buildings. One of the most distinguishing features of any neighborhood is the strong horizontal line established by the structure’s cornices. It is important that this line be introduced into the design solution
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 118
for new construction to assure continuity from one building to the next. It is not necessary to duplicate an adjoining structure in terms of height but, instead, to maintain an appearance of a strong horizontal line between dwellings. There should not be more than a ten percent (10%) difference in a visual field where the majority of buildings are similar in height. Nor should there be a ten percent (10%) difference in the height of any one story, unless the adjacent structures are functionally too short. If all the surrounding buildings are of varied height with no apparent compatibility, the Planning Commission shall ultimately decide the appropriate scale based on the system of development of the rest of the Town and on the requirements of the zoning ordinance.
(3) Scale. The size of a building, the building mass in relationship to open spaces, windows, and doors should be compatible with other buildings in a visually related field. Scale is created by the size of units of construction and architectural detail which relate to the immediate environment and man.
(4) Materials, Texture, and Color. The purpose of this section is to encourage the proper use of appropriate materials and details. The materials and details of new construction should relate to the materials and details of existing adjacent buildings. Relationship of materials, texture, and color of the façade of a building should be visually compatible with the predominant materials used in the buildings to which it is visually related. However, materials for all structures in commercial, industrial and public zones shall be of stone or masonry to ensure the safety of the occupants. Visible roofing materials may be slate, composition shingles, or metal (with a permanent finish and not the type used for barns or sheds). Further, metal buildings have no precedence in Chestertown’s history; therefore the use of metal is not permitted on visible facades.
TRADITIONAL NEIG
TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENTHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT
Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) utilizes design principles embodied in urban form and design conventions that were the norm in Chestertown from Colonial times to the 1940’s. The TND District permits development and land use pursuant to an approved Master Development Plan that meets the requirements of the Town Zoning Ordinance and that is approved by the Planning Commission.
The following Design Guidelines are intended to supplement the Design Standards and requirements contained in the Chestertown Zoning Ordinance applicable to the R-6 Traditional Neighborhood Development District.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 119
Applicants shall be guided throughout the review process by the following TND Design Standards. Because it is recognized that design professionals, including architects, landscape architects, and land planners, are trained to strive for creative excellence, the design standards and criteria are not intended to restrict creative solutions or to dictate all design details. The TND Design Guidelines serve as a tool for the Town planning staff by providing a checklist of elements to be considered. The Standards also inform the design professionals of items that should be considered or included from the outset of the design process.
A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of establishing Design Guidelines for the Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) District is:
(1) To preserve and enhance the unique character of the Town while integrating new development into the overall fabric of the community;
(2) To encourage creative design and innovative approaches to achieve the community character called for in the Town’s Comprehensive Plan;
(3) To ensure that each incremental addition to the Town recognizes precedent and is designed in a manner that is mindful of what has come before and contributes to the achievement of overall community design objectives; and
(4) To encourage a broad housing market that will accommodate a diverse population mix of all ages, income levels, and socio-economic backgrounds reflective of the Town’s existing demographics.
B. Specific Goals and Objectives. The goals and objectives of the TND Design Guidelines are to:
(1) Design for the human scale and perceptions to create a sense of neighborhood and community.
(2) Enhance Chestertown’s sense of place in its rural and regional setting by maintaining the small-town feel while keeping new development in harmony with nature.
(3) Create a pleasant and functional pedestrian realm that consists of common open spaces, tree-lined streets, and landscaped areas (between public and private spaces) and utility corridors.
(4) Encourage internal and peripheral open space.
(5) Create neighborhood centers within walking distances of all surrounding neighborhoods.
(6) Create appropriate transition areas between neighborhoods.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 120
(7) Design for neighborhood and collector streets internal to the community.
(8) Integrate buildings of smaller scale in a pattern of various footprints.
(9) Plan for mixed and multiple land uses, including a mix of housing types, income and a horizontal and vertical mix of uses.
(10) Utilize appropriate details in building design.
(11) Create housing which offers a variety of options to accommodate and encourage a diverse population mix of varied socio-economic backgrounds reflective of the Town’s demographics.
C. Applicability. The provisions of the TND Design Guidelines shall be considered during the review of all Master Development Plans, site plans, subdivision plans, or other permits or applications for new development, new construction involving structural alterations, and new structures, on all land located in the R-6 (TND) District. Where these guidelines conflict with any provision of the Chestertown Zoning Ordinance or the Subdivision Regulations, the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance or Subdivision Regulations shall control.
D. Design Provisions. The Planning Commission will rely on the Comprehensive Plan and the Design Guidelines concerning issues of design, neighborhood and community character, and compatibility. In general, these call for the following characteristics, which shall be set forth on a set of drawings, plans, and/or elevations sufficient to permit the Planning Commission to apply the following standards.
E. General Design Provisions. The following standards generally apply to development proposed in the TND District.
(1) Architectural Considerations.
a. The architectural design of structures and their materials and colors should be visually harmonious with the overall appearance, history, and cultural heritage of the Town, with natural landforms and existing vegetation and with other development plans approved by the Town.
b. Specific consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent properties where such projects demonstrate the Town's character.
c. Facing buildings should not differ in height by more than 2:1, excluding church steeples, decorative cornices, chimneys, and the like.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 121
d. Materials should be used that have similar texture and appearance as appropriate to the Town's character.
e. Exterior materials should be natural in appearance, with preference given to wood or wood appearance siding, stone, and brick. Exterior building colors should be traditional or muted tones.
(2) Overall Form and Spatial Relationships
a. Areas of new construction should be sited so as to best preserve natural vistas and the existing topography.
b. Peripheral greenbelt open space should be designed to follow natural features whenever possible and to maintain an agricultural, woodland, or countryside character.
c. The developed portions of the TND should be distinguished from the peripheral, greenbelt open space by a well-defined line or edge so that developed areas will transition very quickly to rural, undeveloped lands.
d. Peripheral open space should surround the planned neighborhood. An exception to this standard is that Neighborhood Centers Areas may be located along major roads, at the planned neighborhood perimeter. Another exception is that planned neighborhoods proposed to be located within five hundred (500) feet of existing residential development should be encouraged to be contiguous with preexisting neighborhoods through the use of multiple street and footpath connections.
e. Residential lots should not be located within two-hundred and fifty (250) feet of any two-lane state highway, unless effectively screened from the public view by virtue of topography, dense vegetation, or other physical or visual barriers. If a state highway also functions as a main street or main street extended, setbacks and screening may be reduced in favor of urban gateway treatments, e.g., decorative street lights, special signage and landscape treatments appropriate to an urban street.
f. Neighborhood Centers and Central Residential Areas should be surrounded by Single Family Residential Areas or, where applicable, by a combination of residential and civic uses.
g. The transition between different land uses should be handled so as to avoid distinct visual differences, such as in the scale of buildings.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 122
Similar land-use types should front one another, while dissimilar land-use types should abut along alleys or rear parking areas.
h. Neighborhood Centers should be located at or near the geographic center of the residential areas they primarily serve and should be located within fifteen hundred (1,500) feet of three-quarters of all dwellings within its service area.
i. Higher-density residential uses should be located within the Central Residential Areas.
(3) Block Design.
a. Planned neighborhoods should be designed in a net-like pattern of blocks and interconnecting streets and alleys, defined by buildings, street furniture, landscaping, pedestrian ways, and sidewalks.
b. While topography, existing vegetation, hydrology, and design intentions should influence block shape and size, the maximum length for a block should be five hundred (500) feet, with an allowance for blocks up to eight hundred (800) feet when mid-block footpaths are provided. No less than one eight (8) foot pedestrian alley or way should be provided for every two hundred and fifty (250) feet of street frontage in the commercial zones, connecting with rear parking lots.
c. Each block that includes storefronts and/or residential lots or uses less than forty-five (45) feet wide should be designed to include an alley serving rear parking areas or garages.
d. In order to calm traffic speeds, the use of "T" intersections, where vehicles must stop and turn to the right or to the left rather than proceeding forward in a straight line, is encouraged. At least twenty-five (25) percent of all intersections within the subdivision residential areas should take this form, unless other design devices (such as traffic islands or circles, four-way stop signs, or other traffic calming measures are employed to reduce vehicle travel speed.
F. Residential SRA. In addition to the General Design Provisions set forth in subsection E above, the following guidelines generally apply in the Single-Family Residential Areas (SRA) of the TND District.
(1) Residential design styles should reflect vernacular architecture.
(2) Repetitious housing styles within individual neighborhoods are discouraged.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 123
(3) Porch frontages are encouraged on all single family detached homes.
(4) Residential buildings should front on public ways, and be located so as to create a sense of enclosure along the street.
(5) Build-To-Lines (BTL) should include appropriate variations to encourage neighborhood identity and creativity.
(6) Lot widths should be varied. Orientation of housing can also vary.
(7) Lot widths should be designed to ensure that garages do not dominate the front facade of residential structures.
(8) Traditional roof pitches and multiple roof lines are encouraged.
G. Residential CRA. In addition to the General Design Provisions set forth in subsection E above, the following guidelines generally apply in the Central Residential Areas (CRA) of the TND District.
(1) In general, townhouse and multi-family units should adhere to the architectural guidelines for single family and two-family dwellings.
(2) Townhouse and multi-family units should blend into the overall character of the neighborhoods.
(3) Multi-family structures should appear as large single-family units. Small groups of town homes, four or less, may be designed to appear as large single-family structures.
(4) Single family residences should be mixed with other permitted housing types.
(5) No more than six units should be included in a single town house unit group. Each unit should have a distinct architectural appearance, but the overall appearance of the units should be compatible with and complementary to adjacent single family residential units and with the other units in the neighborhood.
(6) Parking for townhouse and multi-family structures should be located to the rear or side of the units.
(7) The majority of multi-family and townhouse units should be located in the Central Residential and Neighborhood Center areas of the TND.
H. Open Space. The following design provisions generally apply to open space areas and Conservation Areas (CA) in the TND District.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 124
(1) Open space shall consist of a separate lot(s) or area(s) designated for protection of its environmental features, for recreation, or for public use, including public facilities. Open space types are generally recognized as conforming to one of the following types (from rural to urban):
a. Conservation Area (CA): The largest open space areas, reserved for protection, enhancement, and creation of environmental resources including wetlands, stream buffers, tree cover, steep slopes, floodplain and similar environmentally sensitive land that collectively form and connects to a regional greenbelt. The landscape is naturalistic and requires limited to no maintenance. Certain areas may be conducive to informal recreation such as hiking and biking trails that serves to line the reserve to a regional open space network.
b. Park: A large public tract, available for active and passive recreation, typically located at the edge of the neighborhoods, connected to conservation reserves and adjacent access from a public thoroughfare. The landscape generally consists of lawn and trees, informally and naturalistically arranged and requiring limited maintenance. Parks often accommodate active recreation including tennis, multi-purpose courts, ballfields, garden plots, picnic areas, pools and pool house, community building and similar use, including parking.
c. Green: A moderate to small public tract of land, available for unstructured recreation, often circumscribed on all sides by both building frontages and thoroughfares. Greens are most often associated with and uniquely identified/designed for a particular neighborhood use. The landscape consists primarily of trees and lawn areas, naturalistically or formally arranged, requiring limited or moderate maintenance. A natural green including informal plantings and grouping of trees and plant materials, randomly placed sitting areas and walks and similar features. A formal green includes more formal arrangement of trees and plantings, deliberately aligned furniture and sitting areas, formal pathways and walks, and similar features. An attached green (either natural or formal) is circumscribed on all sides by building frontages and on at least two sides by thoroughfares.
d. Squares: A public open space, often an entire block, at the intersection of important streets and set aside for civic and public purpose; often associated with multiple neighborhood/public use. Typically circumscribed on all sides by both building frontages and thoroughfares, its landscape consists primarily of paved walks, lawn, trees, shrub massing, furniture and ornaments, such as fountains or
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 125
sculptures, civic buildings, all formally arranged and requiring moderate to substantial maintenance.
e. Plaza: A small to moderate public open space at the intersection of important streets and/or at the juncture of important commercial and civic buildings, set aside for civic purposes and intense human activity. Typically circumscribed on all sides by building frontages, its landscape consists of durable pavement, furniture, ornaments, decorative fountains or other urban art, and trees, all formally arranged and requiring minimal to moderate maintenance.
(1) Where appropriate, the open space provided within TND’s should include a mix of Conservation Areas, greens, parks, and squares.
(2) Conservation Areas that serve as greenbelts should be designed to create a visual and physical distinction between the proposed development, the surrounding countryside, and any neighboring developments.
(3) Greens and squares are spatially defined and distributed open spaces within the planned neighborhood, designed to serve a variety of outdoor leisure and assembly needs of planned neighborhood residents and to enhance the form and appearance of the development.
(4) There should be a main central green or square, located within five hundred (500) feet of the planned neighborhood's geographical center. When a Neighborhood Center is part of the development proposal, this main green should be located in close proximity to it. Other, smaller greens should be dispersed throughout the remainder of the planned neighborhood in such a way that no lot is more than a walking distance of 1,350 feet from a green, square, or park. The main village green should be designed to a pedestrian scale, meaning that it should not be longer or wider than three hundred (300) feet and should be between 20,000 and 40,000 square feet in area. The other, smaller greens, squares, and parks (but not including the central open space within "loop lanes") should be no less than 8,000 square feet in size unless otherwise permitted by the Planning Commission. All greens should be planted with shade trees along their edges, at intervals not greater than fifty (50) feet, with groups of trees located at various points throughout their area.
I. Neighborhood Center. In addition to the General Design Provisions set forth in subsection E above, the following guidelines generally apply in the Neighborhood Center (NC) of the TND District.
(1) Maximum Size. New commercial buildings in the Neighborhood Center and their associated parking spaces should not occupy more than five (5) percent of the Adjusted Tract Area of the entire planned neighborhood. Commercial buildings may occupy up to ten (10) percent of the Adjusted Tract Area if
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 126
they include second-story office uses. Commercial buildings may occupy up to fifteen (15) percent of the Adjusted Tract Area if they include second-story residential units. In order to qualify for the fifteen (15) percent figure, at least half of the new commercial building coverage (foundation footprint) should be of two-story construction, and at least twenty-five (25) percent of the second-story space shall be designed for residential uses.
(2) Uses. The mixed-use/commercial portions of the planned neighborhood should be contained within the Neighborhood Center. This area should be designed to provide a variety of retail shops and services to support the day-to-day needs of planned neighborhood residents and other local residents, complemented by other compatible business, civic, and residential uses in commercial-type buildings in a manner consistent with a small downtown or central market place in the community.
(3) Commercial areas should surround, be located adjacent to, or be across the street from a public park, green, or square of at least 10,000 square feet, which area may be credited as part of the open space required of the development.
(4) New commercial buildings may be either traditional in their architectural character or be a contemporary expression of traditional styles and forms, respecting the scale, proportion, character, and materials of shops in the community. Shopfront design should be based upon historic examples in the area, with large display windows having sills between twelve (12) and eighteen (18) inches above sidewalk level and lintels nine (9) to twelve (12) feet above sidewalk level. Commercial buildings should also articulate the line between the ground and upper levels with a cornice, canopy, balcony, arcade, or other visual device.
(5) The massing of larger commercial buildings should be de-emphasized in a variety of ways, including the use of projecting and recessed sections, to reduce their apparent overall bulk and volume. Such breaks in their facades and roof lines should occur not more frequently than the width of two historic shop-fronts (generally about 25 feet each), nor less frequently than one hundred (100) feet. To harmonize with the traditional scale of commercial buildings in historic towns and villages, new commercial buildings should not contain more than 5,000 square feet (above grade), and those with more than 2,000 square feet of floor space (above grade) should be of at least one and-one-half-story construction.
(6) A majority of buildings should be designed for multiple uses, with offices and/or residential units above.
(7) Buildings should be topped with pitched roofs with overhanging eaves, but flat roofs with articulated parapets and cornices may be allowed. Desired
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 127
materials on pitched roofs include slate (either natural or manmade), shingle (either wood or asphalt composition), and metal formed to resemble "standing seams." Roof color should be traditional, meaning that it should be within the range of colors found on existing buildings in the community. Specifically excluded are white, tan, or blue shingles, red clay tiles, and corrugated metal. The use of fascias, dormers, and gables is encouraged to provide visual interest. All gables should be functional.
(8) Gas station canopies should have pitched roofs and the lighting should be from luminaries completely recessed into the ceilings of said canopies, so that the lighting elements themselves are not visible from or beyond the lot lines.
(9) Exterior wall materials may include stucco, wood clapboard (including vinyl or aluminum imitation clapboard siding), native stone, split-face aggregate block, or brick of a shape, color, and texture very similar to that found in the historic villages and towns in of Kent County. Specifically prohibited should be "T-111" plywood siding. Except on rear walls, all forms of concrete block should also be prohibited. In addition, metal buildings should also be excluded from this sub-district.
(10) Large work area doors or open bays shall not open toward or face the public ways.
(11) HVAC and other fixed operating machinery shall be either screened from view or located so that such items are not visible from the highway, public rights-of-way, or adjoining non-commercial areas. Large trash receptacles, dumpsters, utility meters, and above ground tanks, etc., shall be similarly treated.
(12) All signage should:
a. Be affixed to a building facade, canopy, or arcade;
b. Be located no higher than the sills of second-story windows;
c. Be visible to both pedestrians and drivers;
d. Be illuminated with steady external lighting (if lighted at all); and
e. Use lighting conforming to the regulations contained in the Zoning Ordinance.
(13) Traditional canvas awnings without interior illumination are encouraged, and all signs should be of wood or metal, preferably with dark background colors and light-colored lettering.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 128
(14) Storefront buildings should have at least sixty (60) percent of their front facade coincident with their street frontage, including frontage onto courtyards.
(15) Principal entrances to buildings should be from the front sidewalk, except in courtyard designs.
(16) Storefront buildings fronting on the same street and located on the same block should be attached, except as necessary to accommodate pedestrian ways.
J. Lighting Design Provisions. An exterior lighting plan shall be submitted to the Town whenever subdivision or site plan approval is sought in the TND District in order to determine whether the provisions of this section have been met and that adjoining property will not be adversely impacted by the proposed lighting.
(1) In general, the following provisions apply to lighting proposed as part of any development:
a. Lighting should be designed so as to prevent direct glare, light spillage and hazardous interference with automotive and pedestrian traffic on adjacent streets and all adjacent properties.
b. Light fixtures should be designed as an integral design element that compliments the design of the neighborhood through style, material, and color.

A. Site Layout, Development Pattern, and Building Orientation.
(1) Intent. Site layout and building orientation often define the focus of activity that occurs at the front door or along the street. These standards are intended to use site planning and building orientation in order to:
a. Create a sense of place for users and passers-by;
b. Ensure that buildings relate appropriately to surrounding neighborhoods and streets and create a cohesive visual identity and attractive street scene;
c. Ensure that site circulation promotes contiguous pedestrian and vehicle circulation patterns;
d. Ensure that parking areas provide safe and efficient access to buildings; and
e. that site layout and building design create a unique and identifiable image for development.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 136
(2) Location of Parking. In order to reduce the scale of the paved surfaces and to
shorten the walking distance between the parked car and the building, offstreet
parking for all commercial developments shall be located according to
one of the following options:
a. A minimum of seventy percent (70%) of the off-street surface
parking spaces provided for all uses contained in the development’s
primary building shall be located other than between the front façade
of the primary building and the primary abutting street (e.g., to the
rear or side of the primary building(s); this number increases to
seventy percent (70%) in smaller commercial developments and one
hundred percent (100%) for public buildings, and all buildings in or
immediately adjacent to a residential district; or
b. More than fifty percent (50%) of the off-street surface parking spaces
provided for all uses contained in the development’s primary building
may be located between the front façade of the primary building(s)
and the primary abutting street, provided the amount of interior and
perimeter parking lot landscaping required is increased by fifty
percent (50%).
(3) Multiple-building developments.
a. When there is more than one (1) building in a commercial
development, such as a shopping center, the development shall
comply with the following standards, except that multiple building
developments located at the intersection of two thoroughfare streets
shall comply instead with the standards stated in A.5 of this section.
b. Site Layout and Building Orientation.
All buildings shall be arranged and grouped so that their primary
orientation complements adjacent, existing development and either:
In this development pattern, a side "main street”,
off the primary abutting street, is the core and
focus of the center. Buildings are closely spaced
and front directly on this "main street.” The
majority of parking is on the interior of the block
behind the buildings, although parallel or angled
parking could be allowed along the "main street.”
The "main street” could be intersected by smaller
side streets providing access to other uses on the
parcel.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 137
i. Frames the corner of an adjacent street intersection; or
ii. Frames and encloses a "main street" pedestrian and/or vehicle access corridor within the development site; or
iii. Frames and encloses on at least three sides parking areas, public spaces, or other site amenities.
iv. Alternatives. An applicant may submit an alternative development pattern, provided such pattern achieves the intent of the above standards and this section. Strictly linear or "strip commercial" development patterns shall be avoided.
(4) Single-building developments.
a. Applicability. Unless part of a larger planned development or commercial center, when there is only one (1) building in a proposed commercial development the development shall comply with the following standards, except that single building developments located at the intersection of two streets shall comply instead with the standards stated below. (Site Layout and Building Orientation at Two
Intersecting Streets)
In this development pattern, most buildings front directly on the street and define a clear edge. The pad site on the corner makes a strong architectural statement and announces the center. Parking is typically on the interior of the block.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 138
b. Single-tenant building. Unless part of a larger planned development or commercial center, when there is only one (1) building in a proposed commercial development that will be occupied or physically dominated by a single tenant, such building shall be oriented toward the primary abutting street and shall otherwise comply with standard A(2)a, Location of Parking, above. Deep setbacks behind large expanses of parking areas or vacant land shall be avoided.
c. Multi-tenant building. Unless part of a larger planned development or commercial center, when there is only one (1) building in a proposed commercial development that will be occupied by multiple tenants, at least fifty percent (50%) of the building's “active” wall shall be oriented toward the primary abutting street and shall otherwise comply with standard A(2)a, Location of Parking, above. Deep setbacks behind large expanses of parking areas or vacant land shall be avoided. For purposes of this standard, the “active” wall shall be the side of the building containing the majority of storefronts, customer entrances, and windows.
(5) Site layout and building orientation at two intersecting streets.
a. Intent. Chestertown’s major commercial intersections of are generally located at key gateway sites or prominent street corners necessitating special attention. The corners should be linked and function as a whole, recognizing the historic and architectural legacy and precedent so that a sense of place and “arrival” unique to Chestertown is created.
b. Applicability. All new office, and commercial developments located at the intersection of two streets shall comply with this subsection's site layout and building orientation standards.
c. Site Layout and Building Orientation. To the maximum extent practicable, within each intersection quadrant, primary buildings and/or pad site buildings shall be arranged to orient to the thoroughfare streets and to frame the corner at the intersection of the two streets. Deep building setbacks behind large expanses of parking areas or vacant land shall be avoided. A minimum of sixty percent (60%) of all thoroughfare street frontages shall be occupied by:
i. Building frontage;
ii. Decorative architectural walls no higher than three (3) feet;
iii. Landscaped entryway features;
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 139
iv. Required focal point; and/or
v. Site amenities.
d. Corner treatments. On the corners of a street intersection, buildings and amenities that serve as a “focal point” should be located within one hundred (100) feet from the curb line. Site amenities that may serve as focal points may include and are not limited to any of the following:
i. Patio or plaza with seating area;
ii. Mini-parks, squares, or greens;
iii. Pedestrian walkways or greenways
iv. Water features or
v. Public art or sculpture
vi. Any other similar, deliberately shaped area and/or focal feature that, in the Town’s judgment, adequately enhances such development or serves as a gathering place.
Parking areas shall be limited within one hundred (100) feet of the intersection, and be screened by a decorative wall and landscaping not to exceed three (3) feet in height.
e. Building placement and organization. Buildings occupying a corner site should be distinctively-designed, and proportioned to the intersection. Within each intersection quadrant, new buildings shall be organized to align with existing buildings located across the intersecting streets in a way that “completes” the space around the corner and unites the adjacent developments.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 140
(6) Building Clusters.
a. Intent. The siting and design of smaller retail stores should complement the appearance of a larger development by visibly reducing the project's scale and by expanding the range of activities and businesses found within a single development. The location, orientation of the entry, and architecture of individual pad or building clusters provide opportunities to frame entries into larger developments and contribute to the development's visual interest by placing storefront spaces closer to the street and creating and reinforcing a streetscape. Structures should be architecturally compatible with the main buildings on a commercial site. The layout of buildings shall relate directly to the public street and surroundings (outward) as well as to the main center (inward). Specific siting decisions including focal points and site amenities shall create a “sense of place” and arrival into the commercial center.
b. Siting Guidelines and Standards. The number, location, and design of independent pad sites shall reinforce, rather than obscure, the identity and function of a commercial development, especially in Large Commercial Centers. Pad site building clusters shall be placed on the site in groupings to create and define street edges and entry points or to enclose and create interesting places between buildings. Even dispersal of pad sites in a widely-spaced pattern within the development, even if along the street edge(s), is unacceptable. Pad
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 141
sites shall be clustered together to define street edges and entry points to enclose and create interesting places between buildings
c. Building Design. Commercial buildings on pad sites within or adjacent to existing shopping centers shall incorporate the same materials and colors as those on the primary commercial building(s) in the development or center, and surrounding community.
i. Standardized or corporate franchise buildings designs or architecture are unacceptable.
ii. Pad site building entrances are appropriate locations to express individual building character or identity. Customer entrances shall be emphasized through incorporation of a building recess, projection, canopy, or similar design element.
(7) Site Amenities.
a. Intent. Site amenities and pedestrian-scale features (e.g., outdoor plazas, street furniture, statuary, sidewalk cafes) in commercial developments offer attractive spaces for customer and visitor interaction and can act as transitional areas between commercial and residential components in a mixed use development. The use of site amenities can also provide spaces and pedestrian connections between various buildings and diverse uses; can break up expanses of parking; enhance the overall development quality; and contribute to the character of an area.
b. General Guideline. Site amenities and gathering places can vary widely in size, in type, and in degree of amenity. Buildings, trees, walls, topography, and other site features within a commercial development should be oriented and arranged to pedestrian activity within and to the development; it can create gathering places and lend a human scale to an otherwise difficult environment.
c. Standards for Site Amenities.
i. Minimum Area Devoted to Site Amenities. One-half of one percent (0.5) of gross floor areas of new construction shall be provided as physical and environmental amenities to be developed and incorporated with any commercial development. In no case shall area devoted to amenities be less than 500 square feet.
ii. Allowed Site Amenities. Site amenities may consist of any of the following:
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 142
(a) Patio or plaza with seating area;
(b) Squares, or greens;
(c) Pedestrian walkways or greenways;
(d) Water features;
(e) Public art or sculpture; or
(f) Any other similar, deliberately shaped area and/or focal feature that, in the Town’s judgment, adequately enhances such development or serves as a gathering place.
iii. Aggregation Allowed. In larger commercial developments containing more than one building, the required area may be aggregated into one or more larger spaces, provided such space is within easy walking distance of the major tenant(s) of the development.
d. Design Requirements.
i. All site amenities within a commercial development shall be an integral part of the overall design and within easy walking distance of major buildings, major tenants, and public roads.
ii. Any such amenity/area shall have direct access to a public sidewalk and/or bicycle network.
iii. The amenity/area shall be constructed of materials that are similar in quality to the principal materials of the primary buildings and landscape.
(8) Relationship to surrounding development. When commercial development is located adjacent to, or in proximity to residential use(s), the use of alternative transitions, including architectural transitions such as reducing the scale of commercial building mass next to residential uses and at least some front-to-front building orientations, and development of less intense land uses between commercial and single-family residential areas, such as lower-intensity office, civic/open space, or multi-family land uses may be required. Landscaped buffers, walls, and fences are used only when these other alternative transitions are not effective, not possible, or not desirable given
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 143
prevailing development patterns in a specific area. Transitions may be required in the following situations:
a. Changes in use between adjoining properties, especially from commercial to residential;
b. Changes in intensity of use between adjoining properties, such as from Large Commercial Centers to multi-family residential; and
c. Views or activities on the commercial development site that could be a nuisance for neighbors, such as commercial loading and service areas.
d. When a transition is required, an applicant shall incorporate the following architectural techniques to the maximum extent practicable, to ensure compatibility with surrounding development, including adjacent residential development:
i. Use similar building setback.
ii. Use similar building height.
iii. Use similar roof form.
iv. Mitigate the larger mass of commercial buildings with façade articulation (see Building Massing and Façade Treatment, below).
v. Use front-to-front building orientations, especially with commercial uses that are pedestrian-intensive (e.g., restaurants, banks).
(9) Commercial building Design.
a. New commercial buildings may be either traditional in their architectural character or be a contemporary expression of traditional styles and forms, respecting the scale, proportion, character, and materials of shops in the community. Shop-front design should be based upon historic examples in the area, with large display windows having sills between twelve (12) and eighteen (18) inches above sidewalk level and lintels nine (9) to twelve (12) feet above sidewalk level. Commercial buildings should also articulate the line between the ground and upper levels with a cornice, canopy, balcony, arcade, or other visual device.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 144
b. The massing of larger commercial buildings should be de-emphasized in a variety of ways, including the use of projecting and recessed sections, to reduce their apparent overall bulk and volume. Such breaks in their facades and roof lines should occur not more frequently than the width of two historic shop-fronts (generally about twenty-five (25) feet each), nor less frequently than one hundred (100) feet. To harmonize with the traditional scale of commercial buildings in historic towns and villages, new commercial buildings should not contain more than 5,000 square feet (above grade), and those with more than 2,000 square feet of floor space (above grade) should be of at least one and-one-half-story construction.
c. Buildings should be topped with pitched roofs with overhanging eaves, but flat roofs with articulated parapets and cornices may be allowed. Desired materials on pitched roofs include slate (either natural or manmade), shingle (either wood or asphalt composition), and metal formed to resemble "standing seams." Roof color should be traditional, meaning that it should be within the range of colors found on existing buildings in the community. Specifically excluded are white, tan, or blue shingles, red clay tiles, and corrugated metal. The use of fascias, dormers, and gables is encouraged to provide visual interest.
d. Gas station canopies should have pitched roofs and the lighting should be from luminaries completely recessed into the ceilings of said canopies, so that the lighting elements themselves are not visible from or beyond the lot lines.
e. Exterior wall materials may include, wood clapboard (including vinyl or aluminum imitation clapboard siding), or brick of a shape, color, and texture very similar to that found in the historic villages and towns in Kent County. Specifically prohibited should be "T-111" plywood siding. Except on rear walls, all forms of concrete block should also be prohibited. In addition, metal buildings should also be prohibited.
f. Large work area doors or open bays shall not open toward or face the public ways.
g. HVAC and other fixed operating machinery shall be either screened from view or located so that such items are not visible from the highway, public rights-of-way, or adjoining non-commercial areas. Large trash receptacles, dumpsters, utility meters, and above ground tanks, etc., shall be similarly treated.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 145
h. Traditional canvas awnings without interior illumination are encouraged, and all signs should be of wood or metal, preferably with dark background colors and light-colored lettering.
i. Storefront buildings should have at least sixty percent (60%) of their front facade coincident with their street frontage, including frontage onto courtyards.
j. Principal entrances to buildings should be from the front sidewalk, except in courtyard designs.
k. In order to break up vast expanses of single element building elevations, building design shall include a combination of architectural elements and features including but not limited to offsets, windows, entry porticos or arcades.
NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL
NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL
(C-3 District)
The following design guidelines shall be implemented throughout the Neighborhood Commercial District in order to create a cohesive, attractive appearance that is inviting and pedestrian-friendly, and which encourages travel by foot, bicycling, in addition to traditional automobile transport.
A. Building design.
(1) Structures in the Zone shall incorporate unified architectural styles or motifs, which shall establish an identifiable architectural character. Building designs, including designs for accessory structures, shall be complementary throughout the development in terms of:
a. Consistency of roof and siding materials and colors;
b. Similar window and door patterns;
c. Similar streetscapes including landscaping, light fixtures, and similar site amenities; and
d. Height, size, bulk, and arrangement of buildings on a development site.
(2) In order to provide differentiation between the ground floor and upper stories, building design shall include bays or balconies for upper levels, and awnings, canopies, or other similar treatments for lower levels. Variation in building materials, trim, paint, ornamentation, windows, or other features such as public art, may also be used.
(3) When located adjacent to sites that reflect a unified architectural style the architectural design of buildings shall complement buildings on the adjacent site.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 146
(4) When not located adjacent to sites that reflect a unified architectural style, the architectural design of buildings shall utilize vernacular architectural features and characteristics commonly found in the Town’s historic district.
(5) Building Facades. Facades that face public streets, adjacent development, or connecting pedestrian frontage should be subdivided and proportioned using features such as windows, entrances, arcades, arbors, and awnings along no less than eighty percent (80%) of the facade. A minimum of sixty percent (60%) of the facade should be composed of transparent materials, unless the Planning Commission finds that such transparency would be inconsistent with the operational requirements of the building. At least one-half of this amount should be provided so that the lowest edge of the transparent material is no higher than four (4) feet above the street level.
(6) Customer Entrances. Building facades facing a primary access street should have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances that include features such as the following:
a. Canopies or porticos;
b. Overhangs, recesses/projections;
c. Arcades;
d. Raised corniced parapets over the door;
e. Distinctive roof forms;
f. Arches, outdoor patios;
g. Display windows; and/or
h. Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas and/or places for sitting.
B. Width and Facade.
(1) A new or altered building housing commercial use should be located near the street and, when applicable, should reflect the characteristic rhythm of surrounding facades or storefronts found in the Downtown area. The mass of the facade of a new building shall be divided into smaller elements with size and proportions similar to those of adjoining and nearby structures, including where appropriate those structures across the street, and shall be consistent with the development and redevelopment goals of the district A minimum of three (3) percent of a lot width should remain open as side yards. Proper fire protection standards should be adhered too.
(2) Proportion. A new or altered building shall respect the characteristic proportion of existing facades of adjoining uses and structures and be consistent with the development or redevelopment goals of the district.
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 147
a. The building facade should incorporate wall plane projections or recesses break-up the overall wall into smaller, appropriately scaled sections.
b. Each building facade should have a repeating pattern that includes instances of either; (1) color change, (2) texture changes, (3) material module change, or (4) expression of an architectural or structural bay through a change in plane, such as an offset, reveal, or projecting rib.
c. The above guidelines may be waived if the applicant can demonstrate an alternative building design that significantly articulates a wall plane.
(3) Mass. The mass of buildings shall complement the size and proportions of the predominant features on the block on which it is located. The primary mass of structures should include secondary projections that reduce the apparent scale, creates visual interest, and promotes compatibility with adjacent uses.
(4) Relationship to Street. A new or altered facade shall have a close relationship to the street even if not compatible with those of adjoining and nearby buildings. Building setbacks are too be adjusted to meet the set back established by the streetscape. When development or re-development cannot bring buildings close to the street, landscape treatments shall be utilized to screen parking located between buildings and the street.
(5) Roof Forms. The type of roof used shall be compatible with the roofs formed on adjacent and nearby buildings or utilize vernacular roof forms commonly found on structures located in the Town Historic District. Pitched roofs and gables are encouraged. Where pitched roofs are not practical from an engineering basis or are not cost effective, false gables and mansards can achieve a similar appearance. Flat roofs with exposed mechanical fixtures should be avoided. For larger structures, variations in rooflines should be required to reduce scale and add visual interest. Roofs for larger structures should have at least two of the following features: overhanging eaves, sloped roofs and three or more roof planes.
(6) Building Facades. Facades that face public streets, adjacent development, or connecting pedestrian frontage should be subdivided and proportioned using features such as windows, entrances, arcades, arbors, and awnings along no less than eighty percent (80%) of the facade. A minimum of sixty percent (60%) of the facade should be composed of transparent materials, unless the Planning Commission finds that such transparency would be inconsistent with the operational requirements of the building. At least one-half of this amount should be provided so that the lowest edge of the transparent material is no higher than 4 feet above the street level.
(7) Customer Entrances. Building facades facing a primary access street should have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances that include features as the following:
a. Canopies or porticos;
b. Overhangs, recesses/projections;
c. Arcades;
Design Manual – February 13, 2012 Page 148
d. Raised corniced parapets over the door;
e. Distinctive roof forms;
f. Arches, outdoor patios;
g. Display windows; or
h. Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas and/or places for sitting.
C. Building Groups.
(1) Buildings should be arranged in a manner that creates a sense of enclosure and defined space. A site’s buildings should be arranged so that they help to frame and define the fronting streets, as well as any internal streets of site, giving deliberate form to streets and sidewalk areas.
(2) Where possible, it is recommended that buildings on the site be arranged so that a sufficient number of the site’s buildings or portion of the site’s aggregate building mass has an orientation towards the fronting arterial(s) street, and are located in relatively close relation to those fronting arterial(s)/street(s), so as to effectively frame and define the fronting streets and the pedestrian realm along those streets.
(3) New buildings within the C-3 district should not be separated from fronting streets by large parking lots.
(4) At a minimum, sensitive placement of buildings along the opposite sides of the street can be used to help define the streetscape, and bring the two focus or support areas in closer relation to each other. In such cases, the buildings should also be located in close relation to the street and to each other, and in a common alignment.
(5) All buildings should be in close physical proximity (to the extent allowed by site topography), well-connected by pedestrian sidewalks, walkways, arcades, or colonnades, and not separated from one another by large parking areas. One should not have to walk in and along parking aisles or roadways to get from any one building to another.
(6) Buildings that do not occupy the street front should be designed so that they are oriented towards the fronting streets, and have a relation and orientation with the rest of the development. Such buildings should also be connected to and served from internal drives
(7) The design of buildings and sites should be integrated into the overall design of the proposed development. All buildings should have architectural, design, and pedestrian connections strongly linking them with rest of the development. For example, covered pedestrian walkways linking buildings with the main commercial street front building could provide a strong design connection.
