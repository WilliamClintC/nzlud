herein.
Notwithstanding Subsection A of this section, where a tract, parcel, or

Notification of violation. When it is believed that a motor vehicle is
being kept on property within the Town of Sykesville in violation of
this chapter, notice shall be given by posting same on the vehicle in
question, or by delivery to any dwelling home or occupied building on
the property in question, which notice shall be effective on the date

The owner of the vehicle in question, or the property owner, shall
have 10 days from the effective date of notice to remove the vehicle
in question, or to apply to the Zoning Administrator for a vehicleunder-
repair permit.

does not require a permit for a vehicle under repair, as provided
in this chapter, the owner shall, within the ten-day period, provide
satisfactory evidence of same to the Zoning Administrator.

violation, if the vehicle is merely moved to another location within the
Town limits.
C.
Owner of property presumed responsible. For the purposes of
enforcement of this chapter, it is presumed, in the absence of clear
convincing evidence to the contrary, that the owner of property upon
which a motor vehicle is kept has knowledge of the presence of the
vehicle on said property. Where the owner of property is aware of
the presence of the motor vehicle upon his property, it is conclusively
presumed that the vehicle is being kept on said property with the
permission and acquiescence of the property owner. Both the owner of
property and the owner of the vehicle are responsible for violations of
this chapter.

§ 169-7. Violations and penalties.
Chapter 174

chapter existing on, prior to or subsequent to the date of the notice.
Removal of vehicles by Town.
Any time after the expiration of 10 days after notice of violation
of this chapter, the Town may take possession of and remove any
vehicle in violation of this chapter. Such vehicle is forfeit, and
becomes the property of the Town of Sykesville which may dispose
of same in any manner deemed reasonable.
(1)
Proceeds of disposition. If the disposition of the vehicle results in
monetary proceeds, said proceeds shall be applied first to the cost
of removal and disposal of the vehicle. Disposition of any proceeds
in excess of the costs of removal and disposal of the vehicle shall
be determined by the Town Council, which may return such excess
proceeds to the owner or retain same in the Town treasury.
(2)
F.

separate offense, and shall be punishable by a fine of $25 for each day
after the 10 days that the vehicle remains on property within the Town
of Sykesville.
B.
All fines levied hereunder and all charges and expenses which may
be assessed for violation of this chapter shall constitute a lien on real
property of the violator within the Town of Sykesville, and may be
collected and enforced in the same manner as delinquent property or
other taxes.
C.
Subordination to state law. In the event that the laws of the State
of Maryland require a lesser penalty, or prohibit imposition of the
penalties herein provided for violation of a municipal ordinance, then
the penalties for violation of this chapter shall be the maximum
permitted by state law.
D.
Independent provisions. In the event that it be determined in any court
of law or otherwise that any individual provision or subsection of this
chapter is invalid or unenforceable, this shall not be deemed to affect
any other provisions of this chapter, which shall remain in full force and
effect.

If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
building, structure or premises may, with approval of the Board, be
changed to another nonconforming use which in the opinion of the
Board is of the same or a more appropriate use or classification. In
the case of a nonconforming junkyard operation, the Board may, based
on specific findings of fact, decide upon an application filed by the
landowner as to whether a relocation of a nonconforming junkyard
operation, either in whole or in part, to another location on the
immediate property or to a location on an adjoining property
constitutes a suitable substitution of use which has substantially less
adverse impact to the general public and adjoining or confronting

A.
The owner of the property so affected shall, following the expiration
time of such written notice, have the right to appeal to the Board the
refusal of a zoning certificate, and the Board may give approval to
build if it should find, after public hearing, and upon the evidence and

use of land, and will achieve the following objectives:
The creation of common space within new residential
developments;
(1)
The maintenance and/or enhancement of the appearance,
character, and natural beauty of an area;
(2)
The protection of the local ecology and the quality and quantity of
underground and surface water and the preservation of stands of
trees and the natural landscape;
(3)
The protection of scenic vistas from the Town's roadways and other
places, such as homesites, hillsides, landmarks, and parks;
(4)
The preservation of the Town's traditional character and creation
of a physical connection with the rest of the Town;
(5)
The facilitation of the construction and maintenance of streets,
utilities, and public services in a more economical and efficient
manner, resulting in a reduced cost of providing public services and
infrastructure;
(6)
(7) The encouragement of a less sprawling form of development.
Applicability.

to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens
of the Town by regulating the appropriate use of land in all areas
of the Town and to encourage the placement and use of structures
and use of land more in keeping with neo-traditional small town
planning concepts. The regulations provided in this section
constitute overlay zoning regulations, and are in addition to and
not in lieu of all zoning regulations applicable to the underlying
zoning district of the property. In the event of any conflict between
the zoning regulations in the underlying zoning district and these
overlay zoning regulations, these overlay zoning regulations shall
control, unless such requirement is waived pursuant to the
provisions of Subsection C(4) by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
(1)
The regulations provided in this section shall apply to the proposed
development of all lands, buildings, and properties within the
territorial limits of the Town of Sykesville where the primary use
is intended to be residential single-family detached and attached
dwelling units. The Planning and Zoning Commission will require
(2)
C.
§ 180-90 SYKESVILLE CODE § 180-90
176:266
that the provisions of this section be utilized in any tract or parcel
of land to achieve the purposes and objectives of Subsection B,
except: (a) when the tract or parcel of land will be developed
in accordance with § 180-93, as a planned unit development; (b)
when the tract or parcel of land is exempted from the regulations
provided in this section by the Planning and Zoning Commission
in accordance with the provisions of Subsection C(4) below; or
(c) when the tract or parcel of land is otherwise grandfathered
in accordance with the provisions of Subsection C(5) below.
Determination of the applicability of this section shall be made at
the time of sketch plan application and approval by the Planning
and Zoning Commission. [Amended 4-12-2004 by Ord. No. 244]
The overlay zoning regulations of this section shall also apply to the
redevelopment of any property within the boundaries of the Town
where the primary use is intended to be single-family detached and
attached dwelling units. "Redevelopment," as used herein, means
the process of substantially altering previously developed property
by the improvement or alteration, such as, by way of example only,
changing the lot lines, front, side, or rear yard areas, the building
envelope, increasing the total impervious surfaces on the property
by more than 25%, or otherwise altering the property in a manner
that increases the assessed value of the property by more than
50%. In the event of redevelopment, the land being redeveloped
shall be subject to these overlay zoning regulations. [Amended
4-12-2004 by Ord. No. 244]
(3)
Exemption. If the owner/applicant presents evidence satisfactory
to the Planning and Zoning Commission that the objectives of
Subsection B would be better satisfied by compliance with the
requirements of the underlying zoning, then the applicant may
be exempted by the Planning and Zoning Commission from
compliance with this section. [Amended 4-12-2004 by Ord. No.
244]
(4)
Grandfathered properties.
"Grandfathered," as used in this section, describes the status
accorded certain properties and development activities that
are exempt from the application of the overlay zoning
regulations as provided in this section.
(a)
Any lot on which development activities have legally
progressed to the point of pouring foundation footings or the
installation of structural members, prior to the effective date
of the overlay zoning regulations adopted in this section, will
be permitted to complete construction as per existing
development approvals (e.g., building permit).
(b)
Any legally buildable single lot or parcel of land of record, or
any single lot or parcel of land for which final plat approval has
(c)
(5)
§ 180-90 WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT § 180-90
176:267
been granted prior to the effective date of the overlay zoning
regulations adopted in this section shall be grandfathered and
may be improved or developed in accordance with all other
provisions of this chapter, Chapter 145, Subdivision
Regulations, and other Town ordinances then in effect.
Any lot, or parcel or land, for which preliminary plan approval
has been granted and has not expired, or for which an
extension of preliminary plan approval has been granted by
the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the effective
date of the overlay zoning regulations adopted in this section,
shall be grandfathered and may be improved or developed in
accordance with all other provisions of this chapter, Chapter
145, Subdivision Regulations, and other Town ordinances in
effect prior to the effective date of the overlay zoning
regulations adopted in this section. However, any development
activities on any such lot or parcels of land should comply
insofar as possible with the overlay zoning regulations
provided in this section if the development activity occurs after
the effective date of the overlay zoning regulations adopted
pursuant to this section.
(d)
Standards. The following standards shall apply to all cluster
subdivisions:
Number of dwelling units permitted.
The number of dwelling units shall be determined by the
following procedure:
The gross acreage of the parcel to be subdivided shall
be determined through a survey performed by a licensed
surveyor.
[1]
The interim acreage of the parcel to be subdivided shall
be determined by subtracting from the gross acreage the
total acres of wetlands and one-hundred-year floodplains
which exist on the parcel to be subdivided.
[2]
The net acreage of the parcel to be subdivided shall be
determined by reducing the interim acreage by 15% to
account for acreage which would have been dedicated to
roads and other public improvements under conventional
zoning.
[3]
To determine the total number of dwelling units permitted,
the net acreage shall be multiplied by:
0.34 when the underlying zoning is a C Conservation
District, subject to the restrictions in Subsection D(1)(b)
2 when the underlying zoning is Residence District
R-20,000
[4]
(a)
(1)
D.
§ 180-90 SYKESVILLE CODE § 180-90
176:268

District R-10,000
5 when the underlying zoning is Urban Residence District
R-7,500
5 when the underlying zoning is Local Business District
B-L
5 when the underlying zoning is General Business District
B-G
5 when the underlying zoning is Restricted Industrial
District I-R
The total number of dwelling units permitted shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number.
The resulting product shall be the total number of dwelling
units permitted on the parcel. This figure shall be shown
on the drawings and plans submitted by the applicant for
preliminary plan approval.
[5]
Where the property lies in more than one zoning district, the
permitted number of dwelling units shall be calculated as
above for each district and added to give a total number of
dwelling units. The dwelling units may be clustered in one or
more districts, except that dwelling units shall not be clustered
in a C Conservation District.
(b)
Bonus provision.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may allow and approve
more than the number of dwelling units permitted under
Subsection D(1) above, upon the Planning and Zoning
Commission's determination that the proposed development,
through the quality of its site design and architecture, displays
sensitivity to the purposes of this section. The Planning and
Zoning Commission may require renderings, scale models,
topographical exhibits, description of housing types, and
material selection. The following amenities and characteristics
shall serve as guidance for determination of the bonus
percentage to be allowed:
[1] No culs-de-sac in the subdivision: bonus of 2%.
Parking facilities are provided behind all dwelling units:
bonus of 2%.
[2]
If a stormwater management pond is used, the ratio is
restricted to 6:1 maximum: bonus of 2%.
[3]
[4] No roofline ratios are less than 12:10: bonus of 2%.
[5] Detached garages are used exclusively: bonus of 2%.
(a)
(2)
§ 180-90 WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT § 180-90
176:269
Copper or tin roofs are used on at least 20% of the
dwelling units: bonus of 2%.
[6]
[7] All front porches are deeper than six feet: bonus of 2%.
Horizontal wood siding is used on at least 80% of the
dwelling units: bonus of 2%.
[8]
Fifty percent more than the minimum quantity required of
specimen trees greater than three inches caliper width are
included in the subdivision design: bonus of 2%.
[9]
The aggregate density bonus over the permitted number of
dwelling units calculated in accordance with Subsection D(1)
above, shall not exceed 10% of the total permitted under
Subsection D(1) above.
(b)
Design guidelines. In evaluating the sketch plan, preliminary plan or
final plan of a cluster subdivision, the following criteria are among
the matters that must be considered by the Planning and Zoning
Commission to find that the site design meets the purposes of this
section:
Location of building envelopes and landscaping.
Building envelopes should be selected that do not include the
tops of ridgelines.
(a)
Building envelopes should be located on the edges of fields
and/or on the edges of wooded areas to minimize the visual
impact of development.
(b)
Building envelopes should not include areas with slopes in
excess of 25%.
(c)
(d) Existing stone rows and tree lines should be preserved.
(e) Trees on ridges should not be removed.
(1)
Lot lines and yards.
All dwellings and structures shall be located a minimum of
50 feet from any adjacent C Conservation District and/or any
agriculturally zoned land.
(a)
No building envelope shall be placed closer than five feet
to any lot line, except single-family attached dwelling units
may be built side by side. Zero lot line dwelling units may
be built four feet from any other lot line, however, a five-foot
easement for access to and maintenance of the dwelling must
be provided. If new dwelling units are positioned immediately
adjacent to existing dwelling units, the size of the side yard
setbacks for the new dwelling units should follow the pattern
established by the already-existing dwelling units.
(b)
(2)
E.
§ 180-90 SYKESVILLE CODE § 180-90
176:270
The maximum average of all front yard setbacks should be
no greater than 20 feet. If new dwelling units are positioned
on lots to be immediately adjacent to existing dwelling units,
the size of the front yard setbacks for the new dwelling units
should follow the pattern established by the already-existing
dwelling units. The front yard setback shall be measured from
the edge of the nearest right-of-way.
(c)
(d) Flag lots are prohibited.
All sidewalks should be placed with the eventual goal of linking
the cluster subdivision to the downtown areas of the Town.
(e)
Public roads. The amount of site disruption caused by roadways
and the associated grading required for their construction should
be minimized.
All roads shall connect with other roads within the cluster
subdivision and roads must be placed to link in a grid pattern
to facilitate neighborhood blocks, unless the applicant presents
evidence satisfactory to the Planning and Zoning Commission
that it is not possible for all roads to connect or to be placed in
a grid pattern. The use of alleys to provide rear access to lots
fronting on public roads is permitted.
(a)
The use of one-way streets, with on-street parking restricted to
one side only, should be considered where feasible.
(b)
Individual road widths shall be determined by the topography,
use, and traffic pattern anticipated for each road. The
minimum roadway width for alleys connecting the rear access
of lots fronting on public roads shall be 12 feet. The minimum
roadway width for all other roads shall be:

The perimeter of blocks within the subdivision should not
exceed 1,300 feet. No block face should be greater than 300
feet without an alley providing through access.
(d)
Roadways should generally follow existing contours of the land
to minimize grading.
(e)
Driveways.
The number of driveways accessing collector roads should be
kept to a minimum. The use of alleys to enhance traffic flow
should be considered where feasible.
(a)
In general, the use of common driveways is discouraged.
However, where common driveways are approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the maximum number of
units served by a common driveway shall be two. The minimum
common driveway width shall be 12 feet.
(b)
All lots using common driveways shall provide a driveway
maintenance agreement to be reviewed and approved by the
Town Attorney.
(c)
All driveways shall be designed to provide facilities for offstreet
parking of not less than two motor vehicles per dwelling
unit.
(d)
(4)
Signage and lighting. In general, permanent on-site development
identification signs are discouraged. However, where a
development identification sign is approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, its area shall be limited to eight square feet,
its construction shall be of natural materials (i.e., wood and stone),
and the base area shall be appropriately landscaped. Lighting, if
provided, shall be shielded and appropriately screened by natural
landscaping.
(5)
Accessory buildings and structures. Accessory buildings and
structures shall be located on the interior of the lot within all
setback lines.
(6)
Existing structures.
When a parcel to be subdivided under this section contains
existing structure(s), the owner/applicant of the parcel shall
request of the Sykesville Historical Commission an advisory
opinion to survey the parcel to determine any historic,
(a)
(7)
§ 180-90 SYKESVILLE CODE § 180-90
176:272
architectural, or cultural significance of the structure(s). If
significance is established, the owner/applicant must preserve
the structure(s) or offer the structure(s) and minimum lot
size(s) compatible with the underlying zoning to the Town
of Sykesville for the preservation of the historic setting of
the structure(s). If accepted by the Town, the lot(s) shall be
included in the common space calculations, and the Planning
and Zoning Commission may recognize such dedication in
consideration of a density bonus under Subsection D(2),
considering all other factors.
Adaptive reuse of structures not deemed to be of historic,
architectural, or cultural significance by the Sykesville
Historical Commission, including the adaptive reuse of existing
agricultural structures such as barns and silos, for residential
use or permitted accessory use, is encouraged and shall be
permitted where determined to be appropriate by the Planning
and Zoning Commission, upon advice of the Town Engineer. If
adaptive reuse as described above is used in the subdivision
design, minimum lot size(s) compatible with the underlying
zoning shall be created for the adapted reused structures and
offered to the Town of Sykesville for preservation. If accepted
by the Town, the lot(s) shall be used in the common space
calculations, and the Planning and Zoning Commission may
recognize such dedication in consideration of a density bonus
under Subsection D(2), considering all other factors.
(b)
Wildlife management plan. In projects involving 25 or more acres,
a wildlife management plan shall be submitted. This plan shall
address measures taken to preserve and improve on-site wildlife
habitat. Rare and endangered species habitat protection shall be
addressed, if applicable. Where feasible, wildlife corridors should
be incorporated into development plans.
(8)
Common space.
Standards.
Parcels to be subdivided under this section shall contain
undeveloped portions of the tract dedicated to common space
equal to or greater than 40% of the gross acreage of the parcel
to be subdivided. Lot(s) associated with existing structure(s)
may be included in the land space identified as common space,
but the square footage of the structures shall not be included
in the calculation to meet the total land area required for
common space unless the lot(s) is accepted for preservation by
the Town of Sykesville in accordance with Subsection E(7)(a)
or (b). The bonus density criteria set forth in Subsection D(2)
may be used in lieu of and not in addition to a density bonus, as
a credit towards the common space requirement. The common
space credit towards the common space requirement shall be
(a)
(1)
F.
§ 180-90 WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT § 180-90
176:273
no more than 10%. If the criteria in Subsection D(2) is applied
to the common space credit, no density bonus shall be allowed.
Wetlands and/or watercourses and/or land with slopes in
excess of 25% shall account for no more than 1/3 of the
common space.
(b)
Notwithstanding the above, up to 50% of the common space
may be land covered by water if, in the Planning and Zoning
Commission's judgment, such water body is deemed a site
amenity.
(c)
All dwelling units shall have reasonable access to common
space areas, and the maximum number of lots compatible with
good design should abut the common space.
(d)
If active recreational areas are included in the common space,
they shall be suitably located and adequately screened to
provide and assure privacy and quiet for the neighboring
residents.
(e)
Small areas of subdivision common space scattered throughout
the cluster subdivision shall be avoided. To the extent possible,
a contiguous system of common space shall be achieved by
linking common space areas with pedestrian pathways.
(f)
The pedestrian circulation system shall be designed to assure
that pedestrians can move safely and easily on the site and
between properties and activities within the site and
neighborhood.
(g)
Access shall be provided to each parcel of common space from
one or more streets in the development and shall be contiguous
across proposed rights-of-way.
(h)
Access to the common space shall be delineated by the use of
design elements such as stone walls, woodland paths surfaced
with bark mulch, etc.
(i)
Use of common space.
The common space shall be used for conservation, historic
preservation and education, outdoor education, recreation,
park purposes, agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or for a
combination of those uses. No other uses shall be allowed in
the common space except as provided herein.
(a)
Only 5% of the common space may be subject to or used for
paved areas, bike trails, or pathways or accessory structures
to the dedicated use of the common space. The common space
may be subject to permanent easements for the construction,
maintenance, and repair of roads and utilities servicing the
common space or the cluster subdivision, and sewer or
(b)
(2)
§ 180-90 SYKESVILLE CODE § 180-90
176:274
drainage facilities serving the common space or the cluster
subdivision or adjacent land.
Ownership of common space.
The common space shall be offered in whole to the Town of
Sykesville. Acceptance in whole or in part shall be determined
by the Town Council.
(a)
If acceptance of the common space is denied by the Town
of Sykesville, then the common space shall be conveyed as
follows:
To a corporation or trust such as a condominium or
homeowners' association, the ownership or membership
of which is comprised of the owners of lots or dwelling
units within the cluster subdivision. If such a corporation
or trust is utilized, ownership thereof shall pass with
conveyances of the lots or dwelling units in perpetuity.
Maintenance of the common space and any facilities
located thereon shall be permanently guaranteed by such
corporation or trust. The corporation or trust shall provide
for mandatory assessments to each lot or residential unit
for maintenance expenses. Each such corporation or trust
shall be deemed to have assented to allow the Town to
perform maintenance of the common space and any
facilities located thereon, if the corporation or trust fails to
provide adequate maintenance, and shall grant the Town
an easement over the common space to do so. In any
instance where maintenance is required, unless the
situation is an emergency, the Town shall provide 15 days'
written notice to the corporation or trust as to the need
for maintenance and, if the corporation or trust fails to
complete said work, the Town may perform the work at
the cost and expense of the corporation or trust. The
owner of each lot or residential unit shall be deemed to
have assented to the Town filing a lien against each lot or
residential unit in the development for the full cost of such
maintenance, which liens shall be released upon payment
to the Town of same. Each individual deed, as well as
the deed of trust or articles of incorporation, shall include
provisions to carry these provisions into effect. Documents
creating such trust or corporation shall be submitted to
the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the Town Attorney
and shall be recorded in accordance with all applicable
state and local laws governing such entities as a condition
of the Planning and Zoning Commission's final approval.

conservation easement or scenic easement prohibiting
further development or construction of dwelling units on
the property and maintaining the property in perpetuity
for the uses set forth in Subsection F(2).
The owner or other entity may retain the common space
for use or lease for one of the purposes specified in
Subsection F(2), provided that the owner conveys the
development rights of the common space in a conservation
or scenic restriction prohibiting further development of
the property.

Purpose and objectives. Within the limit of these requirements, it is the
purpose of the planned unit development to provide suitable sites for
relatively higher density types of residential structures in areas zoned
R-10,000 and R-7,500 Districts and to permit the optimum amount of
freedom and variety in the design and management of such varying
types of residential structures, including one- and two-family units,
townhouses, and garden apartments within the areas designated. The
following objectives are sought in providing for the planned unit
development:
To provide a more attractive and varied living environment than
would be possible through the strict application of R District
requirements.
(1)
A.
§ 180-92 WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT § 180-93
176:285
To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the
development of land.
(2)
To encourage a more intimate, efficient, and aesthetic use of open
space.
(3)
To encourage variety in the physical development patterns of
residential areas.
(4)
Area. The proposed planned unit development shall normally include a
tract of land not less than 20 acres in an R-10,000 District and 10 acres
in an R-7,500 District. A planned unit development may be considered
on a parcel of land less than 10 acres if it has a common boundary with
an R-7,500 District, but in no case shall a tract of land less than five
acres be considered. Where the acreage in a planned unit development
project is 100 acres or more, the Commission may approve in the
development plan as part of the overall plan a planned business center
in which B-L Business District uses may be located in accordance
with § 180-91; provided, however, that such planned business center is
located in a manner as to be a integral part of the development itself
and not as a means of servicing adjacent areas, or as a basis by which
a business district may be extended to adjacent properties.
B.
Designation of a planned unit development.
Land zoned properly and meeting the minimum requirements may
be designated by the Commission as suitable for a planned unit
development and may be developed by the owner, if he so desires,
according to the requirements and standards herein.
(1)
No land shall be designated as a planned unit development unless
it satisfactorily meets such additional criteria as to suitability for
such a development as may have been adopted by the Commission.
Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to, those enumerated
under §§ 180-19 and 180-94.
(2)
C.
Type and use of structures. Dwelling units may include single-family,
two-family or multifamily structures, based on density requirements,
standards described, nature of adjacent development, and
compensating features of the development plan. The Commission may
also approve places of public assembly, recreational buildings, and
accessory buildings, if primarily for use by persons residing within the
planned unit development, and if located and planned in a manner not
detrimental to adjacent properties.
D.
In any R-7,500 Urban Residence District, the Board of Appeals,
following public hearing, may approve up to 100% of the units in
multifamily structures subject to the following: [Amended 3-13-1978
by Ord. No. 110]
The Planning and Zoning Commission having formally reviewed
and filed with the Board of Appeals its preliminary approval of the
(1)
E.
§ 180-93 SYKESVILLE CODE § 180-93
176:286
proposed site and/or subdivision development plan for the property
to be the subject of public hearing;
Due consideration being given by the Board of Appeals to the
requirements of § 180-109 of this chapter; and
(2)
That the final site development plan and/or subdivision plat be
submitted to the Commission for its approval along with any public
works agreement prior to the issuance of any zoning certificate or
building permits.
(3)
The gross residential density of a planned unit development shall not
exceed the equivalent of six dwelling units per gross acre.
Such density shall be calculated as follows, as applicable to
multifamily structures:
Each efficiency apartment dwelling unit is equivalent to 0.50
unit.
(a)
Each one-bedroom multifamily or apartment unit is equivalent
to 0.75 unit.
(b)
Each two-bedroom multifamily or apartment dwelling unit is
equivalent to 1.00 unit
(c)
Each three-bedroom multifamily or apartment dwelling unit is
equivalent to 1.50 unit.
(d)
(1)
Calculation of gross acreage shall include all land within the PUD
tract, regardless of use, and if it abuts an external motorway to
which access is permitted, may include 1/2 of the right-of-way
thereof, but not exceeding 30 feet.
(2)
F.
Open space. Common open space shall comprise not less than 25%
of the gross area. Such space shall include land area to be developed
as recreational areas or which is designated for the common use of
all occupants of the planned unit development, but shall not include
streets, off-street parking areas, or utility easements. The Commission
must be furnished satisfactory evidence, as a condition for approval,
that such open space area will be continued and that perpetual
maintenance is provided for.
G.
Sanitary facilities. Prior to accepting for approval a development for
a planned unit development, the Commission must be furnished
satisfactory evidence that public water and sewerage systems will be
provided and approved by the Health Department, as well as by any
other agency having jurisdiction over such matters.
H.
Development plan.
Applications for approval of a planned unit development must be
accompanied by a development plan prepared by a licensed
(1)
I.
§ 180-93 WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT § 180-93
176:287
architect, registered civil engineer, professional landscape
architect or other qualified land planner. The development plan
shall be to scale and contain sufficient information to establish the
identity of proposed uses, grades, and approximate dimensions and
locations of proposed structures, streets, parking areas, walkways,
easements and property lines.
After approval of the development plan by the Commission, any
material change therein shall require a resubdivision of such plan
for approval. In any case, where an approval has been given by
the Commission and construction has not started within one year
thereafter, such approval of the planned unit development shall
automatically be terminated.
(2)
Standards for location of dwelling types.
Within 100 feet of any other property in an R District, other than
an R-7,500 District, dwellings shall be of single-family types.
(1)
As a condition for approval of a planned unit development in which
multifamily dwellings are proposed, the Commission shall require
over and above other standards herein, that these uses be so
arranged and distributed, and appropriately related to public open
space, single-family dwellings and/or semidetached dwellings that
higher densities are not unreasonably and disproportionately
concentrated in these locations, or so located as to concentrate
traffic on minor residential streets.
(2)
J.
Area requirements, yards and dwelling units per building. Standards
shall be as follows:47
K.
Height regulations. Maximum heights of buildings shall not exceed the
height as specified in the R-7,500 District.
L.
Parking. At least two usable off-street parking spaces shall be provided
for each dwelling unit either on the lot it occupies or within 150 feet of
such lot or an apartment dwelling unit. For each apartment unit, space
shall be provided at the rate of two spaces per dwelling unit.
M.
Public hearing. Except as provided in Article XIX, no public hearing
need be held on any application for a planned unit development,
provided that a public hearing may be held by the Commission when it
deems such hearing to be desirable or necessary in the public interest.
N.
Financial responsibility. Prior to accepting a development plan for
review, the Commission must be satisfied that the owners of and/
or applicants for a planned unit development are financially able to
complete the proposed development, that they intend to start
construction within one year following the Commission's approval and

§ 180-93 SYKESVILLE CODE § 180-93
176:288
§ 180-94. Planned major subdivision; residential, regulations.
A major subdivision of land for residential purposes in those districts where
permitted may be approved by the Commission, as authorized in
§§ 180-25E, 180-32C and 180-40C, subject to § 180-19 of the general
provisions of this chapter, and the following provisions:
that they intend to complete it within a reasonable time as determined
by the Commission.
Purpose and intent. The Commission finds that a portion of the police
power of the State of Maryland has been delegated to each municipality
to be exercised reasonably in determining the manner and nature of
development within each municipality. The Maryland General Assembly
has given much discretion to the several municipalities in making such
determinations relying on the local jurisdiction's knowledge of local
conditions and the needs of its people and communities. The Maryland
General Assembly has further created numerous state departments
and agencies to provide consultation, advice, data and other similar
forms of assistance in the furtherance of establishing comprehensive
policies on which to base local planning decisions for the general
good and welfare. Development pressures (i.e., population shifts, sewer
moratoriums, accelerating inflation of land values, and other
phenomena), caused by a myriad of complex social and economic
factors which transcend local jurisdictional boundary lines, are
bringing increasing numbers of families into Sykesville and its environs
necessitating the provision of additional public schools; solid waste
disposal sites; water, sewerage and storm drainage facilities; roads
and associated facilities; police, fire and related emergency-servicetype
facilities; primary health care facilities; open space, floodplain
management and sediment control measures; and the increasing need
for maintaining a stable tax base. In recognition of the fundamental
difference between the diverse and unlimited "wants" of a growing
community of people, and those "needs" which are inherently basic or
limited (i.e., land, air and water resources), it is imperative that plans,
policies and decisions, insofar as it is humanly possible, be weighed
and ordered; first, in consideration of the fundamental "needs", and
secondly, in consideration of the priority of "wants" which ultimately
involve the direct or indirect expenditure of limited public funds.
A.
The following provisions, therefore, are set forth in planning for the
continued orderly development of Sykesville and its environs in the
pursuit of these objectives: In designating a tract(s) or area(s) suitable
for a major subdivision of land for residential purposes in any district
where permitted, the Commission shall, pursuant to authority granted
by Article 66B, Annotated Code of Maryland, this Chapter 180, Zoning,
and Chapter 145, Subdivision Regulations, in addition to any other
applicable ordinances or regulations, require that adequate
provision(s) be incorporated in and made a part of any conditions of
any approval to insure the integrity and orderly use of the Town's

[Added 7-20-1984 by Ord. No. 137]
natural resources as would promote the public necessity, health, safety,
convenience, general welfare, environment, and the Town's financial
ability to provide and/or receive essential community improvements,
facilities and/or services. Such conditions of approval may include, and
insure adequate provisions for such specific on- and off-site facilities
and improvements as: school sites; solid waste disposal sites; open
spaces; floodplain management and sediment control measures; water,
sewerage and storm drainage facilities; roads and associated facilities;
police, fire and related emergency-type facilities including
consideration of primary health care facilities. Whenever any one or
combination of the aforesaid facilities and/or improvements are deemed
necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of the duly adopted
official Master Plan for Sykesville and the authority conveyed by Article
66B of the Annotated Code of Maryland, this Chapter 180, Zoning,
Chapter 145, Subdivision Regulations, or any other applicable
ordinances or regulations; and where any one or combination of the
aforesaid facilities and/or improvements deemed necessary cannot be
provided or assured, then the Commission shall either disapprove or
defer designating those areas in question, in whole or in part, as
suitable for a major subdivision of land for residential purposes until
such time as those specific improvements and/or facilities deemed
necessary can be adequately provided or assured.
The provisions of § 180-94, Subsections A and B shall also apply to
the subdivision of land for residential purposes in Planned Employment
Center Districts. [Added 12-8-2014 by Ord. No. 288]

The purpose of the PEC - Planned Employment Center District is to provide
for logical locations where high-quality mixed use developments can occur
in harmony with surrounding land uses (including site layouts and
architecture that is aesthetically pleasing and consistent with applicable
guidelines) and in support of Sykesville's goals for growing the employment
base, providing housing for existing and future residents, and offering retail
services that complement the existing businesses within the Town. The
following objectives will help fulfill this purpose:
§ 180-135. Applicability.
PEC - Planned Employment Centers are limited to properties that are
in excess of 20 acres and are within 1,320 feet from Maryland Route
32. Any portion of a proposed development application must be within
1,320 feet from Route 32; the entire development parcel does not have to
meet this requirement. The following regulations and applicable regulations
contained in other articles shall apply in the PEC - Planned Employment
Center District.
To encourage orderly, staged development of comprehensively
designed mixed-use centers.
A.
To create a mixture of office, retail, recreational, hotel, institutional,
light industrial and residential uses within a single structure or within
multiple structures where all related structures, parking, and open
spaces are designed to function as a cohesive and integrated site, while
protecting the residential character of surrounding neighborhoods.
B.
To provide for an enriched and enhanced natural environment by the
preservation of trees and the incorporation of stormwater management
techniques which maintain the hydrologic regime of the site.
C.
To assure compatibility of the proposed land uses with the internal
and surrounding uses by incorporating innovative standards of land
planning and site design.
D.
To encourage harmonious and coordinated development of sites,
considering the existing natural features, bicycle, pedestrian and
vehicular circulation and compatibility with surrounding uses.
E.
To encourage development that is of excellent design and architecture

considered residential.
For the purposes of this calculation, the percentage for each land
use shall be based on the total (or gross) development parcel size.

Any land that was previously part of the original development
parcel that was subdivided and dedicated to the Town of Sykesville
can be included in the total development parcel size for
determining both percentage of land use and open space
requirements (i.e., Warfield Park Parcel, and internal public roads).
