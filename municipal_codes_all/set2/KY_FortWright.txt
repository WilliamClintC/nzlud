later, the city may proceed with the improvement or part thereof stayed by
the action, including notice requiring payment of special assessment or
installment thereon and bonds or other method proposed to finance the
improvement.  The first installment may be apportioned so that other
payments will coincide with payment of ad valorem taxes.






   (B)   The amount of any outstanding assessment or installments
thereof on any property, and accrued interest and other charges, constitutes
a lien on the property to secure payment to the bondholders or any other
source of financing of the improvement.  The lien takes precedence over all
other liens, whether created prior to or subsequent to the publication of the
ordinance, except a lien for state and county taxes, general municipal taxes,
and prior improvement taxes, and is not defeated or postponed by any private
or judicial sale, by any mortgage, or by any error or mistake in the
description of the property or in the names of the owners.  No error in the
proceedings of the Council shall exempt any benefited property from the lien
for the improvement assessment, or from payment thereof, or from the
penalties or interest thereon, as herein provided.

through 33.17 applies if additional property is included in the improvement
or if change is made in the method or period of financing; but additional
property may be included in the improvement with the consent of the owner
thereof without compliance with other sections if it does not increase the
cost apportioned to any other property, or any other change may be made
without such compliance if all property owners of the improvement consent.

records, not to exceed three days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays) from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of
the cause is given for further delay and the place, time, and earliest date

§ 34.08  REFUSAL OF UNREASONABLE REQUESTS.

mail copies thereof.  However, refusal under this section must be sustained
by clear and convincing evidence.

under this chapter, shall determine within three (3) days, excepting
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after the receipt of any request

making the request within the three-day period of its decision. Any agency
response denying, in whole or in part, inspection of any record  shall 
include  a statement  of the  specific  exception authorizing the
withholding of the record and a brief explanation of how the exception
applies to the record withheld.  The response shall be issued by the
official custodian or under his authority and shall constitute final agency
action.

under the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882.  Upon the Attorney General's
request, the agency will provide additional documentation.






   (C)   If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney
General reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole
or in part, the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute
appeal proceedings within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory
relief in the circuit court.  In addition, if the Attorney General disallows

   (A)   Upon inspection, the applicant shall have the right to make
abstracts of the public records and memoranda thereof, and to obtain copies
of all public records not exempted by the terms of § 34.16. When copies are
requested, the custodian may require a written request and advance payment of

the records shall duplicate the records or permit the applicant to duplicate
the records; however, the custodian shall ensure that such duplication will
not damage or alter the original records.






   (B)   (1)   Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial
purposes shall be available for copying in either standard electronic or
standard hard copy format, as designated by the party requesting the records,

defined as not less than 8½ inches x 11 inches in at least one color on
white paper, or for electronic format, in a flat file electronic American
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format. If the public
agency maintains electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and
the format conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public record may be
provided in this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified
by the public agency. Any request for a public record in a form other than
the forms described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized
request.





(KRS 61.874(1) - (3))




§ 34.13  FEES FOR COPIES.




   (A)   The public agency may prescribe a reasonable fee for making
copies of nonexempt public records requested for use for noncommercial
purposes which shall not exceed the actual cost of reproduction, including
the costs of the media and any mechanical processing cost incurred by the
public agency, but not including the cost of staff required. If a public
agency is asked to produce a record in a nonstandardized format, or to tailor
the format to meet the request of an individual or a group, the public agency
may at its discretion provide the requested format and recover staff costs as
well as any actual costs incurred.






   (B)   (1)   Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits
the disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for
commercial purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for
commercial purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee.






      (2)   The public agency from which copies of nonexempt public
records are requested for a commercial purpose may require a certified
statement from the requestor stating the commercial purpose for which they
shall be used, and may require the requestor to enter into a contract with
the agency. The contract shall permit use of the public records for the
stated commercial purpose for a specified fee.






      (3)   The fee provided for in division (B)(1) of this section
may be based on one or both of the following:






         (a)   Cost to the public agency of media, mechanical
processing, and staff required to produce a copy of the public record or
records;






         (b)   Cost to the public agency of the creation,
purchase, or other acquisition of the public records.

   It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of a
public record for a:






   (A)   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial purpose, if
a certified statement from the requestor was required by the public agency
pursuant to § 34.13;






   (B)   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows the
use of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or






   (C)   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly allows
the use of the public record for a commercial purpose. A newspaper,
periodical, radio or television station shall not be held to have used or
knowingly allowed the use of the public record for a commercial purpose
merely because of its publication or broadcast, unless it has also given its
express permission for that commercial use.

provided and made available at the discretion of the public agency. If a
party wishes to access public records by electronic means and the public
agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency may require that the
party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement with the agency, and
may charge fees for these agreements.

TRAFFIC-CONTROL DEVICES

traffic-control sign or signs exhibiting the words "Go," "Caution," or
"Stop," or exhibiting different colored lights for purposes of traffic
control, the following colors only shall be used, and these terms and lights
shall indicate and be obeyed as follows:






   (A)  Green alone or "Go": Vehicular traffic facing the signal may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place
prohibits either such turn.  However, vehicular traffic shall yield the
right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection at the time such signal is exhibited.





   (B)  Steady yellow alone or "Caution" when shown following the green
or "Go" signal:  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby
warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red
indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic
shall not enter the intersection.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow
signal may enter and clear the intersection.






   (C)  Red alone or double red or "Stop":  Vehicular traffic facing the
signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or
at such other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall
remain standing until green or "Go" is shown alone.






   (D)  Flashing red alone:  Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall
stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such
other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall not
again proceed until it can do so without danger.






   (E)  Flashing amber alone:  Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall
reduce its speed and proceed cautiously across the intersection controlled by
such signal.






   (F)  "Yield Right-of-Way":  Vehicular traffic facing the "Yield
Right-of-Way" sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering
the primary intersecting or merging right-of-way.  All traffic facing the
sign shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles and pedestrians within such
primary intersecting or merging right-of-way.  No vehicle facing a "Yield
Right-of-Way" sign shall enter the merging or intersecting right-of-way at a
speed in excess of 15 miles per hour, except that this speed limit shall not
apply to vehicles entering an expressway.






   (G)  Lane lights:  When lane lights are installed over any street for
the purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular
traffic shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. 
However, when flashing amber lights appear above a lane all left turns shall
be made from that lane.  Where red arrows appear above such lanes, vehicles
shall not move against them.  If flashing amber lights show above a lane,
that lane shall be used only for passing and for left turns unless a sign at
such place prohibits such turn.

or device which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official
traffic device or railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to
direct the movement of traffic, or which conceals or hides from view or
interferes with the effectiveness of any official control device or any
railroad sign or signal.  No person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit on any street, any traffic sign or signal bearing any
commercial advertising. Nothing in this section shall be construed as
restricting any public department or public utility of the city in any
emergency or temporarily from marking or erecting any traffic barrier or sign
whose placing has been approved by the city.






   (B)  Every such prohibited sign, signal, or marking is declared to be

it to be removed.





Penalty, see § 70.99




§ 70.20  DEVICE TO BE LEGIBLE AND IN PROPER POSITION.




   No provision of this traffic code for which signs or any other
traffic-control device is required shall be enforceable against an alleged
violator if at the time and place of the alleged violation the required
device was not in proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an
ordinarily observant person.




§ 70.21  TEMPORARY DISREGARD OF DEVICES BY POLICE OFFICERS.

GENERAL PROVISIONS




§ 91.01  SIDEWALK POLICY AND CONSTRUCTION MAINTENANCE PLAN.



   (A)   Introduction.




      (1)   This Sidewalk Policy and Construction and Maintenance
Plan ("Policy") shall cover the construction of new sidewalks and the repair
of existing sidewalks that are located in the public right-of-way and that
have been dedicated and accepted by the city for public use.




      (2)   It is the goal of the policy to address the following
sidewalk issues, listed in descending order of importance.




         First:      Repairing severely damaged (hazardous)
sidewalks.




         Second:   Filling in missing short sections between
sidewalks.




         Third:      Filling in large areas without sidewalks.




         Fourth:      Aesthetic considerations.




   (B)   Sidewalk fund. The City Council has approved a capital
projects program fund, which includes an annual budgeted line item earmarked
for the maintenance and construction of sidewalks located in the public
right-of-way. This fund ("the Sidewalk Fund") will be used to purchase
materials, equipment, labor, and professional services necessary to implement
the policy.




   (C)   Sidewalk Committee. A Sidewalk Committee is established under
this policy to oversee the policy. The Sidewalk Committee is comprised of the
Council members appointed to the Community Preservation Committee, the City
Administrative Officer, and the Public Works Director. The Committee will
meet periodically, but at least annually, to review the work schedule and
make recommendations for changes and adjustments whenever necessary.




   (D)   Implementation plan. In order to provide for the efficient and
orderly implementation of the policy, the city is divided into six  sidewalk
districts (see map attached to Ord. 3-2017).




   (E)   Sidewalk inventory and condition assessment.




      (1)   The Public Works Department shall periodically inventory
as many sidewalks as allowed by time and budget, for the purpose of creating
a sidewalk condition index (the "Index").




      (2)   When inventorying sidewalks, the Public Works Department
shall use the following rating system to compile data to form the Index:




         (a)   "Slight Cracking" denotes a crack that is
superficial up to 1/8" in width and/or vertical displacement less than 1/8".
(1 point)




         (b)   "Moderate Cracking" denotes a crack that is
between 1/8" and 1/4" in width and/or slight vertical displacement up to
1/2". (2 points)




         (c)   "Severe Cracking" denotes a crack that is over
1/4" in width and/or has a vertical displacement of 1/2" to 1". (3 points)




         (d)   "Vertical Separation" denotes a section of
sidewalk in which the vertical separation is greater than 1". (5 points)




   (F)   Prioritization Plan.




      (1)   Each district shall be ranked based upon the results of
the sidewalk inventory. Priority will be determined by the highest point
total in the most recent index.




      (2)   Once the Public Works Department has begun work in a
district, it will continue in that district until all sidewalks have been
inspected and the required repairs and replacements have been made.




      (3)   Notwithstanding the above sentence, the Sidewalk
Committee may consider other factors in determining whether an exception to
the general policy is warranted, on a case-by-case basis. These factors
include, but are not limited to: natural disasters, emergencies, or other
extraordinary circumstances, the volume of pedestrian traffic, proximity to
public transportation boarding and drop off points, and proximity to schools.




   (G)   Criteria for sidewalk repair and replacement. Upon inspection,
sidewalks in the prioritized district shall be repaired and/or replaced if
the following conditions exist:




      (1)   Vertical offset at joints larger than one inch.




      (2)   Intersecting cracks in one panel subject to displacement.




      (3)   Settlement in sidewalk larger than four inches in an
eight-foot span.




      (4)   Rough surface due to deterioration of concrete that is
determined hazardous.




   (H)   Sidewalk specifications.




      (1)   All sidewalk repairs, replacement, and construction
shall comply with the Kenton County Subdivision Regulations. This provision
shall apply to any developer who builds sidewalks in residential and
commercial subdivisions.




      (2)   Any sidewalk construction or repair shall be subject to
inspection by the City Public Works Department for compliance with the
abovementioned standards or quality of material and workmanship.




   (I)   Trees and tree roots in the vicinity of sidewalks. In certain
locations trees have been planted in close proximity to sidewalks. Roots of
such trees may have caused severe damage to sidewalks, the repair of which
may require the cutting of these roots. In the event a sidewalk cannot be
repaired or rendered compliant without the removal of the tree, the tree
shall be removed. If such a tree is in the right-of-way, the sidewalk fund
shall pay for the removal. If the tree is on private property, the property
owner shall be responsible for the removal.




   (J)   Damage to sidewalks due to private construction activity or

shall be delivered to that person by postage pre-paid first class U.S. mail
to the address identified in the citation or a different address identified

   In the event that a determination of the Code Enforcement Officer that

continue thereafter, the city shall cause those violations to be abated
through either employees of the city or contracts with others.

all charges and fees incurred by the city in connection with the enforcement
of this chapter, including abatement costs. The lien shall also include
attorneys fees incurred as an additional penalty. The affidavit of the
Code Enforcement Officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount
of the lien and the regularity of the proceedings, and shall be recorded in
the office of the County Clerk. The lien shall be notice to all persons from
the time of its recording and shall bear interest thereafter until paid. The
lien created shall take precedence provided in KRS 65.8840(9). The city shall
possess the lien for ten years following the date of the final,
non-appealable order of the Board or final judgment of the court. The lien

§ 92.11  ABATEMENT PROCEDURE FOR IMMINENTLY DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.



   (A)   Any property condition which the city reasonably determines to
be imminently dangerous to the health and safety of city residents may be
summarily abated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.




   (B)   Actions taken to abate imminently dangerous property
conditions may include, but are not limited to. repair, removal, or
demolition of the condition creating the danger and/or the restriction from
use or occupancy of the property on which the dangerous condition exists or
any other abatement actions determined by the city to be necessary.




   (C)   (1)   Whenever the city determines that summary abatement
is justified by an imminently dangerous condition, circumstance, or
occurrence, the city shall give reasonable notice, not to exceed five
business days, to the property owner as to the nuisance and prior to the
demolition of any unfit or unsafe structure, the property owner shall be
afforded the right to a hearing before the Mayor or his or her designee.




      (2)   If the property owner cannot be located or the owner
fails to take prompt appropriate action to abate the condition, the city may
proceed to take abatement action authorized in this section to the extent
necessary to remedy the immediate danger without further notice or right to a
prior hearing.




   (D)   (1)   Whenever the city takes action to abate imminently
dangerous property conditions, the property owner shall be liable for all
costs of such abatement. Charges for nuisance abatement shall be a lien upon
the premises. Whenever a bill for charges remains unpaid for 14 days after it
has been rendered, the City Clerk/Treasurer may file with the County Clerk a
statement of lien claims. This statement/affidavit shall contain a legal
description of the premises, the expenses and costs incurred, the date the
nuisance was abated, and a notice that the city claims a lien for this
amount. The affidavit of the authorized city officer shall constitute prima
facie evidence of the amount of the lien and the regularity of the
proceedings. The lien shall be notice to all persons from the time of the
recording and shall bear interest at 6% per annum thereafter until paid.
Notice of the lien shall be mailed to the owner of the premises if his or her
address is known. However, failure to record the claim or to mail the notice,
or the failure of the owner to receive the notice, shall not affect the right
to foreclose the lien for charges.




      (2)   The lien shall take precedence over all other liens,
except state, county, school board, and city taxes, and the city may bring a
civil action against the owner and have the same remedies as provided for the
recovery of a debt owed. The citys lien shall include the costs incurred
in all legal actions necessary to foreclose the lien, which costs shall
include reasonable attorneys fees.




   (E)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid imminent danger
abatement charges shall be sold for nonpayment, and the proceeds of the sale
shall be applied to pay the charges after deducting costs, as is the case in
the foreclosure of statutory liens. This foreclosure shall be in equity in
the name of the city.




   (F)   The City Attorney is authorized to institute such proceedings
in the name of the city in any court having jurisdiction over the matter
against any property for which the bill has remained unpaid for 14 days after
it has been rendered, upon direction by the Mayor.

§ 92.21  PROHIBITION.



   (A) Any property within the city that is a chronic nuisance property is
declared a public nuisance, in violation of this subchapter and subject to
the remedies provided herein; and




   (B)   Any person responsible for property who permits property to be
a chronic nuisance property shall be in violation of this subchapter.



(Ord. 07-11, passed 11-2-11)



§ 92.22  ABATEMENT PROCEDURE FOR CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTIES.



   (A)   When the Code Enforcement Officer, or his or her designee(s),
receives documentation or information confirming the occurrence of three or
more nuisance activities within a 90-day period on or at any premises or
property, the Code Enforcement Officer, or his or her designee(s), shall
review such documentation or information to determine whether it describes
the nuisance activities enumerated in this subchapter.  Upon such a finding,
the Code Enforcement Officer, or his or her designee(s), shall warn the
person responsible for such property, in writing, that the property is in
danger of being declared a chronic nuisance property.




   (B)   The warning shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt
requested, and shall contain:




      (1)   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property;




      (2)   A concise description of the nuisance activities that
exist or have occurred on the property;




      (3)   A demand that the person responsible for the property
respond to the notice, within ten days of its service, to discuss the
nuisance activities and create a plan to abate the chronic nuisance;




      (4)   Offer the person responsible an opportunity to abate the
nuisance activities giving rise to the violation; and




      (5)   A statement describing that the property could be
subject to closure and civil penalties and/or costs assessed up to $200 per
day if the property is declared a chronic nuisance property.




   (C)   The Code Enforcement Officer, or his or her designee(s), shall
serve, or cause to be served, the warning and notice to abate upon the person
responsible by certified mail, return receipt requested, or may personally
serve the person responsible in accordance with the procedures set forth in
KRS 65.8825.




   (D)   If the person responsible fails to respond to the warning
within the time prescribed, the Code Enforcement Officer, or his or her
designee(s), shall issue a notice declaring the property to be a chronic
nuisance property, and post such notice at the property and issue the person
responsible a citation for a civil infraction, punishable by a maximum
penalty of $200.  If the personal responsible fails to respond to the
warning, notice or citation, the matter shall be referred for enforcement.




   (E)   If the person responsible responds as required by the notice

agreed-upon course of action that would abate the nuisance activity. If an
agreed-upon course of action does not result in the abatement of the nuisance
activities, or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached, the matter
shall be forwarded to the Code Enforcement Board, or other city enforcement
board or agency and any additional appropriate entity or office, for
appropriate official enforcement action.  Provided, that in the event the
Code of Enforcement Officer, or his or her designee(s), determine that the
person responsible has taken reasonable steps to abate the nuisance activity,
the city shall not commence an enforcement action under this subchapter,
notwithstanding the continuance of the nuisance activity.




   (F)   It is a defense to an action for chronic nuisance property
that the person responsible, at all material times, could not, in spite of
the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to
the determination that the property is chronic nuisance property.

any appropriate citation.  Upon failure of the property owner to request a
hearing before the Fort Wright Nuisance Hearing Board, an order may be issued
condemning and vacating the premises, or portions thereof, to the extent
necessary to abate the chronic nuisance property.  Any close and vacate
order shall be for a period of less than one year from the date of closing
and rescind within 14 days of an abatement.  If the property consists of
multi-unit dwellings, and the nuisance activity has occurred solely within a
single unit, the condemnation and vacate order may be limited to the single
unit.

copy of the order shall be served on the owner of the property in the same
manner as the warning, and shall be conspicuously posted on the property.




   (C)   Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the city from
pursuing additional remedies, including judicial actions provided by statute
or common law, to enjoin or otherwise remedy the chronic nuisance.

§ 92.24  SUMMARY CLOSURE.



   Nothing in this subchapter prohibits the city from taking any emergency
action for the summary closure of such property when it is necessary to avoid
an immediate threat to public welfare and safety.



(Ord. 07-11, passed 11-2-11)



§ 92.25  PENALTY UPON FAILURE TO COMPLY.



   Upon the failure of the property owner to comply with an order to close
and vacate, the Code Enforcement Department may prohibit the furnishing of

heating oil, to the premises by any public utility holding a franchise to use
the streets and public ways of the city; revoke the certificate of occupancy
of the premises; or use any other legal remedy available under the laws of
the state.



(Ord. 07-11, passed 11-2-11)



§ 92.26  RELIEF FROM ORDER.



   The Code Official may vacate or suspend the provisions of an order to
close and vacate upon a showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the
nuisance activity has been abated and will not be maintained or permitted on
the property or a unit thereof.

charges and fees incurred by the city in connection with the enforcement of
this chapter, including abatement costs. The lien shall also include
attorneys' fees incurred as an additional penalty. The affidavit of the Code
Enforcement Officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of
the lien and the regularity of the proceedings, and shall be recorded in the
office of the County Clerk. The lien shall be notice to all person from the
time of its recording and shall bear interest thereafter until paid. The lien
created shall take precedence over all other liens, except state, county,
school board, and city taxes, except as provided in KRS 65.8840(9). The city
shall possess the lien for ten years following the date of the final,
non-appealable order of the Board or final judgment of the court. The lien
may be enforced by judicial proceeding.

§ 93.31  SMOKE DETECTORS REQUIRED.




   (A)  Subject to such exceptions and conditions for compliance as
stated herein, six months after the effective date of this subchapter, smoke
detectors shall be required in all dwellings privately owned or rented for
occupancy.  It shall be the responsibility of the owner of each new or
existing occupied dwelling unit to install smoke detectors in each dwelling
unit as hereinafter provided.  The smoke detectors shall be capable of
sensing visible or invisible particles of combustion and providing a suitable
audible (or visual for the deaf or hearing-impaired) alarm.






   (B)  This subchapter shall apply to any and all dwellings or dwelling
units, new or existing, which do not fall under the jurisdiction of the
currently adopted Kentucky Building Code or the currently adopted Life Safety
Code (LSC 101).





(Ord.  -1985, passed  -  -85)  Penalty, see § 93.99




§ 93.32  TYPE AND PLACEMENT.




   (A)  In order to comply with this subchapter, only ionization or
photoelectric type detectors approved by a nationally-recognized testing
laboratory shall be installed.  As an alternative to self-contained smoke
detectors, under certain limited conditions (i.e., battery-powered smoke
detectors), an approved fire detection system or a combination thereof may be
installed.  The City Fire Inspector may subjectively, and on a case-by-case
basis, approve each and every alternative system in written form.






   (B)  Smoke detectors in new residential dwellings shall be wired
directly (hard wired) to the building's power supply.  In existing
buildings, it is preferred that smoke detectors be wired directly to the
power supply; however, the detectors may be powered by self-monitored battery
or operated by an electrical plug-in outlet which is fitted with a plug
restrainer device, provided that the outlet is not controlled by any switch
other than the main power supply.






   (C)  Smoke detectors shall be placed in accordance with applicable
N.F.P.A. Standards (see § 93.34).  Detectors may be ceiling or wall
mounted, provided that if wall mounted they shall be within 12 inches, but
not closer than six inches, of the ceiling.






   (D)  At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each
sleeping area.  A sleeping area is defined as the area or areas of the
dwelling unit in which the bedrooms (or sleeping rooms) are located.  Where
bedrooms or rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by other used
areas (such as kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets), they
shall be considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this
section.  In a dwelling unit which contains a well-defined sleeping room
separated from the other activity areas of the same unit, the detector shall
be located in the corridor within the unit or interior area giving direct
access to the rooms used for sleeping purposes.  Where sleeping areas are
separated or where a single smoke detector will not adequately service all
sleeping areas, there shall be smoke detectors installed adjacent to each
sleeping area.






   (E)  In a rooming unit, the detector shall be centrally located on the
ceiling.






   (F)  In a dwelling containing two or more dwelling units or any
rooming unit, in addition to the requirements for individual smoke detectors
in each dwelling unit or rooming unit, detectors shall be placed in centrally
located common areas, so that smoke detectors will adequately service all
sleeping areas.





(Ord.  -1985, passed  -  -85)  Penalty, see § 93.99




§ 93.33  INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE.




   (A)  The owner of the dwelling shall be responsible for supplying and
installing in an operable condition the required detectors and for providing
maintenance and testing in an owner- occupied residence; or for providing the
manufacturer's maintenance and testing instructions to a tenant in the case
of rental property.






   (B)  The owner of a dwelling shall be responsible for maintenance and
testing of detectors, in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, which
are located in common areas or detectors in rooming units where the tenant
usually has short periods of occupancy (hotels, motels, rooming or tourist
homes).






   (C)  The tenant shall be responsible for maintaining and testing the
detector, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, which are
within his exclusive control during the life of the tenancy. The tenant shall
be responsible for notifying, in writing, the owner when a detector becomes
inoperable, whereafter the owner has ten days in which to repair or replace
in operable condition the detector.  In the battery-operated type of
detector, battery replacement shall be the responsibility of the tenant.






   (D)  At every change of tenancy, it shall be the duty of the owner to
test and ascertain that those detectors contained in the unit are in operable
condition, and if not, the owner shall be responsible for placing them in
operable condition prior to re-renting the unit.






   (E)  At every change of occupancy of every dwelling unit occasioned by
or incidental to a sale, lease or sub-lease of the unit, it shall be the duty
of the grantor thereof (i.e., the seller, lessor or sub-lessor, as the case
may be) to provide, before occupancy, to the new occupant that all smoke
detectors as required by this section (or other applicable laws) are
installed and in proper working condition.  Failure to comply with this
division shall be punishable as set forth herein; provided, however, that
this division shall not be construed to violate or render void any contract,
lease, or sub-lease subject hereto.






   (F)  No smoke detector or alternative system shall be directly
connected (permanently wired) to the electrical system of a structure without
the proper electrical certification.

   This subchapter is intended to be used with, and supplemented by, the
applicable provisions of the National Fire Protection Standards Nos. 72-E and
74 (current edition) which are hereby incorporated herein; however, if there
shall be any conflict between this subchapter and the supplemental standards,
this subchapter and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall
prevail.  All amendments to or changes in N.F.P.A. Nos. 72-E and 74 shall be
adopted and made part thereof without further reference.

activity within any dwelling unit unless smoke detectors have been installed
and located therein according to the requirements and specifications hereof.

within six months of the effective date of this subchapter, certify in
writing on a form to be provided by the Fire Department, to the Chief of the
Fire Department, compliance with this subchapter. The failure of any owner to
so certify compliance shall give rise to a presumption of noncompliance and
shall be grounds for citing the owner under the penalty section hereof.






   (B)  The presumption of noncompliance may be rebutted by evidence
established during an inspection as provided in § 93.99.

knowingly induces another, directly or indirectly, to violate the provisions
of those sections, shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned for not
more than 30 days, or both.  (KRS 227.990(4))






   (C)  The minimum penalty for noncompliance with §§ 93.30 through
93.36 is $250.  The penalty for noncompliance is automatically waived if the
dwelling unit is brought into compliance with §§ 93.30 through 93.36 within
30 days of the original violation.  The property owner must request an
inspection from the Fire Department to verify compliance and have the waiver
provision applied.  Continued failure to comply may result in a maximum
penalty of $500 or six months in jail.  (Ord.  -1985, passed  -  -85)






   (D)   The penalties for violation of § 93.22 are established as

chapter for an appeal from the denial of that application.

BUSINESS TAXATION



§ 110.25  LEVY AND IMPOSITION.



   For the purpose of providing funds for the general operating expenses
of the city and the municipal services and functions provided thereby, and
subject to the provisions of KRS 67.750 through 67.795, and except as
provided in § 110.28, an occupational license fee is hereby levied and
imposed upon everybody engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation,
profession or other businesses in the city, for the privilege of that
engagement.



(Ord. 10-07, passed 12-05-07)



§ 110.26  RATE.



   The occupational license fee that is levied and imposed by this chapter
is at the rate of:



 



   (A)   Employees. One and fifteen one-hundredths percent (1.15%) of
all compensation earned by an employee for labor, work or services provided
in the city.




   (B)   Those not employees.  0.075% of the taxable gross receipts of
everybody, other than employees, who is engaged in any franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business in the city.




   (C)   The occupational license fee enacted herein will apply only to
taxable compensation that is subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act
(FICA), 26 U.S.C. § 3101 et seq. This FICA-Cap means that wages above
the FICA-Cap are not subject to the provisions of this section.

statutes governing the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, this section
shall comply with all such changes or amendments to the extent required by
law; and any taxable amounts affected by such changes or amendments will be
collected accordingly. If any provision of this section or its application to
any person or circumstance is held invalid because of changes or amendments
to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions that can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application.



(Ord. 10-07, passed 12-05-07; Am. Ord. 15-12, passed 10-3-12)



§ 110.27  APPORTIONMENT OF GROSS RECEIPTS.



   (A)   Pursuant to the authority of KRS 67.753(4), it is hereby
determined that the apportionment provisions of KRS 67.753 do not fairly
represent the extent of the engagement in the city of those, other than
employees, who are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business both within and outside of the city; and



 



   (B)   Accordingly, the following described property factor is hereby
added to the payroll factor and the sales factor provided in KRS 67.753 for
the apportionment of the gross receipts of those, other than employees, who
are engaged in any franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business
both within and outside of the city.



 



      (1)   The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of
which is the average value of the taxpayers real and tangible personal
property owned or rented and used in the city during the computation period,
and the denominator of which is the average value of all of the taxpayer's
real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used anywhere during
the computation period. In the determination of the property factor:



 



         (a)   Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its
original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight (8) times
the net annual rental rate which is the annual rental rate paid by the
taxpayer less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from
sub-rentals.



 



         (b)   The average value of property shall be determined
by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the computation
period, but the City Administrative Officer may require the averaging of
monthly values during the computation period if reasonably required to
reflect properly the average value of the taxpayer's property.



 



      (2)   The proportion of the total gross receipts everywhere of
those, other than employees, who are engaged in any franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business both within and outside of the city
that are subject to the occupational license fee established by this chapter,
shall be determined by multiplying the total gross receipts thereof
everywhere by the quotient of the total of the payroll factor and the sales
factor described in KRS 67.753(2) and (3), and the property factor described
in division (1), that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
business had in the city during the tax period, divided by the total number
of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other
business had in the city during the tax period . The total number of those
factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business
had in the city during the tax period will always be either 1, 2 or 3. For
example, if the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or other business:



 



         (a)   Had only the sales revenue factor in the city,
during the tax period, without either the property factor or the payroll
factor in the city, the total number of those factors that the franchise,
trade, occupation, profession or other business had in the city during the
tax period would be 1; or



 



         (b) Had both the sales revenue factor and the payroll
factor in the city, during the tax period, without the property factor in the
city, the total number of those factors that the franchise, trade,
occupation, profession or other business had in the city during the tax
period would be 2; or



 



         (c)   Had the sales revenue factor, and the payroll
factor, and the property factor in the city, during the tax period, the total
number of those factors that the franchise, trade, occupation, profession or
other business had in the city during the tax period would be 3.

may be a refund of between 1 % and 50% of the occupational license fee.  The

any particular successive year, and otherwise is in compliance with the terms
of the agreement.

reasonably requested to enable the Mayor to evaluate the application.  Upon
acceptance, the Mayor will provide the applicant written approval of the
application that will include the terms and conditions of the agreement as
the Mayor deems appropriate to ensure that the city receives the full value
of any benefits to be gained, including, without limitation, provisions
requiring continuing operation within the city for a period beyond the
incentive period, provisions for reimbursement of incentives and potential
penalties not to exceed 50% of the incentives offered in the event of default
by the approved company, and appropriate conditions precedent to the
triggering of incentives to ensure the city receives the full revenue and job
benefits deemed appropriate, within the limits set forth in division (A).

company's employees pursuant to the incentive granted by the city; or




      (2)   Withhold and remit to the city the full amount of the
occupational license tax from the approved company's employees, consistent
with all applicable laws and ordinances, and receive a reimbursement from the
city of the incentive in the form of a refund at the end of each incentive
year.  Alternatively, upon agreement of the city and the approved company,

SECTION 9.14 CONDITIONAL USES
A. DETERMINATION: Subject to the requirements of Section 18.7, the board of adjustment may authorize a conditional use to be located within any zone in which such conditional use is permitted, if the evidence presented by the applicant is such as to establish, beyond any reasonable doubt:
1. That the proposed use at the particular location is necessary or desirable to provide a service or facility which will contribute to the general well-being of the neighborhood or the community; and
2. That such use will not be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity.
B. CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS: In accordance with KRS 100.237, the board of adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide applications for conditional use permits to allow the proper integration into the community of uses which are specifically named herein which may be suitable only in specific locations in the zone only if certain conditions are met:
1. The board of adjustment may approve, modify, or deny any application for a conditional use permit. If it approves such permit, it may attach necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one or more things be done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a continuing nature. Any such conditions shall be recorded in the board's minutes and on the conditional use permit, along with a reference to the specific section in the zoning regulation listing the conditional use under consideration. In addition, a certificate of Land Use Restriction shall be filed pursuant to Section 9.31 of this ordinance. The board shall have the power to revoke conditional use permits, or variances for noncompliance with the condition thereof. Furthermore, the board shall have the right of action to compel offending structures or uses removed at the cost of the violator and may have judgment in personam for such cost.

3. In any case, where a conditional use permit has not been exercised within the limit set by the board, or within twelve (12) consecutive calendar months from date of issuance, such conditional use permit shall not revert to its original designation, unless there has been a public hearing. Exercised as set forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts for
Article IX General Regulations 9-13
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
the construction of the main building or other improvement has been let; or in the absence of contracts that the main building or other improvement is under construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial investment shall be under contract, in development, or completed. When construction is not a part of the use, exercised shall mean that the use is in operation in compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit.
4. The zoning administrator shall review all conditional use permits, except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the landowner is complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the conditional use permits.
If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions listed on the conditional use permit, the zoning administrator shall report the fact in writing to the chairman of the board of adjustment. The report shall state specifically the manner in which the landowner is not complying with the conditions on the conditional use permit, and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time it is furnished to the chairman of the board of adjustment.
The board shall hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable time, and notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least one week prior to the hearing. If the board of adjustments finds that the facts alleged in the report of the zoning administrator are true and that the landowner has taken no steps to comply with them between the date of the report and the date of the hearing, the board of adjustment may authorize the zoning administrator to revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity on the land which the conditional use permit authorizes.
5. Once the board of adjustment has completed a conditional use permit, and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be completely and permanently satisfied, the zoning administrator, upon request of the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions have been satisfied, and enter the facts which indicate that the conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the copy of the conditional use permit which is on file. Thereafter said use, if it continues to meet the other requirements of this ordinance, will be treated as a permitted use.

SECTION 9.25 FLOOD PROTECTION DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS
A. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
1. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in Kentucky Revised Statutes 151.230 delegated to local government units the
Article IX General Regulations 9-43
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the legislative body of Fort Wright, Kentucky, hereby adopts the following floodplain management ordinance, as follows:
2. FINDINGS OF FACT
a. The flood hazard areas of Fort Wright are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
b. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.
3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;
b. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
c. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;
d. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and
e. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas.
4. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this ordinance are to:
Article IX General Regulations 9-44
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
a. Protect human life and health;
b. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
c. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
d. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
e. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
f. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding;
g. Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area; and,
h. Ensure that those who occupy a Special Flood Hazard Area assume responsibility for their actions.

a. Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than 2 feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 9.25.E.2.c.
(1) In an AO zone, the lowest floor shall be elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or higher than the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
(2) In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Floodplain Administrator will determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from other sources, approximate methods, use of historical data, best supportable and
Article IX General Regulations 9-70
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
reasonable judgement in the event no data can be produced. The lowest floor shall be elevated no lower than 2 feet above such base flood elevation. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.
(3) In all other Zones, elevated 2 feet above the base flood elevation.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
b. Non-residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be elevated to conform with Section 9.25.E.2.a or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
(1) Be floodproofed to an elevation 2 feet above the level of the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
(2) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy and debris;
(3) A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such
Article IX General Regulations 9-71

(5) All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials to an elevation 2 feet above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Openings for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the standards of Section 9.25.E.2.c.
c. Elevated Structures. New construction and substantial improvements of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
(1) Openings for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
(i) Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
(ii) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior foundation grade); and
(iii) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.

(ii) Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than 2 feet above the level of the base flood elevation, and
(iii) Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
(2) Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
(i) The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the:
o The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than 2 feet above the base flood elevation, or
o The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.
Article IX General Regulations 9-73
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
(3) All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the communitys Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must either:
(i) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
(ii) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
(iii) Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this ordinance, including anchoring and elevation requirements for manufactured homes.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
e. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 9.25.C.2, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge;
(2) If Section 9.25.E.2.e is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 9.25.E.
3. STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AND/OR FLOODWAYS
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Section 9.25.C.2, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply:
a. No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a
Article IX General Regulations 9-74
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
b. New construction and substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with Section 9.25.C.2.
4. STANDARDS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING ZONES
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Section 9.25.E.C.2, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1  3), where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
a. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall:
(1) Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
b. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall:
(1) Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.
(2) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that any space below that
Article IX General Regulations 9-75
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in Section 9.25.E.2.b.
5. STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS
a. All subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
b. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
c. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and,
d. In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available, base flood elevation and floodway data for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.
e. All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
6. STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONES BEGINNING WITH THE LETTER A
For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated A the following provisions shall apply:
a. Must be non-habitable;
b. Must be anchored to resist floatation and lateral movement;
c. Must be provided with flood openings in accordance with the standards of Section 9.25.E.2.c;
d. Must be built of flood resistant materials to 2 feet above the base flood elevation;
e. Must elevate utilities 2 feet above the base flood elevation;
f. Can only be used for storage or parking; and
g. Must not be modified for a different use after permitting.
7. CRITICAL FACILITIES
Article IX General Regulations 9-76
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
F. APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES
1. Nature Of Variances
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
It is the duty of the legislative body to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
2. Designation of Variance and Appeal Board
a. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of these regulations.
3. Duties of Board of Adjustment
Article IX General Regulations 9-77
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
a. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
b. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes.
4. Variance Procedures
In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and the:
a. Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
b. Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
c. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;
d. Importance to the community of the services provided by the existing or proposed facility;
e. Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of functionally dependent use;
f. Availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
g. Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
h. Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
i. Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
j. Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
k. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges and culverts.
5. Conditions for Variances
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
Article IX General Regulations 9-78
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
a. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
b. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the legislative body need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the legislative body believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
c. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(i) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(ii) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(iii) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition section under "Public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
d. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation.
e. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) upon request
f. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Article 6 (4) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
6. Variance Notification
Article IX General Regulations 9-79
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
a. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
b. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Kenton County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
c. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and report such variances issued in the communitys biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
7. Historic Structures
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
G. SEVERABILITY
This ordinance and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this ordinance be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
If any clause, sentence, or phrase of the Ordinance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
This ordinance was adopted at a public meeting of the legislative body of the City of Fort Wright on May 1, 2013.

A. FILING OF CERTIFICATES OF LAND USE RESTRICTIONS:
1. Effective October 1, 1988, the county clerk of every county containing a planning unit which has enacted land use regulations pursuant to this chapter shall, upon receipt of a recording fee of ten dollars and fifty cents ($10.50), file and maintain among the official records of his office certificates of land use restriction completed according to this section and KRS 100.3682 to 100.3684. The certificates shall be in the form designated in KRS 100.3683; shall be completed and filed by the secretary of the planning commission, board of adjustment, legislative body or fiscal court which finally adopts or imposes the land use restriction described in the certificate; and shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the date upon which the body takes final action to impose or adopt the restriction. The certificate shall set forth the name and address of the property owner; the address of the property; the name of the subdivision or development, if there is one; the name and address of the body which maintains the original records containing the restriction; and shall indicate the type of land use restriction adopted or imposed upon the subject property on or after October 1, 1988, including variances, conditional use permits, conditional zoning conditions, subdivision plats and development plans; but not including zoning map amendments which impose no limitations or restrictions upon the use of the subject property other than those generally applicable to properties within the same zone. The county clerk shall index the certificates by property owner and, if applicable, name of subdivision or development. The county clerk shall maintain in his office a record of the name and address of the agency having custody of the official map for each planning unit within the county. All zoning map amendments shall be reflected on the official zoning map within thirty (30) days of the date upon which final action approving such amendments is taken by the planning unit.
2. The planning unit shall collect the county clerk's filing fee for the certificate from the applicant at the time any proceeding is initiated which may result in the imposition, adoption, amendment or release of any land use restriction provided for in this chapter; and the planning unit may also charge the applicant a fee for the reasonable cost of completing and filing the certificate, not to exceed ten dollars and fifty cents ($10.50), in addition to any other applicable filing or administrative fee, to compensate the planning unit for completing and filing the certificate. The fees permitted by this subsection shall be refunded to the applicant in the event no land use restriction is imposed or adopted as a result of the proceeding.
3. When a restriction reflected on the certificate is amended, a new certificate shall be filed. In the case of such amendment or in the event the original restriction is released, the previous certificate shall be
Article IX General Regulations 9-82
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
released by the secretary of the body which amended or released the restriction in the same manner as releases of encumbrances upon real estate.
4. The failure to file, to file on time, or to complete the certificate properly or accurately shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any land use restriction or regulation. Any improper filing may be cured by a subsequent proper filing. Nothing herein shall affect the running of time for any appeal or other act for which a time limit is prescribed by this chapter.
B. CERTIFICATE FOR CONTIGUOUS PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES PART OF SAME PROCEEDING: In the event a planning commission, fiscal court or legislative body originates a zoning map amendment for more than five (5) contiguous properties, upon approval of such map amendment, there shall be filed a single certificate setting forth the required information for all the properties, and the originating body shall pay a single filing fee for such certificate. Whenever a land use restriction is imposed upon two (2) or more properties or lots in the same proceeding, including but not limited to the approval of a subdivision plat or development plan for multiple lots, a single certificate shall be filed for all such properties or lots collectively and a single filing fee shall be paid therefore.

SECTION 9.29 REGULATIONS CONCERNING TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS
A. TELEVISION: Earth stations for the reception and/or transmittal of TV signals, programs, messages, etc., may be installed as accessory structures in any zone, in compliance with the following regulations:
1. Such structures, including support equipment, shall not be permitted within any front yard or side yard (on each side of the lot) in any zone. Such structures may be permitted to extend into the minimum rear yard depth, as defined herein, in all zones, provided that such structures are set back from the rear lot line a minimum of ten (10) feet, and side yard clearances are maintained.
2. Structures may be ground mounted or roof mounted, provided that maximum height limitations are maintained. If the structure is roof mounted, it shall be located in a manner so as to detract as little as possible from the architectural character of the building.
3. Structures shall be constructed to withstand a wind load of eighty (80) miles per hour.
4. Structures shall be grounded electrically and shall not cause to disturb, restrict, or impede the reception of equipment on adjoining properties.
B. RADIO: Earth stations for the reception and/or transmittal of radio signals, programs, messages, etc., may be installed as accessory structures in any zone, in compliance with the following regulations:
1. Such structures, including tower, mast, antenna, guy wires, support equipment, etc., shall not be permitted within any front yard or side yard (on each side of the lot) in any zone. Such structures may be permitted to extend into the minimum rear yard depth, as defined herein, in all zones, provided that such structures are set back from the rear lot line a minimum of ten (10) feet, and side yard clearances are maintained.
2. Such structures, including tower, mast, antenna, guy wires, support equipment, etc., shall not exceed seventy (70) feet in height, as measured from ground level to the highest point of the structure.

Article IX General Regulations 9-85
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
SECTION 9.30 PHASED ZONING REGULATIONS
A. Phased zoning is an overlay type regulation to be used in cases where the timing and/or phasing of the zoning of an area is especially critical to the implementation of the adopted comprehensive plan. The intent of the phased zoning regulations is to encourage redevelopment of a specified area for the use and/or density designated within the comprehensive plan when the necessary conditions for such development are realized (e.g., demolition of existing buildings). Implicit in such a phased zoning approach is the premise that until such conditions are realized, the type of development designated within the comprehensive plan is premature; such development would be prevented by temporarily zoning the area to generally conform with the predominant existing land use, with a clear stipulation of an intended future rezoning, which would be in compliance with the adopted comprehensive plan.
B. The phased zoning regulations may be overlaid over any zoning classification by means of a zone change process. The use of the phased zoning regulations would indicate that the regulations of the overlaid zone are currently being enforced, based upon the general existing land use, but upon attainment of all the requirements of the zone which corresponds to the adopted comprehensive plan for the type of use and/or density, the area could be rezoned in direct compliance with the plan.
C. Phased zones are indicated on the official zoning map by adding to the overlaid zone, the letter "P", as a suffix enclosed in parentheses. For example, in order to properly phase its change, an area zoned R-1C, which is identified for future use on the adopted comprehensive plan for "industrial" could be temporarily zoned R-1C(P), indicating that present development on the site would be in conformance with the regulations of the overlaid R-1C Zone, but that, upon the attainment of certain conditions (e.g., provision of an adequate access road, demolition of existing buildings), the area could be rezoned through a zone change procedure to an industrial zone. At the time of the zone change, the temporary R-1C(P) Zone is removed and the area is developed according to the regulations of the new zone, which is in conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan.
D. The minimum size of any area to be rezoned, as regulated by this section of the ordinance, is one (1) acre, provided that all other provisions of this ordinance and the subdivision regulations are adhered to. Development of a smaller tract adjacent to an existing zone being requested may be permitted if the proposed development conforms to and extends the original development as if the new area had been a part of the original development and provided further that the zone is in conformance with the comprehensive plan.
SECTION 9.31 RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR HANDICAPPED PERSONS
Article IX General Regulations 9-86
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
A. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
1. Person With A Disability: A person with a physical, emotional, or mental disability including, but not limited to, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, deafness or hard of hearing, sight impairments, and orthopedic impairments, but not including convicted felons or misdemeanants on probation or parole or receiving supervision or rehabilitation services as a result of their prior convictions, or mentally ill persons who have pled guilty but mentally ill to a crime or not guilty by reason of insanity to a crime. Person with a disability does not include persons with current illegal use of or addiction to alcohol or any controlled substance as regulated by KRS Chapter 218A.
2. Residential Care Facility: A residence operated and maintained by a sponsoring private or governmental agency to provide services in a homelike setting for persons with disabilities.
3. Services: Means, but is not limited to, supervision, protection, rehabilitation, personal development, and attendant care.
B. Any sponsoring private or governmental agency shall be permitted to operate a care facility in any residential district, zone, or subdivision subject only to compliance with the same limitations upon area, height, yard, screening, parking, number of dwelling units, and number of occupants per dwelling unit as apply to other residences in the district, zone, or subdivision. For purposes of determining the number of units which comprise the facility, employees of the sponsoring agency providing services to persons with disabilities shall be counted only if their permanent residence is maintained at the facility. No conditional use permit not otherwise required for the other residences within a zone or land use category shall be required for the operation of a residential care facility.
SECTION 9.32 COMPATABILITY STANDARDS FOR QUALIFIED MANUFACTURED HOUSING
A. PURPOSE: The purpose of compatibility standards for manufactured housing is:
1. To permit local governments to adopt and enforce, as part of its zoning regulations, compatibility standards governing the placement of qualified manufactured homes in residential zones, within the local governments jurisdiction, designed to ensure that when a qualified manufactured home is placed in a residential zone, it is compatible, in terms of assessed value, with existing housing located immediately adjacent to (1) either side of the
Article IX General Regulations 9-87
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
proposed site within the same block front; (2) adjacent to the rear, or (3) within a one-eighth (1/8) mile radius or less from the proposed location of the qualified manufactured home.
B. A qualified manufactured home that meets the compatibility standards as set forth in Subsections D. 5., and D. 6., of this section, as well as the regulations of the zone in which it is proposed, shall be allowed as a permitted use and as a primary family residence in any residential zone permitting detached single-family residential uses.
C. Applications must be submitted to the zoning administrator demonstrating that the compatibility standards as set forth in Subsections D., 5. and D. 6., have been met and contending that the proposed construction, installation, or relocation of the qualified manufactured home is similar and comparable in exterior appearance, building materials, and living area to other dwelling units that have been constructed on adjacent tracts, lots, and parcels.
D. The procedures for approval shall be in accordance with the requirements of Article XVI and the following:
1. Applications for the placement of qualified manufactured homes shall be submitted with a nonrefundable application fee on a form or forms developed for that purpose to the city zoning administrator. Qualified manufactured homes may not be constructed until after an application has been accepted and approved in accordance with these regulations.
2. The application shall include (1) only information reasonably necessary to make determination as to conformity with the provisions of this Section of this ordinance; (2) recent photographs of the front, side and rear of the qualified manufactured home exterior finish (whichever is applicable); (3) pictures taken from the proposed site of the dwelling unit in the northerly, easterly, southerly, and westerly directions, and pictures of any adjacent dwelling units. The photographs shall be taken within 30 days prior to the submittal of the application. In addition, each application shall be accompanied by a site plan or plot plan containing appropriate information including, but not limited to, the following:
a. Location of all existing buildings, structures, easements, and boundary lines;
b. North arrow, scale, city and land lot;
c. Existing use of adjacent property;
d. Location of all proposed buildings, structures, and land uses.
3. Applications shall be first reviewed for completeness. If the application is rejected for not being complete, the applicant shall be notified of the
Article IX General Regulations 9-88
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
reasons for the rejection. The applicant shall be responsible for the satisfaction of all of the comments prior to the resubmission of the revised application.
4. The application shall be reviewed for compatibility with architectural appearance and similarity with:
a. adjacent development or surrounding developments;
b. development within the same zone or general area;
c. proposed development permitted in the same zone or general area; and,
5. Compatibility with architectural appearance shall be based on the following:
a. floor living space and setbacks;
b. siding and exterior materials;
c. roof pitch;
d. square footage;
e. general aesthetic appearance.
6. Compatibility with the orientation and location of existing structures shall be based on the following:
a. building height;
b. building width;
c. building depth;
d. building setbacks.
7. A decision of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of a complete application shall be made and the applicant shall be notified in writing. Conditional approval shall require that the specific conditions and the reasons therefore be stated in writing and be agreed to by the applicant; such conditions shall be binding upon the applicant upon agreement. In the case of disapproval, the reasons therefore shall be specifically stated in writing by designating each specific provision of this section or other applicable ordinance that is not met and an explanation as to the reason or reasons why each such provision is not met.
SECTION 9.33 REGULATIONS OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
A. The city of Fort Wright, together with the other cities in Kenton County together with the Kenton County Fiscal Court, after consultation among the mayors, councils, commissioners and staffs of the municipalities and the county within the

9. Review of Kentucky statutes related to regulating sexually oriented businesses.
E. Duncan Associates has summarized this work and presented recommendations to Planning and Development Services of Kenton County and Kenton and Campbell Counties and their cities in an August 2003 report entitled Site Visit Analysis: Sexually Oriented and Related Businesses in Kenton and Campbell Counties (hereinafter called simply the Kelly and Cooper Study).
F. That study has also been made available to the legislative bodies of Kenton and Campbell Counties for their consideration and use.
G. That study has been accepted and used by the Fiscal Court of Kenton County in adopting the countywide licensing ordinance, Kenton County Ordinance No. 451.9, as amended, establishing licensing requirements for sexually oriented businesses and service oriented escort bureaus in 2004.
Article IX General Regulations 9-90
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
H. The United States Supreme Court in City of Renton v. Playtime Theater, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), held that local governments may rely upon the experiences of other cities as well as on its own studies in enacting local legislation to regulate sexually oriented businesses;
I. The United States Supreme Court in Renton and other cases has held that a local government may regulate such uses through content-neutral, time, place, and manner restrictions, so long as said regulations are designed to serve the government interest and do not unreasonably omit avenues of communication, and are aimed not at the content of protected speech within said establishments but rather at the secondary effects of said establishments on the surrounding communities.
J. The study by Kelly and Cooper found extensive physical interaction between patrons and dancers at many of the establishments in both Kenton and Campbell Counties.
K. Covington, the only municipality in Kenton County that has had sexually oriented businesses within its border, from January 1, 2002, to February 11, 2004, the police made a total of 469 calls to sexually oriented businesses in the city. The crimes committed at these establishments during this time period included robbery, assault, fraud, malicious mischief, public intoxication, and possession of illegal drugs. In addition, on June 13, 2003, Covington police arrested three individuals for prostitution-related charges at Liberty's Show Lounge, a sexually oriented cabaret in the city.
L. As the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals noted in a decision addressing issues related to the Adult Entertainment ordinance in the City of Newport (Campbell County), there is a long history underlying efforts to regulate sex businesses in Northern Kentucky:
Defendant City of Newport ("City" or "Newport") long ago gained a reputation as home to a veritable smorgasbord of vice, attracting patrons from across the nation. For decades, the small city was considered the Midwest's answer to Las Vegas, and leaders of organized crime were said to operate its gambling casinos and nightclubs.
In the 1960's, public pressure began to demand that Newport be cleaned up. This pressure has continued until the present, with varying degrees of success.
A 1986 report generated by the Newport Alcoholic Beverage Control Administrator indicated that of 28 adult bars opened since 1978 (including successive bars at the same site), 21 had had at least one prostitution-related conviction, and 18 had had multiple convictions. Def. Ex. K, p. 2. The report explained that "all of the prostitution in businesses with adult entertainment
Article IX General Regulations 9-91
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
involved an alcoholic beverage as the median [sic] of exchange and the solicitation of such drinks by 'mixers.'" Id. In all, 98% of prostitution arrests in Newport occurred in the vicinity of these bars. Id. Adult entertainment establishments, which constituted 12% of all businesses serving alcohol, accounted for 17% of all police runs. Def. Ex. K, p. 21.
A later review, conducted in 1990 by the Newport License Inspector, documented the continued prostitution arrests occurring at several adult dancing establishments. Def. Ex. G. Moreover, the City determined that over $ 70,000 was expended in 1990 to target, patrol and prosecute the illicit behavior occurring in and around the bars. Def. Ex. H.
Several of Newport's citizens, merchants and church groups also opposed the presence of the semi-nude dancing clubs. These groups generally believed that the adult entertainment clubs were "clouds over [the] neighborhood that keep [it] from growing in the [right] direction." See Def. Ex. I (letter to Mayor from Taylors Landing Business District). Complaints commonly expressed were that the seamy establishments deterred other merchants from locating in Newport's business district, deterred shoppers, served a poor example for the City's youth, and generally tarnished the City's image. Id.
Bright Lights, Inc., v. City of Newport, 830 F. Supp. 378, 380-81 (E. D. Ky. 1993).
Based on those findings, the court went on to hold in relevant part:
Having considered the matter carefully, the court concludes that some leeway must be afforded the reform efforts of the City Council of Newport. This body has been elected by the citizens to attempt to "clean up the image" of the City.
To do this, it must overcome the sleazy impression of Newport and Northern Kentucky that survives from "the heyday" when things ran wide open; reform candidates were literally drugged and framed for morals offenses by public officials and police officers; the members of reform citizens groups were vilified and harassed; and a "liberal" in local parlance was a person favoring the continued open and notorious violation of the gambling and morals laws.
To illustrate that the Council's perception of a need to clean up the image of the City is not paranoid, the court notes the following statements in a national magazine's satirical Chapter on Newport's big sister, the city of Cincinnati.
"The city's streets fairly shine; the odd litterer draws a scornful stare. Wide avenues, bosky side streets, the most inviting of thoroughfares. And clean. So clean. No X-rated movie theaters, no adult-book stores, no bare-breasted night joints soil these streets, all of them long ago jettisoned over to the Kentucky side of the river."
Article IX General Regulations 9-92
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
Peter Richmond, Town Without Pity, Gentlemen's Quarterly, July 1993, at 102, 104.
This court holds that the City of Newport has the right to secede as Cincinnati's combat zone.
The court holds that the City has "an important and substantial governmental interest" in advancing these reform goals, which interest is furthered by the ordinances in question. Barnes, 111 S. Ct. at 2461. The court further finds and holds that in the case of the City of Newport, given its unique history, the ordinances' "incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest." Id. (quoting O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 376-77, 88 S. Ct. at 1678-79).
Newport's image affects that of all of Northern Kentucky, a community of nearly 300,000 people. That City and its community have the right to project a progressive and decent image. The nudity ordinances contribute to the enhancement of this interest and will be upheld. 830 F.Supp. at 384;
M. The Supreme Court had earlier noted in upholding another regulation in Newport, it is plain that, as in Bellanca, the interest in maintaining order outweighs the interest in free expression by dancing nude. Newport v. Iacobucci, 479 U.S. 92, 97, 93 L. Ed. 2d 334, 340, 107 S. Ct. 383, 386 (1986). Although the significance of the opinion itself is now questionable (see J&B Social Club # 1 v. City of Mobile, 966 F. Supp. 1131, 1135 (S.D. Ala. 1996)), the quoted part of the opinion stands unchallenged.
N. The cities of Covington and Newport continue their efforts to improve their image. Since 1985, Covington has redeveloped its riverfront, creating several new office towers, high-end condominiums, hotels, and a convention center. In Newport, in conjunction with private development and Southbank Partners, Inc., the City has built a major entertainment center along the river. This initiative has promoted improved pedestrian and transit connections in Northern Kentuckys river cities to and from the stadiums and other attractions along the Cincinnati riverfront.
O. Despite these efforts, the areas of downtown Covington and Newport away from the riverfront continue to suffer in many ways. The study by Kelly and Cooper found in the area near to existing sexually oriented uses a number of building vacancies and building maintenance falling far short of that found in the revitalized areas near the river.
P. The city of Fort Wright respects the Constitutional rights of its citizens, including the right to present certain types of entertainment that may not appeal to the entire population. Through this ordinance, it is the desire of the city of Fort
Article IX General Regulations 9-93
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
Wright to balance the Constitutional rights of businesses that present sexually oriented entertainment with the city of Fort Wright interests in ensuring that this community not suffer from the same sorts of adverse effects that Covington and Newport have long suffered.
Q. From long experience in Covington and Newport, as well as from the following studies and others not listed, the city of Fort Wright also finds that such businesses may have primary and secondary effects involving crimes related to the activities in the establishments, of which prostitution and crimes of violence are those of greatest concern. See for example:

R. The city of Fort Wright recognizes that some of the cited studies included bars without sexually oriented entertainment among the businesses studied; the city of Fort Wright finds, nevertheless, that addressing the establishments that have live, sexually oriented entertainment is a more critical local issue than that of bars without such entertainment, for three reasons:
1. Bars in Kentucky are already regulated by the Commonwealth, and those state regulations directly address many of the concerns that arise with the service of alcohol;
2. The local history of prostitution and sex-related crimes has largely been related to businesses with live, sexually oriented entertainment, and not with other establishments that serve alcohol; and
3. The interaction between dancers who are paid to work with very limited clothing and the customers who pay to see them work in the establishments with live entertainment creates a sexually charged environment and the opportunity to negotiate for the provision of additional services that do not involve dancing or other protected expression and that are simply unacceptable under the standards of the County and its citizens.
S. As noted earlier in these findings, there is a long local history of prostitution and sex-related crimes at or incident to the operation of establishments with live, sexually oriented entertainment. Further, the studies shown herein provide further evidence of the potential crime-related secondary effects from such businesses. Although the methodologies and quality of these studies vary somewhat, local experience has demonstrated to the city of Fort Wright that the relationship between crime and such establishments is a fact in Northern Kentucky and not just a theory published in a study.
T. The city of Fort Wright has reviewed evidence and testimony presented at public meetings before the County, and information based on the past experiences of the Kenton and Campbell Counties and the cities of Covington and Newport, the experiences of the County Attorneys offices prosecuting numerous and varied offenses that have occurred in and around the sexually oriented entertainment establishments, and based upon the documented experiences of other governmental units within Kentucky and elsewhere in dealing with the impact of sexually oriented entertainment, that such businesses can, if not properly regulated, be deleterious to said community.
U. The city of Fort Wright finds that the countywide licensing ordinance related to sexually oriented businesses and service oriented escort bureaus adopted by the Fiscal Court of Kenton County is an effective tool for addressing the many operational issues that can arise with such businesses.
Article IX General Regulations 9-95
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
V. The city of Fort Wright finds that amendments to the citys Zoning Ordinance regarding the location and design of such businesses are important variables in the nature and extent of adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses on the community, and further finds that location and design are among the types of issues that are typically addressed through zoning.
W. Based on the recommendations of Kelly and Cooper, which are based on their experience in other communities and their review of the studies cited above and other local efforts to address such secondary effects, the city of Fort Wright finds that the following principles are essential to effective zoning controls of sexually oriented businesses:
1. Sexually oriented businesses should, to the maximum extent practicable, be separated from one another by a distance that is greater than a convenient walking distance, because experience elsewhere has shown that the location of such businesses near one another may increase the adverse secondary effects, particularly those related to crime, by a greater than arithmetic factor;
2. Sexually oriented businesses have the greatest adverse effect on residential neighbourhoods and should thus be separated to the maximum extent practicable from residential neighbourhoods;
3. Sexually oriented businesses are likely to attract criminal elements that prey on soft targets, including children, and it is thus important to separate sexually oriented businesses from schools, parks, recreation centers, and religious institutions, all of which are places where children are likely to congregate, often without parental protection;
4. Also because of the tendency of sexually oriented businesses to attract criminal elements that prey on soft targets, it is important to seek locations for such businesses that are not located along pedestrian routes, where young people, old people and others who are vulnerable, are likely to walk in going about their day-to-day business. Thus, locations to which the primary access is by automobile minimize the risk of persons going about their daily business encountering persons who are visiting or even loitering around the sexually oriented businesss.
X. In examining Kenton County for available sites that would be suitable for sexually oriented businesses that meet the above criteria, Kelly and Cooper identified a number of such sites in the County, none of which were located in city of Fort Wright.
Y. Fort Wright currently has no sexually oriented businesses in the community.
Z. Fort Wright currently has no area zoned for any type of commercial use.
Article IX General Regulations 9-96
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
AA. Fort Wright currently has only limited areas zoned for commercial use, and those areas are small and adjacent to residential areas.
AB. Fort Wright has within its limited commercial areas only small, local businesses generally serving the convenience needs of residents.
AC. Fort Wright residents in these jurisdiction with limited commercial areas must go to larger, nearby cities for most of their retail purchases and entertainment.
AD. Staff of Fort Wright can not recall ever receiving any applications for or inquiries about the establishment of any sexually oriented business in the city of Fort Wright.
AE. Fort Wright thus finds that the physical context and experience of the City of Fort Wright support the findings by Kelly and Cooper.
AF. Fort Wright finds that, in reliance on the Kelly and Cooper study, other municipalities in the County, including specifically Covington, Erlanger and Taylor Mill, all of which have large and diverse commercial or industrial areas with suitable sites that would be potentially available locations where sexually oriented businesses could legally locate.
AG. Fort Wright acknowledges that it can re-evaluate these findings if, in the future, there is a substantial change in the character of the community and the potential for suitable sites for sexually oriented businesses within the community.
AH. Fort Wright therefore finds that there are no suitable locations for sexually oriented businesses in the city of Fort Wright and such businesses should therefore be prohibited.
AI. FINDINGS: The facts and other matters set forth in the previous clauses that form the preamble to this ordinance are hereby adopted as findings of fact in support of the legislative action of the city of Fort Wright in adopting this amendment to the Zoning Ordinance. Upon adoption of this zoning amendment, these shall be incorporated into the Zoning Code by reference as if fully set forth therein to the adopting Resolution.

SECTION 10.13 PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT) OVERLAY ZONE
A. PURPOSE: The purposes of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) Overlay Zone are to: promote flexibility in design and permit planned diversification in the relationships between location of and types of uses and structures; promote the advantages of modern large scale site planning for community development through the efficient use of land, facilitating a more economic arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land uses, and utilities; preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the existing landscape features and amenities, and to utilize such features in an harmonious fashion; provide for more usable and suitably located recreation facilities, other public and common facilities, than would otherwise be provided under conventional land development procedures, but always with the intention of furthering the public health, safety, and general welfare.
B. GENERAL: A Planned Unit Development (PUD) Overlay Zone may only be permitted to be superimposed over any of the Residential (R) Zones, provided that all conditions or provisions of this section of the ordinance, the applicable requirements of the subdivision regulations, and any additional requirements, as may be determined necessary to provide for the most efficient layout of the PUD and its proper integration with the surrounding development, are met; and a public hearing is held on the PUD application.
C. APPLICATION AND PROCESSING: Applications for a Planned Unit Development Overlay Zone shall be processed as follows in two stages:
1. Stage I -- Development Plan and Zoning Map Amendment - Application for amendment to PUD Overlay Zone shall include a development plan in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.20, A., Stage I Plan Requirements.
a. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed application in accordance with the requirements of KRS Chapter 424, and review said application with regard to its compliance with the stated purposes of the PUD Overlay Zone, the required elements of the Stage I Plan, and other applicable requirements of this section. Upon holding such hearing, the planning commission shall make one of the following recommendations to the legislative body: approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval. The planning commission shall submit, along with their recommendations, a copy of the Stage I Plan and the bases for their recommendation.
b. The Planning Commission recommendation relating to the Stage I Development Plan shall become final and automatically
Article X Zones 10-29
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2017 PDS
implemented as set forth in the Planning Commission recommendations, unless within twenty-one (21) days after the final action by the Planning commission:
(1) Any aggrieved person files a written request with the Planning Commission that the final decision shall be made by the appropriate legislative body; or
(2) The appropriate legislative body files a notice with the Planning Commission that the legislative body shall decide the map amendment.
c. If a request with the Planning Commission is filed, the legislative body shall, within ninety (90) days after receiving the recommendations of the planning commission, review said recommendations and take action to approve or disapprove said PUD application. Such action may incorporate any conditions imposed by the planning commission. However, should the legislative body take action to impose different conditions than were reviewed and considered by the planning commission, then said conditions shall be resubmitted to the planning commission for further review and recommendation, in accordance with Subsection C., 1., a., above. Approval of the PUD Overlay Zone shall require that development be in conformance with the Stage I approved plan.
Zoning Map Amendment - Upon approval of the PUD Overlay Zone, the official zoning map shall be amended by adding the prefix "PUD" to the existing residential zone (e.g., PUD-R-1B, PUD-R-1C, etc.) for the area as shown on the Stage I approved plan.
2. Stage II - Plan and Record Plat - A Stage II Plan and Record Plat shall be developed in conformance with the Stage I approved plan and in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.20, B. and C., and submitted to the planning commission for its review.
a. The legislative body shall review the submitted Stage II Plan with regard to its compliance with the required elements of Section 9.20, B., for Stage II plans, other applicable elements of this ordinance, and other applicable regulations, and its conformity with the Stage I approved plan. In approving the Stage II plan, the city may authorize minor adjustments from the Stage I approved plan, without a public hearing. The legislative body shall determine what is a major change considering the spatial relationship of structures, a change in land uses, a change in density, a change in circulation
Article X Zones 10-30
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2017 PDS
patterns for vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or the change in open space and recreational areas and the like.
In the event that the city legislative body determines the changes are a major nature, the proposed revisions shall be reviewed through the public hearing process as provided under 10.12.
Upon city legislative approval of the Stage II Plan, a copy of said plan shall be forwarded to the city's zoning administrator, who shall grant permits only in accordance with the Stage II approved plan and other regulations, as may be required by this ordinance.
b. Upon approval of the Stage II Plan, the planning commission shall review the submitted Record Plat with regard to its compliance with the required elements of Section 9.20, C., for record plats, the applicable requirements of the subdivision regulations, and its conformance with the Stage II approved plan.
Following planning commission approval of the plat as required by KRS 100.277, the record plat shall be submitted to the legislative body for a determination that any offer of dedications (public ways and/or easements) indicated on the plat would be beneficial to the public interest and suitable for the immediate or future "acceptance for maintenance" by the city as required by KRS 82A.
Upon submission of the record plat to the legislative body, said original plat, certified by the planning commission and the mayor of the legislative body, and suitable for recording, shall be forwarded to the offices of the county clerk to be recorded.
D. RESIDENTIAL USES AND DENSITIES: All types of residential housing units (attached or detached) may be permitted within a PUD Overlay Zone, including but not limited to, single-family, two-family, and multi-family residential units. The density of dwelling units in a PUD shall be determined by the density (dwelling units per net acre) as calculated from the existing residential (R) zone superimposed by the PUD Overlay Zone. This density shall be applied to the total project area excluding that land devoted to commercial uses and streets (public and private).
E. COMMERCIAL USES: Commercial uses, intended primarily for the service and convenience of residents of the PUD, may be permitted within the project area, provided a market analysis is made justifying the need for said uses.
These commercial uses shall be grouped in complexes clearly delineated on the Stage I Plan, and may include one or more of the following uses:
Article X Zones 10-31

1. Churches
2. Community centers, including day care facilities
3. Country clubs
4. Fire or police stations
5. Libraries
6. Open space/recreation areas
7. Schools (nursery, elementary, and secondary);
G. AREA REQUIREMENTS: No PUD Overlay Zone shall be permitted on less than twenty-five (25) acres of land. However, development of a smaller tract adjacent to an existing PUD Overlay Zone may be permitted, if the proposed development conforms to and extends the original development as if the new area had been a part of the original development.
H. HEIGHT, YARD, AND SETBACK REQUIREMENTS: Requirements shall be as approved in the plan.
I. OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING: Off-street parking and, when applicable, loading and/or unloading facilities, shall be provided in accordance with Articles XI and XII of this ordinance.

Article X Zones 10-32
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2017 PDS
K. EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL: Effective erosion and sedimentation controls shall be planned and applied in accordance with Section 9.7 of this ordinance.
L. COMMON OPEN SPACE/RECREATION AREA: At least twenty percent (20%) of the total acreage of the proposed PUD shall be retained as common open space/recreation area, and dedicated to a public and/or private entity for operation and maintenance. Such open space/recreation areas shall be physically situated so as to be readily accessible, available to, and usable by all residents of the PUD. Common open space/recreation areas shall be that part of the total project exclusive of dwellings, streets, parking areas, single-family lots, commercial areas, and other non-open space and non-recreationally oriented facilities.
M. AMENDMENTS: Any amendments to plans shall be made in accordance with the procedure required by this ordinance and any minor amendments may be approved by the city legislative body without a hearing as provided herein and any major changes shall be heard by the city legislative body at a public hearing after due notice.
N. EXPIRATION: Any amendment to the PUD Overlay Zone shall be subject to the time constraints, as noted below. Upon expiration of said time period, and any extensions thereto, the legislative body may initiate a request for a public hearing by the planning commission, in accordance with the requirements of KRS Chapter 100, for the purpose of determining whether said PUD Overlay zone should revert to its original zoning designation. A public hearing may be initiated if either of the following conditions apply:
1. A particular section of the original Stage I Plan has not had a Stage II approval by the city legislative body within twenty-four (24) consecutive months from the date of the approval of the Stage I approved plan for that particular section, provided an extension may be permitted by the legislative body if sufficient proof can be demonstrated that prevailing conditions have not changed appreciably to render the Stage I approved plan obsolete.
2. Substantial construction has not been initiated within a period of twelve (12) consecutive months from the date of approval of the Stage II Plan by the legislative body of a particular section; provided that an extension may be permitted upon approval of the legislative body, or its duly authorized representative, if sufficient proof can be demonstrated that the construction was delayed due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, and that prevailing conditions have not changed appreciably to render the Stage I approved plan obsolete. The amount of construction
Article X Zones 10-33
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2017 PDS
constituting initiating substantial construction shall be as approved in the Stage II approved plan.
O. UTILITIES: All utilities must be underground when any new development occurs.

Commentary: It is recommended that when development is proposed in hillside areas, that consideration be given to fitting the proposed development to the natural configurations of an existing landscape.
H. HILLSIDE PROTECTION
1. The following requirements shall be met for development within areas identified as having 15% slope or greater.
a. Slope Determination
Topographic information has been created and stored by the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Department of the PDS. The data comprises polygons which contain the generalized slope of Kenton County derived from a 10-foot resolution slope grid, created from the elevation grid for Kenton County.
b. Slope Setbacks
Proposed structures shall be set back from either the toe or top of the slope to a structure, whichever applies, a minimum of 10 feet, unless otherwise required by a geotechnical investigation or retaining walls are used. These setbacks do not supercede the minimum setbacks required by the Kentucky Building Code. Setbacks shall be measured as shown in Figure 11.
2. In areas where 15% slopes or greater will be disturbed, a geotechnical evaluation must be completed by a registered professional engineer and submitted with the Stage II Development Plan for review. All disturbances must follow the recommendations of the geotechnical evaluation. Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the site, the planning commission, or its duly authorized representative, shall require written authorization from a registered professional engineer that the proposed development is in compliance with the specifications as contained within the geotechnical investigation.
3. Areas containing slopes of 35% or more shall not be disturbed.
4. Grading and Drainage
a. All excavations on slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%) shall be made to approximate grade or subgrade elevations consistent with approved plans. Applications for grading permits must include an approved Land Disturbance Permit from Sanitation District No.1. Grading plans must be based on adequate surveys and soil
Article X Zones 10-136
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2017 PDS
investigations. The Kenton County Subdivision Regulations refer to general soil conditions that exist in the area.
b. Excavation, Movement of Soil, Tree Removal, and Erosion and Sedimentation Control. Section 9.7 of the City of Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance currently states:
(1) No governmental entity or other person or entity shall strip, excavate, fill, or otherwise move soil, trees, or other vegetation, except for minor changes such as: the filling of small depressions, removal of vegetation which is diseased or endangering the public safety, etc. without first insuring that all requirements of the Subdivision Regulations of the legislative body, if applicable, have been fulfilled and then obtaining a permit.
(2) The required permit may be issued after determining that the resulting change in grade, or removal of trees and other vegetation, in the affected area will be in conformance with all applicable provisions of this ordinance. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prohibit normal excavation or grading incidental to the construction or alteration of a building on the premises for which a building permit has been granted as required otherwise in this ordinance.
(3) Erosion and Sedimentation Control: Erosion and sedimentation controls for excavation, movement of soil, and tree removal, shall be planned and applied according to the following:
(a) The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one time during development.
(b) When land is exposed during development, the exposure shall be kept to the shortest practical period of time.
(c) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect critical areas exposed during development.
(d) Sediment basins (debris basins or silt traps) shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from land undergoing development.
Commentary: It is necessary to minimize problems associated with water runoff and soil erosion incurred in grading these slopes while preserving unique scenic resources and wildlife habitat.
Article X Zones 10-137
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2017 PDS
(e) Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased run-off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
(f) Permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development.
(g) The development shall be fitted to the topography and soils so as to create the least erosion potential.
(h) Wherever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained and protected.
c. In addition to the above, the following requirements shall be met:
(1) Within the allowable disturbance area, finished cut and fill slopes shall be constructed to a maximum 3:1 (33.3%) slope or flatter (unless retaining walls are used) unless otherwise approved by the city based on results of a geotechnical investigation.
(2) Remove good topsoil from areas to be graded or filled, and preserve it for use in finishing the grading of all slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%).
(3) Stabilize all graded areas with native vegetation or erosion control blankets as soon as grading is completed or work is interrupted for 30 days or more.
(4) Use mulch to stabilize areas temporarily where final grading must be delayed.
(5) Roughen the surface of all slopes during construction to retain water, increase infiltration and facilitate vegetation.
5. Slope Restoration
a. Cuts and fills shall be restored to a maximum 3:1 (33.3%) slope or flatter and re-vegetated. Slope breaks, such as benches, may be used to reduce the length of cut and fill slopes to limit sheet and rill erosion and prevent gullying (see Figure 12). The required spacing between benches shall be in accordance with the Kentucky Department of Highways Geotechnical Manual. Other methods, such as geotextiles, may be used, however, they must be installed by a qualified geotechnical engineer.
b. Cuts and fills that are controlled by retaining walls must meet the requirements of this ordinance (see Section 10.31, O).
c. Re-vegetated slopes shall include both native trees and shrubs, as per the recommended Plant lists contained within the Planting

I. RIPARIAN PROTECTION, OPEN SPACE AND OUTDOOR AMENITIES
1. Riparian Buffer Requirements
a. The minimum Riparian Buffer width shall be reflective of and interpreted from the Federal Insurance Administrations Flood Insurance Study floodway boundaries, plus an additional 50 feet, however, no less than fifty (50) feet in total width (measured from outline of the creek, as defined within LINK GIS drain layer).
b. If the applicant can demonstrate that the floodway boundaries in their location are inaccurate, boundary revisions may be made, in agreement with the city.
c. Building facades must include additional entrances when oriented toward the Riparian Buffer.
d. The minimum required Riparian Buffer width shall remain undisturbed and restricted in use for flood control and restoration, as regulated in Section 9.25, C., 3., of the Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance.
e. An applicant has the option to obtain additional open space credits by applying a conservation easement to the entire area comprising the Riparian Buffer within the parcel. In such cases, a pedestrian and bicycle trail may be developed within the Riparian Buffer, at least ten (10) feet in width (See Figure 13), in cooperation with the recipient entity. A conservation easement shall count towards:
Figure 12: Benching
Benching is a variation on sloping, and consists of cutting the sides of the excavation to form one or more horizontal levels or steps, usually with vertical or near-vertical surfaces between levels. Soil type and local conditions determine the max horizontal and vertical dimensions of a benched excavation. Often a combination of benching and sloping is used.
Figure 11: Slope Setbacks
Cuts and fills shall not be placed so close as to endanger adjoining property.

7. Collective off-street parking located on another lot must be located within five hundred (500) feet walking distance of the entrance to the use to be served. Said walking access shall provide a safe means of pedestrian access to and from the establishment being served.
8. Reserved spaces shall not be counted in the minimum requirement.
9. Allowance by the board of adjustment for such collective parking facilities, on lots other than the lot upon which the building or use being served is located, should be situated so as to ensure that such locations will not result in added traffic problems, or traffic or pedestrian safety problems.
The board is authorized after consideration to issue a permit for not less than the required parking for the highest use on the premises and any additional parking per use the board determines necessary based on the evidence.
The board of adjustment shall retain continuing approval and review power of Collective Parking for mixed use conditional use. Said review and re-approval or change may be brought before the board of adjustment on its motion or through the appeal process from the Zoning Administrator. Said parking requirements may be increased using the formula outlined above, to assure that whenever the intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises shall be increased through lack of internal control of scheduling, addition of seating capacity, gross floor area, dwelling units, change of use, or other units of measurement specified herein, additional parking spaces shall be provided in the amounts hereafter specified for that use, if the existing parking space is inadequate to serve such increase in intensity of use or scheduling.
F. SHARED PARKING PROVISION: When any land or building is under the same ownership, or upon submission of satisfactory guarantees of the continued operation and proper maintenance of the shared parking facility, and proposed development is for two (2) or more land uses, excluding residential uses, the number of minimum required parking spaces shall be computed by multiplying the minimum number of parking spaces normally required for each land use by the appropriate percentage, as shown in the following shared parking credit table, for each of the five (5) time periods shown. The number of parking spaces required is then determined by adding the results in each column. The column total that generates the highest number of parking spaces becomes the minimum parking requirement.

1. The following requirements shall apply to any shared parking facility for mixed use development.
a. The shared parking facility must be located within five hundred
(500) feet walking distance of the entrance to the establishment to be served. Said walkway access shall provide a safe means of pedestrian access to and from the establishment being served.
b. Reserved spaces shall not be shared.
c. It shall be determined at the time of parking facility plan approval that shared parking is possible and appropriate at the location proposed. Particular attention is needed to assure that sufficient and convenient short-term parking will be available to commercial establishments during the weekday daytime period. The short-term shared parking spaces must be located in the most convenient and visible area of the parking facility nearest the establishment being served.
d. Any subsequent change in use shall require the issuance of a new zoning permit and proof that minimum parking requirements, per these regulations, will be met.
e. Shared parking may be utilized for other uses, which are not shown in the parking credit table. The applicant shall prepare a similar calculation for the proposed uses, indicating the estimated percentage of each time period, based upon current parking information. Documentation shall be submitted by the applicant to
Article XI Off-Street Parking and Access Control Regulations 11-6
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
demonstrate that the normal and regular operating hours of the uses proposing a shared parking arrangement do not coincide or overlap in any manner.
G. DRIVEWAYS NOT COMPUTED AS PART OF REQUIRED PARKING AREA: Entrances, exits, or driveways shall not be computed as any part of a required parking lot or area, except in the case of single-family residential zones, where access driveways may be used for parking.
H. OFF-STREET PARKING SPACE TO BE USED FOR PARKING ONLY: Any vehicle parking space shall be used for parking only. Any other use of such space, including repair work or servicing of any kind, other than in an emergency, or the requirement of any payment for the use of such space, shall be deemed to constitute a separate commercial, use in violation of the provisions of this ordinance.
I. NO BUILDING TO BE ERECTED IN OFF-STREET PARKING SPACE: No building of any kind shall be erected in any off-street parking lot except a parking garage containing parking spaces equal to the requirements set forth in this section of the ordinance or a shelter house/booth for a parking attendant, provided the number of required spaces are not reduced.
J. PARKING PLAN APPROVAL REQUIRED: Plans for all parking lot facilities, including parking garages, shall be submitted to the zoning administrator for review and for compliance with the provisions of this ordinance and such other pertinent ordinances of the city. Such plans shall show the number of spaces and arrangements of parking aisles, location of access points onto adjacent streets, provisions for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, location of sidewalks and curbs on or adjacent to the property, utilities, location of shelters for parking attendant, locations of signs, typical cross-sections of pavement, including base and sub-base, proposed grade of parking lot, storm drainage facilities, location and type of lighting facilities, and such other information or plans as the circumstances may warrant. Where such parking plans include provisions for access points to adjacent streets, then said plans shall also be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Section 11.2.
SECTION 11.1 DESIGN AND LAYOUT OF OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS
A. SIZE OF OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES: For the purposes of this ordinance, one (1) parking space shall be a minimum of nine (9) feet in width and eighteen
(18) feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles. Such parking space shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven (7) feet.
Article XI Off-Street Parking and Access Control Regulations 11-7
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
B. WIDTH OF ACCESS DRIVES: All off-street parking areas shall be laid out with the following minimum aisle or access drive widths:
1. Ninety (90) degrees (perpendicular) parking -- Twenty-two (22) feet (either one or two way circulation)
2. Sixty (60) degree (angle) parking -- Fifteen (15) feet (one way circulation only)
3. Forty-five (45) degree (angle) parking -- Twelve (12) feet (one way circulation only)
4. Thirty (30) degree (angle) parking -- Eleven (11) feet (one way circulation only)
5. Zero degree (parallel) parking -- Twelve (12) feet (one way circulation)
When any combination of these types of parking is used (facing the same aisle) the most restricted aisle or access drive width requirements shall prevail. In addition, a two (2) foot overhang may be permitted on the external sides of a parking area.
If the width of the parking space is increased over nine (9) feet, the drive aisle width can be decreased proportionally (two (2) foot width in drive aisle per one
(1) foot increase in space width) except that a drive aisle for two-way traffic may not be decreased below twenty (20) feet in width and a drive aisle for one-way traffic may not be decreased below eleven (11) feet in width.
C. ACCESS TO OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES: Each required parking space shall be connected with a deeded public right-of-way by means of aisles or access drives as required by Section 11.1, B. The parking area shall be so designed to ensure that all maneuvering into and out of each parking space shall take place entirely within property lines of lots, garages, and/or storage areas.
D. OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS IN MULTI-FAMILY, COMMERCIAL, OR INDUSTRIAL ZONES: All such parking areas shall have a protective wall and/or bumper blocks around the perimeter of said parking area and shall be so designed that all vehicles leaving the facility will be traveling forward to approaching traffic. All parking shall be effectively screened on each side adjoining or fronting on any property situated in a zone permitting single-family residential development, by a solid wall, fence, or densely planted compact hedge, as regulated by Section 9.17 of this ordinance. Ground cover shrubs and trees shall be located and maintained so as to not interfere with vehicular and pedestrian traffic on the property or with sight distance clearance at entrances and exits.
Article XI Off-Street Parking and Access Control Regulations 11-8
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
E. LIGHTING: Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall not glare upon any right-of-way or adjacent property.
F. PAVING OF NEW OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS: All new off-street parking areas shall be paved with asphalt concrete or Portland Cement concrete and shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Appendix A.

SECTION 11.3 ACCESS CONTROL REGULATIONS
In order to promote greater safety of passage between highway and land, improve the convenience and ease of movement of travelers on the highway, permit reasonable speeds and economy of travel, and increase and protect the capacity of the highway, the location and design of access points shall be in accordance with the following access control requirements. These requirements shall apply to all arterial and collector type streets, as identified in the adopted comprehensive plan.
A. PROVISION OF RESERVED TURNING LANES: At those access points where vehicles turning to and from the arterial and collector streets will affect the roadway capacity, reserved turn lanes shall be constructed by the developer.
B. PROVISION OF FRONTAGE ROAD: Where possible, provision for the construction of a frontage road shall be made. However, access to the arterial or collector streets via an intersecting street or a common driveway shall be investigated if such a design is not reasonable.
C. COORDINATION OF ACCESS POINTS: Major Access points on opposite sides of the arterial and collector streets shall be located opposite each other, otherwise turning movement restrictions may be imposed by the planning commission or zoning administrator, whichever is applicable. In addition, in order to maximize the efficient utilization of access points, access drives shall be designed, located, and constructed in a manner to provide and make possible the coordination of access with, and between, adjacent properties developed (present or future) for similar uses. As a condition of approval for construction, use, or reuse of any access road, the zoning administrator may require that unobstructed and unencumbered access, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, be provided from any such access point to adjacent properties.
D. SPACING RESTRICTIONS FOR SIGNALIZED ACCESS POINTS: Access points which will warrant signalization shall be spaced a minimum distance of one quarter (1/4) mile apart. The exact location of the signal light shall be determined by a traffic engineering study which shall at least account for the following variables:
1. Speed
2. Traffic signal phasing
3. Traffic signal cycle length
4. Roadway geometrics
5. Accident experience
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
Article XI Off-Street Parking and Access Control Regulations 11-17
Provision for all turning movements to maintain the design capacity of the roadway shall be required.
E. SIGHT DISTANCE: The location of access points shall comply with safe sight distance requirements, as provided in Table 1. The centerline of all access points shall intersect as nearly at a ninety (90) degree angle as possible, but in no case shall the angle of intersection be less than seventy-five (75) degrees or greater than one hundred five (105) degrees, unless approved by the planning commission or zoning administrator, whichever is applicable, due to certain exceptional conditions.
F. LOCATION OF UNSIGNALIZED ACCESS POINTS
1. Arterial Streets
a. Unsignalized access points shall be spaced a minimum distance of six hundred (600) feet apart. Turning restrictions and/or reserved lanes may be required.
b. One (1) access point per existing tract will be permitted. However, if the spacing requirements for a direct access point onto an arterial street (as provided in F., 1., a., above) cannot be met, then an access point may be located on a frontage road, or on an intersecting local street, or share a common driveway that meets the spacing requirements. In order for the intersecting local street or frontage road to function properly, access onto them should be controlled as follows:
(1) Access points onto local streets intersecting an arterial street shall be spaced a minimum distance of one hundred (100) feet, measured from point of curb return to point of curb return, from the arterial street.
(2) In areas zoned to permit commercial, industrial, or multi- family residential uses, access points from adjacent properties onto frontage roads, shall be no less than one hundred (100) feet, measured from point of curb return to point of curb return, from intersections of the frontage road with local or collector streets.
c. Where the frontage of a tract is greater than five hundred (500) feet an additional access point may be permitted. However, the type of access will depend on the spacing requirements in F., 1., a.
(1) If the frontage of the tract is large enough, then at least one
(1) of the access points may have direct access onto the arterial street, provided the spacing between the adjacent
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
Article XI Off-Street Parking and Access Control Regulations 11-18
access points meet the requirements of Section F., 1., a., and all other requirements of this section of the ordinance. In the case where the frontage allows only one (1) point of direct access, due to spacing restrictions as provided herein, the second access point will be via a frontage road, or an intersecting local street, or share a common driveway that meets the spacing restrictions, as provided along the arterial street.
d. If a tract of land has no means of access that would meet the requirements of this section of the ordinance, one (1) access point shall be provided. However, all such access points shall be considered a temporary right-of-way and may be terminated, reduced, limited to certain turning movements, or caused to be relocated by the zoning administrator at such time as the particular use served by the access point changes and/or the property is otherwise provided an alternate means of access via a frontage road, or an intersecting local street, or sharing of a common driveway. Provisions for the construction of a frontage road, restricted turning movements, or other improvements, may be required, as a condition to approval, in order to minimize the number of access points and congestion to the adjacent street. In all cases where said access points are classified as temporary, such designation shall be duly noted on the plot plan or site plan submitted for a zoning permit and also upon the deed of the property in question.
2. Collector Streets
a. On two-lane roadways, one (1) access point per existing tract will be allowed. However, if the frontage is greater than five hundred
(500) feet, an additional access point may be permitted. Furthermore, the minimum spacing between adjacent access points on this type of facility shall be one hundred (100) feet, measured from point of curb return to point of curb return, except in the case where the street intersects another collector street or arterial street, then said access points shall be spaced a minimum of three hundred (300) feet from the intersection.
b. On multi-lane roadways, the spacing is dependent on whether or not a barrier median exists (prohibiting left-turn movements). If a barrier median exists, access points may be spaced as close as three hundred (300) feet. However, certain turning movements will be prohibited. If a barrier median does not exist, then the minimum
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
Article XI Off-Street Parking and Access Control Regulations 11-19
spacing of access points shall be six hundred (600) feet. In addition, some turning movements may be prohibited.
c. One (1) access point per existing tract will be allowed. However, if the spacing requirements for a direct access point, as provided in F., 2., a., cannot be met, then an access point may be located on a frontage road, or on an intersecting street, or share a common driveway that meets the spacing requirements.
d. If a tract of land has no means of access that would meet the requirements of this section of the ordinance, one (1) access point shall be provided. However, all such access points shall be considered a temporary right-of-way and may be terminated, reduced, limited to certain turning movements, or caused to be relocated by the zoning administrator at such time as the particular use served by the access point changes and/or the property is otherwise provided an alternate means of access via a frontage road, or an intersecting local street, or sharing of a common driveway. Provisions for the construction of a frontage road, restricted turning movements, or other improvements, may be required, as a condition to approval, in order to minimize the number of access points and congestion to the adjacent street. In all cases where said access points are classified as temporary, such designation shall be duly noted on the plot plan or site plan submitted for a zoning permit and also upon the deed of the property in question.
G. WIDTH OF ACCESS POINTS
1. In single-family residential zones, no access point width shall be less than nine (9) feet nor more than twenty (20) feet. In all other zones, access points shall not be less than twelve (12) feet nor more than forty-eight (48) feet in width. The width shall be as measured from the point of curb return to point of curb return, or edge of pavement if no curb exists, excluding the curb radius.
2. The zoning administrator may modify (enlarge or reduce) the width to provide for a more efficient and safe channelization and/or flow of traffic.
H. EXCEPTIONS TO ACCESS POINT REQUIREMENTS: Where situations develop that may require special treatment, the requirements as provided in Section 11.2,
A. - G., may be varied, provided that a traffic engineering report is prepared by a qualified traffic engineer, establishing that the special treatment will have no adverse effects on the roadway safety and capacity.
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance May 2016 PDS
Article XI Off-Street Parking and Access Control Regulations 11-20
I. ACCESS POINT PROBLEM AREAS: If, after special study, it is determined that the type of use or activity proposed would have an adverse effect on the safety and capacity of the adjacent roadway, the access point spacing requirements, as contained in this section, may have to be increased in order to adequately solve the traffic movement.
J. APPROVAL OF ACCESS POINTS REQUIRED: Plans for all access points, and modifications thereto (including plans to use existing access points where a change of use for any tract of land would generate more traffic than the previous use, thus producing an adverse effect on the adjacent roadway), shall be submitted to the zoning administrator and Planning and Development Services of Kenton County staff, at a scale not less than 1 inch = 100 feet. No action of approving or rejecting these plans by the zoning administrator shall be taken until a review and recommendation of said plans has been made by Planning and Development Services of Kenton County staff. Such plans shall show the location of all access points, and access points within six hundred (600) feet in either direction. The proposed access point shall include typical cross-sections of pavement, the base and subbase, proposed grade, and storm drainage, and such other information or plans as the circumstances may warrant. If such access points are being located in conjunction with off-street parking and/or loading and unloading facilities, then said plans shall also include parking and
off-street loading and/or unloading plans, in accordance with Sections 11.0 and
12.0 of this ordinance.
K. APPROVAL OF ACCESS POINTS ALONG STATE MAINTAINED ROUTES BY KENTUCKY DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION: A copy of the Plans for all access points to be constructed along a state maintained route shall also be submitted to the Kentucky Department of Transportation for review and approval during the same time as plans are submitted to the zoning administrator, as provided for in Section 11.2. No access point plans shall be approved, or permits issued, for construction by the zoning administrator, until said access point plans have been approved by the Kentucky Department of Transportation.

Values are for urban conditions. On rural streets, distances are to be increased by ten
(10) percent to allow for greater reaction time.
The sight distances apply when street grades are zero (0) percent to three (3) percent, either up or down. When an upgrade is steeper than three (3) percent, adjustments are to be made to compensate for the longer time required to reach the speed of highway traffic. The time is less than shown when the highway is descending. Adjustment factors apply to grades only in that portion of the road between the access points and the downstream point at which a vehicle emerging from the access points has been able to accelerate to within ten (10) miles per hour of the route speed.
When the street, in the section to be used for acceleration after leaving the access point, ascends at three (3) percent to four (4) percent, then sight distances in the direction of approaching ascending traffic are to be increased by a factor of 1.4. When the access point ascends at five (5) percent to six (6) percent, sight distances should be increased by a factor of 1.7.
When the street, in the section to be used for acceleration after leaving the access point, descends at three (3) percent to four (4) percent, then sight distances in the direction of approaching descending traffic are to be reduced by a factor of 0.6. If the road descends at five (5) percent to six (6) percent, sight distances should be reduced by a factor of 0.5.
When the criteria for sight distances to the right cannot be met, the need can be eliminated by prohibiting left turns by exiting vehicles.

ARTICLE XII
OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING REGULATIONS
SECTION 12.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
For all buildings and structures erected, altered, or extended, and all uses of land established as specified herein, after the effective date of this ordinance, off-street loading and/or unloading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations herein. However, where a building permit has been issued prior to the date of the adoption of this ordinance, and provided that construction has not begun within ninety
(90) days of such effective date, off-street loading and/or unloading facilities in the amounts required by this ordinance, shall prevail.
A. SPACES REQUIRED
1. Every building, or part thereof, erected and occupied for uses permitted in commercial and industrial zones, including conditional uses permitted in residential zones, involving the receipt or distribution of vehicles, materials, or merchandise, and having up to five thousand (5,000) square feet of gross floor area, shall be provided with at least one (1) loading and/or unloading space. A study shall be prepared by the company or operator to determine the additional loading and/or unloading space needs over and above the first space required for the specific use proposed. In determining the number of spaces needed, the study shall take into the consideration the following:
a. estimated and projected arrival and departure rates for scheduled and unscheduled (random) trucks
b. estimated and projected length of truck stop duration for loading and/or unloading of each truck
c. estimated number of trips by vehicle type (i.e., two axle vehicles, semi-tractor trailers, etc.) and size
The zoning administrator shall review the study of estimated and projected loading and/or unloading needs and make a determination if the number of spaces provided are adequate for the use proposed.
2. If it is determined by the zoning administrator, based on existing conditions of the proposed site, the design of the building, and the completed needs study, that additional loading and/or unloading spaces
Article XII Off-Street Loading And/Or Unloading Regulations 12-2
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2000 PDS
are needed to accommodate the facilities than could be reasonably provided, the zoning administrator shall require that additional parking areas, properly designed to handle the parking of necessary trucks, including the maneuvering of the trucks to and from the space, be provided for the storage of trucks waiting to be loaded and/or unloaded.
3. If, after approval by the zoning administrator of the number of spaces and any storage of truck parking needed to accommodate the loading and/or unloading of trucks for a specific use, a need exists, based on operation of the specific use, to provide additional off-street loading and/or unloading spaces or storage of trucks than was previously determined, the zoning administrator may require that corrective action be taken to eliminate any deficiencies as follows:
a. limit the time and interval of arrival and departure of trucks, commensurate with the need
b. require necessary additional loading and/or unloading spaces, or require that adequate parking areas be provided for the storage of trucks waiting to be loaded and/or unloaded
B. ADDITIONAL LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING SPACES TO BE PROVIDED: Whenever the intensity of any use of a building, or premises is increased through addition of gross floor area, change of use, or increased activity, additional loading and/or unloading spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 12.0, A., above, if it is determined by the zoning administrator that the existing spaces are not adequate to serve such increase in intensity.
C. LOCATION OF OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING AREA: All loading and/or unloading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use served. However, permitted uses located in industrial zones may provide parking areas for the storage of trucks waiting to be loaded and/or unloaded within three hundred (300) feet from each lot served, upon the approval of the zoning administrator, provided that said off-street storage of trucks are unable to be provided on the same lot, or contiguous to the same lot, as the use being served and further provided that said storage of trucks is located in the same zone as the use being served. Loading and/or unloading areas may be located in the side and minimum required rear yards, provided that all loading and/or unloading facilities shall be set back a minimum of ten (10) feet from the rear lot line and minimum side yard clearances are maintained.
Unloading facilities shall be set back a minimum of ten (10) feet from the rear lot line and minimum side yard clearances are maintained.
Article XII Off-Street Loading And/Or Unloading Regulations 12-3
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2000 PDS
D. DRIVEWAYS NOT COMPUTED AS PART OF REQUIRED LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING AREA: Entrances, exits, or driveways shall not be computed as any part of a required loading and/or unloading space.
E. OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING SPACE TO BE USED FOR LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING ONLY: Any loading and/or unloading space shall be used for loading and/or unloading only. Any other use of such space, including repair work or servicing of any kind, other than in an emergency, or the requirement of any payment for the use of such space, shall be in violation of the provisions of this ordinance.
F. NO BUILDING TO BE ERECTED IN OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING SPACE: No building of any kind shall be erected in any off-street loading and/or unloading space.
G. OFF-STREET LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING SPACE SHALL NOT BE REDUCED: The required parking spaces, as set forth and designated in this ordinance, shall not be reduced, except as provided for in this ordinance.
H. LOADING AND/OR UNLOADING PLAN APPROVAL REQUIRED: Plans for all loading and/or unloading facilities shall be submitted to the zoning administrator for review and for compliance with the provisions of this ordinance and such other pertinent ordinances of the legislative body. Such plans shall show the number and location of loading and/or unloading spaces, including necessary maneuvering of trucks, and dock and apron approach, and arrangements of access aisles, location of access points onto adjacent streets, provisions for truck circulation, location of curbs on or adjacent to the property, utilities, location of signs, typical cross-sections of pavement, including base and subbase, proposed grade of lot, storm drainage facilities, location and type of lighting facilities, and such other information or plans as the circumstances may warrant.

ARTICLE XIV
SIGN REGULATIONS
SECTION 14.1 SHORT TITLE: This Article shall be known as the Sign Article of Fort Wright.
SECTION 14.2 PURPOSE AND INTERESTS SERVED
A. The purpose of this Article is to establish a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of signs within the jurisdiction of the City of Fort Wright These regulations are designed to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare by controlling the type, number, location and physical dimensions of signs, to prevent the disruptions, obstructions and hazards to vehicular and pedestrian traffic that signs may cause, and to enhance the quality of the environment in residential and nonresidential districts.
As a basis for adopting these regulations, the City of Fort Wright finds:
1. Signs are an essential form of communication in the built environment, providing way-finding guides to residents, visitors, public safety officials, customers and potential customers of local businesses, delivery people and others.
2. Signs also provide communication on public issues, as the U.S. Supreme Court found in City of LaDue v. Gilleo: Signs that react to a local happening or express a view on a controversial issue both reflect and animate change in the life of a community. Often placed on lawns or in windows, residential signs play an important part in political campaigns, during which they are displayed to signal the resident's support for particular candidates, parties, or causes. They may not afford the same opportunities for conveying complex ideas as do other media, but residential signs have long been an important and distinct medium of expression.
3. Retailers and other businesses depend on signs to help people find their businesses, and, in a large and expensive media market like that of Cincinnati (a market which includes Fort Wright), many small businesses depend on signs as one of the most affordable forms of advertising.
4. Although signs thus serve many important purposes in society in general and in Fort Wright in particular, there are other considerations that the City of Fort Wright weighs heavily.
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-2
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
5. Signs may distract drivers and lead to deaths and injuries to pedestrians and cyclists as well as to drivers and passengers and to property damage. Moving, flashing and rapidly changing signs are particularly distracting to drivers. A proliferation of signs on a particular site can have the same effect as moving signs, as drivers try to sort through the visual cacophony to find the information that they want or need.
6. The Fort Wright City Council, with the advice of the Kenton County Planning Commission and its professional staff, and with input from residents through the Direction 2030: Your Voice. Your Choice. planning process, has placed an increasing emphasis on preserving the sense of place and the design of the built environment; limiting the size, height and number of signs is an important tool in preserving a sense of place, a tool that accompanies the Countys standards for landscaping.
7. Direction 2030: Your Voice. Your Choice. recommends that policies, regulations and incentives be developed and implemented that preserve and improve the existing community fabric.
8. Balancing these competing considerations is particularly difficult in residential areas, where people value both their pleasing and visually appealing environments and their ability to communicate their opinions regarding candidates and public issues through yard signs.
9. In updating its ordinance in 2016 after the Supreme Courts landmark decision in Reed v. Town of Gilbert, the Fort Wright City Council, working with PDS staff and an outside consultant, has made a major effort to limit content as a factor in its sign regulations. After due consideration, however, it has concluded that one way to leave room for extensive free expression through signs in residential areas while limiting total sign clutter is to maintain significant limits on commercial signs in residential areas. Recognizing the importance of for sale and for lease signs in maintaining the occupancy of healthy neighborhoods (see the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro), those signs must remain. There is a similar utility in providing for yard sale signs, which allow people to dispose of unwanted items without sending them to a landfill.
10. Although as the Court found in Reed v Gilbert, time limits on signs can be arbitrary, as the Court recognized in 2009 in Pleasant Grove v. City of Summum, a significant distinction between speakers expressing an opinion and signs is that Speakers, however long-winded, will eventually come to the end of their remarks. Members of the Fort Wright City Council have long noted that signs for political campaigns as well as those advertising pancake breakfasts and spaghetti dinners for civic organizations are often abandoned after the events, contributing to clutter long after they have served their purpose. Although such signs were once typically paper or cardboard that would eventually decay, many today are plastic and will remain until removed. Thus, despite the expressed
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-3
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
concern of the Supreme Court with time limits, the Fort Wright City Council finds that it has a substantial governmental interest in clarifying the status of signs for past events that thus no longer serve a purpose so that there is a legal basis for the City of Fort Wright to remove them or force their removal.
11. The City of Fort Wright has long allowed unlimited numbers of small signs bearing non-commercial messages to allow merchants and others to designate handicapped parking places, provide directions to ATMs and restrooms, warn of guard dogs and other hazards and provide a variety of other place-based information. With the prohibition of commercial messages on such signs, it has been the observation of the Fort Wright City Council members and their professional staff members that property owners are judicious and appropriate in posting such signs. The City of Fort Wright thus finds that it has a substantial interest in allowing merchants and property owners freely to post necessary informational signs but without allowing an endless proliferation of commercial messages.
12. Although in findings above the City of Fort Wright has recognized the multiple values of signs in the built environment, Fort Wright officials after consultation with the Planning Commission and representatives of cities and towns in the County concluded several years ago that there is no place for signs of overwhelming size and no relation to context in an urban and urbanizing environment like Fort Wright. Although previous versions of these regulations followed the pattern of state and federal laws by defining such billboard as off-site signs, this ordinance addresses the same issue by establishing a form of circuit breaker size limit, prohibiting very large signs on small lots, on vacant lots, or on lots with only small buildings.
13. These are complex public policy issues, and the Fort Wright City Council with the help of its professional planners, attorneys and outside consultant, has attempted to balance the competing considerations in a way that it believes best protects the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Fort Wright, including its many valued businesses and the tens of thousands of visitors who arrive or pass through the City of Fort Wright each month.

SECTION 14.15 MASTER SIGNAGE PLANS
A. PURPOSE AND INTENT
1. It is the purpose of the City of Fort Wright to require owners, lessees and managers of sites containing multiple signs requiring permits to plan and design signs that are compatible with the buildings on the site, thus enhancing the appearance of the site and of the streetscape that includes it. This Section spells out specific criteria for review for compliance with the section, but the City of Fort Wright recognizes that the consideration of issues of design necessarily requires some exercise of judgment, within the specific criteria set out in this Section. Although the City of Fort Wright has provided a remedy of appeal for an applicant aggrieved by an action on a proposed master signage plan, it is the intent of the City of Fort Wright that the primary remedy for such an applicant is the erection and installation of all of the signs allowed by right, under other sections of this Article. It is thus the intent of the City of Fort Wright, that, to the extent that it can guide the scope of review of a court considering an appeal, a court considering an appeal under this
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-33
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
Section reverses or remands the decision of the Zoning Administrator only if it finds that such action is arbitrary and capricious.
B. APPLICABILITY
1. The owner of any site that includes more than one tenant or occupant shall apply for approval of a Master Signage Plan before applying for a sign permit for any detached sign.
C. PROCEDURE
1. The submittal of a Master Signage Plan shall be considered a Stage II Development Plan.
2. The owner(s) shall apply to the planning commissions duly authorized representative.
3. Where an application for approval of a Master Signage Plan is submitted simultaneously or as part of another Stage II Development Plan, the two shall be processed together. Where an application includes properties not under common ownership, all property owners shall sign the application or shall submit documents granting the applicant the authority to process such an application.
4. The planning commissions duly authorized representative shall review the submitted Stage II Development Plan with regard to its compliance with the required elements of this Section, for Master Signage Plans, other applicable elements of this Article, and other applicable regulations, and its conformity with any approved Stage I Development Plan for the property. In approving the Master Signage Plan, the planning commissions duly authorized representative may authorize minor adjustments from the Stage I Development Plan.
5. If a Master Signage Plan application is denied, the applicant may submit a new application with a revised plan at any time.
6. Any person aggrieved by the action of the planning commissions duly authorized representative on a Master Signage Plan may appeal the decision by filing an application with the Planning Commission.
D. APPLICATION CONTENTS
1. The application for approval of a Master Signage Plan shall contain at least the following information. Where the application is submitted simultaneously with an application for a Stage II Development Plan approval, the Master Signage Plan may refer to portions of the Stage II Development Plan application or approved Stage I Development Plan for related requirements:
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-34
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
a. If the site has not been improved, all information required by Section 9.20, B., for a Stage II Development Plan;

c. A proposed design plan showing signage design at a scale of 1/2 = 1 ft
d. Computation of the maximum area for all signs, the height of signs and the number of detached signs allowed on the development site(s) included in the plan under this Article, including incentives authorized below;
e. For properties with multiple tenants or multiple occupants entitled to signs, an allocation of the allowed signage among the eligible tenants or users;
f. An accurate indication on the plot plan of the current or proposed location of each present and future sign of any type, whether requiring a permit or not, except that signs not requiring permits need not be shown;
g. The color schemes and design features (excluding specific messages) for proposed signs; and
h. The signatures of all owners or their authorized agents in such form as the legislative body may require.
E. AMENDMENTS
1. A Master Signage Plan may be amended by filing a new Master Signage Plan that conforms to all requirements of this Section in effect at the time of submittal.
F. PROVISIONS FOR NONCONFORMING SIGNS
1. A Master Signage Plan for a property already containing signs on the date of submission of the application shall include a schedule for bringing all signs on the development site into conformance with the Master Signage Plan by a specified date. The conformance schedule included in such Master Signage Plan shall be considered a condition of approval of the Master Signage Plan.
G. CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL
1. A Master Signage Plan shall be approved if and only if the planning commissions duly authorized representative finds that the proposed plan meets all of the standards set out in this Article. If the planning commissions duly authorized representative finds that the proposed plan substantially meets such standards, it may approve the proposed plan
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-35
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
subject to conditions that will cause it to meet these standards. Otherwise, the planning commissions duly authorized representative shall deny the application for plan approval:
a. Each proposed sign conforms with all applicable standards of this Article;
b. The total amount of signage proposed for any building, wall, site, or portion of a site, conforms with all applicable standards of this Article;
c. The proposed plan contains all of the information required by subsection D of this Section
d. The proposed allocation of allowed signage among eligible tenants, which shall be proportional to one of or a combination of the following criteria:

(3) The façade area of the building elevation(s) containing the public entrances to the spaces leased to or controlled by each tenant or occupant.
e. All proposed signs shall be part of a common design scheme, meeting at least the following criteria:
(1) The materials and design of all wall signs shall follow one design scheme;
(2) The materials and design of freestanding signs shall follow one design scheme, which may or may not be the same as the design scheme for wall signs;
(3) Each design scheme shall require consistency among signs for at least three of the following criteria: lighting design; color schemes; materials; shape; proportion; and/or typefaces;
(4) If the design schemes for the wall signs and freestanding signs are different, they shall have in common at least two of the following criteria: lighting design; color schemes; materials; proportion; and
(5) The design scheme for freestanding signs shall use building materials, colors and, where applicable, architectural design features consistent with the materials, colors and architectural design features of the principal building on the site.
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-36
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
H. EFFECT
1. After approval of a Master Signage Plan, no permit shall be issued for a sign on the site(s) subject to the Master Signage Plan except in accordance with such plan, and no sign shall be erected, placed, painted, or maintained, except in accordance with such plan, and such plan may be enforced in the same way as any provision of this Article. In case of any conflict between a provision of a Master Signage Plan and one or more provisions of this Article, this Article shall prevail.
I. SPECIAL SEVERABILITY PROVISIONS
1. The severability provisions of Section 14.19, A., 11., are limited by this subsection. If any procedural aspect of this Section is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, it is the intent of the City of Fort Wright that this entire Section, but only this Section, should be stricken as unconstitutional, but that any plans previously approved under it should remain in effect, allowing the signs shown on such plans as lawful nonconforming signs, regardless of whether such signs have been erected on the date of such decision. If any substantive part of the standards and criteria for approval of this Section is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional it is the intent of the City of Fort Wright that such part be stricken and that the rest of this Section remain in full force and effect, in accordance with the principles set out in more detail in Section 14.19, A., 11.
SECTION 14.16 PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES

SECTION 14.18 DEFINITIONS AND MEASUREMENTS
A. MEASUREMENTS
1. Area of Signs Other than Wall Signs
a. The gross surface area of a sign, except wall signs, is the entire area contained within a single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of such sign. For detached signs composed of more than one sign cabinet or module, the gross surface area shall include the sum of the area in each cabinet or module only. If a sign has more than one face, the gross surface area shall be equal to the maximum area of the sign face or faces visible from any ground position along any public right-of-way at any one time.
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-41
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
b. The perimeter of a sign will not include lighting fixtures, pole covers, landscaping, framing, decorative roofing, moldings or aprons or other architectural or decorative embellishments, provided they contain no written copy, logos or symbols.
2. Area of Wall Signs
a. The gross surface area of a wall sign is the entire area contained within a single continuous perimeter composed of any straight line geometric figure(s) which encloses the extreme limits of the advertising message(s). If the sign is composed of individual letters or symbols using the wall as the background with no added decoration, color or embellishment, the total sign area shall be calculated by measuring the area within the perimeter of each symbol or letter. The combined area of the individual figures shall be considered the total sign area.
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-42
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
3. Computation of Area of Multifaced Signs
a. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than forty-two (42) inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the face
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-43
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
4. Measurement of Height of Sign
a. Sign height shall be measured from the elevation at the base of the sign to the highest point of the highest element of the sign, excluding any incidental structural element, such as an uplift cable for a projecting sign. Where the sign is located on a hill, the average elevation of the land which the sign will be placed upon shall be used as a basis for measuring the height. A sign may be located on a mound or berm up to three feet in height without the mound or berm being counted towards the overall height of the sign.
SECTION 14.19 POLICIES AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION
A. This Article shall be administered, enforced and construed in accordance with the following policies.
1. DISCRETIONARY REVIEW
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-44
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
a. When one or more signs are part of a project or development, or a variance, conditional use permit, exception or special use permit is sought for sign(s), which requires discretionary review, then the sign shall be reviewed without regard to the graphic design or visual image on the display face of the sign, and discretion shall be restricted to structural, location and other non-communicative aspects of the sign. This provision does not override the billboard policy.
2. MESSAGE NEUTRALITY
a. It is the City of Fort Wright policy to regulate signs in a constitutional manner.
3. REGULATIONS ON OFF-SITE MESSAGES
a. This Article distinguishes in some cases between commercial messages that relate to products or services not offered at the location of the sign (off-site commercial messages). The purpose of that distinction is to acknowledge the need of businesses for identification and notice of their businesses at a business location while limiting the proliferation of commercial messages generally. There is no intent to limit noncommercial messages in any way with this distinction.
4. BILLBOARD POLICY
a. New billboards, as defined herein, are prohibited. The City of Fort Wright completely prohibits the construction, erection or use of any billboards, other than those which legally exist within the regulatory zoning jurisdiction of the City of Fort Wright, or for which a valid permit has been issued and has not expired, as of the date on which this provision is first adopted. No permit shall be issued for any billboard which violates this policy, and the City of Fort Wright will take immediate enforcement or abatement action against any billboard constructed or maintained in violation of this policy. In adopting this provision, the City of Fort Wright affirmatively declares that it would have adopted this billboard policy even if it were the only provision in this Article. The City of Fort Wright intends for this billboard policy to be severable and separately enforceable even if other provision(s) of this Article may be declared, by a court of competent jurisdiction, to be unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable.
5. MESSAGE SUBSTITUTION
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-45
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
a. Subject to the property owners consent, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted in whole or in part for the message displayed on any sign for which the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. In addition, any on-site commercial message may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any other on-site commercial message, provided that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, lot or land use; does not affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted; does not allow a change in the physical structure of a sign or its mounting device; and does not allow the substitution of an off-site commercial message in place of an on-site commercial message or a noncommercial message.
6. REGULATORY INTERPRETATIONS
a. All regulatory interpretations of this Article are to be exercised in light of the City of Fort Wright message neutrality and message substitution policies. Where a particular type of sign is proposed in a permit application, and the type is neither expressly allowed nor prohibited by this Article, or whenever a sign does not qualify as a structure as defined in the building code then in effect, then the Zoning Administrator shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the application based on the most similar sign type that is expressly regulated by this Article, in light of the policies stated in this Section.
7. NONCOMMUNICATIVE ASPECTS
a. All rules and regulations concerning the non-communicative aspects of signs, such as location, size, height, illumination, spacing, orientation, etc., stand enforceable independently of any permit or approval process.
8. MIXED USE ZONES AND OVERLAY ZONES
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-46
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
a. In any zone where both residential and non-residential uses are allowed, the sign-related rights and responsibilities applicable to any particular parcel or land use shall be determined as follows: (1) if specific sign regulations are provided in the zoning district, those regulations shall be applied; or (2) if no sign regulations are provided in the zoning district, residential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a zone where a use of that type would be allowed as a matter of right, and nonresidential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a zone where that particular use would be allowed, either as a matter of right or subject to a conditional use permit or similar discretionary process.
9. PROPERTY OWNERS CONSENT
a. No sign may be displayed without the consent of the legal owner(s) of the property on which the sign is mounted or displayed. For purposes of this policy, owner means the holder of the legal title to the property and all parties and persons holding a present right to possession, control or use of the property. The signature of the property owner or authorized agent will be required on all applications for sign permits.
10. LEGAL NATURE OF SIGN RIGHTS
a. As to all signs attached to real property, the signage rights, duties and obligations arising from this Article attach to and travel with the land or other property on which a sign is mounted or displayed. This provision does not modify or affect the law of fixtures, sign-related provisions in private leases regarding signs (so long as they are not in conflict with this Article or other law), or the ownership of sign structures. This provision does not apply to hand held signs or other images which are aspects of personal appearance.
11. SEVERABILITY
a. Generally
(1) If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this Article is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence,
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-47
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
phrase, clause, term or word of this Article, except as limited by Section 14.19, A., 11., b.

(1) Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in subsection A of this Section or elsewhere in this Article or this Code, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term or word of this Article is declared unconstitutional, such declaration shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term or word of this Article, even if such severability would result in a situation where there would be less speech, whether by subjecting previously exempt signs to permitting or otherwise additional standards.
c. Severability of Provisions Pertaining to Prohibited Signs
(1) Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in subsection A of this Section, or elsewhere in this Article or in this Code, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term or word of this Article or any other laws declared unconstitutional by valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term or word of this Article that pertains to prohibited signs, including specifically those signs and sign types prohibited and not allowed under Section 14.5 of this Article. Furthermore, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term or word of this Article or of any part of the Zoning Ordinance is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term or word of this Article, except as expressly provided in Section 14.19, A., 11., b.
d. Severability of Prohibition on Off-premise Signs
Article XIV Sign Regulations 14-48
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance November 2018 PDS
(1) If any part section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term or word of this Article and/or an other provisions of this Article or other provisions of Zoning Ordinance or this Code are declared invalid or unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect the limitations on off-premise signs as contained herein.

A. The zoning administrator shall give written notice, by registered mail or certified mail, to the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation. The notice shall describe the particulars of the alleged violation and the reasons why the
Article XVI Administration 16-8
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2000 PDS
zoning administrator believes there is a violation in fact, and shall require an answer or correction of the alleged violation, to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of such notification. The notice shall state that failure to reply or to correct the alleged violation, to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice, constitutes admission of violation of the terms of this ordinance.
B. The notice shall further state that, upon request of those to whom said notice is directed, a technical investigation will be made by a qualified expert or experts and that, if violations as alleged are found, costs of such investigations shall be charged against those responsible for the violations, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate, but that if it is determined that no violation exists, the cost of the investigation will be paid by the legislative body.
C. If there is no reply within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice, but the alleged violation is corrected to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, he shall note "violation corrected" on his copy of the notice, and shall retain it among his official records, taking such other action as may be warranted.
D. If there is no reply within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice and the alleged violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator within the established time limit, he shall proceed to take, or cause to be taken, such action as is warranted by continuation of a violation after notice to cease.
E. If a reply is received within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice indicating that the alleged violation will be corrected to the satisfaction of the zoning administrator, but requesting additional time, the zoning administrator may grant an extension if he deems it warranted in the circumstances of the case and if the extension will not, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life, health, or property.
F. If a reply is received within thirty (30) consecutive calendar days of receipt of said notice requesting technical determination as provided in this ordinance, and if the alleged violations continue, the zoning administrator shall call in properly qualified experts to investigate and determine whether violations exist.
If expert findings indicate violations of the performance standards, the costs of
Article XVI Administration 16-9
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2000 PDS
the investigations shall be assessed against the properties or persons responsible for the violations, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate under the terms of Section 16.9 of this ordinance.
If no violation is found, the cost of the investigation shall be paid by the legislative body without assessment against the properties or persons involved.

1. Before any variance is granted, the board of adjustment must find that the granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or welfare, will not alter the essential character of the general vicinity, will not cause a hazard or a nuisance to the public, and will not allow an unreasonable circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. In making these findings, the board shall consider whether:
Article XVIII Board Of Adjustment 18-6
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2000 PDS
a. The requested variance arises from special circumstances which do not generally apply to land in the general vicinity, or in the same zone;
b. The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an unnecessary hardship on the applicant; and
c. The circumstances are the result of actions of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is sought.
2. The board shall deny any request for a variance arising from circumstances that are the result of willful violations of this ordinance by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of this ordinance from which relief is sought.
3. Such variance shall not be granted by the board of adjustment unless and until:
a. A written application for a variance (including the required fee per Section 19.0 of this ordinance) and a Site Plan, subject to the applicable requirements of Section 9.19, are submitted.
b. Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with Section 18.1 of this ordinance.

(1) The board of adjustment shall make findings that the requirements of this section have been met by the applicant for a variance.
(2) The board of adjustment shall further make a finding that reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of a variance and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
e. In granting any variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe
Article XVIII Board Of Adjustment 18-7
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2000 PDS
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance and punishable under Section 16.9 of this ordinance.
B. VARIANCE CANNOT CONTRADICT ZONING REGULATION: The board of adjustment shall not possess the power to grant a variance to permit a use of any land, building, or structure which is not permitted by this ordinance in the zone in question, or to alter the density of dwelling unit requirements in the zone in question.
C. VARIANCE RUNS WITH LAND: A variance applies to the property for which it is granted and not to the individual who applied for it. A variance runs with the land and is transferable to any future owner of land, but it cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different site.
D. CHANGE FROM ONE NONCONFORMING USE TO ANOTHER: A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without the specific approval of the board of adjustment, as provided herein.
1. The board of adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide on applications to convert or change an existing nonconforming use to another nonconforming use, subject to the following:
a. A written application for a change from one nonconforming use to another (including the required fee as per Section 19.0 of this ordinance) and a Site Plan, if applicable, subject to the applicable requirements of Section 9.19, shall be submitted to the board.
b. Notice of public hearing shall be given in accordance with Section 18.1 of this ordinance
c. The public hearing shall be held. Any person may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney
d. Prior to granting a change from one nonconforming use to another, the board of adjustment shall find that the new nonconforming use is in the same or more restrictive classification of use as the prior nonconforming use. In the determination of the same or more
Article XVIII Board Of Adjustment 18-8
Fort Wright Zoning Ordinance December 2000 PDS
restrictive classification of use, the applicant shall establish and the board of adjustment shall find:
(1) That the new nonconforming use shall generate less vehicular traffic (automobile and truck) than the prior nonconforming use;
(2) That the new nonconforming use is of a nature which will emit less noise and air pollution than the prior nonconforming use;
(3) That the new nonconforming use will be more in character with the existing neighborhood than the prior nonconforming use, in that it is more in conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan, and also, more in conformance with the uses permitted in the zone in which the use is located, than the prior nonconforming use.
e. Any change of nonconforming use granted by the board of adjustment shall conform to the requirements of this ordinance, including, but not limited to, parking requirements, sign regulations and yard requirements, and all other pertinent ordinances of the legislative body.
f. The board of adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at which time its use became nonconforming.
g. The board of adjustment, in granting a change of nonconforming uses, may attach such conditions thereto as it may deem necessary and proper; and the action, limitations, and conditions imposed, if any, shall be in writing, directed to the applicant, with a copy to be furnished to the zoning administrator.
h. The change of nonconforming use, as may be granted by the board of adjustment, applies to the property for which it is granted and not to the individual who applied and, therefore, cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different property.
i. In the case where the change of nonconforming use has not occurred within one (1) year after the date of granting thereof, the change of nonconforming use permit shall be null and void and reapplication to the board of adjustment shall have to be made.

WHEREAS, Kenton County, and the incorporated municipalities within it, have long sought to regulate sexually oriented businesses within the limits of the Constitution to protect the Countys many residential neighborhoods; and
WHEREAS, the adopted comprehensive plan provides the following policy guidance for regulating such businesses:
Furthermore, the Area-Wide Comprehensive Plan does not identify specific land uses, but instead, categorizes land uses using broad categories. Undesirable land uses, including adult-oriented business may be appropriate within more than one land use category identified within this Plan Update. The following criteria are presented to provide guidance for siting of these uses:

Section 4.2: Lot Layout
4.2-1 Purpose
This section fulfills the infrastructure requirements of Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 100.273 through
100.292. These Lot layout standards assure a necessary component of harmonious, progressive, and
aesthetically-pleasing development. They contribute to healthy and dynamic neighborhoods where
residents can live, work, shop, and play, and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public
in Kenton County. To further these more general purposes, this section:
(A) Creates standards that result in the logical arrangement of Lots that are accessible and capable of
being built upon;
(B) Ensures that proper protection from Flood is provided to Lots, built structures and public
infrastructure;
(C) Sets forth minimum standards for utility and Watercourse Easements that will accommodate their
future maintenance needs; and
(D) Provides for the reservation of desirable recreational areas, school sites or other public grounds for
the potential purchase of such areas by the appropriate public body.
4.2-2 Easements
(A) The minimum width of Public utility Easements shall be as required by the applicable public utility
agency. The utilities shall be centrally located within the width of the Easement.
(B) Additional Easement width shall be required by Staff if Staff determines that such additional width
is necessary due to the depth the utilities must be buried or due to the proposed size and use of the
utilities.

any existing or proposed Watercourses which traverse the Subdivision.
(B) The Easement width shall be sufficient to provide for the maintenance of the Watercourse as
determined by Staff.
4.2-4 Natural Land Use
Subdivisions shall be encouraged to be designed to take advantage of the natural topography of the land,
to economize the construction of Drainage facilities, to minimize destruction of trees and topsoil, and to
preserve such natural features as Watercourses, unusual rock formations, large trees, sites for historical
significance, and other natural assets. See Figure 4.2-A.
Figure 4.2-A: Illustration of Subdivision design taking advantage of the natural topography

4.3-1 Purpose
This chapter fulfills the infrastructure requirements of Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 100.273 through
100.292. These public utility standards assure a necessary component of harmonious, progressive, and
aesthetically-pleasing development is addressed. They contribute to healthy and dynamic neighborhoods
where residents can live, work, shop, and play. Furthermore, they promote the health, safety, and general
welfare of the public in Kenton County. To further these more general purposes, this section:
(A) Establishes the adequacy of existing and proposed stormwater, wastewater and water supply
facilities as a factor to be considered when reviewing proposed Subdivisions;
(B) Sets forth minimum standards for stormwater Drainage systems, sanitary sewer and water systems,
and the extent to which they shall be provided;
(C) Ensures that new Lots are provided access to essential public utilities when they are available; and
(D) Promotes the ability of fire departments to fight fires by requiring minimum fire flows and
adequate provision of fire hydrants.

4.4-2 Required Thicknesses
(A) Table 4.4-2: Required Subdivision Street Thicknesses shows the required pavement thicknesses for
various Street classifications for Asphalt and Concrete Streets where in situ Subgrade soils can
meet the minimum required Subgrade CBR equal to 2 or greater for Concrete pavements or CBR
of 3 or greater for Asphalt pavements. These thicknesses were determined using the AASHTO
Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1986 and 1993) and the design parameters identified in
Table 4.4-1: Subdivision Pavement Design Parameters Using AASHTO Method. These values
meet requirements for a 50 year life cycle without replacement, assuming resurfacing at 17 and 34
years as shown in the example calculation in Figure C.1-A: Exhibit A.
(B) Wherever the minimum CBR values for Asphalt or Concrete pavements as defined in Table 4.4-1:
Subdivision Pavement Design Parameters Using AASHTO Method cannot be provided by the in
situ Subgrade soils, the Engineer shall: 1) submit an engineered Subgrade improvement design
that increases the CBR value of the in situ Subgrade soils to the required minimum CBR values
for Asphalt and Concrete pavement in Subsection 4.4-1: Pavement Design Method; or 2) submit an
engineered alternate pavement design that takes into account the substandard CBR values.

(I) Concrete Pavement Lugs
The purpose of pavement lugs in Subdivision pavements is to provide some additional resistance to
Contraction Joints separating during repeated expansion and contraction cycles over the life of the
pavement in certain open ended and relatively steep downhill pavement conditions. In these open
ended and downhill conditions, resistance to pavement lengthening at contraction joints is
substantially reduced as compared to Contraction Joints in long stretches relatively straight
pavement. In the long, relatively straight streets, the repetitive adjacent slabs help keep the
contraction joints from separating during repeated expansion and contraction cycles. Those
conditions which shall require lugs are related to the geometry of the Streets and are as follows (see
Figure A.1-J: Detail #8, Figure A.1-K: Detail #9, and Figure A.1-L: Detail #10).
(1) The ends of Cul-de-sacs where the Street grade approaching the Cul-de-sac decreases more
than 20 feet vertically, at an average grade of more than six percent, before there is a change
in direction of Street Drainage. In this condition, install a lug near the end of the Cul-de-sac
across the extension of the two lanes of pavement.
(2) At T-intersections, place a lug on the intersecting street near the intersection, where grade on
the intersecting Street is going up from the intersection more than 20 feet vertically, at an
average grade of more than six percent, before there is a change in the Drainage direction.
(3) On the main line of a Street pavement where the pavement is going straight and downhill
more than 20 feet vertically, at an average grade of more than six percent and the direction of
centerline deflects horizontally by more than 30 degrees, place a lug just uphill of the start of
the horizontal curve.
a) Lugs shall be placed at least 20 feet uphill from any shallow utility excavation
transverse to the pavement.
(4) The Design Engineer may add other lugs in conditions he considers critical to Contraction
Joint integrity.

NOTE: THIS SECTION IS NOT REGULATORY BUT SETS OUT IMPORTANT PAVEMENT
FACTS AND SUPPORT FOR HOW THE REGULATIONS REGARDING STREET PAVEMENT
AND EARTHWORK WERE DERIVED AND INCORPORATED INTO Article 4: Public and Private
Infrastructure AND Article 6: Geotechnical Exploration and Earthwork Construction Requirements.
4.8-1 Purpose
Pavement in Public Streets, including Subdivision Streets, is one of the largest physical assets by dollar
value owned by various Kenton County legislative bodies (city/county). The purpose of this section is
twofold. The first is to inform all in Kenton County who have responsibilities in the design, construction
and maintenance of Subdivision Streets of important facts about the nature of pavements and their
individual responsibilities in obtaining good long-term pavement performance in new Kenton County
Subdivisions.
The second is to set out some of the critical engineering analysis and reasoning used to establish the
pavement, pavement Subgrade, and pavement Drainage specifications for future Subdivision pavement
contained in Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure, Section 4.4: Pavement Design Method and
Required Thicknesses through Section 4.7: Asphalt Concrete (Asphalt) Paving Mixture and Construction
Specifications, and Article 6: Geotechnical Exploration and Earthwork Construction Requirements of
these regulations.

Existing Subdivision Pavement 4.8-2 Performance Analysis
During the process of reviewing this 2014 update of the Kenton County Subdivision Regulations there
was a substantial community discussion on Subdivision pavement design, construction and performance.
During the late stages of this community discussion, at the suggestion of the Kenton County Judge
Executive and several city Mayors, and authorization of the Planning Commission Chairman, a
committee of five local pavement professionals with extensive and long-term experience in the design,
construction, and maintenance of Subdivision pavements was formed. This committee was asked, as a
voluntary community service, to do the following: analyze existing Subdivision pavement performance,
evaluate that performance compared to reasonable expectations for pavement performance, and make
recommendations that would improve pavement customer value in future Subdivision pavements. All
earlier community discussion on pavement performance was to be considered as input into their process.
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report contains this committees final report to the Planning
Commission in this regard. The recommendations of this report were an important source of information
that was used in the formation of these Subdivision pavement regulations.
4.8-3 Important Pavement Facts
There is no perfect pavement, no pavement lasts indefinitely, and all pavements require maintenance,
repair and refurbishment on a timely basis in order to minimize long term pavement costs. All
professional pavement design procedures recognize that all pavements will eventually fail, regardless of
how well they are built, either by the impacts of weathering, the impacts of repetitive heavy vehicle axle
loads, or both. Professional engineering pavement design also recognizes pavement will have local
failures during its life because of the imperfect nature of the natural soil Subgrade, pavement materials,
and construction techniques. Pavements designed by pavement professionals are, therefore, designed
with assumptions and calculations of the need for maintenance, repair of isolated failures, and
refurbishment during the pavement life. All pavement literature recognizes that the three essential
components of good pavement performance are (A) proper pavement design for the in situ conditions,
(B) proper construction consistent with the design, and (C) proper and timely maintenance and repair.
Failure in the proper execution of any one of these three components will lead to very substantial
increases in long term pavement cost and/or inadequate pavement serviceability. These three
components are discussed further below.
(A) Pavement Design
The following is a discussion of certain important elements of the engineering approach taken to
establish the pavement design, materials and construction methods specified for Subdivision
Streets in Section 4.4: Pavement Design Method and Required Thicknesses through Section 4.7:
Asphalt Concrete (Asphalt) Paving Mixture and Construction Specifications, and Article 6:
Geotechnical Exploration and Earthwork Construction Requirements.
(1) Proper pavement engineering design requires economic analysis of pavement design
alternatives. For an in-depth discussion of the engineering economics of pavements, see
Chapter 3 of the AASHTO 93 Pavement Design Manual. The economic engineering design
objective used herein is to minimize pavement 50 year net present value life cycle costs to
the pavement Customer while maintaining adequate pavement serviceability. The pavement
Customer is defined as the amalgamation of the Subdivision Lot/home purchaser,
occupant, tax payer and citizen. There is no attempt to differentiate any of these Customer
subgroups. Collectively, they are the pavement Customer.
The Customer pays all of the costs of pavement through Lot/home purchase price, rent, and
various forms of taxes.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 120
Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
Pavement cost over the pavement life cycle includes construction costs; maintenance, repair
and refurbishment costs; and costs related to the time value of money (thus net present
value). These various costs include any overhead and profit that is related to the goods and
services provided.
A 50 year life cycle was chosen for the analysis period because there is substantial local
experience that demonstrates Subdivision pavements, when properly designed, built,
maintained, and resurfaced, can last 50 years or more. A longer analysis period was not
chosen because transportation modes and pavement loading, maintenance and repair methods
and materials, and all sorts of other related factors, are simply not foreseeable beyond 50
years. Pavement designs herein are also designed with a 20 year design life or performance
period, defined as the time that an initial pavement will last before it needs rehabilitation.
Pavement designs presented herein are designed to last at least 50 years, as long as properly
constructed, maintained, and resurfaced over the 50 year period as shown in Subsection 4.8-
3(C): Pavement Maintenance herein. Figure A.1-AA: Detail #25 also shows a method of
extending the pavement life past 50 years using existing refurbishment and resurfacing
methods.
Any alternate pavement design submitted for a particular Subdivision by a pavement design
professional must also include a 20 year design life and a 50 year life cycle maintenance,
repair, and resurfacing analysis, including relevant traffic loading.
(2) The pavement Subgrade is the soil directly under the pavement. Pavements rely on the
Subgrade for structural support. Subgrades must, therefore, be constructed of soils with
adequate load bearing capacity, properly prepared.
Portland Cement Concrete (Concrete) is a rigid pavement and spreads traffic loads over a
larger Subgrade area as compared to Asphalt Cement Concrete (Asphalt) pavement which
is a flexible pavement. Because of this wheel load distribution difference in the nature of
these two pavement types, Asphalt pavements require a higher minimum Subgrade bearing
capacity than Concrete pavements.
Pavement specifications herein require Subgrade soils that, when properly prepared, will
produce a bearing capacity or California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of 2 or greater for Concrete
pavement and CBR of 3 or greater for Asphalt pavement.
A substantial majority (not all) of potential future Subdivision sites in Kenton County have
natural soils that, when properly prepared, will produce an adequate Subgrade bearing
capacity to support Concrete or Asphalt, but not necessarily both. For Subdivision locations
with in situ soils that will not produce these minimum bearing capacities for the pavement
type that the Developer selects, properly designed and built Subgrade improvements will be
required.
Quality control of as-built Subgrades is a very important component of assuring the expected
pavement design performance.
(3) The repetition of Equivalent 18,000 Pound Single Axle Loads (ESALs) going over the
pavement during its life is one mode of eventual pavement failure. Therefore, estimates of
ESALs are required to properly design pavements. Pavement designs herein include ESAL
loading estimates during land development construction, building construction, and traffic
activity after full building occupancy. The estimate methods and quantities are shown in
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 121
Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
Figure C.1-A: Exhibit A. Any alternate pavement designs must be based on these ESAL
estimates, or greater.
(4) Pavement surface and subsurface storm water conditions are another important consideration
in pavement design. The primary engineering design methods for minimizing the negative
effects of storm water on pavement and pavement Subgrades are (1) preventing water from
entering the pavement, (2) providing Drainage that quickly removes excess water that enters
the pavement, and (3) building the pavement strong enough to resist the combined effects of
wheel load and water. Because Asphalt is more porous and has higher reliance on Subgrade
strength as compared to Concrete pavement, accounting for the potential negative effects of
water entering Asphalt pavements and pavement Subgrade is more critical for Asphalt
pavements.
The design features specified in these regulations use all three methods listed above to
minimize the negative effects of storm water on Subdivision pavement.
The primary pavement requirements used in these regulations for effective storm water
surface and subsurface management are as follows:
a) Rural Development Streets
i) Three percent surface cross slope, as shown in Figure A.1-E: Detail #5 and
Figure A.1-F: Detail #6.
ii) Subgrade cross slope of three percent for Concrete Streets and three percent +2
inches for Asphalt Streets, as shown in Figure A.1-C: Detail #3, Figure A.1-D:
Detail #4, Figure A.1-E: Detail #5, and Figure A.1-F: Detail #6.
iii) Drainage ditches on both sides of the Street where the ditch depth is always
deeper than the Subgrade at the outside edge of pavement, as shown in Figure
A.1-E: Detail #5, and Figure A.1-F: Detail #6.
b) Suburban and Urban Streets
Most Subdivision pavements likely to be built in Kenton County will be classified as
urban or suburban. These Streets are built with curb and gutter. The pavement with
curb and gutter serves as a surface storm water conduit which is designed to collect
surface storm water off the Street and off adjoining Subdivision lots and transport that
storm water to Street catch basins which connect to storm sewers. Street design
requirements herein are designed to get and keep storm water in the gutter flow line of
these Streets as much as practical.
i) All Streets
a) Curb and gutter and three percent surface cross grade to get and keep storm
water in the gutter line until it is collected at catch basins (see Figure A.1-C:
Detail #3 and Figure A.1-D: Detail #4.
b) Build Public Sidewalk so that the edge nearest the Street is built six inches
above the adjacent Curb on sloped Curbs and three inches above the Curb on
Barrier Curbs. This maintains positive street Drainage even after multiple
pavement overlays (see Figure A.1-C: Detail #3 and Figure A.1-D: Detail
#4).
c) Install continuous edge drain at the outside edge of the pavement on both
sides of the Street, as shown in Figure A.1-C: Detail #3, Figure A.1-D:
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 122
Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
Detail #4, Figure A.1-X: Detail #22, and Figure A.1-Y: Detail #23. This
edge drain will help drain the Subgrade, help keep surface water from the
outside edge of the pavement out of the Subgrade, and will help drain Joints
in Concrete and the Asphalt/Concrete Curb and gutter interface.
d) Provide for Subgrade Drainage and edge drain Drainage at all paired catch
basins, as shown on the Required Street Cross Section Construction at Catch
Basin Crossings in Figure A.1-B: Detail #2.
ii) Concrete Streets
a) All pavement Joints are properly sealed with joint sealing compound to
minimize water penetrating those Joints and getting into the Subgrade.
b) All pavements are built with a three percent Subgrade cross grade (see
Figure A.1-C: Detail #3 and Figure A.1-E: Detail #5) continuous from
centerline to edge of Curb, which will help any water that gets into the
Subgrade to the outside of the Curb and to the edge drain.
iii) Asphalt Streets
a) The surface course of Asphalt has been designed to minimize the water that
will penetrate the pavement and get into the Subgrade.
b) The finish course of Asphalt is built ¼ inch above the Curb apron to force
any surface water toward the gutter line rather than allow the water to lay out
in the pavement surface for extended periods of time.
c) The Curb apron is built with a six percent cross pitch to keep water in the
gutter line.
d) The Asphalt Joint at the Concrete Curb apron is sealed with Joint sealer to
keep water from penetrating through that Joint into the Subgrade.
e) The Subgrade is built with a three percent plus two inch cross slope and is
built continuously from the centerline to the outside of the Curb to help drain
the Subgrade and help minimize the potential for water penetrating into the
Subgrade from the outside edge of the pavement.
f) The first course of pavement base (Asphalt or KYTC crushed stone base) is
continuous from the centerline to the outside edge of the pavement, and the
Concrete Curb and gutter is built on top of the first course of base, which
will help keep water from penetrating the Subgrade at the outside edge of the
pavement and will help support the Curb and reduce potential for Curb
breakage.
In regards to building the pavement strong enough to resist the combined effects of wind
and water, the Subgrade design parameters used in Table 4.4-1 account for substantial
Kenton County seasonal variability in Subgrade support consistent with substantial change in
water content of Subgrade soils season-to-season.
(5) There are many other design, material, and construction method details set out in Section 4.4:
Pavement Design Method and Required Thicknesses through Section 4.7: Asphalt Concrete
(Asphalt) Paving Mixture and Construction Specifications, Article 6: Geotechnical
Exploration and Earthwork Construction Requirements, and Appendix A: Standard

Page 123
Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
Construction Drawings that are important to good pavement performance. Because these
details are not discussed here does not diminish their importance.
(B) Pavement Construction Quality Control
Construction quality control, which means building the pavement with good construction practices
and in substantial conformance with these Subdivision regulations and the approved construction
design drawings, is the responsibility of the Subdivision Developer and its agents who are the
Engineers and construction Contractors hired by that Developer to design and build that
Subdivisions improvements. The Planning Commissions role in construction quality control is,
through its Staff or other quality control service provider, to confirm and document that the
Subdivision design drawings satisfy these regulations and that the in-place Subdivision
improvements are built in substantial accordance to these Subdivision regulations and the
Subdivision design drawings.
(C) Pavement Maintenance
The need for and benefit of timely and adequate maintenance by the Street pavements owners is
documented throughout the pavement literature. Failure to properly and timely maintain
pavements will lead to substantially increased Customer pavement costs and/or diminished
pavement serviceability.
(1) Recommended 50 Year Life Cycle Maintenance
The following is a schedule for maintenance, repair, and resurfacing that can be expected in
an effort to minimize Customer 50 year life cycle costs for Subdivision pavements.
a) Recommended Asphalt Pavement Owner Maintenance
Minor Maintenance:
 Joint and crack seal every three years
 Spot Curb repair
 Spot pavement repair
Major Maintenance:
 At approximately +17 years:
- Spot Curb repair, as necessary
- Spot base repair
- Mill Asphalt two inches deep at the Concrete Curb apron to zero inches at
six feet out from the Curb Apron
- Install new two inch Asphalt surface with a four percent Curb apron to
centerline cross slope.
- Seal the Asphalt/Curb Apron interface
 At approximately +34 years:
- Spot Curb repair
- Spot base repair
- Pavement fabric over joint between Asphalt and Curb
- New two inch Asphalt surface overlay
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 124
Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
b) Recommended Concrete Pavement Owner Maintenance
Minor Maintenance:
 Joint and crack seal every three years
 Inspect Driveway apron expansion material for signs of pavement lengthening;
take remedial action as necessary (See Subsection 4.8-3(C)(1)c): Management
of Concrete Pavement Lengthening, below.)
 Localized failure repairs
Major Maintenance:
 At approximately +17 years:
- Spot Curb repair
- Spot slab repair
 At approximately +34 years:
- Spot Curb repair
- Spot slab and Joint repair
- Inspect for erosion (tunneling) under pavement, mud jack as necessary
- Mill Concrete two inches deep at or near the Concrete gutter line to zero
inches deep six feet out from the gutter line.
- Install Asphalt skim coat and Stress Absorbing Asphalt Membrane
Interlayer (SAMI) over the width of the pavement.
- Install 1½-inch deep Asphalt surface overlay with a four percent gutter line
to centerline cross slope.
c) Management of Concrete Pavement Lengthening
Concrete pavements can expand in length later in the pavements life as described on
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report - Problem #12(b). While the
pavement design features incorporated into this regulation along with proper owner
pavement maintenance will minimize this lengthening, the potential for lengthening
and the related potential negative impacts cannot be eliminated.
The design feature incorporated into these regulations which will allow for the
identification and management of any potential negative impacts to improvements on
private property is the placement of a total of three inches of expansion joint material
within the Street Right-of-way at each Driveway apron, as shown in Figure A.1-T:
Detail #18, Figure A.1-U: Detail #19, and Figure A.1-V: Detail #20.
The pavement owners regular inspection (every three years) of the expansion material
to see if the three inches of expansion material has closed up to two inches or less is
required. If the expansion material has closed up to two inches or less, remedial
action consisting of saw cutting the Driveway apron next to the Curb to allow for
additional expansion is required.
The preceding is one set of proven long-term pavement management strategies that
have been used on Northern Kentucky Subdivision Streets. There are others that have
been effective. When these strategies are properly and timely executed on pavement
designs in these regulations (properly constructed), the result should be satisfactory
pavement performance for at least 50 years without pavement replacement.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 125
Article 4: Public and Private Infrastructure
Section 4.8: Pavement Performance and Design
As new, more cost effective maintenance and repair strategies are developed over time,
they should be adopted for use.
(2) Extending Pavement Life Beyond 50 Years
Figure A.1-AA: Detail #25 shows a methodology of extending pavement life that should
allow most Subdivision pavements, properly built and maintained under these regulations, to
have their life extended beyond 50 years without replacement. Obviously, many things can
and likely will change over the next 50 years that will substantially change the best course of
action for refurbishment or replacement of these Subdivision pavements.

Section 5.1: Purpose
Article 5: Green Infrastructure (GI) Options
Section 5.1: Purpose
5.1-1 Green infrastructure uses natural processes to ameliorate the negative effects of urban development,
including reducing heat island effects, air pollution, water pollution and excess storm water runoff.
Integrated stormwater management is a subset of green infrastructure. The use of integrated stormwater
management is encouraged because of its connection to effective development practices and
environmental quality. The influence of the natural flow regime (hydrology) of a given watershed on
overall stream integrity (chemical, physical, biological) is well established, and as such, maintaining the
natural flow regime is a priority for stormwater managers. The proper use of integrated stormwater
management practices can achieve this goal and dramatically improve stormwater runoff quality,
decrease runoff volume, reduce infrastructure costs, protect the integrity of downstream streams and
rivers, and create more interesting places to live. Stormwater management practices include a broader
understanding of watershed management and ecosystem function, coupled with overall site design and
layout, and implementation of an impervious area reduction strategy. The creation of impervious
surfaces on a site can dramatically impact a communitys watersheds, wastewater treatment systems, and
water supplies by altering the landscapes inherent ability to slow, filter, and absorb stormwater runoff
(i.e. alters the natural flow regime). Development or redevelopment of a site can be accomplished while
reducing the overall negative impact to receiving streams, by applying carefully considered stormwater
management techniques which mimic natural hydrology. To further these more general purposes, this
article:
(A) Establishes site design components to promote more effective use of individual stormwater
management techniques to prevent negative impacts rather than mitigating them;
(B) Provides the ability to utilize simple, nonstructural methods for stormwater management that are
lower cost and lower maintenance than structural controls;
(C) Encourages the management of stormwater as close to the point of origin as possible and
minimizes collection and conveyance, establishing a strategy to determine what portions of
stormwater are to be filtered into the ground on site and what portions of stormwater are to flowthrough
the site for management elsewhere;
(D) Provides benefits to the environment as well as to the development community by improving water
quality and restoring aquatic habitats while controlling flooding. This approach can increase
rainfall infiltration and groundwater recharge with potentially large environmental benefits and
potentially lower net costs  both to the environment and to the Developer. The integrated
stormwater management techniques provide innovative options for Developers to rethink overall
site design and layout to utilize a site more efficiently while providing better stormwater
management opportunities than traditional gray infrastructure;
(E) Uses multiple impervious area reduction techniques within the context of an overall site design to
reduce the negative runoff impact created with the development or redevelopment of a site and
ideally reduce the amount of underground pipe infrastructure necessary on a site;
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 127
Article 5: Green Infrastructure (GI) Options
Section 5.2: Site Layout Strategies
(F) Promotes the aesthetic value of integrated stormwater management. In addition to the benefits of
maintaining healthy waterways and the multiple environmental benefits supporting healthy
communities found in the use of integrated stormwater management, the use of these techniques
can provide aesthetic value to a community with the use of added vegetation to the landscape. By
integrating natural processes into the built environment, these techniques provide stormwater
management, Flood mitigation and control, and air quality management with more aesthetic appeal
than standard gray stormwater infrastructure.
Section 5.2: Site Layout Strategies
5.2-1 Overall site layout strategies are encouraged to be incorporated into an integrated stormwater
management plan. Site layout strategies are the first step in managing stormwater in a way that mimics
natural hydrology. Using land more efficiently for development, preserving critical ecological areas, and
reducing runoff through better site design are vital to maintaining a healthy watershed. Stormwater
management works most effectively in conjunction with an overall site design strategy which identifies
how the stormwater impacts created by the development will be addressed.
5.2-2 A site design strategy should include identification of which portions of expected stormwater will be
managed using either infiltration methods, retention methods, or flow-through methods. Shifting the
focus toward the utilization of rainwater as a resource that should be managed as close to where it falls as
possible and away from addressing rainwater solely as a waste that should be removed from a site will
increase the efficiency of stormwater management.
5.2-3 Effective stormwater management will utilize multiple methods aimed at managing runoff through both
infiltration into natural systems as well as use of management methods which remove water from the site
through piping infrastructure without adding significant impacts to local waterways and watersheds. The
elements work collectively to lessen the negative impacts to nearby waterways and watershed systems.
5.2-4 Efficiently designing a site should include conscious efforts to minimize the impervious areas created by
new streets, pedestrian pathways, parking Lots, and/or buildings.
Section 5.3: Elements of Integrated Stormwater Management
5.3-1 The following elements are examples of integrated stormwater management which, when used in
coordination with effective site design strategies, can aid in lowering the negative impact to local
waterways and watersheds. Once a strategy has been established to minimize collection and conveyance,
these elements can be utilized, in varying combinations, to successfully implement stormwater to be
filtered into the ground on site and stormwater to flow-through the site for management elsewhere.

Article 5: Green Infrastructure (GI) Options
Section 5.3: Elements of Integrated Stormwater Management
(A) Narrower Right-of-way Widths
Whether used in conjunction with narrower pavement widths or traditional width pavements,
narrowing the Right-of-way established within a site is a significant opportunity to reduce the
quantity and increase the quality of storm water runoff by allowing structures to be set closer to the
street. Because of the topography that is typical for this region, many developments involve land
that includes ridge tops, hillside slopes and headwater streams. As such, development plans often
include streets and structures constructed along ridge tops with back yards that extend down the
hillside slopes and into headwater streams. Placing structures closer to the ridge top lessens the
need for earthwork and tree removal along these hillside slopes which keeps more undisturbed land
on the slopes and near the headwater streams. In addition to the added benefit of helping to ensure
hillside stability, lessening hillside disturbance and tree removal will result in a lesser impact to the
natural flow regime, and therefore a lesser impact to water quantity and water quality in these
headwater streams as well as the corresponding receiving streams downstream of the site. See

(B) Grassy Swales (Bioretention Swales) Without Curb and Gutter and Grassy Swales With
Curb and Gutter Containing Cut-outs and Flumes
Swales are long and narrow depressions in the landscape which incorporate vegetation to gradually
move stormwater through a site by use of gentle slopes to guide runoff through the system. Swales
are primarily used to slow the speed of stormwater runoff as it moves through a site though some
infiltration can occur when slopes (less than five percent) and soils are favorable. The vegetation
used within swales typically requires lower ongoing maintenance than that of traditional
landscaping. When used in combination with Curb and gutter containing cutouts and flumes, the
swales provide the same benefit as traditional swales without Curb and gutter by collecting
stormwater outside of traditional gray infrastructure associated with the site and decreasing the
impacts of development to the overall man-made stormwater management system. However this
system offers the added benefit of providing Curb and gutter along the edge of streets to help
buttress asphalt pavements, create a well-defined pavement edge and increase the overall pavement
edge lifespan. See Figure 5.3-B and Figure 5.3-C.

(C) Infiltration Gardens (Biofiltration Swales or Rain Gardens)
Infiltration gardens are shallow depressions in the landscape which provide larger, often unused or
left-over areas on a site to filter stormwater into the natural soils and groundwater system. Use of
infiltration gardens can significantly lessen the amount of stormwater collected into piping
infrastructure. The vegetation used within infiltration gardens typically requires lower ongoing
maintenance than that of traditional landscaping. See Figure 5.3-D.

(D) Pedestrian Walkways as a Design Element
Alternative pedestrian ways which are outside of the requirements set forth in Table 4.1-1 can be
created to constitute a pedestrian circulation system equal to the level of effectiveness that
traditional Sidewalk on one or both sides of the street would provide. Rather than including
Sidewalks only within the Right-of-way along the Street, integrating a well thought out pedestrian
circulation system throughout a site can reduce impervious surface while potentially lowering the
construction cost and raising the stormwater management benefits of the overall site. Incorporating
a strategic system of Pedestrian Walkways linking key destinations within a site (in conjunction
with aligning connections for travel outside the site) will increase usability of walkway networks.
Additionally, incorporating materials such as mulch, gravel, or other pervious material can further
reduce the hard surface runoff. When adding Sidewalks to one or both sides of every street, often
important pedestrian connections are not made, the Sidewalks themselves are under (if-at-all)
utilized, and excessive impervious surfaces are created.

(E) Planter Boxes
Planters are long narrow, often rectangular landscaped areas with vertical walls and flat, unsloped
bottoms, and are able to store a greater volume of water than swales, because they are typically
deeper, and provide more capacity. Water flows into the planter, absorbs into the topsoil and
plants, fills to a predetermined overflow elevation, and discharges into the overflow system
provided. Two types of planters are used for stormwater management.
(1) Flow-through Planters
Flow-through planters have a sealed bottom and sides and absorb only as much water as the
soil and plants in the planter can accommodate. They allow water to slowly travel through
the soil profile prior to overflowing into a subsurface underdrain system. See Figure 5.3-F.

The bottom of an infiltration planter is open to the native soil. Water in the planter is
absorbed by topsoil, and infiltrates into native soils below. See Figure 5.3-G.

(F) Permeable Pavement
If underlying soils allow for the natural infiltration of rain water, constructing pavement using
permeable materials can allow for stormwater to filter through the pavement and into the natural
ground water system while still providing the structural integrity necessary for the sites
automobile and pedestrian traffic. The use of Permeable Pavement can mitigate the overall impact
of the development to the piping infrastructure systems while maintaining full functionality of the
developed site. See Figure 5.3-H, Figure 5.3-I, and Figure 5.3-J.

(G) Preserving Existing Trees and Planting New Trees
Preserving trees and planting new trees on a site adds to the ability to effectively slow, absorb, and
filter rainwater. Trees naturally work to physically slow the flow of water through a site by
intercepting stormwater on their leaf surfaces as well as through their root structure. Not only do
trees collect water for their growth, their physical presence on the landscape intercepts the flow of
water downhill and slows its movement. See Figure 5.3-K.

5.4-1 Staff will approve the use of Integrated Stormwater Management provided the following criteria have
been substantiated:
(A) The Integrated Stormwater Management is proposed to utilize the landscapes ability to reduce,
slow, filter, and/or absorb stormwater runoff from Streets, parking lots, and buildings by
maintaining key elements of the natural flow regime and minimizing impacts to receiving streams.
(B) The Integrated Stormwater Management is consistent with Sanitation District No. 1s Stormwater
Rules and Regulations.
(C) The Integrated Stormwater Management has been designed by a Professional Engineer.
(D) For Integrated Stormwater Management within the public Right-of-way, the element(s) shall be
approved by the authority designated by the applicable Legislative Body in writing.
Section 5.5: Elements of Integrated Stormwater Management allowed
By-Right
5.5-1 The following two Integrated Stormwater Management elements are permitted to be used in two separate
and distinct methods. These elements are permitted to be used as elements of Integrated Stormwater
Management anywhere in Kenton County when the criteria outlined in Section 5.4-1 have been
substantiated. However, the by-right use of the following Integrated Stormwater Management
elements can be utilized without requiring that any special conditions be met, as long as the element is
being used in the specific applications outlined as follows:
(A) Narrower Pavement Widths
Narrowing pavement widths is a significant opportunity to reduce stormwater runoff by reducing
the total amount of impervious surface and therefore, reducing the amount of stormwater requiring
collection into pipe infrastructure for maintenance off-site. The use of narrower pavement widths
is allowed by-right when used in conjunction with a Rural Development type. Rural Development
types are single and two-family residential developments that contain lot widths equal to or greater
than 300 feet and contain no on street parking. See Subsection 4.1-10: Allowable Pavement
Design.
(B) Grassy Swales and Shoulders Without Curb and Gutter
Swales are long and narrow depressions in the landscape which incorporate vegetation to gradually
move stormwater through a site by use of gentle slopes to guide runoff through the system. Swales
are primarily used to slow the speed of stormwater runoff as it moves through a site though some
infiltration can occur when slopes (less than five percent) and soils are favorable. When used
without curb and gutter systems, swales can more easily collect stormwater uninhibited by the
physical barriers created by traditional Curbs. Additionally, without the traditional gutter system,
stormwater can more easily flow directly into swales (infiltration systems) rather than into manmade
stormwater management system. Grassy swales and shoulders without curb and gutter is
allowed by-right when used in certain situations such as: (1) in developments that prohibit on-street
parking and contain minimum Lot widths that equal or exceed 300 feet; or (2) along streets that
serve as an entrance to the development and contain no residences and no parking. See Subsection
4.1-13: Roadside Swales.

must provide adequate support for the pavement structure as defined in these regulations.
(1) During earthwork and initial pavement subgrade preparation, the Geotechnical Engineer or
Geotechnical Technician shall evaluate in situ pavement subgrade materials on the site and
develop an opinion about their suitability to provide the minimum CBR values when
compacted to the required densities at the specified moisture contents.

Section 6.2: Earthwork Specifications, Evaluation, Material Testing and Reporting for Earthwork Within the Public Street
Right-of-Way and Private Street Easements, and Areas Structurally Supporting the Public Street Right-of-Way and Private
Street Easements
(2) The Subgrade shall consist of cohesive soils, clean #57 crushed limestone, crushed stone
base, or Controlled Low Strength Material (CLSM). Any aggregate material used to replace
part of the cohesive Subgrade soil must be drained, per Figure A.1-W: Detail #21 so that no
standing water can collect and be held in the aggregate Subgrade.
(3) Clean granular soils that do not exhibit a well-defined moisture-density curve shall be
compacted to a firm, non-yielding condition and to at least 80 percent relative density as
determined by the testing methods contained in ASTM D4253 and D4254, latest edition.
(4) The Subgrade shall be shaped to plan elevation and cross-section and checked by the Staff
inspector for conformity with the cross section shown on the approved Improvement
Drawings immediately prior to placing the pavement. Pavement shall not be placed on any
part of the Subgrade which does not conform to the cross section shown on the approved
Improvement Drawings.
(C) Final Subgrade Proofrolling
(1) Proofrolling is the final test to be performed immediately prior to beginning the paving
operations.
(2) Prior to the placement of pavement materials and after confirming proper density and
moisture content of the Subgrade soils, all Street Subgrades shall be proofrolled to test the
stability and uniformity of Subgrade materials.
(3) Proofrolling shall be performed with a dual axle dump truck fully loaded with clayey soils or
aggregate.
(4) Proofrolling shall be performed at walking speed with at least two passes made in each drive
lane direction with the outside wheel generally traveling along the inside line of the future
Curb during one pass, and the wheel-paths offset one-half of the truck width during the
second pass to maximize subgrade coverage. Extra proofroll passes shall be made at the
discretion of the Staff inspector.
a) Where proofrolling indicates areas of soft or unsuitable Subgrade soils or areas of nonuniform
Subgrade stability, the area shall be delineated and repaired.
b) Areas of soft or unsuitable Subgrade soils or areas of non-uniform Subgrade stability
shall be identified by observing Pumping and/or Rutting (See Definitions Subsection
2.3-95: Pumping (or deflection) and Subsection 2.3-102: Rutting).
c) Rutting in excess of one inch in depth shall be deemed a Subgrade failure requiring
Subgrade repair.
d) Pumping or deflection of less than one inch is acceptable so long as the Subgrade soil
rebounds back to its original position after the wheel load passes. Pumping or
deflection greater than one inch or areas of permanent deflections shall be deemed a
Subgrade failure requiring Subgrade repair.
e) For larger areas of subgrade proofroll failure, the alternative pavement design
procedures in Subsection 4.4-2(B) can be implemented by the Applicant.
(5) Subgrade repairs shall be performed by scarifying, aerating and recompacting the Subgrade
soils. As an alternative, the failed Subgrade soils can be removed and replaced with properly
compacted soils capable of producing the required CBR value.

Right-of-Way and Private Street Easements, and Areas Structurally Supporting the Public Street Right-of-Way and Private
Street Easements
(6) In all cases, repaired areas shall be retested for compaction and proofrolled again before
proceeding with the placement of pavement materials. Rutting can typically be repaired by
scarifying, aerating, and recompacting, while areas of pumping will more likely require a
more significant repair with depth often including the removal and replacement of unsuitable
Subgrade materials.
(D) Final Subgrade Inspection Testing and Reporting Requirements
(1) Both the Staff inspector and the Geotechnical Technician have final Subgrade review,
testing, and reporting responsibilities.
(2) The Geotechnical Engineer shall provide soil testing to develop an opinion of adequate
bearing characteristics of the final Subgrade soils. Those tests will include, but are not
limited to, moisture content testing, density testing, and verification of soil types being
adequate to produce the required CBR values for the pavement. Moisture content testing,
density testing, and verification of soil types being adequate to produce the required CBR
values for the pavement shall be performed by the Geotechnical Engineer at intervals no less
than one test per 100 lineal feet of Street for Streets of 500 lineal feet or less, or one test per
200 lineal feet for Streets over 500 lineal feet.
(3) The Geotechnical Technician and the Staff Inspector shall review the proofrolling described
in Subsection 6.2-7(C): Final Subgrade Proofrolling and determine whether the Subgrade
passes the proofroll.
(4) Paving operations shall only be permitted to begin after passing inspection results are

Section 7.4: Study Requirements
7.4-1 Analysis Scenarios
(A) The TIS shall examine the before and after conditions within the study area to a degree sufficient to
document the operational and safety impacts of the proposed development and access plan. The
before and after conditions shall be termed the No Build and Build conditions.
(B) The No Build condition shall include:
(1) Existing traffic volumes forecasted to the appropriate analysis year;
(2) Existing Street geometry,
(3) All applicable Traffic Control devices;
(4) Any traffic generated by proposed adjacent developments;
(5) Any funded Improvements within the study area; and
(6) Any Transportation System Management (TSM) Improvements, such as signal timing and/or
phasing optimization and reconfiguration of existing lane uses that may improve the
operation of the transportation system.
(C) The Build condition shall include:
(1) No Build traffic volumes;
(2) Site generated traffic; and
(3) Any Street Improvements proposed with the development.
(D) No Build and Build analysis shall be conducted for the anticipated year of opening and a
design year assuming a 10-year horizon. Opening year Build analysis should only include that
portion of development which is anticipated to be completed at opening. Design year analysis
shall include the full build-out potential of the development. In the event that the full build-out of
the development is anticipated to extend beyond the 10-year horizon, the design year shall be the
anticipated year of full build-out.
(E) All scenarios evaluated shall include analysis of the weekday AM and PM peak hours. The
Applicant should work with Staff to determine whether the peak hour of the development or the
peak hour of the adjacent Street traffic is to be analyzed to evaluate the worst-case scenario. When
a proposed development is anticipated to generate a high volume of traffic during non-traditional
peaks, such as a noon peak, late night or weekend peak period, these periods should also be
examined. The need to study additional periods of operation shall be at the discretion of Staff.
7.4-2 Data Collection
The data collection efforts for the study shall be consistent with the level of analysis required. At a
minimum this shall include two-hour turning movement counts conducted in 15-minute intervals at all
study intersections for all peak periods examined. When traffic patterns are affected by the presence of
non-traditional peaks such as school trips, the peak hour turning movement count shall be expanded to
include both peak periods. The peak hours should be determined by a 24-hour count of the adjacent
Street traffic on a typical weekday (i.e., Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday). Previously collected data
and traffic volumes may be used in the analysis at the discretion of Staff.

Article 7: Traffic Impact Studies
Section 7.4: Study Requirements
7.4-3 Future Traffic Volumes
Future traffic volumes used to evaluate the opening year (if different from existing year) and design year
conditions shall be determined by applying an appropriate growth rate to reflect anticipated changes in
demand on the Street network. This growth rate shall be determined from comparison of historical traffic
volumes in the study area. Other methods of forecasting traffic volumes, such as socio-economic
analysis and the use of travel demand models may also be used to determine future traffic growth rates at
the discretion of Staff.
7.4-4 Trip Generation and Distribution
(A) Trips generated by the proposed development shall be calculated using the most current edition of
the ITE Trip Generation Manual methodologies.
(B) Trips generated by the development should be distributed onto the Public Street network consistent
with existing traffic patterns in the area, identified by origin destination studies of adjacent
developments or traffic counts of adjacent Streets. This methodology may be replaced with more
refined trip distribution approaches derived from market research studies, travel demand models, or
other methodologies at the discretion of Staff.
7.4-5 Operational Analysis
Operational analysis shall be conducted for all intersections within the study area for all analysis
scenarios identified in Subsection 7.4-1: Analysis Scenarios. At a minimum, operational analysis shall
include, but is not limited to:

should be consistent with Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)/Highway Capacity Software (HCS)
methodologies for unsignalized and signalized intersections. Roundabout analysis shall utilize
RODEL/ARCADY analytical procedures. Analysis results should be summarized with LOS and
delay by lane group and intersection totals. For roundabout analysis, LOS shall be determined
using both signalized and unsignalized HCM thresholds.
(B) Analysis shall be evaluated using the following parameters unless justified by additional study at
the discretion of Staff.
(1) Peak Hour Factor (PHF) = 0.90
(2) Lost Time = 2.0 sec
(3) No right turns on red (RTOR)
(4) HCS arrival type = 3
(5) Yellow and red clearance intervals shall be calculated based on ITE recommended
procedures.
(6) Pedestrian phases and minimum clearance times shall be accommodated for all potential
pedestrian crossings.
(7) Where applicable the minimum green time per phase shall be equal to or greater than the
minimum pedestrian clearance time.
(C) Queuing analysis shall be conducted for all controlled movements in the study area. Queuing
analysis should report 95th percentile queues for all scenarios and periods examined, and identify
any conflicts between adjacent queues and/or queues and permitted turning movements.

software.
7.4-6 Safety Analysis
When the study area includes a corridor or intersection which has been identified as a high accident
location by KYTC, OKI, Staff, or the applicable Legislative Body, safety analysis shall be conducted and
included in the TIS. Safety analysis shall be conducted using the three most recent years of crash data
available. Engineering judgment shall be used when reviewing and analyzing existing crash patterns in
areas where Improvements have been implemented within the period of the crash data. At a minimum
safety analysis shall include but is not limited to:
(A) Determination of crash rates for the subject location;
(B) Statistical analysis of crash data by time, light conditions, day of week, pavement conditions, crash
type, and contributing factors;

8.7-2 If no public Sidewalk exists along the adjacent arterial or Collector Street at the time a new development
is proposed, a Sidewalk shall be provided, along with the required pedestrian Access Points.
8.7-3 Any expansion or improvement of an existing Parking Area shall be required to be in compliance with
this section if the following applies:
(A) The new Parking Area is directly adjacent to the Arterial or Collector Street;
(B) A public Sidewalk or transit stop already exists along the Arterial or Collector Street; and
(C) The expansion will add 10 or more off-Street parking spaces that are to be located adjacent to an
Arterial or Collector Street. If a public Sidewalk already exists, then pedestrian Access Points shall
be provided.
8.7-4 The requirements of this section may be waived if sufficient proof is presented that there is not adequate
room and/or adequate need for pedestrian Access Points.

REPORT TO THE KENTON COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION
FROM THE KENTON COUNTY STREET STANDARDS ENGINEERS COMMITTEE (SSEC)
Members: Mark Brueggemann, P.E.; Joe Kramer, P.E.; Jim Viox, P.E.; Ted Vogelpohl, P.E.;
Henry Fischer, Chairman
BACKGROUND
In 2008 the Kenton County Planning Commission (KCPC) initiated an effort to update the Kenton County
Subdivision Regulations. As a part of the update process, input was solicited from various interested groups in
Kenton County. Among those responding, the Kenton County Mayors Group, the Kenton County Judge
Executive, the Land Development Council of the Home Builders Association of Northern Kentucky (HBANKY),
and the Northern Kentucky Society of Professional Engineers (NKSPE) were particularly active in their response.
By mid-2013, there was consensus agreement among the interested groups and the KCPC staff on most parts of the
updated draft regulations. The area where there remained substantial disagreement among the parties mentioned
above was that part of the regulation draft that dealt with requirements for future subdivision street pavements.
During the late stages of this community discussion, at the suggestion of the Kenton County Judge Executive and
several city Mayors, and authorization of the Planning Commission Chairman, a committee of five local pavement
professionals with over 150 years of collective experience in the design, construction, reconstruction, and
maintenance of subdivision pavements was formed and took on the name of Kenton County Street Standards
Engineers Committee (SSEC). The committee members are listed above. This committee was asked, as a
voluntary community service, to do the following: analyze existing subdivision pavement performance, evaluate
that performance compared to reasonable expectations for pavement performance, and make recommendations that
would improve pavement customer value in future subdivision pavements. All earlier community discussion on
pavement performance was to be considered as input into their process.
The committee established a problem analysis and decision making approach with the objective of providing
Kenton County subdivision pavement customers (home purchaser/owner, home occupant, taxpayer, citizen)
maximized long-term pavement value. Over the course of a year, the committee met for two hour meetings,
normally twice weekly, to generate their analysis and recommendations. In addition, there were meetings and
conversations with many other individuals and groups seeking their advice, input, and consensus agreement. Those
groups included:
 The Kenton County Planning Commission Subdivision Regulations Committee
 Kenton County Planning Commission
 Kenton County Mayors Group Subdivision Regulation Review Committee
 Various Northern Kentucky city and county engineers
 Various Northern Kentucky city and county public works officials
 Brian Wood, P.E.  Executive Director of Plantmix Asphalt Industry of Kentucky
 Local concrete and asphalt producers
 Local subdivision improvement contractors
 The Northern Kentucky Society of Professional Engineers continuing education session (Feb. 24, 2014)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN
THE KENTON COUNTY SUBDIVISION REGULATION STREET STANDARDS
The following represents the consensus problem identification and recommendations for improvement in Kenton
County subdivision street regulations by the SSEC. Besides many hours of analysis and discussion by our
Committee, input into the analysis and decision making process was solicited, received, and considered from a
broad spectrum of those involved in the design, construction and maintenance of subdivision streets, especially
those who have been involved in the KCPC subdivision regulation update process. In addition, many sources from
the professional pavement design and maintenance literature were considered and used.
It is noteworthy that the recommendations contained in this report are the unanimous recommendations of the
members of the SSEC.
The SSEC hereby respectfully requests that the KCPC accept the following analysis and incorporate these
recommendations into the revised Subdivision Regulation street standards now under their consideration.
PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION
Realistic problem solving requires accurate definition of the problems and their root causes. That is the aim of the
following as it relates to problems in existing Kenton County subdivision pavements and improvements for the
design and regulation of future pavements.
The following is a list of the most critical problems and opportunities for improvement that have been identified in
Kenton County subdivision pavements installed from roughly 1985 (28 years old) to 2000 (13 years old). The
significance of 1985 is that, in 1985, there was a substantial effort by the Northern Kentucky engineering,
homebuilding, and local government community to improve new subdivision pavement performance. This 1985
effort resulted in a substantial upgrade and standardization of subdivision pavement regulations across Northern
Kentucky, including Kenton County. The subdivision pavements built from 1985 to 2000 in Kenton County were
built under those 1985 regulations. There was little to no change in the pavement regulations during that period.
Jim Viox, Henry Fischer, and Thelen Associates, Inc. (George Thelen then and Ted Vogelpohl now) have been
participants in both the 1985 update effort and this current update effort. This continuity has benefitted this current
effort greatly. It is also noteworthy that very significant improvements in pavement performance and citizen/
homeowner/ taxpayer pavement value resulted from that 1985 effort. Hopefully, as much or more value can be
gained from this current effort.
PROBLEMS COMMON TO ASPHALT AND CONCRETE PAVEMENT
1. Pavement performance standards are not clear in the current regulations. Pavement design parameters,
performance expectations, and procedures for and the importance of proper pavement maintenance are not
set out. This has often resulted in unclear and unrealistic expectations for pavement performance and
maintenance within the Kenton County community.
2. Quality assurance efforts in pavement construction in some cases have been lacking, leading to premature
pavement failure. Related to this problem is the fact that some construction and material specifications in
the current subdivision regulations are inadequate to insure quality pavement performance. In other
instances, the existing regulations dont provide an adequate description of material and construction
specification tolerances that can be achieved using good material control and construction practices. This
lack of proper tolerances leads to ambiguity, confusion, and arbitrary decision making during construction
on what the acceptable material and construction standards are. Various aspects of this quality assurance
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 201
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
effort are the responsibility of the developers, the design and geotechnical engineers, the construction
contractor, and the KCPC and its designated inspection agency.
3. In many cases, subdivision streets in Kenton County communities have not been adequately maintained by
their owners, thus shortening pavement life and substantially increasing ultimate customer long-term
pavement costs.
4. There is no consideration given in existing regulations pavement design of how to extend pavement life
beyond the 20 year design life.
5. Subgrade strength is, in some cases, being degraded because of water penetrating into and weakening the
subgrade. There is a need for improvement in the drainage characteristics of subdivision pavements (both
surface and subsurface); there are design shortfalls as well as construction quality control and maintenance
shortfalls. This problem is much more critical in asphalt pavements because of asphalts high reliance on
subgrade strength as compared to concretes reliance on uniform subgrade support.
6. Pavement failures caused by utility ditch settlement under the street. This is a more costly per occurrence
but less frequent problem for concrete pavements.
7. Existing subdivision regulation standards for streets in industrial and commercial subdivisions are often
inadequate for the heavy truck traffic loading these streets must support.
PROBLEMS SPECIFIC TO ASPHALT STREET PAVEMENTS
8. When asphalt pavements came into common use in Kenton County in the early 1990s, there was a failure
to recognize and address the fact that asphalt pavements are more dependent on subgrade strength than
concrete pavements. Often there was an assumption that subgrade strength that was good enough for
concrete was good enough for asphalt. This isnt true. This assumption led to some asphalt pavement
failures caused by inadequate subgrade preparation and/or inadequate subgrade materials.
9. Asphalt pavement subgrade weakening caused by inadequate pavement surface and subsurface storm water
management. Root causes include inadequate subgrade and surface cross slope, both in design and
inadequate quality control; water penetrating the asphalt/curb apron interface due to the asphalt being
finished below the curb apron; inadequate curb apron cross slope to the gutter line; the asphalt subgrade
being cut lower than the adjacent curb subgrade, thus trapping water under the asphalt; water penetrating
the subgrade from the area outside the curb; and inadequate sealing and maintenance of the asphalt/curb
apron interface. Another problem in this area relates to the improper use of more brittle asphalt materials
designed specifically for highway use. When more brittle asphalt materials are used in subdivision
pavements, premature surface cracks develop in the body of the pavement, allowing water to penetrate
through the pavement into the subgrade and accelerating deterioration of the pavement subgrade.
10. There are inadequate quality assurance requirements in the current regulations for asphalt material and no
asphalt in-place density requirements or testing.
11. In some limited cases, there have been excessive premature asphalt street concrete curb and gutter failures.
Some causes include: improper or inadequate isolation joints at structures (catch basins); inadequate curb
cross section bending strength and/or inadequate subgrade support; and inadequate concrete material
quality leading to D-cracking and other freeze-thaw concrete deterioration.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 202
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
PROBLEMS SPECIFIC TO CONCRETE STREET PAVEMENTS
12. Premature pavement failures caused by in-place concrete not being resistant enough to natural multi-year
freeze-thaw and expansion/contraction cycles. Causes include:
a) Concrete mixes (coarse aggregate type and cement content) that are not resistant enough to concrete Dcracking
and the use of appropriate de-icers. Note that some inappropriate de-icers will cause concrete
deterioration even with appropriate concrete mixes. The D-cracking problem leads to deterioration at
the joints as well as total concrete failure in the body of the concrete slabs.
b) Excessive concrete street lengthening or growth problems that are caused by the use of expansion
joints in the pavement, expansive gravel 57s coarse aggregate, premature load transfer failures at
contraction joints, joint seal failure and poor maintenance. Another pavement condition that can
contribute to the problem is where pavement lengthening is relatively unrestricted, such as at the end of
downhill cul-de-sacs. Measures to manage potential pavement growth impacts on private property
outside of the pavement can also be improved.
13. Premature contraction joint load transfer failure which causes rough vehicle ride and eventual slab failure.
This problem is caused by the separation of the contraction joints due to the use of expansion joints and
more recently (since 1990) by the use of substantial amounts of #8 gravel in pavement concrete mixes. The
addition of #8 gravel and corresponding reduction in 57s gravel decreases the percentage of total aggregate
above ½ in size, and thus decreases the aggregate interlock across the contraction joint. Inadequate joint
seal maintenance is another contributing factor to this problem. This type failure also contributes
significantly to concrete problems described in number 12 above.
RECOMMENDATION OBJECTIVE
The most serious and improvable existing subdivision pavement problems have been identified along with their
root causes. The objective now is to find solutions to those problems that yield the pavement customer (house
purchaser, home owner, occupant, taxpayer, citizen) the lowest possible 50 year net present value for the pavement
life cycle costs. Net present value accounts for the time value of money, which is the basis for evaluating any
pavement option. Initial construction costs, pavement joint maintenance, localized failure repair, and resurfacing
costs are the primary life cycle costs. 50 years was selected as the reasonable period to evaluate pavement use,
performance, and maintenance. It is anticipated that the life of most subdivision pavements as designed here can be
extended beyond 50 years when properly constructed and maintained with additional refurbishment and repair
some time after 50 years.
The following Committee recommendations are consistent with this preceding objective. Note that local suburban
subdivision streets, which represent the bulk of subdivision streets built in Kenton County, are used as examples in
many of these recommendations and exhibits. These recommendations are easily adapted to other classes of
subdivision streets.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. For all engineering, material, and construction specifications in the subdivision regulations, including those
recommended herein, establish realistically achievable definitions, including allowable variances and
tolerances.
Benefit: Meeting this objective will substantially help clarification of pavement expectations for all
involved in the subdivision process. It will also help minimize ambiguity and arbitrary decision making on
as-constructed pavement variances in the future.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 203
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
2. Include a Pavement Performance and Design section in the subdivision regulations that sets out a 20-year
design life and 50-year life cycle maintenance and resurfacing plan. Also include other subdivision
regulation pavement design parameters, the proper expectations for pavement performance, the differences
in performance characteristics between asphalt and concrete, the need for maintenance, and other related
subjects. Figure C.1-A:Exhibit A contains the SSEC parameter selection and example design calculations
for subdivision pavements. Exhibit B contains the SSEC 50-year life cycle expected minimum
maintenance requirements.
Benefit: Addresses problem #1 and helps address problems #3 and #4.
3. After revised regulations are adopted, establish an effort whereby a group of local engineers, contractors,
developers and governmental officials collaborate to improve the governmental pavement construction
inspection program. The focus should be to determine those factors or items that are most important to be
inspected to insure proper pavement performance. Then once those factors are determined, train inspection
personnel how to inspect those factors and document those inspections. The formation of a longer term
inspection oversight group should also be considered.
Benefit: Addresses problem #2.
4. Suggest to the Kenton County Mayors Group that a pavement management system such as the one used
currently by the City of Florence would be a good idea for implementation in Kenton County. Properly
implemented, this type of system will significantly improve long-term customer pavement value.
Benefit: Helps solve problem #3.
5. Adopt a structural subgrade strength minimum for the standard subdivision pavement design of CBR = 2 or
greater for concrete and CBR = 3 or greater for asphalt. Require site specific improvements in design and
construction of the subgrade and/or pavement by a Registered Engineer where these CBR requirements
cant be met with the proposed subdivisions natural soils and proper compaction.
Benefit: Help address problems 5 and 8.
6. Adopt a requirement for geotechnical reports regarding pavement design and subgrade support at multiple
stages of subdivision approval, as described in Exhibit C. These reports will also address other important
soil slope stability and structural issues.
Benefit: Assures adequate subgrade structural support for pavements. Helps address problems 5 and 8.
7. Establish minimum subdivision regulation pavement design for industrial and commercial subdivisions
with stated design parameters, including ESAL loading. Require planned traffic (ESAL) loading analysis
by a registered engineer for all commercial and industrial subdivisions. Where planned traffic loading
exceeds standard design loading or where minimum required CBRs are not met, require the necessary
improvements in pavement design and construction. See Exhibit A for proposed industrial/commercial
pavement designs.
Benefit: Solves problem #7.
8. Increase subgrade cross slope from the current 2%. Use a subgrade cross slope of 3% for concrete and
4.5%+ for asphalt pavements (see Exhibit D, Exhibit E, and Exhibit F).
Benefit: Helps solve problems 5 and 9.
9. Increase finish surface cross slope of all pavements from 2% to 3% (see Exhibit D, Exhibit E, and Exhibit
F).
Benefit: Helps solve problems 5 and 9.
10. Use concrete sloped curb (see Exhibit E) and eliminate use of current concrete rolled curb.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 204
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
Benefit: Helps solve problems 4 and 11 and improves vehicle ride when accessing driveways.
11. Use ODOT 6 chair back curb or equivalent instead of KTC 6 vertical curb. Allow horizontally sawed
driveway apron cuts in this curb type.
Benefit: The ODOT curb is more approachable when parking a car adjacent to the curb and less likely to
damage wheel rims.
12. Require that the front top edge of the sidewalk along the street be constructed 6 +1 above the top of
sloped curb (see Exhibit G).
Benefit: Help solve problem #4 by allowing for future significant asphalt overlays while still maintaining
adequate street drainage (see Exhibit H).
13. Require edge drains along all curb lines as depicted in Exhibit D, Exhibit E, and Exhibit F.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 5 and 9.
14. Require that telephone and electric crossovers under the street and three feet beyond the street to be
installed as follows: Separate the parallel ducts by at least 2 horizontally using spacers; cover with 6 of
fill sand; properly compact with a vibratory plate compactor; add additional conduit as necessary, properly
separated. Cover with fill sand properly compacted. Backfill remaining trench with KTC dense grade
aggregate (DGA) properly compacted up to subgrade (see Exhibit G). Other shallow utility ditches under
the pavement, other than those described in 15 below, are to be similarly bedded, covered, and backfilled.
Benefit: Helps solve problem #6.
15. Require storm catch basins and catch basin storm crossovers to be bedded, covered, backfilled, and drained
into one catch basin as depicted on Exhibit H. Make sure 57s crushed stone is exposed to the base of the
pavement. Properly compact all materials.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 5, 6 and 9.
16. Adopt subdivision street classifications, including number of lots served, street width, subgrade slope,
pavement thicknesses, and curb type, as shown in Exhibit I.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 1, 4, 5 and 9.
17. Adopt the standard of always having the pavement base course, whether stone-based or full-depth asphalt,
extend under the curb as shown in Exhibit D and Exhibit E.
Benefit: Allows for the required use of a 24-inch wide curb instead of the current standard 30-inch wide
curb and helps solve problems 5, 9 and 11.
18. Adopt asphalt material standards which more narrowly define those KTC asphalt material standards which
are appropriate for residential subdivision pavements. Set out testing requirements for asphalt aggregate
and liquid asphalt content. Also establish density testing requirements for in-place pavement. Use KTC
crushed stone base material for stone-based pavements. Require regular reporting and passing results of
KTC gradation requirement from base material sources.
Benefit: Helps solve problems #2 and #10.
19. For asphalt pavements, increase the cross slope of the apron of the 24 concrete curb and gutter section to
6% (see Exhibit D and Exhibit E). Require the asphalt surface at the apron to be finished 1/4 + 1/8 above
the apron and properly sealed.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 5 and 9.
20. Install finish course of asphalt no later than one year from the date of installation of the asphalt base and
intermediate course (see Exhibit D and Exhibit E). When the finish course of asphalt is installed
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 205
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
immediately as a part of initial construction, asphalt base material may be substituted for intermediate base
material.
Benefit: Insures that asphalt streets are completed on a timely basis.
21. Specify concrete mixes used for concrete pavements to have six bags of cement per cubic yard. Require all
large aggregates (above #8s) to be crushed limestone. Require that #4 limestone be included in the
pavement mix. A maximum aggregate size of 57s is appropriate for concrete curb and gutter. Require
KTC approval of hardness requirements for crushed limestone aggregate sources. See Exhibit J for SECC
recommended concrete aggregate content and a discussion of the importance of large aggregate size in
concrete pavement.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 12 and 13.
22. Eliminate expansion joints in concrete pavements. Use skewed contraction joints as shown in Exhibit K.
Place contraction joints at a maximum spacing of 15 O.C.
Benefit: Helps solve problems 12 and 13.
23. For concrete pavements, provide 3 of expansion joint material in the driveway apron area within the right
of way (see Exhibit L) to provide for the management of any concrete pavement growth that does occur.
Inspect placement when inspecting driveway apron/sidewalk construction. City/County street maintenance
personnel will monitor any closing of expansion joints, as a part of normal street maintenance, and take
appropriate action.
Benefit: Provides for management of street growth problems outside of the pavement, when they do occur
(problem #12.b).
24. Use pavement lugs in concrete pavement as shown in Exhibit M to help minimize potential pavement
growth in critical pavement geometric conditions. These critical conditions, which are identified in Exhibit
N and Exhibit O, have historically been the pavement geometric conditions where subdivision pavement
growth problems have been more likely to occur.
Benefit: This should help mitigate the problem described in problem #12.b.
25. The KCPC should consider the merits of replacing the current cul-de-sac design with the Hamilton County
teardrop cul-de-sac design (see Exhibit P).
Benefit: This teardrop design might make turn around for public service vehicles easier than the current
design.
The preceding represents our group consensus problem identification and recommendations for improvement in
future Kenton County subdivision pavements.
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS
As a part of the SECCs work, they solicited and received the cooperation from three local developers (Arlinghaus,
Drees, and Fischer), several local governmental entities, local construction contractors, and material suppliers in the
construction of several pavement demonstration projects. These demonstration projects were built in 12 different
new subdivision sections throughout Northern Kentucky during the period of September 2012 through July 2014.
The purpose of these demonstration projects was to evaluate the constructability, ease of quality control, cost,
andto the extent possibleprobable long-term performance characteristics of various material specifications,
construction methods, and construction details. Included among the tested alternatives were many of the final
recommendations of this report which have been suggested for adoption in the Revised Subdivision Regulations for
Kenton County. There were also alternatives tested that were not used in the SECCs final recommendations.
These demonstration projects greatly enhanced the confidence of the SSEC in their final recommendations.
Kenton County Subdivision Regulations November 6, 2015
Page 206
Appendix C: Engineers Committee Final Report
Among the final SSEC recommendations contained in this report that were tested in these demonstration projects
were critical parts of recommendations number 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
CONCLUSION
The recommendations for improvement are in the areas of design, construction standards, construction quality
control, and maintenance of pavements, which are interdependent and all necessary to insure good
homeowner/taxpayer pavement value. The SECC also recognizes that proper pavement performance expectation
setting for all involved in the regulation, design, construction, and maintenance of subdivision pavements is a
critical component of obtaining good pavement value. Hopefully, our work here will help improve communication
in this regard.
Our work on problem definition and recommendations is now complete. We now respectfully ask the Commission
to accept our work product and have your staff help us incorporate this work product into the current Kenton
County draft subdivision regulations which will be considered for adoption by the KCPC at public hearing.
Thank you for your consideration.

Ted Vogelpohl, P.E.
After this report was submitted to the Kenton County Planning Commission in draft form, the Commission
Chairman asked this Committee to work with the KCPC Staff to integrate these recommendations into the KCPC
draft subdivision regulations for consideration of adoption by the Planning Commission. This Committee did so, as
requested.

Design Life: The service or performance period before a new
pavement requires rehabilitation, or the time during which
a new pavement deteriorates from its initial serviceability
to its terminal serviceability. Selected as 20 years.
Life Cycle Analysis: The extended pavement service or analysis period
including maintenance, resurfacing and rehabilitation
beyond the Design Life. Selected as 50 years.
Drainage Coefficient: Selected as 1.0 based on poor quality of drainage and
pavement structure being exposed to moisture levels
approaching saturation up to 5 percent of the time.
Reliability: Factor that incorporates some degree of certainty that the
designs will last for the pavement design life and life
cycle. Selected 80 percent.
Deviation: Standard deviation that accounts for reliability of AASHTO
Road Test data for local conditions. Selected 0.35 for
concrete pavement and 0.45 for asphalt pavement.
Initial Serviceability: Serviceability is described as the ability of a pavement to
serve its intended traffic. The AASHTO serviceability
scale is 0 to 5, with 5 being a flawless pavement and 0
being a pavement that is impossible to travel. Initial
serviceability is a function of pavement type and
construction quality. Selected 4.2 for concrete and 4.5 for
asphalt.
Terminal Serviceability: The lowest serviceability that will be tolerated before
rehabilitation. Selected 2.5 for concrete and asphalt
4
pavements.
Modulus of Rupture: Average 28-day third point flexural strength of concrete.
Selected as 600 psi.
Modulus of Elasticity: Selected as 3,600,000 psi for concrete.
CBR: California bearing Ratio of subgrade soils. Selected 2
(minimum) for concrete pavements and 3 (minimum) for
asphalt pavements. Selected a modulus of subgrade
reaction (K) of 50 pci to correlate with CBR = 2 for
concrete pavements. Selected a resilient modulus (MR)
of 2,700 psi to correlate with a CBR = 3 for asphalt
pavements, which accounts for seasonal environmental
and climatic factors, roadbed soil quality and roadbed soil
moisture and freeze-thaw conditions.
Load Transfer: Load transfer factor for transverse joints in concrete
pavement. Selected 4.4 for undoweled joints and
aggregate interlock only, and 3.2 for doweled joints.

Concrete Commercial/Industrial Street Example:
Using applicable parameters from Table 4.4-1, the calculated doweled concrete
pavement thickness for 3,500,000 ESAL (20-year Design Life) is 9 inches. For a
50-year Life Cycle, the total ESAL are:

Increasing the doweled concrete pavement thickness to 10 inches yields a
calculated ESAL = 8,982,500, which is greater than ESAL50 (8,750,000).
After the asphalt and concrete pavement thickness adjustments for 50-year Life Cycle
considerations are made, the calculated thicknesses in Table 4 become the required
thicknesses in Table 4.4-2.

4 6-8 inch KYTC crushed stone base for residential pavements to be installed in one lift (pug milled) and properly compacted (one
lift). Any crushed stone base greater in thickness than the above noted 6-8 inches must be installed in two lifts. Asphalt base can
be replaced with a structurally equivalent thickness of crushed stone base as long as the following minimum asphalt thicknesses are
maintained: minimum total Asphalt thickness equals 4.5 inches local, 5.5 inches subcollector, 6.5 inches residential collector, and
7.5 inches commercial/industrial
5 Number of lots served for a particular Street is defined as the number of lots which that Street serves as the sole access or, where
a number of Lots are served by more than one access, it is an approximation of the number of lots served that is equivalent to one
access.
- Example 1: A particular section Street serves as the sole access to less than 200 Lots. That Street would then be a
Local Street.
- Example 2: An area of existing and future residential development of 450 Lots is served by more than one access Street.
Only those Streets that will carry traffic and ESAL loading higher than a Subdivision Street that provides sole access to
more than 200 Lots will be classified as a subcollector Street.

ALTERNATE PAVEMENT DESIGNS
The above calculations are based upon a CBR of 2 for concrete pavements and a CBR
of 3 for asphalt pavements, per Table 4.4-1. The following Table 5 presents the
Structural Numbers for Alternate Asphalt Pavement Designs for CBR values ranging
from 2 to 7, for use in Alternate Designs when the documented CBR value is not 3.
Design for CBR values less than 2 is not recommended; rather, the subgrade soils
should be improved to CBR = 2 or greater. The Structural Numbers in Table 5 include
the adjustment for the 50-year Life Cycle consideration.

The thicknesses in Table 6 illustrate that there is very little variation in calculated
pavement thicknesses with changes in CBR. For all street classifications, there is only
0.53 to 0.67 variation in concrete thickness when the CBR changes from 2 to 7.
Therefore, it is recommended that all alternative concrete pavement designs use the
same required thicknesses as the base or standard designs. The required thicknesses
for each street classification, adjusted for 50-year Life Cycle considerations, are given in
Table 7.

SUBGRADE QUALITY VERIFICATION
A qualified geotechnical engineer will provide the verification of the site specific subgrade support. The City of
Cincinnatis list of qualified geotechnical engineers will be used as the base approved list for geotechnical
engineers with the ability of KCPC to add to or delete from that list. The following steps will be taken:
a. At the preliminary subdivision plan stage, the geotechnical engineer will use his local soils
knowledge, USGS soils mapping, and a visual field reconnaissance to report on the likelihood of soils
on that specific site meeting the minimum CBR values for subgrade. The report will also include
observations relative to the sites suitability for building support.
b. At construction drawing submittal, the geotechnical engineer will submit a report on the soil types,
the expected CBR of those soil types that exist on that section of lots being submitted (or possibly
on the subdivision as a whole). This submittal will also include information on other issues of
structural subsurface stability for proposed subdivision public land improvements planned for the
site. These judgments will be based on the results of soil borings, open trench exploration, soil
testing, etc. that are sufficient for the geotechnical engineer to render his engineering opinion.
c. During mass earthwork, subgrade materials will be evaluated as to their meeting required densities
and as to the subgrade materials being used being capable of producing the CBR required to meet
the base subdivision street design when compacted to the required densities. Reports as to these
results will be submitted by the geotechnical engineer to the KCPC prior to the installation of
pavement. If subgrade soils are substandard, remedial subgrade/pavement enhancement will be
designed and submitted to KCPC.
d. Prior to pavement being installed, the subgrade will be tested for density, moisture content, proof
rolled, inspected for uniformity and proper subgrade profile according to approved procedures of
the KCPC by properly qualified and supervised inspectors.

RECOMMENDED SUBDIVISION STREET CLASSIFICATIONS AND THICKNESSES*
*The Design criteria are contained in Exhibit A of this report
1Average thickness. Varies from 1 inch less at centerline to 1 inch greater at gutter apron
2 Plain Concrete, tooled skewed transverse Contraction Joints without dowels (see Exhibit K)
3 Plain Concrete, with doweled and sawed (non-skewed) transverse Contraction Joints
4 6-8 inch KYTC crushed stone base for residential pavements to be installed in one lift (pug milled) and properly compacted (one
lift). Any crushed stone base greater in thickness than the above noted 6-8 inches must be installed in two lifts. Asphalt base can
be replaced with a structurally equivalent thickness of crushed stone base as long as the following minimum asphalt thicknesses
are maintained: minimum total Asphalt thickness equals 4.5 inches local, 5.5 inches subcollector, 6.5 inches residential collector,
and 7.5 inches commercial/industrial
5 Number of lots served for a particular Street is defined as the number of lots which that Street serves as the sole access or, where
a number of Lots are served by more than one access, it is an approximation of the number of lots served that is equivalent to one
access.
- Example 1: A particular section Street serves as the sole access to less than 200 Lots. That Street would then be a
Local Street.
- Example 2: An area of existing and future residential development of 450 Lots is served by more than one access Street.
Only those Streets that will carry traffic and ESAL loading higher than a Subdivision Street that provides sole access to
more than 200 Lots will be classified as a subcollector Street.
6 Geogrid shall be Tensar TX5 triaxial geogrid.
7 Parking one side
8 No on-street parking
9 All residential collector streets serving above 1,000 lots and industrial or commercial streets are to include heavy vehicle (ESAL)
traffic analysis.

There are numerous issues to consider in the selection of aggregate type and distribution in concrete
mixes. In un-reinforced concrete pavement with non-doweled contraction joints (all Kenton County Sub
Reg pavements except commercial/industrial), having a relatively high percentage of large, angular
aggregate supports good long-term contraction joint performance. The comparative measure of
aggregate size distribution used for concrete is the percentage retained on various size sieves.
The following table compares aggregate distribution for typical pavement mixes used in Northern
Kentucky in the 1980s and earlier, the mid 1990s through today, and the SSEC recommended
pavement aggregate mix.

GENERAL RULES OF TOOLED CONTRACTION
JOINT LAYOUT
1.) Skew joints 2' in each 12.5' lane; 2'-4" skew in each 14' lane.
2.) Always have the driver's side front wheel of the vehicle hit the skewed
joint first.
3.) Maximum joint spacing = 15'; adjust joint spacing as necessary to
keep spacing above a 8' minimum.
4.) On horizontal curves, layout joint spacing along centerline at 14' O.C.;
visually determine a radial line from the centerline back to the curb;
measure back (forward) from that point 2' to set the skew, remembering
the driver's side front wheel of the vehicle hits the skewed joint first. Tool
the joint at the skewed line.
5.) At intersections, catch basins and cul-de-sacs, follow joint layout
shown.
