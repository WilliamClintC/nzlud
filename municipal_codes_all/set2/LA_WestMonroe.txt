Sec. 209. - Actions. 
(a)  Except as provided in this section, actions may be taken either by ordinance, resolution or motion at the discretion of the mayor and board of aldermen. 
(b)  All actions having the force and effect of law; or any action that creates a contractual obligation of the city; or any action establishing a fine or other penalty; or any action that requires an expenditure of funds either immediately or in the future; or any action making an appropriation; authorizing the borrowing of money; levying a tax; license or other revenue measure; creating a district; establishing a rule, regulation or law for the violation of which a fine or imprisonment can be imposed; granting or revoking a franchise, or placing any burden upon or limiting the use of private property, shall be by ordinance.

It is hereby further provided that if an ordinance is the form of action required by general statutory law for the issuance of bonds or other evidences of indebtedness or for the construction of sewerage, street paving, water and drainage improvements to be financed by local or special assessments, the requirements of section 2.14 hereof shall not apply insofar as it requires ordinances to be read in full prior to their adoption. 
Editor's note- Section 2.14 of the charter, referred to above, is codified herein as section 211. 
Sec. 210. - Emergency action. 
(a)  The mayor and board of aldermen may waive the procedural requirements of this charter for the passage of ordinances which are necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety. An emergency ordinance shall be adopted by the affirmative vote of four-fifths of the entire authorized membership of the board of aldermen, and the nature of the emergency shall be specifically stated in the minutes of the meeting of the governing body. Emergency legislation may be vetoed by the mayor immediately after its passage, but another four-fifths vote of the board of aldermen[,] immediately after the mayor's veto, shall override the mayor's veto. Emergency legislation shall be effective upon passage. 
(b)  Emergency ordinances shall be effective for no longer than thirty (30) days. The board of aldermen, however, upon a vote of four-fifths of its membership may extend the life of an emergency ordinance for an additional thirty (30) days, but no such ordinance may be extended beyond that period. 
Sec. 211. - Ordinances. 
    The style of all ordinances shall be: "Be it ordained by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the City of West Monroe, Louisiana ...." All ordinances shall, within fourteen (14) days after they are passed, be published once in the official journal of the municipality or if there be none, in some newspaper of general circulation therein. Ordinances shall not be enforced, unless for a cause the contrary be ordered, until the day after their publication. All ordinances and resolutions shall be read and considered by sections at a public meeting of the mayor and board of aldermen, and, if adopted shall be signed by the mayor or other officer presiding in his absence. The vote on their final passage shall be taken by "yeas" and "nays" which shall be entered on the minutes by the clerk. A vote shall never be taken on an ordinance not previously reduced to typewritten form. An ordinance shall contain only one (1) subject, which shall be indicated in its title. An ordinance which is amended or revised shall set forth in full the section as amended or revised. The clerk shall keep a book to be styled "Ordinances, City of West Monroe, Louisiana," in which he shall file the original of every ordinance which has been adopted immediately after its passage; he shall append to each a note stating the date of its passage and cite therein the book and page of the minutes containing the record of its passage. The ordinances to be so recorded are those which are in their nature laws of the municipality, and not mere orders or decrees temporary in their nature. 
Sec. 212. - Veto of ordinances by mayor. 
    Any ordinance vetoed by the mayor in accordance with the provisions of this charter shall not be overridden until the next regular meeting of the mayor and board of aldermen. At the next regular session, a simple majority vote shall be sufficient to override the mayor's veto. This section shall not apply to emergency ordinances which must be immediately vetoed by the mayor and which veto by the mayor can be then subsequently at the same meeting overridden by another four-fifths vote of the board of aldermen all as provided hereinabove in this charter. 
Sec. 213. - Investigation and removal. 
    The board of aldermen may investigate the operation of any department or agency of the city government or any department or agency which derives support from appropriations made by the board of aldermen. In any such investigation the board of aldermen may administer oaths, subpoena witnesses and compel the production of records. 
Sec. 214. - Code. 
    Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the codification of all ordinances of the City of West Monroe, Louisiana, the authority being granted that the mayor and board of aldermen shall provide for the codification of the ordinances and laws of the City of West Monroe, Louisiana, at such time when sufficient funds are available. 
    At such time when the codification of ordinances becomes a reality as provided for herein, the classification and arrangement of all ordinances of general applicability shall be in accordance with The Code of the City of West Monroe, Louisiana. The city attorney shall keep the Code current. The mayor and board of aldermen shall in its discretion decide upon periodic published revisions of the Code.

ARTICLE A. - FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION 

Sec. 2-4001. - Community development procurement. 
(a)  The written procurement policy attached to Ordinance No. 1916 is adopted and shall be used for the procurement of all goods and services related to the expenditure of funds related to the planning grant thereunder and future grants under the community development block grant program. 
(b)  The mayor, on behalf of the city, is authorized and directed to do any acts and sign any documents necessary and proper to implement this policy. 
(Ord. No. 1996, §§ 1, 2, 11-8-83) 
Sec. 2-4002. - Investment policy. 
(a)  General purpose. The general purpose of this investment policy is: 
(1)  To develop and outline clear investment guidelines and objectives; 
(2)  To develop procedures and constraints for the investment process itself; and 
(3)  To develop a consistent method of reporting and monitoring investments and their market value. 
    All policies and investment objectives and decisions shall reflect the primary mandate to manage public funds prudently. 
(b)  Investment objective. All investment objectives shall be governed by the following priority of goals: Safety of Principal, Liquidity, and Yield. In addition, all investments must qualify as acceptable and lawful under all applicable state and federal laws, particularly including, but not limited to, the provisions of R.S. 33:2955, as from time to time amended. 
    The city may opt to create separate investment accounts in order to segregate activity related to a specific purpose. It is understood that the specific investment guidelines may vary from account to account depending on the designated use for each pool of funds. Each account that is managed separately should have its own set of investment guidelines that specifically state the types of investments to be used, the maximum maturity of the allowable investments and any other limitation. Such investment guidelines shall be developed by the finance director and approved by the mayor. 
(1)  Safety of principal. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective will be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk while avoiding the erosion of principal by inflation. 
a.  Credit risk. Permissible investments shall be limited to those permitted by the provisions of R.S. 33:2955, as from time to time amended, or as expressly otherwise allowed or provided by law. The city shall not be permitted to invest in mutual or trust funds, except for permitted money market mutual funds. The city shall not invest over twenty-five (25) percent of its total portfolio with the same issuer to decrease the possibility of credit risk, unless it issuer is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. The city shall not invest in corporate bonds. 
The city may invest funds with LAMP, the Louisiana Asset Management Pool. 
b.  Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk shall be mitigated by: 
i)  Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash requirements for anticipated demands, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity, and 
ii)  By stipulating that the maximum maturity of any single security in the city investment portfolio can not exceed three (3) years. Longer term securities may only be used for a specific pool of funds such as funds held for construction purposes or bond reserve funds. 
iii)  Inflation risk. Inflation risk will be minimized through the use of permissible investments that are shorter than or equal to the maximum allowable maturity of three (3) years. 
(2)  Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated by the finance director of the city. A minimum of five (5) percent of the total investment portfolio shall be held in cash, money market funds or LAMP. Furthermore, since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets. 
(3)  Yield. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a fair rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. In order to compare the rate of return of the investment portfolio to the market return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, the investment portfolio will be benchmarked against an available benchmark that is reflective of the investment portfolio composition and characteristics. However, return on investment is of least importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. 
(c)  Standards of care. 
(1)  Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials and investment management firms shall be, first and foremost, to comply with Louisiana State Law. In addition, the standard shall be the "prudent person" standard as defined in Louisiana law and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and this investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and any required action is carried out in accordance with the terms of this policy. 
Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived. 
(2)  Ethics and conflicts of interest. Elected officials, officers and employees of the city involved in the investment process shall at all times comply with Louisiana State Law governing ethics for public officials and public employees. 
Elected officials, officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. 
Elected officials, employees and investment officials shall disclose any material interest in financial institutions with which they conduct business. They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. 
Employees and officers shall refrain from undertaking personal investment transactions with the same broker(s) with whom business is conducted on behalf of their entity. 
(3)  Delegation of authority. Authority to manage the investment program is granted to the mayor and the director of finance. The primary responsibility for the operation of the investment program is hereby delegated to the director of finance, who shall carry out established written procedures and internal controls for the operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the mayor and the city. The director of finance shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials and his designees. 
The city reserves the right to select a qualified investment management firm to act as the investment manager on behalf of and for the benefit of the city. The employment of an investment management firm shall be done by contract and approved by the city in accordance with its best business interests in mind. Any investment transactions undertaken by the investment management firm shall be conducted in such a manner as to ensure that the city obtains the best purchase or sale price possible while maintaining high ethical standards in soliciting price quotes from broker/dealers. 
Should the city chose to employ the services of an investment management firm to act as the investment manager or seek the investment management advice of a broker/dealer, the investment management firm and their representatives and/or the broker/dealer and their representative brokers should have expertise in the types of securities allowable under the Louisiana Statutes. The investment management firm and/or each broker with whom the city shall be charged with having full knowledge of the city's investment objectives and investment policy, as well as the investment statutes of the State of Louisiana. 
Competitive bidding will be used and documented for all sale transactions. 
(4)  Safekeeping and custody. The city shall utilize the services of a qualified financial institution or a security broker/dealer to provide custodial services for its investment portfolio. Security broker/dealers may provide custodial services, provided that the broker/dealer meets a minimum capital requirement of twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) and has been in business for at least five (5) years. 
City may select a qualified institution that offers combined services of investment management and custodial services, provided such firm meets or exceeds the qualifications above. An annual review of the financial condition and registration of the investment manager and/or the broker/dealers and the custodial services provider will be conducted by the director of finance. 
(5)  Internal controls. The director of finance is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the entity are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. 
Accordingly, the director of finance shall establish a process for annual independent review by an external auditor to assure compliance with policies and procedures. The internal controls shall address the following points: 
a.  Investment suitability. Purchased securities are in compliance with Louisiana State Law and the statutes that govern the investments of Louisiana political subdivisions and are in compliance with the city investment policy statement. 
b.  Control of collusion. Collusion is a situation where two (2) or more employees are working in conjunction to defraud their employer. 
c.  Custodial safekeeping. Purchased securities, including appropriate collateral, shall be placed with a qualified regulated custodial agency separate from the issuer of the security for custodial safekeeping. 
d.  Avoidance of physical delivery securities. Book entry securities are much easier to transfer and account for since actual delivery of a document never takes place. Delivered securities must be properly safeguarded against loss or destruction. The potential for fraud and loss increases with physically delivered securities. Louisiana Community Bank certificates of deposit are exempt of this. 
e.  Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members. 
f.  Written confirmation is required for all trades and wire transfers. Due to the potential for error and improprieties arising from telephone transactions, all telephone transactions should be supported by written communications and approved by the appropriate person. Written communications may be via fax but the safekeeping institution should have a list of authorized signatures. 
g.  Development of a wire transfer agreement with the lead bank and/or the appointed custodial agency. This agreement should outline the various controls, security provisions, and delineate responsibilities of each party making and receiving wire transfers. 
(6)  Delivery versus payment. All trades, where applicable, will be executed by delivery versus payment (DVP). This ensures that securities are deposited in the eligible financial institution simultaneously with the release of funds. Securities will be held by the custodian selected by the city as evidenced by safekeeping receipts or by monthly asset statements. 
(d)  Financial reporting and portfolio review. 
(1)  Responsibilities of the director of finance. If the city determines that it is in their best interest to seek the investment management advice of a broker/dealer, the director of finance shall prepare an investment report on a quarterly basis, or more frequently at the request of the city or its external auditor, that provides adequate detail as to the investment activity (purchases, sales, income, unrealized gains/losses, weighted average yield to maturity, etc.) occurring during the time frame of the report. At all times, the director of finance shall maintain adequate documentation supporting all transaction activity and the valuation of the investment securities for review by the external auditor. 
(2)  Responsibilities of the investment management firm. If the city determines that it is in their best interest to hire an investment management firm to act as investment manager, the investment management firm shall provide a monthly report to the director of finance of all investment activity that gives adequate information about the following: 
a.  All purchase and sale transactions occurring during the time period. 
b.  Maturity dates of each security in order to assess the credit risk and interest rate risk of each security as well as the portfolio as a whole. 
c.  The income (loss) derived from each investment security and the investment portfolio as a whole, including the amount of unrealized gains and losses on the investment securities resulting from the appreciation or depreciation of the market value as compared to cost. 
d.  Weighted average yield- to-maturity of the investments of the portfolio. 
e.  The percentage of the total portfolio that each type of investment security represents. 
f.  The relative performance of the investment portfolio versus the appropriate benchmark. 
The investment management firm shall plan to meet with the director of finance on as needed and/or as requested to discuss the status of the portfolio. Telephone consultations and e-mail transmissions shall be acceptable forms of communication unless the city requires otherwise. Additionally, if requested, the investment management firm will present investment performance results on an annual basis to the city or the city finance committee or both. At the request of the city or the city finance committee or both, the investment management firm must make themselves available, with appropriate notice, for additional meetings. 
(3)  Performance standards. The investment portfolio will be managed in accordance with the parameters specified in this policy. In order to compare the rate of return of the investment portfolio to the market return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, the city may compare the investment portfolio of the city against an available benchmark that is reflective of the investment portfolio composition and characteristics. Portfolio performance should be compared to appropriate benchmarks on a regular basis and analyzed within the context of all the risk constraints on the portfolio. 
(4)  Marking to market. A statement of the market value of the portfolio, including current credit risk information disclosing the credit quality ratings of the individual securities in the portfolio, shall be issued at least quarterly. This will ensure that the minimal amount of review has been performed on the investment portfolio in terms of value and subsequent price volatility. 
An independent pricing source is an important part of a sound investment process. The custodial agent of the investment securities shall provide independent pricing on a regular basis. Should broker pricing be required for some securities such as mortgages, the custodial agent shall verify the accuracy through some other market pricing mechanism such as Bloomberg Financial Services. 
If the director of finance is managing the portfolio, he/she shall obtain an independent pricing source. If broker pricing is all that is available, two (2) brokers should be used to price all securities. The average of the prices obtained for each security should be used for reporting purposes. 
(e)  Policy. 
(1)  Exemption. No investments shall be exempt from this policy. 
(2)  Amendment. Any changes must be approved by the city upon the recommendation of the mayor and the finance director.

Sec. 2-4031. - Remedies of collector generally. 
(a)  Presumption. For the purpose of the enforcement of this article, and the collection of the tax levied hereunder, it is presumed that all tangible personal property imported into this city or held in this city by any dealer is to be sold at retail, used or consumed, or stored for use or consumption in this city, or leased or rented within this city, and is subject to the tax herein levied; this presumption shall be prima facie only, and subject to proof furnished to the collector. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 47:314. 
(b)  Delinquency. Failure to pay any tax due as provided in this article shall ipso facto, without demand or putting in default, cause said tax, interest, penalties and costs to become immediately delinquent, and the collector is hereby vested with authority, on motion in a court of competent jurisdiction, to take a rule on the dealer, to show cause in not less than two (2) nor more than ten (10) days, exclusive of holidays, after the service thereof, which may be tried out of term and in chambers, and shall always be tried by preference, why said dealer should not be ordered to cease from further pursuit of business as a dealer. If the rule is made absolute, the order rendered thereon shall be considered a judgment in favor of the city, prohibiting such dealer from the further pursuit of said business until such time as he has paid the delinquent tax, interest, penalties and costs, and every violation of the injunction shall be considered as a contempt of court, and punished according to law. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 47:314. 
(c)  Interest; penalty; attorney fees. If the amount of tax due by the dealer is not paid on or before the twentieth day of the month next following the month for which the tax is due, there shall be collected, with said tax, interest upon said unpaid amount, at the rate of one and one-quarter (11/4) percent per month, or fractional part thereof, to be computed from the first day of the month next following the month for which the tax is due until it is paid; and in addition to the interest that may be so due there shall also be collected a penalty equivalent to five (5) percent for each thirty (30) days, or fraction thereof, of delinquency, not to exceed twenty-five (25) percent in aggregate, of the tax due, when such tax is not paid within thirty (30) days of the date the tax first becomes due and payable, and in the event of suit, attorneys' fees at the rate of ten (10) percent of the aggregate of tax, interest and penalty. 
(d)  Failure to report; false report. In the event any dealer fails to make a report and pay the tax as provided by this article, or in case the dealer makes a grossly incorrect report, or a report that is false or fraudulent, it shall be the duty of the collector to make an estimate for the taxable period of the retail sales, or sales of services, of such dealer, or of the gross proceeds from rentals or leases of tangible personal property by the dealer, and an estimate of the cost price of all articles of tangible personal property imported by the dealer for use or consumption or distribution or storage to be used or consumed in this city and assess and collect the tax and interest, plus penalty, if such have accrued, on the basis of such assessment, which shall be considered prima facie correct, and the burden to show the contrary shall rest upon the dealer. In the event such estimate and assessment requires an examination of books, records or documents, or an audit thereof, then the collector shall add to the assessment the cost of such examination, together with any penalties accruing thereon. Such costs and penalties when collected shall be placed to the account of the "sales tax fund" in the same manner as are the taxes collected under this article. 
    If any dealer fails to make any return required by this article or makes an incorrect return, and the circumstances indicate willful negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, but no intent to defraud, there shall be imposed, in addition to any other penalties provided herein, a specific penalty of five (5) percent of the tax or deficiency found to be due, or ten dollars ($10.00), whichever is greater. This specific penalty shall be an obligation to be collected and accounted for in the same manner as if it were a part of the tax due and can be enforced either in a separate action or in the same action for the collection of the tax. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 47:307. 
(e)  Final payment. If any dealer liable for any tax, interest or penalty levied under this article shall sell out his business or stock of goods or shall quit the business, he shall make a final return and payment within fifteen (15) days after the date of selling or quitting the business. His successor, successors, or assigns, if any, shall withhold sufficient of the purchase money to cover the amount of such taxes, interest and penalties due and unpaid until such time as the former owner shall produce a receipt from the collector showing that they have been paid, or a certificate stating that no taxes, interest, or penalties are due. If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods shall fail to withhold purchase money as provided in this section, he shall be personally liable for the payment of the taxes, interest and penalties accrued and unpaid on account of the operation of the business by any former owner, owners, or assignors. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 47:308.

All persons so notified must, within five (5) days after receipt of such notice, advise the collector of any and all such credits, other personal property, or debts, in their possession, under their control or owing by them, as the case may be. 
(g)  Imports. In the event any dealer has imported tangible personal property and he fails to produce an invoice showing the cost price of the articles which are subject to tax, or the invoice does not reflect the true or actual cost price, then the collector shall ascertain, in any manner feasible, the true cost price and assess and collect the tax with interest, plus penalties, if such have accrued, on the true cost price as assessed by him. The assessment so made shall be considered prima facie correct, and the burden shall be on the dealer to show the contrary. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 47:307. 
(h)  Lease; rental. In the case of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, if the consideration given or reported by the dealer does not, in the judgment of the collector, represent the true or actual consideration, then the collector is authorized to fix the same and collect the tax thereon for the board in the same manner as provided in subsection (g), with interest plus penalties, if such have accrued. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, R.S. 47:307. 
(i)  Transportation companies. In the event any transportation company, agency, or firm shall refuse to permit the examination of its books, records and other documents by the collector, the collector may proceed by rule, in term time or in vacation, in any court of competent jurisdiction and require said transportation company, agency or firm to show cause why the collector should not be permitted to examine its books, records and other documents. This rule may be tried in open court or in chambers. In case said rule is made absolute, the same shall be considered a judgment of the court and every violation of said judgment shall be considered as a contempt thereof and punished according to law.

(j)  Examination of records. If any dealer, subject to make and file a return required by any of the provisions of this article, fails to render such return within the time required, or renders a return which is false or fraudulent, in that it contains statements which differ from the true gross sales, purchases, leases, or rentals, or other transactions, taxable under this article, or otherwise fails to comply with the provisions of this article, for the taxable period for which said return is made, the collector shall give such dealer fifteen (15) days' notice, in writing, requiring such dealer to appear before him or his assistant, with such books, records and papers as he may require, relating to the business of such dealer, for such taxable period; and said collector may require such dealer, or other agents or employees of such dealer, to give testimony or to answer interrogatories, under oath administered by the collector or his assistants, respecting the sale at retail, the use, or consumption, or distribution, or storage for use or consumption, in this city, or lease or rental of tangible personal property, or other transactions, subject to tax, or the failure to make report thereof, as provided in this ordinance. 
(k)  Court order. If any dealer fails to make a return, or refuses to permit an examination of his, the dealer's books, records or papers, or to appear and answer questions within the scope of such investigation relating to the sale, use, consumption, distribution, storage, lease or rental of tangible personal property, or sale of services, the collector may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction, for an order requiring such dealer to make such return or requiring the dealer, or his agents or employees, to appear and answer any such questions or permit such examination, and the court or any judge thereof, shall thereupon issue an order, upon such reasonable notice as shall be prescribed therein, to be served upon said dealer or the agents or employees of such dealer, directing him or them to so appear and testify, and to produce such books, records and papers as may be required.

The importation into this city of tangible personal property which is subject to tax, by truck, automobile, or other means of transportation other than a common carrier, without having first obtained a permit as described in section 2-4030 (if the tax imposed by this article on said tangible personal property has not been paid), shall be construed as an attempt to evade payment of the said tax and the same is hereby prohibited, and the said truck, automobile, or means of transportation other than a common carrier and said taxable property may be seized by the board in order to secure the same as evidence in a trial and the same shall be subject to forfeiture and sale in the manner provided for in this article. 
(m)  Attachment. The failure of any dealer, who imports tangible personal property from outside the city into the city for use or consumption or distribution or storage to be used or consumed in this city, or who imports for lease or rental any tangible personal property subject to the provisions of this ordinance, to comply with this section shall ipso facto make the said tax, interest, penalties and costs delinquent and shall be construed as an attempt to avoid the payment of same which shall be sufficient grounds for attachment of such tangible personal property wherever the same may be located or found, whether said delinquent dealer is a resident or nonresident of this city, and whether said tangible personal property is in the possession of said delinquent dealer or in the possession of other persons; provided that it is the intention of this article to prevent the disposition of said tangible personal property in order to insure payment of the tax imposed hereby, together with interest, penalties, and costs, and authority to attach is hereby specifically authorized and granted to the board. 
    In addition to the penalties prescribed in subsections (l) and (m), any person, or dealer, who shall violate the provisions thereof, upon conviction shall be fined or imprisoned as provided in section 1-1008; and each importation or shipment by truck, automobile or other means of transportation, other than a common carrier, found to be in violation of the provisions of these subsections shall constitute a separate offense. 
(n)  Personal debt. The liability of any person or dealer arising from any tax, interest and penalty, or any of them, imposed by this article, from the time they are due, shall be a personal debt of such person, or dealer to the board recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction in an action at law by the board. Such debts, whether sued upon or not, shall be a lien on all the property of such delinquent person, or dealer, except as against an innocent purchaser for value without notice in the actual course of business, and shall have preference in any distribution of the assets of the person, or dealer, whether in bankruptcy, insolvency, or otherwise. The proceeds of any judgment or order obtained hereunder shall be paid to the board. 
(o)  Security. The board may require a bond or other security satisfactory to the collector for the payment of any taxes, fees, interest and penalties, or any of them, imposed pursuant to this article when he shall find that the collection thereof may be prejudiced without such security. 
(p)  Estimate of taxes. If any person, or dealer, shall fail to make a return or report as required by this article, the collector, within three (3) years after the last day on which the omitted report could have been filed without penalty, may make an estimate of the amount of taxes such person, or dealer, is liable to pay under the terms hereof, from any information he is able to conveniently obtain, and according to such estimate so made by him, assess the taxes, fees, penalties and interest due the board from such person, or dealer, give notice of such assessment to such person, or dealer and must make demand upon him for payment, or otherwise as the said claim shall prescribe. 
(q)  Deficient returns. After a return or report is filed under the provisions of this article, the collector shall cause to be examined and make such further audit or investigation as he may deem necessary, and if therefrom, he shall determine that there is a deficiency with respect to the payment of any tax due under this article, he shall assess the additional amount of tax, and any penalties and interest, or either of them due the board from such person, or dealer, and make demand upon him for payment. 
(r)  Arbitrary assessment. If the collector finds that any person, or dealer liable for the payment of any tax under this article designs quickly to depart from this city or to remove therefrom his or its property, subject to any lien under the provisions hereof, or to discontinue business, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or render wholly, or partly ineffectual any proceedings that might be instituted to collect such tax, whereby it shall have become important that such proceedings be instituted without delay, the collector may make an arbitrary assessment as herein provided, whether or not any return or report is then due by law, and may proceed under such arbitrary assessment to collect the tax, or demand security for it, and thereafter shall cause notice of such findings to be given to such a dealer, together with a demand for an immediate return or report, and immediate payment of such tax. 
    All taxes, penalties and interest assessed pursuant to the provisions of the last three (3) preceding subsections, shall be paid within fifteen (15) days after notice and demand shall have been mailed to the dealer liable therefor by the board. If such taxes, penalties and interest so assessed shall not be paid within such fifteen (15) days, there shall be added to the amount assessed, in addition to interest as hereinabove provided, and any other penalties provided by this article, a sum equivalent to five (5) percent of this tax. 
(s)  Distraint and sale. If any dealer against whom taxes have been assessed under the provisions of this article shall refuse or neglect to pay such taxes within the time prescribed herein, it shall be lawful for the collector, or his duly authorized representative, who is charged with the enforcement of collection of such taxes, to enforce collection of such taxes, together with such interest and other additional amounts as are added by law, by distraint and sale of any property or rights to property belonging to the delinquent dealer. 
(t)  Payment by dealer. Any dealer who shall neglect, fail or refuse to collect the tax as provided in section 2-4034, upon any, every and all retail sales made by him, or his agent, or employee, which is subject to tax, shall be liable for and pay the tax himself. 
(u)  Violations generally. For any one of the following violations, in addition to being liable for the other penalties provided herein, the person named shall be guilty of a misdemeanor: 
(1)  Any person who as a purchaser is obligated to report and pay the tax imposed upon any purchase made by him under section 2-4034 and who fails, neglects and refuses to file a return thereof with the collector and pay the tax imposed thereon, within the time stated after such sale is made;

(v)  Corporations.

If the dealer prevails, the collector shall refund the amount to the claimant, with interest at the rate of two (2) percent per annum covering the period from the date the said funds were received by the board to the date of refund. 
(b)  Scope; service. This section shall afford a legal remedy and right of action in any state, city or federal court having jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter, for a full and complete adjudication of any and all questions arising in the enforcement of this article, as to the legality of any tax accrued or accruing or the method of enforcement thereof. In such actions service shall be upon the collector. 
(c)  Subjects of suit. This section shall be construed to provide a legal remedy in the state, city or federal courts, by action of law, in case such taxes are claimed to be an unlawful burden upon interstate commerce, or the collection thereof, in violation of any Act of Congress or the United States Constitution, or in any case where jurisdiction is vested in any of the courts of the United States; provided that upon request of the dealer and upon proper showing by such dealer that the principle of law involved in an additional assessment is already pending before the courts for judicial determination, the said dealer, upon agreement to abide by the decision of the courts, may pay the additional assessment under protest, but need not file an additional suit. In such cases the tax so paid under protest shall be segregated and held by the collector until the question of law involved has been determined by the courts and shall then be disposed of as therein provided.

Thereafter, the collector shall grant a hearing to such dealer, if a hearing has been requested, and may make an order confirming, modifying, or vacating any such finding or assessment. The filing of any such protest shall not abate any penalty for nonpayment, nor shall it stay the right of the collector to collect the tax in any manner herein provided unless the dealer shall furnish security of a kind and in an amount satisfactory to the collector. Appeals from the decision of the collector shall be direct to any state, city or federal court of competent jurisdiction as provided for in subsection (b) of this section.

(d)  Certificate of registration. In order to aid in the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this article, and to collect all of the taxes imposed by this article, on or before December 1, 1976, or in the case of dealers commencing business after December 1, 1976, or opening new places of business after such date, within three (3) days after such commencement or opening, every dealer purchasing or importing tangible personal property for resale shall file with the collector a certificate of registration in a form prescribed by him. The collector shall, within five (5) days after such registration, issue without charge to each dealer who purchases or imports for resale a certificate of authority empowering such dealer to collect the tax from the purchaser, and the duplicates thereof, for each additional place of business of such dealer. Each certificate or duplicate shall state the place of business to which it is applicable. Such certificate of authority shall be prominently displayed in all places of business of the dealer. A dealer who has no regular place of doing business shall attach such certificate to his cart, stand, truck or other merchandising device. Such certificate shall be nonassignable and nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the collector upon the dealer's ceasing to do business at the place therein named. 
(e)  Duty of wholesalers. A manufacturer, wholesale dealer, jobber or supplier shall refuse to accept a certificate that any property upon which a tax is imposed by this article is purchased for resale, and shall collect the tax imposed by this article, unless the purchaser shall have filed a certificate of registration and received a certificate of authority to collect the tax imposed hereby; provided, however, that the payment of the tax by such purchaser shall not relieve the purchaser of the duty herein imposed upon such purchaser to collect the tax upon any resale made by him; but such purchaser who shall thereafter file a certificate of registration and receive a certificate of authority to collect the tax may, upon application therefor, receive a refund of the taxes paid by him upon property thereafter resold by him, and upon the receipts from which he shall have collected and paid over to the board the tax herein imposed. 
(f)  Vehicles. The tax imposed by this article upon the sale or use of any motor vehicle, automobile, motorcycle, truck, truck-tractor, trailer, semi-trailer, motor bus, house trailer, or any other vehicle subject to the vehicle registration license tax of the state shall be collected as provided in this subsection. 
(1)  The tax levied by this article on any such vehicle shall be paid to the state vehicle commissioner as the agent of the state collector of revenue at the time of application for a certificate of title or vehicle registration license and such tax shall be administered and collected by the vehicle commissioner in compliance with rules and regulations issued by the collector of revenue and in compliance with the law as construed by the collector of revenue. No certificate of title or vehicle registration license shall be issued until this tax has been paid. The collector of revenue shall be the only proper party to defend or to institute any legal action involving the tax imposed by this article on the sale or use of any motor vehicle, automobile, motorcycle, truck, truck-tractor, trailer, semi-trailer, motor bus, house trailer or any other vehicle subject to the vehicle registration license tax (R.S. 47:451 et seq.).

All labor, parts, accessories and other equipment which are attached to the vehicle at the time of the sale and which are included in the sale price are to be considered a part of the vehicle. 
(3)  It is not the intention of this section to grant an exemption from the tax levied by this article to any sale, use, item or transaction which has heretofore been taxable and this section shall not be construed as so doing. It is the intention of this section to transfer the collection of sales and use tax on vehicles from the vendor to the vehicle commissioner as agent for the collector of revenue of the state, and to provide a method of collection of the tax directly from the vendee or user by the vehicle commissioner as agent of the collector of revenue in accordance with an agreement by and between the collector of revenue or the vehicle commissioner as agent therefor and the board, the execution of which agreement is hereby authorized. Said tax so collected for said collector of revenue shall be paid to the board and sent to the collector as soon as possible, and in any event at least once each quarter, all in accordance with the agreement. 
(4)  The provisions contained in the definition of "retail sale" in section 2-4023 which exclude isolated or occasional sales from the definition of a sale at retail are not to apply to the sale of vehicles which are the subject to this subsection. Isolated or occasional sales of vehicles are hereby defined to be sales at retail and as such are subject to the tax.

The dealer shall state and collect the tax separately from the price paid by the purchaser, but his failure to do so shall not be available as a defense to the purchaser in any proceedings brought under this article.

If the collector shall reject the claim for refund in whole or in part he shall make an order accordingly and serve notice upon such dealer. 
(d)  General authority for refund. Where no question of fact or law is involved, and it appears from the records of the board that any moneys have been erroneously or illegally collected from any dealer, or have been paid by any dealer under a mistake of fact or law, the collector may, at any time within two (2) years of payment, upon making a record in writing of his reasons therefor, certify that any dealer is entitled to such refund and thereupon the collector shall authorize the payment thereof from any appropriation available for such purposes. 
(e)  Return of deposit. When, to secure compliance with any of the provisions of this article, any moneys shall have been deposited with the board by any dealer, and shall have been paid over to the board and the collector shall be satisfied that such dealer has fully complied with all such provisions, the collector shall so certify and authorize repayment from any appropriations available for such purpose to such dealer of such moneys, or such part thereof as the collector shall certify has not been applied by him to the satisfaction of any indebtedness arising under this article.

Chapter 7 - RESIDENTIAL ANTIDISPLACEMENT AND RELOCATION ASSISTANCE PLAN[10] 

Footnotes: 
--- (10) --- 
Editor's note- Ordinance No. 2303, adopted June 13, 1989, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, its inclusion as Ch. 7 was at the discretion of the editor. 
Cross reference- Planning and development, Part 12. 

Sec. 2-7001. - Background. 
    Pursuant to the provisions of recent federal law, the city has adopted this formal antidisplacement and relocation assistance (ARA) plan for all of its activities involving the use of federal funds. The city's adopted plan complies with all requirements of 49 CFR 24, 24 CFR 570, and 24 CFR 511. This plan takes affect on April 2, 1989. 
(Ord. No. 2303, 6-13-89) 
Sec. 2-7002. - General goals. 
    The law requires the city's ARA plan to accomplish three (3) general goals: 
(1)  To provide reasonable moving expenses to those who would be forced to move permanently as a result of federally assisted activity; 
(2)  To provide adequate advisory services to them including information on their rights under law; and 
(3)  To offer assistance to those lower income tenants forced to occupy rental units that have significantly higher rental charges as a result of the federally funded activities. 
(Ord. No. 2303, 6-13-89) 
Sec. 2-7003. - Definitions. 
    [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
    Affordable rent is a monthly rental rate, including utility allowances, which does not exceed: 
(1)  The greater of the rent plus utility allowance the tenant paid prior to initiations of the federally assisted project, or 
(2)  Thirty (30) percent of the tenant's monthly income adjusted for family size (24 CFR 511.10(h)(1)(ii)(A)). 
    Displacement occurs when a tenant is required to move permanently and involuntarily as a direct result of the federally assisted project to another dwelling unit: 
(1)  In the same complex where the rent is not "affordable," or 
(2)  To a replacement unit beyond the complex regardless of affordability (24 CFR 570.606(g)). 
    Replacement dwelling means a unit selected by a displaced tenant that is: 
(1)  Adequate according to 24 CFR 882.109; 
(2)  Functionally equivalent according to 49 CFR 24.2(d)(2); 
(3)  In a location not less desirable than the unit displaced from; and 
(4)  Leasable at an affordable rent (49 CFR 24.2(d)). 
    Tenant means any family or person residing in a dwelling unit owned by another. 
    Utility allowance is the amount calculated as reasonable monthly utility expenses for tenant families according to 24 CFR 882.116. 
(Ord. No. 2303, 6-13-89) 
Sec. 2-7004. - Displacement protection. 
    Under federal law, all tenants occupying rented dwellings about to be rehabilitated using federal funds shall be protected from involuntary displacement. If no suitable replacement dwelling can be found (as defined above) the tenant cannot be displaced. Further, all tenants must be given information on their rights under law (24 CFR 570.606(c)(2)). Tenants will not qualify for protection or assistance under the ARA plan if they: 
(1)  Are evicted by the owner for cause; 
(2)  Voluntarily leave prior to initiation of the project; 
(3)  Move into the project after initiation and were informed of the planned project; 
(4)  Have a legal interest in the property; or 
(5)  Voluntarily choose to leave the project after being fully informed of their rights and benefits under the ARA plan (49 CFR 24.2(g)(2)). 
    Under the city's ARA plan, all tenants residing in proposed rehabilitation projects will be given the informative material entitled "To Move or Not To Move: Your Rights as a Tenant." Basically, this brochure explains this ARA plan in easy-to-read form. 
(Ord. No. 2303, 6-13-89) 
Sec. 2-7005. - Relocation assistance. 
    A tenant who is "displaced" is eligible for relocation assistance, if applied for on RRP form 17, which includes moving expenses, advisory services, and expenses for temporary relocation as appropriate. 
(1)  Moving expenses: Displaced tenants are entitled to recover the actual costs of their physical relocation including the costs for: 
a.  Transporting furniture and possessions (fifty (50) miles maximum). 
b.  Packing and unpacking. 
c.  Disconnecting and reconnecting, disassembly and reassembly of appliances, etc. 
d.  Storage related to the move. 
e.  Insurance up to the value of possessions moved. 
f.  Replacement of property lost or stolen during the move. 
g.  Other justifiable and reasonable expenses (49 CFR 24.301). 
These costs must be documented. Alternatively, a displaced tenant may choose to receive a fixed payment according to the most recent approved schedule, minimum fifty dollars ($50.00) (49 CFR 24.302). The most recent schedule, approved by the department of transportation, federal highway administration, was published on March 2, 1989, (FR 54:40, p. 8951) specifying the following rates for the state: 
_____ 
Occupant owns furniture Occupant does not own furniture Number of rooms of furniture ea. add. 
  1st each 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 room room addn'l room 250 350 450 550 625 700 775 850 75 200 25  
_____ 
(2)  Other relocation provisions: The city may approved advance payment to reduce or avoid hardship (49 CFR 24.207(c)). Multiple occupants who choose separate replacement dwellings are entitled to reasonable prorated shares of relocation payments (49 CFR 24.207(e)). All claims for relocation payments must be submitted within eighteen (18) months of the displacement (49 CFR 24.207(d)). Relocation payments are not considered as income when filing income tax returns (49 CFR 24.208) or when calculating income for housing assistance levels (24 CFR 813.106(c)(8)(iii)). 
(3)  Advisory services: Displaced families are entitled to advice (24 CFR 570.606(c)) and (24 CFR 511.10(h)) which, at a minimum, informs them of: 
a.  Their fair housing rights under federal law; 
b.  All known rental opportunities in the area where a suitable replacement dwelling may be found; 
c.  Assurance that they will not be forced to relocate if no replacement dwelling can be obtained (49 CFR 24.204(a)). 
Advisory services will include a personal interview (49 CFR 24.205(c)(2)(i)). 
(4)  Temporary relocation: A tenant is not considered displaced if only required to relocate temporarily during the projects construction phase; however, all such tenants must be: 
a.  Provided with decent, safe, and sanitary temporary accommodations; 
b.  Compensated for moving expenses (as in part (1) above); and 
c.  Compensated for any increased housing costs during the temporary relocation (49 CFR 24.2(g)(2)(iv), Appendix A and 24 CFR 570.606(g)(3)). 
(5)  Source of relocations assistance funds: Permanent or temporary relocation assistance will be included as part of the overall RRP project costs; therefore, in most cases costs will be shared equally by the city's rental rehabilitation program and by the private investor or in larger measure by the investor (24 CFR 511.10(g)(2)(iv)). 
(Ord. No. 2303, 6-13-89) 
Sec. 2-7006. - Appeals. 
    Decisions will be rendered in writing to all claimants along with notice of their right to appeal. Claimants may appeal the city's decisions concerning displacement or relocation compensation in writing within ninety (90) days of the decision. The planning director will designate a hearing officer not involved in the decision appealed from. The claimant will be informed of his or her: 
(1)  Right to legal counsel; 
(2)  Right to inspect pertinent file contents; and 
(3)  Right to judicial review (49 CFR 24.10). 
    Further, lower income tenants (i.e., tenants with incomes below one hundred twenty (120) percent of the area median) will be informed of their right to appeal directly to the New Orleans Area Office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) any decision concerning displacement or relocation assistance made by the city (24 CFR 570.606(e)). The hearing officer will inform the claimant of the decision and the reasons for that decision in writing to the claimant within thirty (30) days.

Sec. 3-1001. - Franchise granted. 
    The municipality grants and there is hereby granted to Entergy Louisiana, LLC (the "company"), its successors and assigns, in addition to the rights and privileges presently enjoyed by the company, a nonexclusive franchise, right, and privilege from the date of adoption hereof: 
(1)  To distribute, deliver, sell and supply electric service throughout the municipality and to the inhabitants thereof, or to any person, firm, or corporation, in such manner and from such sources as the said company chooses; 
(2)  To acquire, construct, operate, and maintain such plants, structures, transmission lines, distribution systems, cables, fibers, facilities, and equipment as may be useful or necessary for the generation, production, transportation, distribution, delivery and/or sale of electric power and energy throughout the municipality; 
(3)  To erect, operate, and maintain poles, masts, supports, wires, cables, fibers, transmission lines, conduits, conductors, substations, distribution systems, and any and all other appliances useful or necessary in connection with the sale, transportation, delivery and/or distribution of electric service on, over, under, along, upon, and across all of the present and/or future streets, roads, highways, alleys and public places of the municipality; 
(4)  To repair, replace or remove same or any portion thereof; and 
(5)  To connect any such facilities to any other such facilities for the purpose of selling, transporting and/or distributing electric service into, through, or beyond the boundaries of the municipality. 
(Ord. No. 4043, § 1, 2-14-12) 
Sec. 3-1002. - Limitations on use; unbundling and assignment. 
    This franchise does not authorize the company to use its facilities for the transportation, distribution, or sale of electric service for or on behalf of third parties to any person, firm, or corporation other than the company located within the boundaries of the municipality, unless and until the company has been notified, in writing, by the municipality that the interests of the municipality, including, but not limited to, its recovery of franchise fee revenue on such third party transactions, are adequately protected in connection with the provision of such third party service by the company. In the event that the operations of the company are unbundled, in connection with the adoption of a plan for retail open access or otherwise, the company will have the right to assign its franchise rights with respect to particular facilities or operations as may be necessary to facilitate unbundled operations; provided, however, that any such assignment: 
(1)  Shall not result in a reduction in the franchise fees received by the municipality relating to the provision of electric service within the municipality; and 
(2)  Shall ensure that the municipality retains all other rights and protections afforded by this franchise. 
(Ord. No. 4043, § 1, 2-14-12) 
Sec. 3-1003. - Conditions of use of franchise. 
    This franchise is granted upon and subject to the following provisions: 
A.  In maintaining its properties, the company shall not unnecessarily or unreasonably damage, impair or obstruct the streets, roads, highways, alleys, sidewalks, and public grounds, and the company shall at its own expense, without unreasonable delay, make all necessary repairs to remedy any damage or remove any obstruction caused by its operations hereunder, all in accordance with the standards of the municipality. The company shall obtain all necessary permits or approvals for construction, maintenance, and operations; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to any requirements for such permits or approvals that are adopted or amended subsequent to the date of this chapter and that, as so adopted or amended, have a material effect on the company's rights or obligations pursuant to this franchise or on the company's cost of providing service pursuant to this franchise. 
B.  Upon request, the company will make its best reasonable efforts to provide current maps for specific areas showing feeder routes and the majority of pole locations, and will provide construction manuals that show the typical structural configurations used by the company; provided, however, that the provision of such information by the company shall not relieve the municipality of any obligations that it may have pursuant to R.S. 40:1749.11 et seq., or R.S. 45:141-45:146, or any related or successor statutes; and provided that such information shall be provided by the company without any warranty as to its accuracy. 
C.  The company shall use reasonable precautions to avoid damage or injury to persons or property, and shall hold, save harmless, and indemnify the municipality from all damages, losses, and/or expense, including cost of defense, attributable to the negligence or fault of the company, its agents or employees, while exercising any of the rights and privileges herein granted. 
(Ord. No. 4043, § 1, 2-14-12) 
Sec. 3-1004. - Franchise fees. 
A.  In consideration of the fact that the company, pursuant to this chapter, holds a good, valid, and irrevocable twenty-five (25) year franchise granted by the municipality, and other good and valid considerations, the company agrees that it will pay to the municipality a sum of money equal to three (3) percent of the gross receipts of the company from the sale of electric service at retail for residential and commercial purposes within the corporate limits of the Municipality, including, but not limited to, energy charges, rate plan adjustments, fuel adjustments, and other charges calculated upon energy usage but expressly excluding the franchise tax (the company's "gross receipts"), such payments to be calculated on such receipts commencing with the month of March, 2012, the first payment to be due and payable on the fifteenth day of April, 2012, with subsequent payments to be due quarterly thereafter. 
B.  Further, upon the adoption of an appropriate ordinance, the municipality may require that the company pay to the municipality up to an additional two (2) percent of the gross receipts of the company from the sale of electric service at retail for residential and commercial purposes within the corporate limits of the municipality (the "additional franchise fee"). The company shall include in its franchise fee calculation such additional franchise fee commencing with respect to gross receipts received by the company pursuant to bills rendered during the first calendar quarter following the adoption of an appropriate ordinance, and the receipt of written notification from the mayor of the municipality. Pursuant to the October 18, 1988 and October 12, 2007 General Orders of the Louisiana Public Service Commission ("LPSC"), the company shall collect from residential and commercial customers located within the corporate limits of the municipality such additional percent of gross receipts as is not included in the company's base rates through a line item included in bills rendered for electric service. The company agrees that, in the event the LPSC approves the recovery of the additional franchise fee through base rates, the company shall remove the line item notation relating to the additional franchise fee from the bills rendered to customers for electric service at such time as base rate recovery of the additional franchise fee becomes effective. 
C.  It is distinctly understood and agreed that the percentage of gross receipts paid to the municipality shall not apply to or include any receipts from the sale of electric energy to the municipality, or to government or municipal agencies, or to any sale for industrial purposes or for resale within the corporate limits of the municipality. It shall be the responsibility of the municipality to notify the company of any annexations or other changes in the corporate limits of the municipality, so that the company can make any adjustments to its gross receipts calculation that may be necessary as a result of such a change. 
D.  This obligation to make such payments to the municipality shall remain in full force and effect so long as (1) the company holds a good, valid and irrevocable twenty-five (25) year franchise granted by the municipality, and (2) to the extent the company is allowed by law (including future changes to applicable state law and/or orders of the LPSC) to require, and the municipality purchases, all of its electric service requirements from the company (excluding electric service provided by the use of generating sources owned by the municipality). However, the provisions of this franchise are wholly and entirely conditioned upon the approval of the Treasury Department of the United States of America and the Department of Revenue of the State of Louisiana, and upon the approval of the Louisiana Public Service Commission of the right of the company to deduct from its gross revenues and charge as an operating expense any and all amounts which it may pay to the municipality pursuant hereto other than such amounts as may be collected from customers through a line item on customer bills and in the event of failure to obtain the approval of any such authority for such purpose, the company shall have the right to cancel this contract upon thirty (30) days' notice; it being understood that in the event of the cancellation by the company upon the grounds set out in this paragraph, the company shall not be entitled to any refund of any monies theretofore paid to the municipality pursuant hereto. 
E.  Should the municipality levy any new taxes, of any nature whatsoever, subsequent to the date of this contract, or increase the rates of any taxes in existence on the date of this contract (other than uniform ad valorem taxes now authorized by Article VII, Section 18 of the Constitution of the State of Louisiana or other taxes that are generally applicable to all businesses in the municipality), then the payments herein provided to be made by the company to the municipality will be reduced in an amount equal to the sum of such new and increased taxes, if any. The additional franchise fee shall not be considered to be a new tax or an increase in the rate of a tax for purposes of this provision of the ordinance. The municipality shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to review the available data and calculations upon which the franchise fee calculations are based; provided that as to any calendar year to be reviewed, such notice must be received within three (3) years from the end of the year during which the municipality receives the franchise fee payments applicable to the period to be reviewed. 
F.  If at any time the company is no longer allowed by law (including future changes to applicable state law and/or orders of the LPSC) to require that the municipality purchase all of its electric service requirements from the company, including, but not limited to, the implementation of retail open access in Louisiana which is applicable to the municipality, then the obligation of Entergy, Louisiana, LLC to pay a franchise fee shall not be conditioned on the purchase by the municipality of all of its electric service requirements from company. 
(Ord. No. 4043, § 1, 2-14-12) 
Sec. 3-1005. - Obligations to enforce. 
    The municipality shall make, adopt and enforce all ordinances necessary to protect the property and property rights of the company owned and operated under this franchise, while still recognizing the rights of any other entities holding valid franchises with the municipality, and that the municipality will not in any way interfere with the full legal use by the company of the property which it now maintains or may hereafter maintain in the municipality. 
(Ord. No. 4043, § 1, 2-14-12) 
Sec. 3-1006. - Effective date. 
    The revisions of this chapter, the public health and welfare and the public necessity requiring it, shall take effect from and after its adoption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the company shall file with the municipality the company's written acceptance of this chapter not later than thirty (30) days from the date of its passage. 
(Ord. No. 4043, § 1, 2-14-12) 
Sec. 3-1007. - Term of the franchise. 
    This franchise shall be for a term of twenty-five (25) years from date hereof, and upon exercise by the company of any of the privileges granted hereunder, this franchise shall be irrevocable. If either the municipality or the company, its legal representatives, successors, or assigns, institutes any action or proceedings to enforce the provisions of this chapter, the parties hereby agree that specific performance may be sought and obtained for any breach of this chapter, without the necessity of proving actual damages; provided, however, that either party may, at its option, waive its right to specific performance and collect damages resulting from any breach hereof or failure to perform hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 4043, § 1, 2-14-12) 
Sec. 3-1008. - Effect on prior provisions. 
    Nothing in this franchise shall be construed as superseding, repealing, canceling, modifying, or in any way affecting any of the rights enjoyed by Entergy Louisiana, LLC under that certain franchise granted by Ordinance No. 2268, adopted by the municipality on the thirteenth day of December, 1988, and said franchise is hereby recognized as continuing in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. However, in the event of a conflict between said franchise and this franchise, the provisions of this franchise shall be controlling. 
(Ord. No. 4043, § 1, 2-14-12) 
Sec. 3-1009. - Limitations on extent of franchise. 
    Nothing herein shall be construed to constitute the grant of a franchise for the provision of any service other than electric service to customers within the municipality.

A.  Franchise fee. 
(1)  As consideration for the grant of the franchise and rights herein and for the use by Atmos of the streets, roads, highways, alleys, bridges, public ways, and other immovable property owned or controlled by the City, Atmos shall pay to the city, within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter, a franchise fee equal to two (2) percent of Atmos' gross receipts derived from the sale, transportation, and distribution by Atmos of natural gas at retail to residential and commercial consumers located within the city limits during the preceding calendar quarter. 
(2)  Should the municipality levy any new taxes, of any nature whatsoever, subsequent to the date of this franchise, or increase the rates of any taxes in existence on the date of this franchise (other than uniform ad valorem taxes now authorized by Article VII, Section 18 of the Constitution of the State of Louisiana or other taxes that are generally applicable to all businesses in the municipality), then the payments herein provided to be made by Atmos to the municipality will be reduced in an amount equal to the sum of such new and increased taxes, if any. 
(3)  The city shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to review the available data and calculations upon which the franchise fee calculations are based; provided that as to any period to be reviewed, such notice must be received within three (3) years from the expiration of the period during which the city receives the franchise fee payments applicable to the period to be reviewed. 
B.  No obstruction of public property. Atmos shall not unnecessarily or for any unreasonable period of time obstruct or interfere with the public use of any of the streets, roads, highways, alleys, bridges, public ways, or other immovable property owned or controlled by the city, nor unnecessarily damage or impair those streets, roads controlled by the city. 
C.  Repair of damages. Atmos shall at its own expense repair any and all damages caused by Atmos to any streets, roads, highways, alleys, bridges, public ways, or other immovable property owned or controlled by the city and shall restore, as nearly as practicable, such property to substantially its condition immediately prior to the incident causing such damage, all in accordance with the appropriate state construction and other code standards. Atmos shall commence such repairs immediately upon completion of the work or activity in which Atmos was involved at the time the damage occurred and shall complete such repairs as promptly as possible. Atmos shall not unnecessarily or unreasonably damage, impair or obstruct the streets, roads, highways, alleys, sidewalks, and public grounds, and Atmos shall at its own expense, without unreasonable delay, make all necessary repairs to remedy any damage or remove any obstruction caused by its operations hereunder, all in accordance with the appropriate state construction and other code standards. Atmos shall obtain all necessary permits or approvals for construction, maintenance, and operations; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to any requirements for such permits or approvals that are adopted or amended subsequent to the date of this enactment and that, as so adopted or amended, have a material effect on Atmos' rights or obligations pursuant to this franchise or on Atmos' cost of providing service pursuant to this franchise, and further provided that Atmos shall not be required to pay any fee or charge to the city in connection with any such permit or approval.

To the extent there are such Atmos customers therein, then the gross revenues of Atmos derived from the sale and distribution of natural gas to such customers shall become subject to the franchise fee provisions hereof effective on the first day of Atmos' billing cycle immediately following Atmos' receipt of the annexation notice. The failure by the city to advise Atmos in writing through proper annexation notice of any geographic areas which are annexed by the city shall relieve Atmos from any obligation to remit any franchise fees to the city based upon gross revenues derived by Atmos from the sale and distribution of natural gas to customers within the annexed area until the city delivers an annexation notice to Atmos in accordance with the terms and provisions above. 
G.  [Current maps.] Upon request, Atmos will make available at Atmos offices, current maps for specific areas showing all of Atmos Gas System components, and construction manuals that show the typical structural configurations used by Atmos; provided, however, that the provision of such information by Atmos shall not relieve the municipality of any obligations that it may have pursuant to R.S. 40:1749.11 et seq. or any related or successor statutes; and provided that such information shall be provided by Atmos without any warranty as to its accuracy. This provision shall not obligate Atmos to provide copies of any maps not previously prepared and currently in the possession of Atmos.

(Ord. No. 3181, § 1, 7-10-00) 
Sec. 4-1022. - Imposition of service charge; opportunity for pre-imposition hearing; amount of service charge.

(2)  Three (3) Class B violations occurring within a six-month period of time by one or more violators; or 
(3)  One Class A violation and one Class B violations occurring within a six-month period of time, by one or more violators, regardless of the order of the violations; 
(4)  For purposes of (1)-(3) above, a six-month period of time shall be any period of six (6) months beginning with the occurrence of a Class A violation or a Class B violation, and is referred to as the "time period". 
(b)  Upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to the preliminary imposition of a service charge, as set forth in subsection (a) above, the owner shall be given notice of the preliminary imposition of the service charge in the same manner set forth in section 4-1021(b). The owner shall be given notice of the right to request a pre-imposition hearing by completing a standard pre-imposition hearing form which will be readily available at the West Monroe Police Department, or the West Monroe City Hall. If no pre-imposition hearing is requested within thirty (30) days of the mailing of the notice, or if, after a pre-imposition hearing is held, the service charge is deemed valid, the service charge shall be imposed as set forth below.

(f)  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this article, should a single incident give rise to more than one violation, only one of the violations shall be used for the purposes of section 4-1021 to 4-1022. If a single incident gives rise to both Class A violations and Class B violations, the Class A violation shall be utilized for the purpose of this article. Any other selection of the applicable violation to be used shall be made in a manner which is most likely to cause imposition of a service charge.

Sec. 4-1023. - Miscellaneous provisions.

(2)  An owner may also appeal the imposition of service charges based upon the following grounds: 
a.  The occupant incurring the violation has been evicted from the nuisance residence within thirty (30) days after mailing of a notice of service charges, or an eviction proceeding has been initiated within thirty (30) days after mailing of a notice of service charges, and that proceeding is promptly and aggressively pursued through to completion; 
b.  An initial violation, and all subsequent violations within thirty (30) days thereafter, should not be included in the computation because the violator had not been arrested for any offense listed as an offense constituting a Class A violation or a Class B violation within three (3) years prior to occupancy of the nuisance premises by the violator. 
(3)  Any appeal shall be filed in writing, on a form to be readily available, within thirty (30) days of mailing of notice of the imposition of service charges, stating with particularity the grounds for appeal or objection. 
(4)  All appeals or objections will be filed with the office of the Chief of Police of the City of West Monroe. 
(5)  If, after review by the chief of police, the owner wishes further review, owner shall be entitled to a further appeal to an administrative panel composed of a representative from the police department (which may, but need not be, the chief of police), a representative from the Office of the City Attorney, and a representative selected by the mayor (which may, but need not be, the mayor). A request for such further appeal shall be filed in writing, on a form to be readily available, within fifteen (15) days of mailing of notice of the review decision by the chief of police, again stating with particularity the grounds for appeal or objection. 
(b)  Refunds. An owner may file for a refund of service charges, on a form to be readily available, within sixty (60) days after a Class A violation or a Class B violation has been dismissed, prescribed, or resulted in a verdict of not guilty, requesting that service charges paid by or imposed upon the owner be recalculated without consideration of those Class A violations or Class B violations. 
(c)  Measurements of distance. All distances referred to in this article shall be calculated in a straight line from the nearest point of the property line of the nuisance property to the point of the occurrence of an offense. Any reasonable method of computation of distance shall be allowable, but the distance computed by the G.I.S. system of the city shall be presumed to reflect the correct distance.

This subsection shall not prohibit the withdrawal of funds for the purpose of payments under the Crime Victims Reparations Act, court costs as authorized by law, and other withdrawals specifically authorized by the chief of police, or his designee, in that order. 
b.  In addition, the city shall establish written rules requiring that copayments be made by inmates upon receiving medical or dental treatment, which may include a sliding scale based on the inmates' ability to pay.

After the public hearing, the planning commission shall thereafter make a recommendation to the board of aldermen regarding the application. 
(3)  In the event of a proposed new subdivision, the request to restrict access may be considered concurrently with the approval of the proposed subdivision. Such concurrent application shall not reduce the fee payable pursuant to subsection (b) for this request. 
(e)  Execution of indemnity. If the application for a restriction is approved by the board of aldermen, the requesting party(ies), shall execute an indemnity and hold harmless agreement in favor of the city relieving the city from liability for all injury or damage occasioned to any person or property as a result of the approval and maintenance of the encroachment, and for the cost of demolition and removal of the structure, if later required.

The requesting party(ies) shall provide the city with the certificate of insurance evidencing the coverage required herein prior to the construction of the encroachment and shall furnish annually thereafter, no later than January 5 of each year, for so long as the encroachment remains, a certificate of insurance evidencing the maintenance of the coverage required herein. The policy and certificate of insurance shall contain a provision whereby the insurance company is obligated to give the city no less than thirty (30) days' written notice of the cancellation or alteration of the policy. A certificate or certificates of the foregoing shall be delivered to the department of planning and zoning prior to the construction of the encroachment and annually thereafter. The department of planning and zoning shall promptly provide copies of those certificates to the city clerk. 
(g)  [Transfers.] At any time during the application process, the applicant (whether an individual, group of individuals, or entity, and whether property owners or developers) may transfer that application to any other individual, group of individuals or other legal entity, who shall thereafter be considered as the applicant under all of the terms, conditions and provisions of this section. Further, any person, group of persons or legal entity who have obtained consent of the city to limit public access may, upon transfer of all immovable property and improvements relating to that restriction, likewise transfer the grant of approval obtained under this section to any other individual, group of individuals, or other legal entity if the transferee has executed the required indemnity, provided the required insurance and otherwise complied with all terms, conditions and provisions of this ordinance and the grant of authority. Any such transfer shall not relieve the transferor of any liability, obligation, debt or expense arising prior to or pending at the time of such transfer. 
(h)  Results of noncompliance with requirements; right to revoke approval. No required permit shall be issued to the requesting party(ies) for the construction of the encroachment until such time as all requirements of this section have been met and approval is granted by the city council. Moreover, the city reserves the right to revoke any approval granted hereunder and to remove such encroachment(s) if the requirements of subsection (f) are not met annually. If the approval is revoked and the improvements are demolished/removed due to noncompliance with subsection (f) above, or for any other grounds set out in this section, neither the applicant/owner nor any other persons shall have any recourse or claim of any type or nature whatsoever against the city for the removal of the encroachment. 
(i)  Exceptions; rights of city provided for, etc. The ordinance authorizing the improvement/encroachment shall provide that the city reserves the right to terminate the rights granted by the approval if a public purpose is found to exist for the public property burdened with the encroachment, or for consideration of public safety, or if for any other reason the city determines the improvement/encroachment is no longer proper or desirable, as determined in the discretion of the city. Additionally, the board of aldermen may condition the approval of the improvement/encroachment upon such other terms and conditions as it deems appropriate. The ordinance granting the encroachment shall also require the party(ies) to whom is granted the encroachment the obligations to establish a method satisfactory to the city to provide access to city personnel, Ouachita Parish Sheriff's personnel, emergency personnel and representatives of public utilities and public franchisees in the performance of their duties in such a manner as the city may determine appropriate. Further, any approval granted which would allow limited vehicular access on any public residential street shall also provide that access to the street shall not be restricted by the requesting party(ies) or any other person or party acting on their behalf between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m., seven (7) days a week unless otherwise allowed by the express written consent of the mayor.

Ambulance means any authorized emergency vehicle, permitted as an ambulance by the State Bureau of EMS, equipped with warning devices, designed and operated as a part of a regular course of conduct or business to transport a sick or injured individual or which is advertised or otherwise held out to the public as such. The operations contractor may use parish-permitted ambulances for non-ambulance medical transportation service (NAMTS) but NAMTS providers may not transport patients in NAMTS vehicles. The OCOG Ambulance Committee may establish minimum standards for all medical transportation vehicles, including, but not limited to: ALS Ambulance Vehicles; BLS Ambulance Vehicles; and Emergency Medical Response Vehicles ("EMRVs"). 
Non-ambulance medical transportation vehicle means any wheelchair van or similar non-ambulance vehicle operated by a non-ambulance medical transportation service (NAMTS) provider. NAMTS providers may not transport patients in NAMTS permitted vehicles. The OCOG Ambulance Committee may establish minimum standards and licensing requirements for all non-ambulance medical transportation vehicles. 
Ambulance service or ambulance provider means any person, firm, association, or government entity licensed by the State Bureau of EMS, owning, controlling, or operating any business or service which furnishes, operates, conducts, maintains, advertises, engages in, proposes to engage in, or professes to engage in the business or service of transporting, in ambulances, individuals who may need medical attention during transport. This applies to emergency ambulance calls and non-emergency ambulance calls. However, "ambulance service" and "ambulance provider" shall not include any of the following: 
a.  A volunteer nonprofit organization or municipal nonprofit organization operating an invalid coach or coaches. 
b.  An entity rendering assistance to a licensed ambulance or ambulances in the case of a major disaster. 
c.  A licensed hospital providing non-ambulance transportation when such transportation originates at a licensed hospital.

Emergency medical condition means a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, and/or symptoms of substance abuse) such that a prudent layperson, who possess an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. Except in major catastrophes and in disaster situations (as declared by appropriate elected officials) only ambulances that are permitted at the ALS level with ALS personnel may transport patients with emergency medical conditions. 
Emergency ambulance call means a situation that is classified (at time of dispatch) as a priority one or two under the emergency dispatch protocols established by the NAEMD (National Association of Emergency Medical Dispatch) or APCO (Association of Public Safety Communications Officials), or when the exact circumstances are unknown, but the nature of the request is suggestive of a true emergency where a patient may be at risk. ALS and BLS ambulances or EMRVs may respond to emergency ambulance calls, but only ALS ambulances may transport patients with emergency medical conditions. 
Emergency ambulance call from a hospital means a call that, at the time the call is made, present circumstances in which there is an immediate need for a patient to be transported by ambulance from a hospital in Ouachita Parish (the "originating hospital") to another hospital, inside or outside Ouachita Parish, so that the patient can receive a higher level of care or medical services that are not available at the originating hospital, and the physician ordering the ambulance transport or otherwise referring the patient to another hospital certifies that a delay in the transport is likely to have an unfavorable impact on the patient's outcome. 
Non-emergency ambulance call means a call for ambulance service that is not an emergency ambulance call. Non-emergency transportation by ambulance is appropriate if either: the patient is bed-confined, and it is documented that the patient's condition is such that other methods of transportation are contraindicated; or, if the patient's medical condition, regardless of bed confinement, is such that transportation by ambulance is medically required. 
Emergency mode means an ambulance or EMRV operating with emergency lights and warning siren (may use air horn in addition to siren) while engaged in an emergency ambulance call. Drivers of ambulances and EMRVs shall operate in the emergency mode with warning lights and siren at all times while engaged in an emergency ambulance call if they are operating the emergency vehicle in a manner to take exemption to the traffic laws and rules of the road which may be allowed by state law, so as to warn other drivers of non-emergency vehicles to yield the right-of-way of the authorized emergency vehicle. Ambulances and EMRVs may use emergency warning lights only, if they are engaged in an emergency ambulance call and they are stopped or parked or if they are moving and operating the vehicle in a manner so as to abide by all traffic laws and regulations stipulated in state law. No driver of any ambulance or EMRV shall assume any special privilege from traffic laws and regulations except when such emergency vehicle is operated in the emergency mode, with warning lights and siren, while engaged in an emergency ambulance call. 
Emergency medical response vehicle (EMRV) means a marked emergency vehicle with fully visual and audible warning signals operated by the parish-licensed ambulance service, the primary purpose of which is to respond to the scene of a medical emergency to provide emergency medical stabilization or support, or command, control, and communications, but which is not an ambulance designed or intended for the purpose of transporting a victim from the scene to a medical facility regardless of its designation. Included are such vehicles referred to, but not limited to, the designation as "sprint car", "quick response vehicle", "special response vehicle", "triage trucks", "staff cars", "supervisor units", and other similar designations. Personnel operating EMRVs must be certified as either EMT, advanced EMT or paramedic. 
Emergency facilities means those facilities that include as part of their mission providing for the treatment of patients with life- or limb-threatening conditions. They meet or exceed the emergency care guidelines of the American College of Emergency Physicians and they receive ambulance patients with emergency medical conditions. 
Emergency medical services driver (EMSD) means an individual who is authorized to drive an ambulance in the parish. At a minimum, they must be trained and certified as an emergency medical responder and have successfully completed an emergency ambulance driving course with current certification as approved by the ambulance committee. EMT, advanced EMT, and paramedics may also function as EMSD if they successfully complete an emergency ambulance driving course with current certification as approved by the ambulance advisory committee. 
Ambulatory care facilities provides primary medical care services and may be accessible without prior doctor-patient relationship or without an appointment. 
Call response measurements. The following definitions shall be used as time measurements for the ambulance provider licensed pursuant to this section. All times shall be recorded in hours, minutes and seconds. These measurements shall be utilized by the ambulanced advisory committee to determine licensed ambulance provider's compliance with performance criteria. All of the below listed times shall be based on transporting units only. 
a.  Fractile response time. Percentile of a specific category of requests for ambulance service that are appropriately answered within a stated response time goal or standard.

An example of such a response would be a request for the response during provider's servicing of a mass casualty situation where the majority of the units in the parish/city have been directed to attend the mass casualty incident (ie: mass shooting/active shooter at a school with multiple victims). 
Except in cases of force majeure, provider agrees that it shall at all times have a responsibility to respond as soon as safely practicable even in the face of an excluded response. It is agreed that any such exceptions and/or exclusions from response will extend to the required response times by only the amount of time by which the otherwise applicable response is interfered with or inhibited by the exception. 
q.  Response time penalty: If the provider fails to meet the response time thresholds set forth by this section or established as part of the operations contract on emergency or non-emergency calls during any quarter, the provider may be assessed, such penalties as set forth by this section or established as part of the operations contract. 
Response time will be measured for calculation and assessment of penalties on a quarterly basis. Should provider fail to any response time threshold, prior to any penalty being assessed, provider shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard before the advisory board to show good cause as to why said penalties should not be imposed. For good cause shown, the board may recommend that OCOG waive and/or reduce any response time penalties otherwise due under this section or the operations contract. 
If provider fails to adhere to the applicable response time standards for either emergency or non-emergency responses in three quarters within any twelve-month period, that failure shall constitute grounds for the termination of the license with provider. 
If provider fails to adhere to the applicable response time standards for either emergency or non-emergency responses in two (2) consecutive quarters or two (2) quarters in any twelve-month period, the provider shall, within fifteen (15) days' notice of such failure, provide the ambulance advisory committee with provider's written plan to achieve adherence to the applicable response time standards in the ensuing quarter. If the provider fails to timely submit such plan, provider shall by such failure be deemed to have authorized the executive director to request another ambulance service to provide non-emergency responses on the providers behalf pursuant to subsection (9)a. of this section for a period of not less than thirty (30) days or until such time as the provider has submitted the plan called for above if provider has not submitted that plan within said thirty-day period. 
r.  Corporate citizenship: The provider must agree, when available, to provide ambulance stand-by at no charge for high school and college football games within Ouachita Parish when requested. Provider must also agree, when available, to provide such other stand-by service as is requested by a local emergency response agency for emergency events such as hazmat calls, structure fires, rescue calls, bomb threats, drug raids, etc. at no charge to the requesting public service agency. 
s.  Maintenance of vehicles: All ambulances shall at all times be adequately maintained, serviced and mechanically sound. Provider shall maintain maintenance records that may be inspected by the advisory board as requested. Ambulances shall be less than ten (10) years old and shall have not more than four hundred thousand (400,000) miles of total service. 
t.  Vehicle locating system: Each ambulance provided must be equipped with real time automatic vehicle locator (AVL) systems compatible with and able to communicate with the CAD system of the Ouachita Parish Communications District and provider must maintain all necessary licenses, permits, etc. necessary pursuant to any state, federal, and local laws and regulations to enable provider to operate said system. 
u.  For purposes of any license with a sole provider for emergency medical services, the City of West Monroe will agree as follows: 
The City of West Monroe will instruct and inform all interested parties (such as but not limited to 911 director, hospitals located in Ouachita Parish, etc.) that provider will be the exclusive ambulance service for all emergency (911 and other) and non-emergency ambulance transportation within the City of West Monroe. 
The City of West Monroe shall take all steps reasonable and necessary (including the filing of a criminal or the institution of a civil action) to prevent any operation of ambulance service within Ouachita Parish in a manner that violates this section during the term of any license. 
The City of West Monroe will enforce all laws, rules, regulations and ordinances governing unauthorized ambulance operation within its jurisdiction. 
The City of West Monroe will acknowledge that any unauthorized operation (by other than the sole provider of ambulance service under license with the City of West Monroe) will cause financial harm to provider such that provider may seek any appropriate relief against such other person/entity, including injunctive relief. 
v.  Termination by the City of West Monroe: Each of the following acts, omissions or occurrences shall constitute an "event of default" entitling the City of West Monroe to terminate any such sole provider license issued pursuant to this section: 
Provider shall violate, in any material way, any provision of this section, the operations contract contemplated by this section, or of any state or federal law or regulation governing any aspect of ambulance service; 
Provider shall cease doing business as a going concern; 
Provider shall attempt to transfer the license issued pursuant to the ordinance or the operations contract entered into hereunder to another ambulance provider without the prior written approval of OCOG; 
Provider's financial reports to the advisory board demonstrate financial instability or insolvency; 
Provider shall commence a voluntary case or other proceeding in bankruptcy or seek liquidation, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of its debts or for any other relief under the federal bankruptcy laws, as now existing or as may be amended from time to time, or under any other insolvency act or law, state or federal, now or hereinafter existing, or shall take any other action indicating its consent to, approval, or acquiescence in any such case or proceeding; 
Provider shall apply for, or consent to or acquiesce in, the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, custodian, sequestration, or a trustee for all or a substantial part of its property; 
Provider shall make an assignment of a substantial portion of its assets for the benefit of its creditors; 
Provider shall fail, or shall admit in writing its failure to pay its debts generally as such debts become due; or 
There shall be filed against provider an involuntary petition in bankruptcy or seeking liquidation, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of its debts or any other relief under the federal bankruptcy laws, as now existing or as may be amended from time to time, or under any other insolvency act or law, state or federal, now or hereafter existing, or a receiver, liquidator, custodian, sequestration, or trustee of provider for all or a substantial part of its property shall be appointed without the consent or approval of provider or a warrant of attachment, execution or similar process against any substantial part of the property of provider is issued; and the continuance of any such event or events for thirty (30) days undismissed or undischarged or within such thirty (30) days, the entering of an order for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code. 
In the event the license issued to a sole provider of ambulance services pursuant to this section is terminated due to an "event of default" as set forth above, the City of West Monroe shall have a claim against the performance bond (or other acceptable security) posted by the provider for all damages suffered by the City of West Monroe as a result of such event of default and termination, including, but not limited to, the costs of obtaining or providing the ambulance services to have been provided by the provider during the term of the exclusive license. 
w.  Termination by provider: Provider will be entitled to terminate any license hereunder concerning the provision of ambulance services upon the occurrence of an "event of default" as hereinafter set forth: 
Failure of the City of West Monroe to have the requisite authority to enter into the license, or to enact the necessary ordinances to authorize the license for ambulance services; 
Failure by the City of West Monroe by its own fault, to observe or perform any covenant, warranty, term or provision of this section related to the license;

x.  Mutual termination: Provider and the City of West Monroe may mutually agree to terminate any such license without cause by either party giving the other one hundred eighty (180) days' prior written notice. 
y.  Right to cure: The failure to comply with the terms of this section shall render the license voidable at the discretion of the non-violating party, provided, however, that the other party is given ninety (90) days advanced notice of the intent to terminate the license and is given sixty (60) days to remedy any default. 
z.  Indemnification: Provider will indemnify, hold harmless and defend the City of West Monroe the Advisory Board, OCOG and their representatives, officers, agents, servants and employees, from and against any and all liability, suits, actions, legal proceedings, claims, demand, damages, costs, expenses and attorney's fees arising out of or in any way concerning or incident to any work done by provider in the performance of ambulance service under the license or arising out of any willful or negligent act or omission of provider, its officers, agents, servants and employees (including any such individual acting contrary to the conditions of the license).

j.  Any applicant is the spouse of a person whose application for a sexually oriented business license whose permit or license has been denied or revoked, unless judicially separated; provided, however, that in any such case: 
1.  The application shall not be denied solely on the basis of the age of the ineligible spouse; 
2.  A conviction of the spouse of a specified criminal activity shall not be cause for denial of a license if and only if: 
A.  The applicant had state and local permits prior to the conviction; and 
B.  The applicant had a regime of separation of property, pursuant to applicable Louisiana law, and is the owner of the premises or has a bona fide written lease therefor, or the owner owns the premises as the applicant's separate property pursuant to applicable state law.

Upon the filing of a completed application for a sexually oriented business employee card and the payment of a nonrefundable application fee, the chief of police shall issue a temporary card to the applicant, which temporary card shall expire upon the final decision of the city to deny or grant the application, or, if approved, the issuance of the card.

(c)  Issuance of license or card. After any application for a license under this chapter has been approved, it shall be submitted to the director of administrator, or his designee, who shall forthwith issue and sign the license upon payment of the prescribed fee. Any license for a sexually oriented business shall be restricted to the single location described in the application; that is, each location for a sexually oriented business must have a separate license. After any application for a sexually oriented business employee card under this chapter has been approved, the chief of police shall issue the card. A sexually oriented business employee card shall be good and valid for use on the premises of any sexually oriented business, provided that the licensee has notified the chief of police of the name and address of the sexually oriented business employee card holder within five (5) days of the hire date. 
(d)  Effect of failure to act. The failure of the chief of police to act on an application within the time set forth in this section shall be deemed a denial of the application for a license or card, and shall be deemed to be the issuance of a written notice of intent to deny the license or card applied for. 
(e)  Appeal from notice of intent to deny. Upon issuance or deemed issuance of a written notice of intent to deny a license or card, the applicant may appeal the denial to the city council by making a written request for appeal to the clerk of council within ten (10) days after issuance or deemed issuance of the written notice of intent to deny the license or card. The applicant's temporary license or card, if any, shall continue in effect during such ten-day period. Upon timely appeal, the applicant's temporary license or card, if any, shall continue in effect until the city council has acted on the applicant's appeal or the applicant has withdrawn his or her appeal. The appeal to the city council shall proceed in accordance with the hearing provisions set forth in this chapter and the rules of the city council. The only issue on the appeal shall be whether the applicant meets the criteria for issuance of the license or card in question; the city council shall not have the authority to waive any of the requirements for the license or card in question. 
(f)  Temporary sexually oriented business employee card. The temporary sexually oriented business employee card issued pursuant to this section shall state on its face an expiration date forty-five (45) days after its date of issuance; provided, however, that, if the employee's card application or appeal from a denial of a card or card renewal is continuing at the end of each successive forty-five-day period, at the request of the applicant the chief of police shall issue a renewal temporary card, which shall expire forty-five (45) days after its issuance. Notwithstanding the stated forty-five-day expiration date, the temporary card shall expire upon either the issuance of a permanent card, the withdrawal of any appeal from the denial of issuance of a card, or the termination of any appeal of the denial of issuance of a card. Upon the denial of the issuance of the card (if not appealed), or the unsuccessful or withdrawal of appeal of the denial of issuance of the card, the applicant shall immediately return the temporary card to the chief of police. It shall be unlawful for any applicant to fail to return the temporary card to the chief of police within three (3) business days after the denial of the issuance of the card (if not appealed), or the unsuccessful or withdrawal of appeal of the denial of issuance of the card. 
(g)  Employee card application restriction. Any person denied a sexually oriented business employee card for reasons listed in paragraph (b) shall not be allowed to reapply for a period six (6) months following the notice of denial.

The renewal license will be dated from the date of expiration of the existing license. 
(2)  The chief of police shall approve or deny the renewal within thirty (30) days after receipt of the completed renewal application. If approved, the renewal license shall be issued as provided in section 10-9004. If denied, the chief of police shall issue a written notice of intent to deny the renewal application in the same manner as for the denial of an initial license application, and the appeal rights and any rights to continue operating set forth in section 10-9004 shall apply to such renewal application. The failure of the chief of police to act on an application within the time set forth in this section shall be deemed a denial of the application for a license or card, and shall be deemed to be the issuance of a written notice of intent to deny the license or card applied for. 
(3)  If a licensee fails to complete its renewal application within the time set forth in this section, its application shall be treated as a new application under sections 10-9003 and 10-9004 hereof, but the late filing shall not affect the expiration of the previous license; that is, if the license renewal application has not been acted upon prior to the expiration of the existing license, the existing license shall expire, and the business shall not be entitled to operate as a sexually oriented business unless and until a new license is issued. 
(b)  Sexually oriented business employee card. 
(1)  A sexually oriented business employee card issued under this chapter shall be dated from the effective date as shown on the card and be valid for two (2) years from the date of issuance, unless sooner suspended or revoked.

If approved, the renewal card shall be issued as provided in section 10-9004. If denied, the chief of police shall issue a written notice of intent to deny the renewal application in the same manner as for the denial of an initial card application, and the appeal rights and any rights to continue operating set forth in section 10-9004 shall apply to such renewal application. The failure of the chief of police to act on an application within the time set forth in this section shall be deemed a denial of the application for a license or card, and shall be deemed to be the issuance of a written notice of intent to deny the license or card applied for. 
(3)  If a card holder fails to complete his or her renewal application within the time set forth in this section, his or her application shall be treated as a new application under sections 10-9003 and 10-9004 hereof, but the late filing shall not affect the expiration of the previous card; that is, if the card renewal application has not been acted upon prior to the expiration of the existing card, the existing card shall expire, and the person shall not be entitled to be employed by a sexually oriented business (or in certain operations of a dual-purpose business, as the case may be), unless and until a new card is issued. 
(Ord. No. 3800, § 1, 2-10-09) 
Sec. 10-9008. - Suspension; fines. 
(a)  The following shall be the causes for the suspension of a sexually oriented business license:

(7)  Violation of any controlled, dangerous substance law on the premises of the business holding the sexually oriented business license.

(3)  If the card holder has violated any section of this chapter. 
(c)  The chief of police, with the approval of the mayor and the city attorney, shall issue a written letter of intent to suspend the license or card in question for a period not to exceed six (6) months if the chief of police finds that probable cause exists to believe that grounds exist for the suspension or revocation of a sexually oriented business license of a sexually oriented business employee card. The licensee or card holder shall have ten (10) days following the issuance of the letter of intent to suspend the license or card within which to appeal the suspension to the city council. The appeal shall be perfected by making a written request for appeal to the clerk of council. If no appeal is perfected within such time, the license or card holder shall be suspended in accordance with the written letter of intent to suspend the license or card. If the licensee or card holder perfects an appeal, no suspension shall take effect until after the city council has acted on the appeal or the appeal has been withdrawn. The appeal to the city council shall proceed in accordance with the hearing provisions set forth in this chapter and the rules of the city council. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the above, if the chief of police finds that probable cause exists to believe that a licensee or card holder has violated any provision of this chapter or that grounds exist for the suspension of his, her or its license or card, but that the violation or grounds in question are minor in nature, the chief of police, with the approval of the mayor and the city attorney, may impose an administrative fine, payable to the general fund of the city, instead of a request for suspension of the license or card. The chief of police shall report the imposition of the fine to the clerk of council. The fine shall be due and payable within ten (10) days from service of a notice on the licensee or the card holder by certified mail or hand delivery, unless within such ten-day period, the licensee or the card holder files a written notice of appeal with the clerk of council. If the licensee or card holder perfects an appeal, the time for payment of the fine shall be suspended until after the city council has acted on the appeal or the appeal has been withdrawn. The appeal to the city council shall proceed in accordance with the hearing provisions set forth in this chapter and the rules of the city council. At the hearing, the city council may approve the fine, disapprove the fine, or assess a lower fine. 
(e)  Any fine imposed by the chief of police shall be progressive with each offense during the term of the license or card in question, in accordance with the levels set forth below:

    If either a licensee or a card holder has had three (3) fines imposed during the term of his, her or its license or card, if the chief of police, with the approval of the mayor and the city attorney, finds that probable cause exists to believe that grounds exist for suspension or revocation of a license or card issued pursuant to this chapter, he shall request suspension or revocation of the license or card in question. 
(f)  Nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to require that the chief of police impose one or more fines as a prerequisite to seeking suspension or revocation of any license or card. The chief of police, with the approval of the mayor and the city attorney, may seek suspension or revocation for any grounds set forth in this chapter without the imposition of any fine. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, failure timely to pay any fine imposed under this section shall constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of the license or card of the person who fails to pay such fine. 
(h)  No person whose sexually oriented business license or sexually oriented business employee card has been suspended shall operate a sexually oriented business or be employed in a sexually oriented business during the period of such suspension.

Sec. 10-9009. - Revocation. 
(a)  The chief of police, with the concurrence of the mayor and the city attorney, shall issue a letter of intent to revoke a sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee card if the chief of police finds that a cause of suspension in section 10-9008 occurs and the license has been suspended within the preceding twelve (12) months. 
(b)  The chief of police, with the concurrence of the mayor and the city attorney, shall issue a letter of intent to revoke a sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee card if the chief of police determines that:

(5)  A licensee has knowingly allowed any specified sexual activity to occur in or on the licensed premises. 
(6)  The licensee or card holder has failed to maintain any qualification required for initial issuance or renewal of the license. 
(c)  The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect on the revocation of the license. 
(d)  Nature of revocation. When, after the notice and hearing procedure described in section 10-9010, a sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee card is revoked, the revocation shall continue for two (2) years and the licensee or card holder shall not be issued a sexually oriented business license or sexually oriented business employee card for two (2) years from the date revocation becomes effective, provided that, if the conditions of subsection 10-9010(i) are met, a provisional license or card will be granted pursuant to that section.

The notification shall be directed to the most current business address or other mailing address on file with the chief of police for the respondent. 
(b)  Upon any appeal to the city council as provided in this chapter, or upon the institution of revocation proceedings, the clerk of council shall notify the respondent in writing of the hearing date on respondent's denial, fine, suspension, or revocation proceeding. Within thiry (30) days of the receipt of respondent's appeal or the institution of revocation proceedings, the city council shall conduct a hearing at which respondent shall have the opportunity to present all of respondent's arguments and to be represented by counsel, and present evidence and witnesses on his or her behalf. The city may also be represented by counsel, and shall bear the burden of proving the grounds for denying, suspending, or revoking the license or card, or imposing the fine. 
(c)  The city council may administer oaths, issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, accounts and documents, and examine witnesses and receive testimony at the hearing for denial, suspension or revocation of licenses under this chapter. If any person fails to comply with a subpoena issued by the city council, or if a witness refuses to testify in any matter regarding which he may be lawfully interrogated, such failure or refusal shall constitute contempt of the city council and upon conviction in any court of competent jurisdiction shall be punishable pursuant to section 1-1008 of this Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, such a conviction of a licensee or card holder shall be cause for suspension or revocation of his or her license or card. 
(d)  If a respondent who has been notified of a hearing for denial, suspension or revocation of a license under this chapter does not appear, the hearing may proceed without him and the city council may consider and dispose of the case, but in all cases the city council, upon its own motion, may grant continuances from time to time. If the continuance is granted to a fixed future date by written consent or in the presence of the respondent or his or her counsel, no further notice of the hearing date need be given. In all other cases the same notice of hearing as in original hearings shall be given. 
(e)  Any hearing shall take no longer than four (4) hours, unless extended to meet the requirements of due process and proper administration of justice. 
(f)  In determining cases involving the suspension or revocation of licenses or cards, or the imposition of an administrative fine, the city council may accept, reject or modify the recommendation or action of the chief of police. The city council shall issue a decision on the issue before it within twenty-one (21) days after the conclusion of the hearing. The failure of the council to act within such time period shall be deemed an acceptance of the recommendation of the chief of police. 
(g)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the city council may, instead of or in addition to revocation or suspension of a license issued under the authority of this chapter, impose a fine on the licensee not to exceed the fines set forth in subsection 10-9008(e). 
(h)  In hearings of the city council which finally result in withholding the issuance of a license or in suspending or revoking a license, the city council shall assess the costs of the hearing to the applicant or licensee. The costs are recoverable by the city council in any appellate proceeding instituted by the applicant or licensee or in any other appropriate judicial proceeding. 
(i)  An applicant or licensee who is aggrieved by a decision of the city council to withhold, suspend or revoke his or her license may, within ten (10) days of the notification of the decision, or within ten (10) days of the deemed action of the city council, take a devolutive appeal to the district court having jurisdiction over his place of business, and on such appeal, the trial shall be de novo. Upon the filing of any court action to appeal, challenge, restrain, or otherwise enjoin the city's enforcement of the denial, suspension, or revocation, the city shall immediately issue the aggrieved party a provisional license. The provisional license shall allow the aggrieved party to continue operation of the sexually oriented business or to continue employment as a sexually oriented business employee and will expire upon the court's entry of a judgment on the aggrieved party's appeal or other action to restrain or otherwise enjoin the city's enforcement.

(2)  Where the circumstances indicate that an intoxicated or drugged condition has precluded the presence of a specific criminal intent or of special knowledge required in a particular crime, this fact constitutes a defense to a prosecution for that crime.

(1)  Where the offender reasonably relied on an act of the board in repealing an existing criminal provision, or in otherwise purporting to make the offender's conduct lawful; or 
(2)  Where the offender reasonably relied on a final judgment of a competent court of last resort that a provision making the conduct in question criminal was unconstitutional.

Editor's note- The statute cited is codified at R.S. 33:131 et seq. and is on the subject of regional planning commissions. Provisions on municipal planning commissions are found at R.S. 33:101 et seq. 

Sec. 12-2003. - Procedure for approval of plat and construction plans. 
(a)  The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision by the planning commission consists of three (3) consecutive steps, as follows: 
(1)  Preparation and submission of a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision, together with the attendant items required herein. Submission of a sketch plan is not mandatory, but this step is recommended as a means of identifying and solving design and other subdivision problems. 
(2)  Preparation and submission for review and tentative approval of construction plans, together with the attendant items required herein. 
(3)  Preparation and submission for review and final approval of a final plat, together with the attendant items required herein. 
(b)  Sketch plan: 
(1)  The purpose of the sketch plan is to develop a general design on which to base the final plat and construction plans, and thus to avoid having to revise the design to make it conform to the master plan and to relate it to surrounding development. To this end, the subdivider should consult informally with the planning commission's technical staff on preparation of the sketch plan. 
(2)  Prior to the filing of an application for approval of the final plat and construction plans, the subdivider shall submit to the planning commission two (2) copies of the sketch plan of the proposed subdivision, together with the attendant items required herein. This step does not require formal application, fee or filing of the subdivision plat with the planning commission. The sketch plan shall be reviewed by the planning commission or by the planning director. The review shall take into consideration, in addition to the requirements set out in these regulations, the components of the master plan, especially the major street plan and the parks, recreation and school sites plan, the zoning regulation and other plans, programs and regulations that might affect the area and the design and development of the subdivision. 
(3)  Within fifteen (15) days, the planning commission or the planning director shall inform the subdivider that the sketch plan as submitted or as modified does or does not meet the objectives of these regulations. When the planning commission or the planning director finds that the sketch plan does not meet the objectives of these regulations, the reasons thereof shall be given, together with any changes recommended to be made. In the event the subdivider does not agree to changes recommended by the planning director, he may request and shall receive review and formal action by the planning commission at its next regular meeting. 
(c)  Construction plans: 
(1)  The purpose of the construction plans, together with the attendant items required herein, is to provide plans for the construction of the subdivision and its improvements. To this end, during preparation of the construction plans the subdivider should consult with the planning commission's technical staff, with the city engineer and with other officials and agencies concerned with subdivision and the improvements. The construction plans shall be based upon the general design shown on the sketch plan, together with the recommended or required changes. 
(2)  The subdivider shall submit to the planning commission four (4) copies of the construction plans, together with the attendant items required herein, with written application for tentative approval at least seven (7) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. This step shall constitute formal application for approval and filing of the subdivision with the planning commission. The construction plans, together with the attendant items required herein, shall be reviewed by the planning commission and will be referred for review and report to the city engineer, the director of the parish health unit, the utility agencies or companies concerned with the tract or adjacent tracts and other appropriate officials. The review shall take into consideration, in addition to the plans and other factors considered in connection with the sketch plan, the particular requirements and conditions affecting installation of improvements. 
(3)  Notice of the time and place at which construction plans will be considered shall be sent by the planning commission to the subdivider and to the person whose name and address appears upon the plan as the owner of the land. At the regular monthly meeting next following the submission of construction plans, but in any event within forty-five (45) days, the planning commission shall act upon the construction plans and shall communicate in writing to the subdivider its tentative approval or its disapproval. In the case of tentative approval, the planning commission shall state: 
a.  The specific changes required to be made in the construction plans. 
b.  The character and extent of the required improvements. 
c.  The amount of the surety bond which it will require in lieu of the completion of improvements required herein. 
In the case of disapproval, the planning commission shall state the ground of disapproval. 
(4)  Tentative approval of construction plans shall not constitute acceptance of the plat of the proposed subdivision but shall be deemed only as an expression of approval of the plan submitted as a guide to preparation of the final plat, which final plat will be submitted for approval of these regulations and the conditions of tentative approval of construction plans shall be effective for a maximum period of one year unless, upon application by the subdivider, the planning commission grants an extension. If the final plat has not been submitted to the planning commission for final approval within this time limit, the construction plans shall again be submitted for tentative approval. 
(d)  Final plat: 
(1)  The purpose of the final plat, together with the attendant items required herein, is to provide an accurate record of street and property lines and other elements being established on the land and the conditions of their use. The final plat shall be based on the construction plans, together with the required changes, but it may include only the portion of the approved construction plans which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at the time, provided, however, that the portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations. 
(2)  The subdivider shall submit to the planning commission four (4) copies of the final plat, together with the attendant items required herein, with final approval at least seven (7) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. The final plat, together with the attendant items required herein, shall be reviewed by the planning commission and will be referred for review and report to the city engineer, the director of the parish health unit, the utility agencies or companies concerned with tract or adjacent tracts and other appropriate officials. The review shall take into consideration conformance to the approved construction plans and fulfillment of any conditions of approval and the proper installation of required improvements in conformance with the requirements of these regulations and other applicable standards and regulations. 
(3)  Before action on the final plat, the planning commission shall give notice by registered mail to the subdivider and the owner of the land, whose name or names and addresses are shown on the plat, of the time and place of the hearing to be held on the plat, at least five (5) days before the date fixed for the hearing. The planning commission shall act upon the final plat within forty-five (45) days after its submission and shall communicate in writing to the subdivider its final approval or disapproval. Similar notices shall be mailed to the owners of the land immediately adjoining the platted land, as their names appear on the parish assessment rolls. In the case of final approval, the planning commission shall enter such approval upon the final plat by the signature of its secretary. In the case of disapproval, the planning commission shall state the ground of disapproval. 
(4)  Final approval of a final plat shall not constitute acceptance by the public of the dedication of a street or other public way, park or space. Final approval of a final plat shall be null and void if the final plat is not recorded in the records of the clerk of court of the parish within ninety (90) days after the date of final approval or upon application by the subdivider, the planning commission grants an extension.

Sec. 12-5015. - B-2 Districts: Business park districts. 
    These districts are similar to the B-3 Districts (general business districts) in that they are composed of land and structures used to furnish, in addition to some of the retail goods and services found in transitional business districts, many of the less frequently needed goods and services found in the general business districts.

Uses that are noisy, unsightly or otherwise objectionable or unattractive are seldom found in these districts, and the districts are not intended to accommodate those uses. The district regulations are designed to permit the development of the districts for their purpose in an open, spacious arrangement and to protect the abutting and surrounding residential area by requiring certain minimum yard and area standards to be met, standards that are comparable to those called for in residence districts. It is intended that additional business park districts will be created in accordance with the amendment procedure set forth herein, as they are needed. To ensure that these districts are actually developed to supply the business needs of the urban area, the amendment creating the district may set a time limit for its development.

(c)  District structural regulations. 
(1)  Purpose. 
a.  Blank walls on the ground-floor level are limited: 
1.  To encourage continuity of retail and consumer service uses; 
2.  To encourage retail and commercial activities at street level; 
3.  To provide a pleasant, rich, and diverse experience for pedestrians by visually connecting activities occurring within a structure to adjacent sidewalk areas; 
4.  To enhance crime prevention by increasing opportunities for surveillance of the street from the interiors of buildings and vice versa; 
5.  To restrict unpleasant, blank-wall facades at the street level; 
6.  And to avoid a monotonous environment. 
b.  Building setbacks, shapes, and bulk are regulated to encourage a harmonious association of compatible buildings. 
(2)  Standards. 
a.  Transparency requirements. 
1.  At least fifty (50) percent of the length and at least twenty-five (25) percent of the area of ground level exterior walls abutting sidewalks, plazas, or other public open spaces or rights-of-way must be devoted to windows affording views into retail, office, or lobby space, pedestrian entrances, or retail display windows. 
2.  This limitation on blank walls does not apply to sides of buildings having residential units located adjacent to the exterior ground-floor wall. 
3.  Buildings having less than fifty (50) percent of their ground-level floor area in retail, office, or lobby use. 
(i)  Where a building contains other active uses found by the planning commission to be of visual interest to the pedestrian, windows affording views of that active use may be provided as an alternative to subsection (2)a.1. above. Examples of such uses are pressrooms, classrooms, kitchens, or manufacturing processes. Parking areas, truck loading areas, vehicular accessways, and storage areas are not to be considered active uses. 
(ii)  Artwork such as murals or reliefs may be substituted to meet the requirements of subsection (2)a.1, above, if the proposed artwork is found by the planning commission to meet the intent of this section. Artwork and displays relating to activities occurring within the building or historical subjects relating to the downtown area are encouraged. 
b.  Building setback limitations. 
1.  Along a street or pedestrian right-of-way, building walls must extend to the right-of-way line for at least seventy-five (75) percent of said line. 
2.  As an alternative to b.1., walls may extend to within twelve (12) feet of said line with the remaining space between the building and line designed as an extension of the sidewalk and committed to active uses including, but not limited to, sidewalk cafes, vendors' stands, public art, or pedestrian rest areas with street furniture. 
3.  Alleys unusable by the public for pedestrian access may not be created between buildings. 
c.  Exterior design compatibility (existing development). 
1.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for an existing building which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or site and its intended purpose. 
2.  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
3.  All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and that seek to create an earlier or later appearance shall be discouraged. 
4.  Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
5.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize abuilding, structure, or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
6.  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence, rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
7.  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
8.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project. 
9.  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood, or environment. 
10.  Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that, if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. 
d.  New development or additions. Any new or existing building, structure, and appurtenances thereof, that is moved, reconstructed, materially altered, or expanded shall be visually compatible with buildings, public ways, and places to which it is visually related in terms of the following characteristics: 
1.  Its height; the relationship of width to height of its elevation; the relationship of width to height of its windows; the number, frequency and intervals of its windows, doors, and other appurtenances; the relationship of solids to voids on its exterior facades; 
2.  Its relationship to any open space between it and adjoining buildings or structures; the relationship of its entrances and other projections to sidewalks, the relationships of the materials, textures, and colors of its facade; 
3.  The shape of its roof line; the bulk and arrangement of associated walls, fences, landscape masses, entryways, signs, awnings, porches, and balconies; 
4.  And its directional orientation, whether this be vertical, horizontal, or nondirectional; 
e.  Balconies and awnings. Only cloth awnings or banners shall project into rights-of-way, alleys, or other public accessways; however, the planning commission may approve balconies that encroach into public rights-of-way provided the design of such a balcony does not violate the requirements of subsection (d)(2)c. of this section. 
f.  Waterfront development regulations. 
1.  Purpose. Waterfront development regulations are intended to assure both frequent views of the river and physical access to the river and its activities. 
2.  Standards. 
(i)  For purposes of this section, waterfront development is that development in the downtown development district which is within three hundred (300) feet of the Ouachita River's edge at its mean high-water mark. 
(ii)  The minimum setbacks from property lines shall be twenty (20) feet. 
(iii)  As an alternative to meeting the minimum setbacks, thirty (30) percent of a developed parcel of land may be dedicated for exclusively pedestrian circulation from Riverfront and Commerce Streets to the water's edge, said pedestrian access areas to be landscaped and provided with street furniture or other amenities. 
(iv)  Waterfront property shall not be utilized for vehicular parking except when associated with residential uses. 
(3)  Compliance. 
a.  Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection 12-505l(f), district structural regulations in this section shall apply to all new construction and all major remodeling projects in the downtown development district. 
b.  A major remodeling project is any remodeling or reconstruction where the building floor area is being increased by fifteen (15) percent or more or when the cost of the remodeling is greater than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the existing improvements on the site (fair market value for purposes of this provision being defined as that value used to calculate the assessed value of the site on the assessment rolls of the city for the most recent year). 
c.  Multiple remodeling projects undertaken over a period of five (5) years or less where the cumulative effect is to accomplish a major remodeling shall be considered a major remodeling project for purposes of this section.

(c)  District structural regulations: 
(1)  Purpose. 
a.  Blank walls on the ground-floor level are limited: 
1.  To encourage continuity of retail and consumer service uses; 
2.  To encourage retail and commercial activities at street level; 
3.  To provide a pleasant, rich, and diverse experience for pedestrians by visually connecting activities occurring within a structure to adjacent sidewalk areas; 
4.  To enhance crime prevention by increasing opportunities for surveillance of the street from the interiors of buildings and vice versa; 
5.  To restrict unpleasant, blank-wall facades at the street level; 
6.  And to avoid a monotonous environment. 
b.  Building setbacks, shapes, and bulk are regulated to encourage a harmonious association of compatible buildings. 
(2)  Standards. 
a.  Transparency requirements. 
1.  At least fifty (50) percent of the length and at least twenty-five (25) percent 0f the area of ground level exterior walls abutting sidewalks, plazas, or other public open spaces or rights-of-way must be devoted to windows affording views into retail, office, or lobby space, pedestrian entrances, or retail display windows. 
2.  This limitation on blank walls does not apply to sides of buildings having residential units located adjacent to the exterior ground-floor wall. 
3.  Buildings having less than fifty (50) percent of their ground-level floor area in retail, office, or lobby use: 
(i)  Where a building contains other active uses found by the planning commission to be of visual interest to the pedestrian, window; affording views of that active use may be provided as an alternative to subsection (2)a.l. above. Examples of such uses are pressrooms, classrooms, kitchens, or manufacturing processes. Parking areas, truck loading areas, vehicular accessways, and storage areas are not to be considered active uses. 
(ii)  Artwork such as murals or reliefs may be substituted to meet the requirements of subsection (2)a.l, above, if the proposed artwork is found by the planning commission to meet the intent of this section.

Sec. 12-5025. - Planned unit development residential projects. 
(a)  The following policy statement is in regard to the planned unit residential development project provision of the subdivision regulations which under the zoning administration falls under planned building groups: 
(1)  It is intended to permit, on application and approval of detailed plans, creation of new higher density, single-ownership residential projects where tracts suitable in location and character for the uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed as units. Suitability of such tracts for the plans and development proposed shall be determined by the existing and prospective character of surrounding development, and by reference to the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  In view of the substantial public advantages of planned unit development, it is the intent of this chapter to promote and encourage development in this form where appropriate in location and character. 
(3)  Higher density, single-ownership residential developments represent a special plan for a minimum of two (2) acres permitting usage of smaller building sites than otherwise permitted by this chapter and the subdivision regulations. Certain modifications of the general subdivision requirements, as governed by section 12-2005(e) of this Code, are permitted when, in the opinion of the planning commission, adequate provisions are made for circulation, recreation, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated. 
(b)  Factors to be considered by the commission in review of planned unit residential development projects include: 
(1)  Deed covenants for the development should include provisions for maximum coverage of building sites and other design specifications in accordance with the provisions of section 12-2005(e) of this Code. 
(2)  Deed covenants must include adequate provisions for the perpetual maintenance of common areas such as courts and playgrounds. 
(3)  Plans for the development must include concrete curb and gutter streets, sidewalks, underground drainage, adequate spacing of structures to assure access by emergency vehicles, and adequate off-street parking and access by residents.

Sec. 12-5081. - Purpose, findings, and definitions. 
(a)  Purpose and findings. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation of restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.

Neither is it the intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

    Surface water retention and detention basins designed to handle surface water runoff and overflow are recommended to be constructed so as to appear natural in appearance. 
(a)  Fencing criteria. The requirements for slopes and fencing are intended to discourage access to portions of a basin where steep side slopes (steeper than 4: 1) increase potential for slipping into basins, and to allow easy egress for those who have fallen with slopes that are mild enough (flatter than 4:1 and unfenced) to allow for easy escape. If the basin will hold water deeper than two (2) feet, a physical barrier as demarcation of the basin limits is required. 
(1)  Where interior slopes are steeper than 4:1, the barrier shall be a black chain link fence six (6) feet in height. 
(2)  If a retention or detention basin abuts a public street, a six-foot black chain link fence with evergreen planting and trees shall run parallel with the street right-of-way for the length of the basin.

ARTICLE A. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 12-6001. - Statutory authorization. 
    This chapter is adopted pursuant to R.S. 38:84, which delegates the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
(Ord. No. 2786, § 1, 10-8-96) 
Sec. 12-6002. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city (also sometimes referred to in this chapter as the "community") are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2786, § 1, 10-8-96) 
Sec. 12-6003. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2786, § 1, 10-8-96) 
Sec. 12-6004. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood water; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2786, § 1, 10-8-96) 
Sec. 12-6005. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE B. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 12-6006. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give the provisions of this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
    Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the one percent annual chance (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).

    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory building, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before start of construction of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 12-6018(b) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter set forth in section 12-6003. 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon, (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by the community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in section 12-6019(a)-(i) are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-6008, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore; the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvement of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 12-6018(a)(1) are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 2786, § 1, 10-8-96) 
Sec. 12-6024. - Floodways. 
    Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-6008 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If section 12-6024(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections 12-6020 to 12-6024. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. 
(Ord. No. 2786, § 1, 10-8-96) 
Sec. 12-6025. - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this chapter is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4326, § 3, 10-13-15) 
Sec. 12-6026. - Penalties for noncompliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than six (6) months, or both, for each violation. Each day the violation continues shall be deemed a new violation. In addition, the violator shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of West Monroe from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

    No property owner shall allow any structure or building to remain on their property in a dangerous or dilapidated condition. A dangerous or dilapidated structure or building is one that has been damaged by fire or other casualty, or has deteriorated from age, lack of maintenance or such other cause to such an extent that it is, in its present condition, a potential danger to person or property, or which, by reason of its nature or condition, endangers the public welfare or safety. A dangerous or dilapidated structure or building shall also include a structure or building which is unfit for human occupancy, or is found to be unlawful. 
(a)  Unsafe structures. An unsafe structure includes one that is found to be dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public or the occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect or warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure contains unsafe equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that partial or complete collapse is possible. For purposes of this chapter, the following shall also be considered as a structure, either alone or together with the buildings or other structures located on a common property: 
(1)  Fencing (regardless of construction material - wood, chainlink, metal sheet, masonry, or other material, or a combination of materials); and

1.  Any door, aisle, passageway, stairway, exit or other means of egress that does not conform to the approved building or fire code of the city as related to the requirements for existing buildings. 
2.  The walking surface of any aisle, passageway, stairway, exit or other means of egress is so warped, worn loose, torn or otherwise unsafe as to not provide safe and adequate means of egress. 
3.  Any portion of a building, structure or appurtenance that has been damaged by fire, earthquake, wind, flood, deterioration, neglect, abandonment, vandalism or by any other cause to such an extent that it is likely to partially or completely collapse, or to become detached or dislodged. 
4.  Any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance or ornamentation on the exterior thereof that is not of sufficient strength or stability, or is not so anchored, attached or fastened in place so as to be capable of resisting natural or artificial loads of one and one-half (11/2) the original designed value. 
5.  The building or structure, or part of the building or structure, because of dilapidation, deterioration, decay, faulty construction, the removal or movement of some portion of the ground necessary for the support, or for any other reason, is likely to partially or completely collapse, or some portion of the foundation or underpinning of the building or structure is likely to fail or give way. 
6.  The building or structure, or any portion thereof, is clearly unsafe for its use and occupancy. 
7.  The building or structure is neglected, damaged, dilapidated, unsecured or abandoned so as to become an attractive nuisance to children who might play in the building or structure to their danger, becomes a harbor for vagrants, criminals or immoral persons, or enables persons to resort to the building or structure for committing a nuisance or an unlawful act. 
8.  Any building or structure has been constructed, exists or is maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition applicable to such building or structure provided by the approved building or fire code of the city, or of any law or ordinance to such an extent as to present either a substantial risk of fire, building collapse or any other threat to life and safety. 
9.  A building or structure, used or intended to be used for dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, ventilation, mechanical or plumbing system, or otherwise, is determined by the code official to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such a condition that is likely to cause sickness or disease. 
10.  Any building or structure, because of a lack of sufficient or proper fire-resistance-rated construction, fire protection systems, electrical system, fuel connections, mechanical system, plumbing system or other cause, is determined by the code official to be a threat to life or health. 
11.  Any portion of a building remains on a site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or whenever any building or structure is abandoned so as to constitute such building or portion thereof as an attractive nuisance or hazard to the public. 
12.

Sec. 12-7013. - Securing specifications. 
    Buildings required to be secured shall be secured in one of the following ways: 
(1)  Minimal securing, the least intrusive for buildings in areas where minimum securing is possible; 
(2)  Moderate securing, used when doors or windows become broken or unlatched; and 
(3)  Maximum securing, the most intrusive, used for buildings that have been broken into or vandalized. 
    Except as otherwise specifically required otherwise below, all secured buildings shall be required to be maintained in the same manner and with the same outward appearance of an occupied building, including maintaining of roofs, windows and doors; overall exterior appearance such as paint renewal, as needed, and windows to be curtained or draped to give the appearance of occupancy; and all grounds and premises to be maintained. Structures shall remain secured until re-occupied, or until demolished. 
(Ord. No. 3392, § 1, 4-13-04; Ord. No. 3649, § 1, 4-10-2007) 
Sec. 12-7014. - Levels of securing. 
(a)  Minimal securing. Minimal securing of all exterior openings shall be accomplished by securely locking windows, doors and other means of egress. 
(b)  Moderate securing. If inspection of a building reveals unlocked or broken openings, or traces of improper use or occupancy, including both a building not previously cited as well as a building already considered minimally secured, the building may be required to be moderately secured. 
Moderate securing shall require that all exterior openings be secured in a neat and workmanlike manner with not less than one-half-inch thick (CDX) weather-resistant plywood, either cut to fit within the openings, or cut to fit over trim around the openings, securely fastened with two-and-one-half-inch (21/2") wood screws six (6) to twelve (12) inches on-center. 
The plywood shall be coated with two (2) coats of exterior paint. Color shall blend with or harmonize with the exterior colors of the building as to be inconspicuous as possible. All bare wood siding, windows, overhang, and trim shall also be coated with exterior paint. In the event the owner wishes to utilize the structure for storage (if allowed by zoning codes and subdivision restrictions), it shall be required that a minimum one-and-one-quarter-inch (11/4") solid core door be installed and equipped with passage lock and one-inch (1") deadbolt lock. 
(c)  Maximum securing. If inspection of a building which was previously required to be moderately secured is found to have broken or unlocked openings or evidence of improper use or occupancy, it shall be required that all exterior openings be secured in a neat and workmanlike manner with not less than one-half-inch thick (CDX) weather-resistant plywood, cut to fit within the opening or cut to fit over the trim around the opening, securely fastened with one-half-inch by eight inch (1/2? × 8?) round head bolt with washer through the center of the plywood with two-by-four (2? × 4?) back up. 
The plywood shall be coated with two (2) coats of exterior paint. Color shall blend with or harmonize with the exterior colors of the building as to be inconspicuous as possible. All bare wood siding, windows, overhang, and trim shall also be coated with exterior paint. In the event the owner wishes to utilize the structure for storage (if allowed by zoning codes and subdivision restrictions), it shall be required that a minimum one-and-one-quarter-inch (11/4?) solid core door be installed and equipped with passage lock and one-inch (1?) deadbolt lock.

Sec. 12-7016. - Time limitations. 
(a)  Upon determination that a building is required to be secured, notice shall be provided to the property owner by certified mail or actual delivery. Receipt of notice by any person of suitable age and discretion at the business premises or usual residence of the property owner shall be considered actual delivery and sufficient notice. Notice by certified mail shall be considered as received seven (7) days from the date of deposit into the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, or the date of actual delivery, whichever first occurs. The property shall for all purposes be presumed to be owned by that person who is reflected as the property owner on the records of the Ouachita Parish Assessor. Notice to any co-owner of the property shall be considered as notice to all co-owners. In the event that a property owner is deceased or notice cannot otherwise be served as provided above, service may be made upon an attorney in a manner similar to that provided by subsection 12-7003(c), or proceedings may be instituted "in rem" against the property alone in any manner otherwise allowed by law. 
(b)  Securing of the structure must be completed according to the specifications provided above within seven (7) days from receipt of notice as provided in (a) above.

(1)  Ordinary maintenance or repairs to structures which do not involve a change of design, material, or of the outward appearance of the structure; 
(2)  Construction, reconstruction, alteration, removal, or demolition of any structure: 
a.  Which is required to protect the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. 
b.  For which a permit was issued prior to the establishment of the historic district within which the permitted structure or site is located or before the site was declared a landmark. 
c.  For which the board has issued a ruling of economic hardship or has otherwise overruled the commission on appeal. 
d.  As ordered by final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(3)  Other acts clearly exempted in rules adopted by the commission. 
(c)  Review and design standards for certificates of appropriateness. 
(1)  The commission shall issue and publish detailed design guidelines for the construction, reconstruction, removal, alteration, and demolition of structures in a historic district and for structures declared to be landmarks, said guidelines to be made available upon request. 
(2)  Design guidelines adopted by the commission shall include, at a minimum, the following criteria: 
a.  Exterior design compatibility (existing development): 
1.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for an existing building which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or site and its intended purpose. 
2.  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
3.  All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and that seek to create an earlier or later appearance shall be discouraged. 
4.  Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
5.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
6.  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence, rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
7.  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the least destructive means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken without prior approval of the commission. 
8.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project. 
9.  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood, or environment. 
10.  Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that, if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. 
b.  New development or additions. Any new structure and appurtenances thereof or any structural additions to any existing structure shall be visually compatible with buildings, public ways, and places to which it is visually related in terms of the following characteristics: 
1.  Its height; the relationship of width to height of its elevation; the relationship of width to height of its windows; the number, frequency and intervals of its windows, doors, and other appurtenances; the relationship of solids to voids on its exterior facades; 
2.  Its relationship to any open space between it and adjoining buildings or structures; the relationship of its entrances and other projections to sidewalks, the relationships of the materials, textures, and colors of its facade; 
3.  The shape of its roof line; the bulk and arrangement of associated walls, fences, landscape masses, entry ways, signs, awnings, porches, and balconies; 
4.  And its directional orientation, whether this be vertical, horizontal, or nondirectional. 
(d)  Variances. Where by reason of topographical conditions, irregularly shaped lots, or because of unusual physical circumstances applicable solely to the particular parcel of an applicant, strict enforcement of the provisions of this article would result in serious undue hardship particularly affecting said applicant, then the commission, in passing upon an application may vary or modify adherence to this article, provided always that its requirements insure harmony with the general purposes hereof, and will not adversely affect a historic district as a whole or any designated landmark.
