the end of two (2) years, whichever period is the shorter. The plan showing the grades at

submit competent evidence that vehicles entering and exiting the lot shall not pose a
safety hazard.

§ 40, and in the town bylaws within two hundred (200) feet of the limits of the earth

52
proposed hours of operation and the estimated total number of vehicle trips required to
achieve the removal and restoration during the permit term, assuming typical vehicles are
to be utilized, and the estimated vehicle trips during a typical day. If the applicant

siltation of adjoining land and ways, and for the cleaning and maintenance of town ways
in the vicinity of the lot.

absence of an approved plan, there shall be no disposal or burial of stumps on the lot.

thereof, the whole area where removal has taken place is covered with not less than four
(4) inches of topsoil and seeded with a suitable cover crop, except where ledge rock is
exposed, and all large stones and boulders which protrude above the finished grade are to
be removed or buried. Except for good cause, there shall be no burial of stumps, except in
locations expressly designated. There shall be no burial of waste of any kind, unless
defined as an earth material herein.
(3) Where the earth removal is undertaken to enable or facilitate a lawful use or a
subdivision of land, the applicant shall demonstrate in clear and convincing evidence that
the removal of any earth from the parcel is necessary. Earth removal shall be
presumed excessive and unnecessary if the lot, in its natural state, may be connected by
gravity flow to town sewers and after earth removal must be lifted to town sewers, or
where the implementation of the subdivision may be accomplished by cuts and fills on
the lot.
53
(4) Where the earth removal is undertaken to enable or facilitate another use or a use
exempt under the Zoning Bylaw 3 the Board may require the applicant to restrict by deed
the use of the premises to the use so enabled or facilitated for a period of not less than
twenty (20) years.
(5) No earth removal shall be permitted below four (4) feet above the natural high
groundwater elevation, except upon clear and convincing evidence that such earth
removal is necessary to enable an agricultural or passive recreational use, and the use so
enabled and created is limited in perpetuity to that use.
(6) The applicant shall post performance security with the Treasurer of the Town of
Pepperell in an amount determined by the Board as sufficient to guarantee conformity
with the provisions or conditions of the permit, including, but not limited to, the
anticipated cost of restoration of the land to the condition required in the permit by a
private contractor hired by the town after public bidding following expiration of the
permit. Performance security shall not be released until the Selectmen are satisfied that
restoration is complete according to the permit, and in the case of transfer of ownership,
that the successor owner has furnished performance security then found to be sufficient.
(7) The trucks or other vehicles shall follow a specified route in coming and going to and
from said land, not exceeding specified speeds. The Board may require the owner to
furnish a flagperson or special police details at the entrance to protect the public safety
where vehicle traffic on a given day exceeds certain limits.
(8) Temporary traffic signs shall be posted by the applicant as required by the Board.
(9) All requirements of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles pertaining to trucks shall be met.
(10) No earth materials shall be brought to the site except in conjunction with a Boardapproved
site restoration plan.
(11) The foregoing conditions do not relieve the owner from compliance with other local,
state and federal requirements.
E. Before issuing a permit, the Board shall hold a public hearing, after giving at least
fourteen (14) days' notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation, the first of
such notices to appear not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date of hearing, and
by written notice to all abutters and the Planning Board and Conservation Commission.

Located on the beautiful northern regions of Massachusetts, the Town of Pepperell has
passed through the struggles that characterize all American communities in their early
history. While only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of the incorporation of
the town, subsequent growth of the community, together with the complexity of modern
life, has created the need for more and detailed laws for the proper function and
government of the town. The recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history, and
as the community develops and changes, review and revision of old laws and
consideration of new laws, in the light of current trends, must keep pace. The orderly
collection of these records is an important step in this ever continuing process.
Legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of
old records. They must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must
be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as these in mind that the following
codification of bylaws and rules and regulations was ordered.
Contents of Code
The Code contains the bylaws adopted by the Town Meeting as well as the rules and
regulations adopted by the Board of Selectmen and the Planning Board. Also contained in
the Code are rules and regulations adopted by other boards or persons authorized to do so
by statute or town law.
Division of Code
The Code is divided into three major parts, known as "Divisions." Division 1 contains the
bylaws adopted by the Town Meeting. This Division is further broken down into Parts I
and II. Part I, Administrative Legislation, contains all bylaws of an administrative nature,
namely, those dealing with the administration of government, those establishing or
regulating municipal departments and those affecting officers and employees. Part II,
General Legislation, contains all bylaws of a regulatory nature. Bylaws in this part
generally impose penalties for violation of their provisions, whereas those in Part I do
not. Division 2 contains the regulations promulgated by the Board of Selectmen. Division
3 contains other miscellaneous regulations, such as those adopted by the Planning Board.
Grouping of Legislation and Arrangement of Chapters
The bylaws and other rules and regulations are organized into chapters, their order being
an alphabetical progression from one subject to another. Wherever there are two or more
ordinances dealing with the same subject, they are combined into a single chapter. Thus,
for example, all bylaws dealing with sewers may be found in the chapter entitled
"Sewers." In such chapters, use of Article designations has preserved the identity of the
individual items of legislation.
Table of Contents
The Table of Contents details the arrangement of material by chapter as a means of
identifying specific areas of legislation. Wherever two or more bylaws or rules and
regulations have been combined by the editors into a single chapter, titles of the several
Articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate location of the individual
enactments.
Reserved Chapters
101
Space has been provided in each Division of the Code for the convenient insertion,
alphabetically, of later enactments. In the Table of Contents, such space appears as
chapters titled "(Reserved)." In the body of the Code, reserved space is provided by
breaks in the page-numbering sequence between chapters.
Pagination
A unique page-numbering system has been used, in which each chapter forms an
autonomous unit. One hundred pages have been allotted to each chapter, and the first
page of each is the number of that chapter followed by the numerals "01." Thus, Chapter
6 begins on page 601, Chapter 116 on page 11601, etc. By use of this system, it is
possible to add or to change pages in any chapter without affecting the sequence of
subsequent pages in other chapters and to insert new chapters without affecting the
existing organization.
Numbering of Sections
A chapter-related section-numbering system is employed, in which each section of every
ordinance is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which
the legislation is located and the location of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first
section of Chapter 16 is § 16-1, while the sixth section of Chapter 200 is § 200-6.
Scheme
The Scheme is the list of section titles which precedes the text of each chapter. These
titles are carefully written so that, taken together, they may be considered as a summary
of the content of the chapter. Taken separately, each describes the content of a particular
section. For ease and precision of reference, the Scheme titles are repeated as section
headings in the text.
Chapter Histories
At the end of the Scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter.
This History indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived
and date of adoption. In the case of chapters containing Articles derived from more than
one item of legislation, the source of each Article is indicated in the History.
General References
In each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the Code, a table of
General References is included to direct the reader's attention to such related chapters.
102
Appendix
Certain forms of local legislation do not fall into the categories established for Divisions
1 through 3 of the Code but are of such significance that their application is
communitywide or their provisions are germane to the conduct of municipal government.
The Appendix of this Code is reserved for such legislation and for any other material that
the municipality may wish to include.
Index
The Index is a guide to information. Since it is likely that this Code will be used by
persons without formal legal training, the Index has been formulated to enable such
persons to locate a particular section quickly. Each section of each chapter has been
indexed. The Index should be supplemented and revised from time to time as new
legislation is added to the Code.
Supplementation
Supplementation of the Code will follow the adoption of new legislation. New ordinances
and amendments will be included and repeals will be indicated as soon as possible after
passage.
Statutory References
References to the Massachusetts state laws used in this Code are to the Annotated Laws
of Massachusetts, Tercentenary Edition.
Acknowledgment - 1993
The Editor wishes to acknowledge the interest, enthusiasm and assistance of those town
officials who helped make this Code a reality; in particular, Executive Secretary John D.
Petrin, Town Counsel Joseph Hannon, Esq., former Town Clerk Ann W. Sullivan and
current Town Clerk Lois Libby.
The codification of bylaws and rules and regulations of the Town of Pepperell reflects an
appreciation of the needs of a progressive and expanding community. As in many other
municipalities, officials are faced with fundamental changes involving nearly every facet
of community life. Problems increase in number and complexity and range in importance
from everyday details to crucial areas of civic planning. It is the profound conviction of
General Code Publishers Corp. that this Code will contribute significantly to the efficient
administration of local government. As Daniel Webster observed, "The law: It has
honored us; may we honor it."

delegated by the Appointing Authorities. Appointments are made for specified periods of time and are effective as
of the first day of employment. All employees must successfully complete a pre-placement physical examination
for the position in question, to determine if they are physically capable of performing essential job functions, prior

terms:
Support staff and administrative positions shall be permanent upon completion of probationary

similar type work, that employee may start at a higher step within the range, up to Step 4 with the approval of the
Personnel Administrator. The hiring rate for seasonal, temporary or non-regularly scheduled positions shall be the
rate of the position class in Appendix D for which the employee is being hired.
11 Probationary Period.

employee may be discharged by the hiring Department Head with the concurrence of the Appointing Authority at
any time, without notice or hearing.

annually on their anniversary dates, proceed to the next succeeding step in their respective compensation schedules.
12b. Any employee denied a step increase on the basis of an unsatisfactory performance evaluation shall be eligible for
reconsideration, six (6) months after said denial, at the request of the Department Head to the Personnel Board. The
step adjustment shall be effective when approved, and shall establish a new anniversary date from which all
subsequent step increases shall be measured.
13 Transfers and Promotions
13a An employee promoted to a higher graded position shall first be granted a one-step increase within the present
grade, and then enter the higher grade either at Step 1 or the step rate in that grade immediately at or above the
former rate, whichever is higher. The effective date in Step shall be the effective date of the promotion.
13b An employee temporarily assigned duties of a job classification in a different grade shall continue to be compensated
at the grade and step of their regular position. Temporary duty assignments out of grade longer than twenty-one
(21) calendar days shall be presented to the Board for further determination.
13c If an employee requests an appointment to a position in the same or lesser grade, the employee shall be paid at the
same step in the new compensation grade as he or she was paid in the former grade.
14 Regraded Positions
14a If a position is regraded to a higher grade, the incumbent shall be assigned the step in the new grade that has the
rate of pay equal to or closest above the incumbent's prior rate of pay at the time of the reclassification. The effective
date of the promotion and any associated Step adjustment shall be identical. However, the anniversary date for the
incumbent's step increase consideration shall not be changed.
14b If a position is regraded to a lower grade, the incumbent shall thereafter be compensated at the same Step as before,
but in the new grade of the position, effective the pay period following the reclassification.
14c When a benefit or other part time position becomes available within a department, the Department Head shall notify
the Personnel Administrator of the available position, at which time the position shall be posted on the bulletin
board at Town Hall. Employees interested in such positions shall make application to the Personnel Administrator,
and shall also notify their Department Head of their intentions. All employees who apply and are qualified for the
position, as determined by the Department Head, shall be considered prior to applicants from outside Town
employment. Vacancies may be posted and advertised concurrently, at the discretion of the Personnel
Administrator.
15 Performance Evaluations.
15a All Pepperell Town Departments, Appointing Authorities and persons with employee performance evaluation
responsibilities shall undertake employee performance evaluations on forms approved by the Personnel Board. The
completed approved forms will be permanently filed in the employee’s folder. The completed approved forms shall
be completed at the frequency stated herewith for the following categories of town employees:
New Probationary Town Employees:
Frequency of evaluation: 150 days from the start of employment.
Unsatisfactory Review Town Employees:
Frequency of evaluation: 180 days after unsatisfactory review.
All Town Employees Due a Step Increase:
Frequency of evaluation: 30 days before a step increase is due.
All Town Employees Not in Categories above:
Frequency of evaluation: During the months of October/November of each year, provided that 120 days has elapsed
since the last performance evaluation.
All Town Employees in General:
5
Frequency of Evaluation: Any town employee may request a performance evaluation from his or her department
head or supervisor at any time and one will be provided within 30 days. The performance evaluation will cover the
period from the last performance evaluation to the date of the requested performance evaluation.
16 Layoff and Reinstatement
16a If a layoff or reduction in force (RIF) is directed, Department Heads shall identify positions to be eliminated and
define the level of function to be retained in each class. Within each affected class, employees will be laid off in
the following category order: non-regularly scheduled, temporary or seasonal, probationary, part-time (nonbenefit),
benefit.
16b Employees within each affected class working for a single Department or for any class that spans more than one
Department, will be allocated one (1) point for each full year of Town service, one (1) point for each hour scheduled
to work per week, plus the numerical score received in the last performance evaluation. These points will be added
to the numerical grade of the employee, and, with the concurrence of their Appointing Authorities, employees will
be laid off in the order of fewest points to greatest within the category. Employees to be laid off will be notified by
their supervisors and in writing by the Personnel Administrator.
16c Reinstatement within each Department or class that spans more than one Department shall be in reverse order to
the layoff. Reinstatement rights pertain only to positions previously held, and last for one year from the effective
date of the layoff.
17 Termination
17a After the probation period, an employee may be terminated for cause at any time.
17b An appointment that is not renewed or extended by the Appointing Authority expires at the end of the stated length
of the appointment and the employment of the employee in that position ends effective on that date. Employees of
the Town who were not required to be appointed to their positions prior to 1 July 1994 are exempt from this
provision. The Personnel Administrator will maintain a list of employees so exempted and will also annotate the
personnel records of these employees to this effect.
Article V - Employee Benefits
18 General:
Department Heads have the authority to schedule and grant all leaves under this article.
19 Vacation Leave
19a Benefit employees shall be entitled to vacation leave with pay on the basis of their regularly scheduled hours per
week. Vacation leave for employees working less than 40 hours per week shall accrue in the proportion of their
scheduled hours per week to forty hours ("proportionately"). Vacation time will begin to accrue on the first day of
the first full month following start of employment. New employees must successfully complete their six month
probationary employment period prior to using accrued vacation leave.
19b Vacation leave shall accrue monthly on the basis of the number of completed calendar months of active employment
with the Town. Vacation leave may accumulate to a maximum of 1.5 times an employee's maximum annual accrual
amount.
19c Employees shall take vacation in full day increments, but shall charge vacation leave in hourly increments. They
may take (and charge) vacation in hourly increments with the written approval of the Department Head. Pay in lieu
of vacation is allowed only in the case of employee termination.

19d Vacation Leave scale for benefit employees scheduled to work 40 hours per week ("Months" is defined as months
of continuous active employment):
19e

Active Employment

121-179 13 1/3 160
180 – 299 16 2/3 200
300 plus 20 240
19f Vacation leave may accumulate to no more than the limit established under the Pepperell Personnel Code. If an
employee’s work hours are revised downward, which also revises the vacation leave accumulation limit, and if that
employee had accumulated more leave than the new limit allows, the following rule will apply:
Under no circumstances may an employee lose earned accumulated vacation leave due to a revised work schedule.
At the employee’s discretion, and with the concurrence of the Department Head, accrued vacation leave in excess
of the new maximum may be paid out as though the employee still had a longer work schedule (not to exceed the
earlier, longer schedule), so the employee may receive a maximum of regular pay for vacation leave as under the
prior work schedule. Vacation leave taken in lieu of hours worked will be deducted from the new, lower
accumulation limit, to allow for normal accumulation. If vacation leave over and above the new scheduled work
hours is taken, it will come from the excess accrued vacation and will result in additional pay, but not additional
time off work. Under no circumstances may vacation leave be paid out for hours not worked, if such payments
would result in an overtime payment.
Example: A 40 hour per week employee with 720 hours of accrued vacation leave has his/her scheduled work hours
revised to 20 hours per week, with a corresponding reduction of allowable vacation accrual to 360 hours. The
employee now has an excess of 360 hours over the limit normally allowed for an employee with a 20 hour per week
schedule. If that employee works 10 hours and takes 10 hours vacation time during the next week, he/she is paid
for 20 hours total, and has reduced his/her vacation below the 360 hour limit by 10 hours. At the end of that month,
up to 10 hours of vacation (depending on the length of service with the Town) may be accrued, bringing the total
vacation balance back to no more than 360 hours. During the week in this example, up to 20 excess vacation hours
may also be paid out to the employees so that the employee does not receive more than 40 hours per week of regular
pay and vacation leave combined.
If departmental scheduling or other extenuating circumstance related to the function of the department preclude the
use of vacation leave, the limit shall be extended for a maximum of sixty (60) days; Department Head approval of
this extension is required in writing.
20 Holidays.
20a The Town of Pepperell shall observe eleven and one half (11-1/2) holidays per year, as follows, unless superseded
by a list in the Administrative Guide, which shall take precedence:
20a1 New Year's Day
Martin Luther King Day
Washington's Birthday
Patriot's Day
Memorial Day
Independence Day
Labor Day
Columbus Day
Veterans Day
Thanksgiving Day
1/2 Day Christmas Eve
Christmas Day
7
20b Benefit employees shall be entitled to eight (8) hours holiday leave with pay per holiday Those benefit employees
who are normally scheduled for hours that vary up or down from the normal 8 hour day shall receive
holiday pay for all hours normally scheduled on the official designated holiday. Benefit employees
working less than 40 hours per week who are not scheduled to work on the designated holiday shall receive
holiday pay calculated “proportionately” then round up to the nearest half hour. To be eligible for holiday
pay, an employee shall have worked during the holiday week, including his or her last scheduled shift prior to the
holiday, the holiday itself, if scheduled to work, and his or her next scheduled shift immediately following the
holiday, unless the employee takes vacation leave or personal leave, or has been excused for a legitimate reason, in
writing, by the Department Head.
20c Holiday leave will be granted on the holiday whenever possible. If, however, according to the needs of a
department, holiday leave cannot be granted on the day on which the holiday is observed, the employee shall receive
as total payment, wages based upon two and one-half (2-1/2) times his or her hourly rate for all hours worked the
day of the holiday.
20d Should a holiday fall on Saturday or Sunday, the day observed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on the
Friday or Monday for state employees shall be considered the holiday. If this holiday falls on an employee's
scheduled day off, compensating holiday time will be scheduled by the Department Head, giving consideration to
the desires of employees, or the employee will be entitled to a payment of his or her regular hourly rate times the
number of hours of holiday time the employee would have been entitled to. Compensating time earned from a
holiday will be taken within thirty (30) days of the holiday or the holiday observed by the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. In the case of employees who are on a seven-day schedule, should a holiday fall on Saturday or
Sunday, the day upon which the holiday falls shall be considered the holiday, notwithstanding that the legal holiday
under MGL, occurs on another day.
20e To be eligible for holiday pay, an employee shall have worked during the holiday week, including his or her last
scheduled shift prior to the holiday, the holiday itself, if scheduled to work, and his or her next scheduled shift
immediately following the holiday, unless the employee has been excused for a legitimate reason, in writing, by the
Department Head.
21 Sick Leave.
21a A benefit employee scheduled to work 40 hours per week (benefit, 40 hour) is entitled to 8 hours of paid sick leave
for each completed calendar month of active employment. Sick leave for other benefit employees shall accrue
"proportionately." Sick leave may be taken in half-hour increments.
21b A Department Head may allow an employee to use sick leave when the employee is unable to perform required
duties of the position due to personal illness or accident. The Department Head may also allow an employee to use
sick leave in the event of family illness, prescribed medical examinations or other absences caused by accidents or
illness, at the discretion of the Department Head. Five (5) or more consecutive working days of sick leave, or less
than five (5) days if required by the Department Head, will require a physician's certificate certifying the illness, to
be submitted to the Department Head, a copy of which shall be forwarded to the Town Accountant for the office
file.
21c Unused sick leave may accumulate to a maximum of 720 hours for benefit, 40 hour employees. The maximum
accumulation of sick leave for other benefit employees is calculated "proportionately." Sick leave in excess of the
maximum accrual amount will be lost at the end of each fiscal year.
21d If any employee’s scheduled work hours are revised downward, which also revises the sick leave accumulation
limit, and if that employee has accumulated more sick leave than the new limit allows, the difference between the
new limit and the employee’s accumulated sick leave will be recorded in the employee’s personnel record and with
the Town Accountant as banked sick leave earned. No sick leave may be accrued above the new limit or added to
the banked sick leave earned account. Banked sick leave cannot be used, unless later transferred as follows: If the
employee’s scheduled work hours are later revised upward, which increases the sick leave accumulation limit,
banked sick leave will be transferred, as available, to accumulated sick leave, not to exceed the new higher limit.
21e Employees may elect to donate a specific number of their sick days to another employee on a one-time basis subject
to the approval of the Personnel Administrator and without prejudice to any future requests for the donation of sick
leave. Upon donation of sick leave, the employee permanently waives any claim to the amount of sick leave
donated. Maximum number of days one can donate to another employee is 10 days.
8
22 Personal Leave
22a Benefit, 40 hour employees as of July 1 of any year are entitled to twenty-four (24) hours of personal leave with
pay during that fiscal year. New benefit, 40 hour employees who are hired prior to April 1st are entitled to
prorated personal time until the end of the current fiscal year. Other benefit employees accrue personal leave
"proportionately", rounded to the nearest half-hour. Personal leave shall be scheduled with the approval of the
Department Head subject to the operating needs of the department, as determined by the Department Head. Personal
leave must be used during the fiscal year it was awarded and cannot be carried over from fiscal year to fiscal year.
Personal leave not used by the end of the fiscal year shall be lost.
23 Funeral Leave.
23a In the event of the death of a benefit employee's spouse, child, or step-child resident in the household; or a parent,
brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, grandparent or grandchild of the employee or his/her spouse; an excused
absence with pay of not more than four (4) consecutive, scheduled work days will be allowed.
24 Overtime
24a Benefit employees shall be entitled to one and one-half (1-1/2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked
in excess of forty (40) hours in one (1) work week. For the purpose of this section, “hours worked” shall be defined
as hours physically worked, vacation leave, holiday leave, and personal leave. Hours worked shall not include
funeral leave, jury duty, on-call hours not actually worked, compensatory time, leaves of absence, sick leave except
as authorized in writing by the Department Head, or hours physically worked that have already qualified as
overtime.
24b All employees may be required to work overtime by their Department Heads.
24c Persons working for more than one department shall combine all hours worked in all Town positions to determine
overtime eligibility. Department Heads shall obtain written concurrence of any department whose employee they
wish to hire and provide that documentation to the Personnel Administrator to file in the employee’s personnel
record.
25 Longevity Pay.
25a. Benefit, 40 hour employees are entitled to longevity pay based on each employee’s grade and seniority as of the
end of the previous fiscal year, and according to the schedule set forth in Appendix E. Other benefit employees are
entitled to longevity pay calculated “proportionately.” All payments shall be subject to the approval of the Personnel
Board.
25b. Longevity shall be paid in two installments, one at the end of each six months of the fiscal year. Any employee who
receives a less than satisfactory performance during the fiscal year following the year on which the longevity
payment is based, is entitled to only one half of his or her scheduled longevity payment. If more than one
performance evaluation is less than satisfactory, the employee shall lose eligibility for longevity pay in any amount.
26 Insurance.
26a Medical Insurance: The Town will pay a percentage of the premiums for benefit employees in a Town-sponsored
group health indemnity plan and a percentage of the premium of a group HMO medical plan as determined by the
Board of Selectmen. When more than one member of a family is employed by the Town, the Town will pay a
percentage of the premiums for a family plan in the name of one of the benefit members so employed if otherwise
qualified. The Town will pay a percentage of the premiums for retired employees receiving county retirement
benefits for group life insurance and blanket hospital, surgical and medical insurance.
26b Life Insurance: The Town will pay a percentage of the premiums of benefit employees in a Town-sponsored term
life insurance plan through a qualified life insurance company.
27 Jury Duty
27a Town employees summoned to appear for jury duty shall submit a copy of the summons to their Department Head
in advance of such duty, and shall be granted time off to perform the service. Such employees shall receive their
regular wages or salary from the Town during the period of service. Employees receiving fees or payment for jury
service shall reimburse the Town for all payments received, exclusive of payments received for meals or travel. An
employee who serves jury duty shall file a juror service certificate with the Town Accountant as proof of service.
9
28 Military leave of absence.
28a A benefit employee who serves an annual tour of military duty shall be granted leave with pay for up to seventeen
(17) days per calendar year by the Town for such a tour. This section is subject to applicable State and Federal
laws.
29 Leave of Absence Without Pay
29a Upon a written request, a Department Head may grant a leave of absence without pay to a benefit or other part-time
employee for up to thirty (30) calendar days per year. Leaves of absence for periods of time in excess of thirty (30)
days shall require the approval of the Personnel Board, which shall consult with the Department Head. Employees
on unpaid leave shall return to work at the specified date and time unless the leave is extended by the Department
Head or the Board. Failure to return to work on the specified date, except in the case of a leave for medical necessity
or disability for which the Town's workmen's compensation insurer is making payments, will be considered a
resignation from the employment of the Town with the loss of all seniority and benefits.
29b Employee benefits, including sick leave and vacation, do not continue and/or accrue during leaves of absence
without pay, including absences covered by workers' compensation, but shall remain frozen at the levels at which
they existed at the commencement of the leave. In order to continue coverage under the Town's health and life
insurance plans, employees shall pay the total monthly premiums for the Plans, payable to the Treasurer on the first
of each month, except in the case of the leave for medical necessity or disability for which the Town's workmen's
compensation insurer is making payments, in which case the Town shall assume a percentage of the premiums
determined by the Board of Selectmen.
29c In the case of an employee on a leave of absence for medical necessity or disability for which payments are being
paid by the Town’s workmen's compensation insurer, the employee may elect to receive wages or salary in part for
sick leave accumulated as of the commencement of the leave, to be paid in such amounts as, when added to the
compensation received from the Town’s insurer, will result in up to full payment of his or her wages or salary until
the depletion of accumulated sick leave. Otherwise no cash salary or wages shall be paid for any period for which
total incapacity compensation is paid by the Town’s insurer, except that, in the case of subsequent separation from
the Town’s employment during the term of the leave, the employee may receive salary or wages in full for any
accumulated vacation leave at the commencement of the leave of absence.
29d Employees returning from an unpaid leave of absence shall be credited with seniority and benefits at the level at
which they were frozen and to the extent that they were not used in conjunction with workmen's compensation.
29e Paternity leave of up to three (3) consecutive, scheduled workdays will be granted, with pay, for the birth of a child,
or the adoption of a child under two (2) years old. Paternity leave will commence on the day the child is brought
home from the hospital, or, in the case of adoption, the day the child is permanently introduced into the home.
Maternity leave arising from the pregnancy of an employee will be governed by applicable State and Federal Law.
30 EXCEPTIONS
Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this By-law:
At any Annual Town Meeting, the Finance Committee, with the approval of the Board of Selectmen, may make
budget recommendations for the succeeding Fiscal Year that include suspension of step increases and/or longevity
payments with regard to all personnel not otherwise covered by contract;
At any point in any Fiscal Year, the Board of Selectmen may, upon declaration of a financial emergency, direct
forfeiture of payment for step increases and/or longevity not already implemented or expended, with regard to all
personnel not otherwise covered by contract.

It is the purpose of this By-law to encourage the pursuit of agriculture, to promote
agriculturally-based economic activities, and to assist in the protection of farmlands
within the Town of Pepperell.
The Town specifically notes and emphasizes the rights granted under MGL, Ch. 40A, s.3;
Chapter 90, s. 9; Ch. 111, s. 125A; and Ch. 128, s. 1A, relating to agricultural activities.
Section II: Definitions
The word “farm” shall include any parcel or contiguous parcels of land or bodies of water
under private ownership, used for the primary purpose of commercial agriculture, or an
accessory use thereto.
The term “farm,” for purposes of this By-law, shall include both uses which are exempt
from local zoning under paragraph I of section 3 of MGL Ch. 40A, and non-exempt
agricultural uses identified in Section D of the Table of Uses of the Pepperell Zoning Bylaw.
The term “farming” shall be defined as the commercial production of crops, horticultural
items, or animal products for human use or consumption. “Farming” shall include (but
not be limited to):
? Cultivation and tillage of the soil
? Dairying
? Production, cultivation, growing or harvesting of any agricultural, floricultural,
viticultural, horticultural, or aquatic commodities for commercial purposes

agriculture and the practice of agriculture in Pepperell, or in general
? To serve, at the written request of any Town Officer, Board, or
Committee, as an arbitrator or negotiator in the resolution of disputes
relating to agricultural issues, provided that no order or decision on the
particular matter in question has already been issued by any Town entity
legally authorized to do so; and that any resulting decision or
recommendation shall be strictly advisory, and shall have no legal
standing or definitive nature beyond the voluntary agreement of the parties
to abide by it
C. The Agricultural Advisory Board, per se, is specifically not authorized:
? To acquire or hold property, real or personal

ARTICLE A-III
SEWER DESIGN
Section 1. Size of Sewer
(a) No public, main line, gravity sewers shall be less than eight (8) inches in diameter.
(b) Building sewers shall be a minimum of six (6) inches in diameter.
(c) Forcemain sewers shall be sized to provide, at design average flow, velocity in excess
of 2 feet per second. In no case shall forcemains be less than 4 inches (10.2 cm) in
diameter.
(d) Low pressure sewers shall be a minimum of 1-1/2 inches in diameter and be sized to
provide, at design average flow, velocity in excess of 2 feet per second.
Section 2. Depth of Sewer
(a) No building sewer shall have less than 4 feet cover over the crown of the pipe unless
approved by the Superintendent of the Sewer & Wastewater Division (See Exhibit D,
Figure 8). No sewer extensions or other public sewers shall have less than 5 feet
cover over the crown of the pipe unless approved by the Superintendent of the Sewer
& Wastewater Division. The Board of Public Works reserves the right to impose
special conditions on such approvals.
(b) When the vertical distance between the main line sewer and the building/house
service, at the location of the main line sewer, is greater than four (4) feet, a vertical
pipe riser (chimney connection) shall be used to connect the building/house service to
the main line sewer. (See Exhibit D)Alternative designs may be approved by the
Superintendent of the Sewer & Wastewater Division.
Section 3. Slope
(a) All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing
full, of not less than 2.0 feet per second, based on Manning's formula using an "n"
value of 0.013. Use of other "n" values may be permitted if deemed justifiable on the
basis of research or field data presented. The following are the minimum slope (S)
which should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable:
17
Minimum Slope in Feet
Sewer Size Per 100 Feet____ S
6 inch 2.0 (1/4" per foot) 0.0200
8 inch 0.40 0.0040
10 inch 0.28 0.0028
12 inch 0.22 0.0022
14 inch 0.17 0.0017

21 inch 0.10 0.0010
24 inch 0.08 0.0008
(b) For all new gravity sewer main lines, the last section of the line shall be design to
have a flow rate of 2 feet per second based on the estimated flows from the proposed
connections on the respective line. When further extension of the system is not
expected the actual flows for that line should be considered when design main line,
lower flows require increased slopes to maintain the 2 feet per second velocity. This
requirement shall be the sole discretion of the Superintendent of the Sewer &
Wastewater Division.
(b) Under special conditions, if detailed justification is presented, slopes slightly less than
those required for the 2.0 feet per second velocity when flowing full may be permitted.
Such decreased slopes will only be considered where the depth of flow will be 0.3 of
the diameter or greater for design average flow. Whenever such decreased slopes
are selected, the design engineer must furnish with the sewer design plans, a report
containing detailed justification for the decreased slopes and computations for the
depths of flow in such pipes at minimum, average, and daily or hourly rates of flow.
Decreased slopes may cause additional sewer maintenance expenses. The Board of
Public Works reserves the right to impose special conditions when decreased slopes
are approved.
(c) Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on 20 percent
slope or greater shall be anchored securely.

that inspection can be performed by sighting through the pipe from manhole to
manhole. Changes in grade or slope shall warrant the installation of manholes for
such transitions.
(b) Building sewer deflection may be permitted within the limitations of the pipe joint and
shall in no case exceed 5 degrees (5°). The use of elbows shall be required for
greater deflection. No elbow shall be used which is greater than a 45 degree angle.
Two 45 degree elbows may be used provide a minimum (2) two foot straight section
of pipe is used between each elbow.
Section 6. Manholes (See Exhibit C, C-1, C-2)
(a) Location: Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line; at all changes in grade,
size or alignment; at all intersections; and distances not greater than 300 feet.

entering a manhole at an elevation of 24 inches or more above the manhole invert.
Where the difference in elevation between the incoming sewer and the manhole invert
is less than 24 inches, the invert should be filleted to prevent solids deposition. For
larger sewers where this would be impracticable, the invert of the manhole shall be so
constructed so that there is a smooth transition of flow in the manhole.
Outside drop pipe shall be the preferred method of installation. The drop shall be
secured in placed with a minimum of 12- inches of cement on all sides, below and

sewer installation. All requirements of these utilities in the form of, and not limited to,
fees, permits and repair methods shall be met. The Town of Pepperell utilities are not
registered under "Dig-Safe" therefore notification of each utility not covered by "Dig-
Safe" is required.
Section 2. General Requirements
(a) All excavations required for building sewers and public sewers shall be open trench
work unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent of the Sewer & Wastewater
Division. Pipe laying and backfill shall be done in accordance with the standard
practice to provide proper support, drainage, and freedom from rock damage in
backfilling. No backfill shall be placed until the pipe has been inspected by the
Superintendent of the Sewer & Wastewater Division or his designated inspector.
(b) Before excavation is started, the bituminous or concrete street surface shall be cut
vertically in a line parallel to the center line of construction, and slightly wider than the
trench width, using an approved hand or power operated tool, so as to allow for trench
excavation without further disturbing the surface on either side of the trench. All
excavation shall be of sufficient width and depth with proper allowance for sheathing
and bracing.

Proctor) at optimum moisture content.
(d) Where the excavation is close to existing underground structures or utilities, the
29
excavation shall be dug by hand to insure against damage of utilities or against
disturbing load bearing soil.
Section 5. Dewatering Trenches
(a) The trenches and all other excavations shall be kept entirely free of water at all times
until the sewers are laid, backfilled and tested and all other structures are finished
ready for operation. Sand, silt, and debris entering the building sewer, sewer
extensions or other public sewer due to improper removal of water or by neglect of the
work shall be removed. During excavation the installed pipe shall be capped at all
times to prevent the entrance of groundwater, silt, mud, debris, and overflow of septic
tanks, dry wells, leach fields, storm drains and any other inflow.
Section 6. Excavation Support
(a) Furnish, put in place, and maintain such sheeting, shoring and bracing, as may be
required to support the sides of the excavation and to prevent any movement which
could in any way injure the work, cause safety hazard, diminish the necessary width of
trenches or other excavations, or otherwise delay the work or endanger adjacent
structures.
(b) All sheeting, shoring and bracing shall be of the sizes and strength needed to properly
support the superimposed loads and to prevent any movement, displacement or
settlement of adjacent structures, properties and utilities, pursuant to OSHA

such a manner as to prevent the material in back of the sheeting from running under
the sheeting and into the excavation. Care shall be taken to prevent voids outside of
the sheeting, but if voids are formed, they shall be immediately filled and well
compacted. Sheeting shall not cross the pipe line nor shall it be driven to such a
depth at manholes that it will bear upon the pipe.
(d) Sheeting shall not unnecessarily be driven below the sewer invert. But where this is
necessary, it shall not be removed, but cut two (2) feet higher than the top of the pipe
and left in place.
(e) The sheeting, shoring, bracing or parts thereof, shall be left in place after the
completion of the work in locations where necessary to support existing structures. All
sheathing which is left in place shall be cut off at least two (2) feet below the surface.
(f) Lumber removed may not be reused.
30
(g) The Superintendent of the Sewer & Wastewater Division has the right to order
sheeting and bracing installed and/or left in place, but this shall not be construed as
creating any obligation on his part to issue such orders, and his failure to exercise his
right to do so shall not relieve the excavating contractor from liability for damages to
persons or property occurring from or upon the work occasioned by negligence or
otherwise growing out of a failure on the part of the excavating contractor to install or
leave in place in the excavation, sufficient sheeting and bracing to prevent any caving
or moving of the ground adjacent to the sides of the excavation.

required. Any structure for which such a connection is to be made must be done
in accordance with Water Division regulations and all costs paid for by the owner.
Connection fees for lines dedicated only for a fire protection system will also be
determined by the diameter of the pipe that connects the structure to the main
line.
If an existing water line must be extended to provide access for a service connection,

PEPPERELL WATER DIVISION
RULES & REGULATIONS
systems, plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems; and to provide for the
maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control which will
systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable
water systems from cross connections.
As provided in the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, Public Law 93-523, and
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Drinking water regulations, 310 CMR 22.22,
Cross Connections; the Town has the primary responsibility for preventing water from
unapproved sources or any other substances from entering the public water system.
The Pepperell Water Division is responsible for the protection of the public potable
water supply from contamination or pollution due to backflow or backsiphonage of
contaminants or pollutants through a potable water service connection. If as a result of
a survey of the premises, the Water Division determines that an approved backflow
prevention device is required at the Town’s water service connection or as inplant
protection on any consumer’s premises, for the safety of the potable water supply, the
Water Division shall give notice in writing to said consumer to install approved
backflow prevention device(s) as required. The consumer, shall within the time frame
determined by the Water Division, install by a licensed plumber such approved
backflow prevention device(s) at the consumer’s expense.
Failure, refusal, or inability to install said device(s) within the specified time shall
constitute grounds for shutting off water to the premises until such device(s) has been
properly installed and any fines or charges for shutting off and turning on water have
been paid.
No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the
Pepperell Water Division unless the water supply is protected as required by
Massachusetts 310 CMR 22.22 and this Regulation. Service of water to any premises
shall be discontinued by the Water Division if a backflow prevention device required
by this Regulation is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a
backflow prevention device has been removed, by-passed, or if an unprotected cross
connection exists on the premises. Service shall not be restored until such conditions
or defects are corrected.
In the case of a premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable
substances are handled, in the opinion of the Pepperell Water Division, in such a
fashion as to create an actual or potential health hazard to the public water supply, the
public water supply shall be protected against backflow from the premises by requiring
the consumer to install approved backflow prevention device(s) in the service line as to
provide containment protection.
The location of each approved backflow prevention device with respect to the
plumbing on the premises and the service connection to the premises shall be based
upon the degree of existing or potentially existing health hazard, and shall conform to

required to install and maintain an approved backflow prevention device for building
containment. This device shall be installed immediately downstream of the water
meter or at the point of service entrance, as so there are no draw-offs or tee’s upstream
of said device.
All backflow prevention devices required by Massachusetts 310 CMR 22.22 shall be
tested as required in 310 CMR 22.22 (9) (d). In those instances where the Pepperell
Water Division deems the hazard to be great enough, the Water Division may require
certified inspections at more frequent intervals.
The Consumer shall be responsible for applying for and obtaining all necessary
approvals and permits for the maintenance of cross connections and installation of
backflow prevention devices, and applying annually to Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection for the renewal of each permit.
All decisions relating to the determination of backflow devices with regards to the
Cross Connection Program will be made by the Pepperell Water Division. Failure to
comply with any directive from the Water Division will result in termination of water
service.
All costs for inspections, tests, and other Water Division activities resulting from the
implementation and operation of the Cross Connection Program shall be the
responsibility of the consumer.

devices will be tested by the Pepperell Water Division or a authorized representative.

conducted within 10 days of installation or repair. Failure to follow this procedure will
result in water service termination.
35. All fire protection systems connected to the town’s water supply must be protected

the proposed modification will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure
to the neighborhood.

SECTION 7000. SPECIAL RESIDENTIAL REGULATIONS
7100. OPEN SPACE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
7110. Purpose. The purposes of this open space residential development section are:
? To allow for greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential developments;
? To encourage the permanent preservation of open space, agricultural land, wildlife habitat, other natural resources
such as aquifers, water bodies and wetlands, and historical and archeological resources in a manner that is
consistent with Pepperell’s Comprehensive Plan and Open Space and Recreation Plan;
? To minimize the total amount of disturbance on sites undergoing development;
? To facilitate the construction and maintenance of housing, streets, utilities and public services in a more economic
and efficient manner.
? To preserve and enhance the community character;
? To preserve and protect significant agricultural land and land with high value agricultural soils;
? To protect existing and potential community water supplies;
? To provide for a diversified housing stock including providing affordable housing to persons of low and moderate
income.
7120. Definitions.
Basic Maximum Number: The number of dwelling units that would be allowed on a site using the standard zoning
bylaw provisions and/or subdivision rules and regulations as determined by the yield analysis performed for thespecial
permit plan.
Common Open Space: Land that is set aside for protection from development in perpetuity, usually left in its natural
state, for the purposes of natural resource conservation, wildlife habitat, water supply protection, passive recreation
and other amenities in conformance with the provisions of this section.
Density Bonus: Additional dwelling units that may be awarded beyond the basic maximum number, as determined
through the special permit plan and yield analysis, for the provision of affordable housing units, the setting aside of
additional open space beyond the minimum amount required, green stormwater systems or low-impact development
and open space that is integrated into a wider network of protected land in the town.
Major Subdivisions: Major subdivisions are those creating 5 (five) or more lots or residential units, whether for single
family or multi-family development.
Yield Analysis: An analysis, based on the conceptual conventional plan described in section 7150, which determines
the basic maximum number of lots and dwelling units that would be possible to develop in a conventional manner
following all applicable Pepperell zoning and regulatory requirements.
7130. Applicability. To be eligible for consideration as an OSRD, the parcel of land or group of contiguous parcels located
within the Rural Residence, Town Residence and Recreation Residence districts or any zones of the Water Resource
Town of Pepperell 29 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
Protection Overlay District (WRPOD) must contain a minimum of ten (10) acres. Where the parcel or group of
contiguous parcels is located in the Suburban Residence or Urban Residence districts, the total acreage necessary for an
OSRD shall be five (5) acres. Additional criteria for eligibility include:
? To be eligible for consideration as an OSRD, the parcel may be a subdivision or a division of land pursuant to
G.L. c.41, sec.81P provided, however, an OSRD may also be permitted when the property is held in
condominium, cooperative ownership or other form where the property is not subdivided, which in some cases
will require a special permit or site plan application for multi-family development.
? Each lot created in the OSRD shall have adequate access on a public way or approved subdivision road.
? To facilitate the goals of the Pepperell Comprehensive Plan and Open Space and Recreation Plan, all major
subdivisions (those creating 5 (five) or more lots or residential units) and multi-family special permit
developments shall be presented to the Planning Board as Open Space Residential Developments in compliance
with the provisions of this section. In all cases it shall be assumed that an OSRD is necessary to meet the purposes
of this section, unless the contrary is demonstrated by the applicant to the satisfaction of the Pepperell Planning
Board. In cases where the Planning Board determines that a parcel(s) is unsuited to development as an OSRD, it
may waive the requirements of this section and permit the subdivision or multi-family special permit plan to be
developed in a conventional manner subject to the Pepperell subdivision rules and regulations. An applicant
proposing a minor subdivision (those creating four or fewer lots or units) may develop an OSRD at his/her option.
7140. Permitted Uses. Each lot exclusive of the open land shall be used for residential dwellings of the type permitted or
allowed by special permit in the applicable zoning district. These lots shall be grouped in clusters, and within each
cluster the lots shall be contiguous.
Accessory uses shall be allowed appurtenant thereto as provided in the residential district in which the land is located,
with the exception of the keeping of nondomestic animals; and the use as a customary home occupation, as defined in
this chapter, shall be further limited, prohibiting any employees who do not reside within the dwelling unit, any retail
sales and any business signs.
Common open spaces may be used for noncommercial active and passive recreation, conservation, forestry,
agriculture and natural buffers and may contain structures necessary to approved uses, utilities and other
facilities necessary for the convenience and enjoyment of the residents, subject to approval by the Planning Board as
part of the decision on the special permit or as amendment to the special permit after it has been issued.
In order to diversify the Town’s housing stock and allow for opportunities to provide affordable housing and save
additional open space, a small number of duplexes and /or multi-family residential structures are permitted within
OSRDs, provided they meet all provisions of this OSRD Bylaw, the multifamily residential development requirements
of section 7300, the general special permit criteria of section 9300 and all State of Massachusetts Title 5 and local
health requirements. In any OSRD, no greater than 10% of the total number of lots, including those that may be
permitted under a density bonus per section 7180, can contain duplexes and/or multi-family residential structures
where permitted in the underlying districts. All calculations shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
Lots containing duplexes and/or multi-family residential structures may not be contiguous within any one
subdivision or OSRD development.
7150. Procedure.
Overview of Procedure. For applicable parcels, an OSRD is authorized in three steps; the first of which is optional: 1.
Pre-application conference with the Planning Board and/or other Town boards and committees as described below; 2.
submittal, review and approval of an OSRD special permit plan by the Planning Board, followed by; 3. submittal,
review and approval of a definitive subdivision plan, or site plan, as the case may be, in conformity with the OSRD
special permit as approved by the Planning Board.
If the OSRD involves construction of a new subdivision road, the level of engineering detail required at the special
permit stage of review is the same as for a preliminary subdivision plan that meets the Town of Pepperell subdivision
regulations. An approved definitive subdivision (or site) plan that does provide adequate engineering detail, however,
is required prior to the start of any construction and the issuance of building permits for lots / units within the
development.
Special Permit Procedures. Applicants for an OSRD special permit shall follow the special permit rules and
regulations established by the Pepperell Planning Board in section 9300 of the Town of Pepperell ZoningBylaw.
Town of Pepperell 30 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
Pre-Application Conference. Applicants seeking a special permit for an OSRD are encouraged to request a preapplication
conference or conferences with the Planning Board, department heads and/or other boards as appropriate,
to review the scope of the project and the site for which it is proposed. At a minimum, the intent of the preapplication
conference shall be to:
Identify the key natural features of the site.
? Identify the historic and cultural resources of the site and surrounding area.
? Identify any safety, traffic, or infrastructure issues related to the site and its surrounding area.
? Identify existing trails on the site or on abutting parcels, and any connections thereto.
? Identify areas that the Town prefers to see protected as open space, viewsheds, wildlife habitat, forestry
operations or agricultural uses.
? Discuss the proposed plan and any issues relative to the concept plan Special Permit criteria.
? Discuss any design issues relative to this Bylaw and the Planning Board’s requirements for definitive subdivision
or site plans.
? Assist the developer in understanding the permitting process and issues relative to OSRD.
? Set a timetable for the special permit and definitive plan review processes.
? Schedule a site visit with the Planning Board and other land-use boards, as appropriate.
Site Visit. The Planning Board and/or its designee(s), along with members from all interested boards anddepartments,
may conduct a site visit prior to or during the special permit public hearing. At the site visit, the Planning Board or its
designee(s) shall be accompanied by the applicant and/or its agent(s). With the applicant’s permission, interested
members of the public may be invited to the site visit.
If a quorum of the Planning Board is anticipated to be present at the site visit, the site visit must be properly noticed
per the requirements of MGL Chapter 39, Sec. 23a-24.
Preferred Design Process. Each OSRD special permit applicant should follow a design process similar to that outlined
below. When the plan is submitted, the applicant(s) shall be prepared to demonstrate to the Planning Board that this
design process was substantially complied with in determining the proposed layout of open space, streets, house lots
and other features of the OSRD.
? Understanding the site. The first step is to inventory existing site features, taking care to identify sensitive and
noteworthy natural, scenic and cultural resources of the site, and to determine the connection of these important
features to each other and similar features on abutting properties, if any.
? Evaluating site context. The second step is to evaluate the site in its larger context by identifying natural (e.g.
streams, wetlands, steep slopes), transportation (e.g. roads, woods roads, trails), and cultural (e.g. historic and
recreational sites) connections to surrounding land uses and activities.
? Designating the contiguous open space. The third step is to identify the contiguous open space to be preserved on
the site. Such open space should include the most sensitive and noteworthy resources on the site, and, where
appropriate, areas that serve to extend existing networks of open space or land protected under easements.
? Location of building sites and development areas. The fourth step is to locate building sites, parking areas, paths
and other features of the built environment.
? Roads and Lot Lines: The final step is to choose road alignments and driveway locations and then draw lot lines
around each proposed building lot, which also serves to delineate the open space areas described in section 7160
of this Bylaw.
Submission Requirements. In addition to the information required by the Pepperell Special Permit rules and
regulations, the following additional information shall be submitted as part of a special permit application:
Special Permit concept plans. For any application for an Open Space Residential Development, the applicant shall
prepare two sets of concept plans for the parcel of land to be subdivided or otherwise developed. One plan shall
describe a conventional subdivision or development while the second shall describe an Open Space Residential
Development.
Town of Pepperell 31 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
The principle component of the concept plan is a schematic representation of the proposed development, with
sufficient detail about existing and proposed conditions to enable the Planning Board and the public to understand what
is being proposed and to be able to respond to the applicant’s proposals in an informed manner. This information will
also be used by the Planning Board in determining the number of permissible lots.
The concept plans shall include scaled drawings by a registered land surveyor, civil engineer or landscape architect.
The concept plans shall be used by the Planning Board in determining the number of lots that would be possible were
the parcel to be subdivided in a conventional manner, as well as the general features of the OSRD.
Special permit concept plans shall contain the following information, as well as that required in Appendix B of the
Special Permit rules and regulations, unless the need for such is specifically waived by the Planning Board after
request by the applicant. At a minimum, the concept plans shall also provide the following information:
? The location of the proposed development. A locus map shall be provided showing the location of the
development in relation to the entire town at a scale of one inch equals 1,000 feet.
? Parcel boundaries, north arrow, date, legend, title and scale.
? The size of the parcel(s) being subdivided in acres and square feet.
? The names of the record owner, applicant and the name of the designer or surveyor.
? The existing and proposed lines of streets, ways, easements, and any public areas within the subdivision in a
general manner.
? Any zoning district boundaries.
? The names and addresses of all abutters, as determined from the most recent tax list.
? Photographs of the site at a variety of locations, focusing on possible building sites, unique natural and scenic
areas and areas to be set aside as open space. The location of these photographs should be identified on the plan.
? A description of the environmental and natural features of the site, focusing on those features intended for
preservation through permanently protected open space.
? The acreage, percentage of the entire parcel and proposed uses of the open space.
? The total number and approximate locations of the proposed buildings, dwelling units and/or lots.
? Topography / contour lines at an interval of two feet.
? A statement on the disposition or manner of ownership of the proposed open space.
? A delineation of jurisdictional wetland resource areas and their buffer zones subject to the Massachusetts
Wetlands Protection Act. All resource area flag locations shall be numbered and placed on the plan. The
delineation of all wetland resource areas shall be certified by the Pepperell Conservation Commission.
? A general mapping of soil types from existing data sources, such as the Natural Resource Conservation Services
(formerly the Soils Conservation Service).
? Lot boundaries with their approximate areas and frontage dimensions, or unit placement and all proposed
common and open space areas.
? Location and extent of all parking, landscaping, stormwater management, water supply and wastewater
management service areas that would be required to accommodate all the units in the development proposal.
? If available, the location and results of any test pit investigations for soil profiles percolation rates and
determination of seasonal high water tables.
? A general description of how drainage will be handled, including a soils statement (soil conservation survey is
acceptable) and the general area of the site to be used for stormwater management facilities, including whether
low impact development (LID) techniques are proposed.
? Surface water, bordering vegetated wetlands and flood hazard area data using the FIRM or Raytheon information,
as applicable, demonstrating that each such conventional lot has viable frontage access on a public way without
reliance on a common drive.
Town of Pepperell 32 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
? Draft of the proposal for the open space for Planning Board approval that includes a provision for maintenance
which permits assessments upon individual owners in the event of a default by the organization.
? Drafts of any covenants running with the land, easements or grants which shall be enforceable by the town and/or
subsequent owners of the land or buildings and which will oblige in a like manner subsequent holders of all orpart
of the applicants’ interest.
? After an OSRD concept plan has been submitted, no tree removal, no utility installation, no ditching, grading or
construction of roads, no grading of land or lots, no excavation, except for purposes of soil testing, no dredging
and no construction of buildings or structures shall be done on any part of the site until a definitive subdivision or
site plan if applicable) for such development has been approved by the Pepperell Planning Board.
Number of Lots/Units. The basic maximum number of lots and dwelling units shown on the Open Space Residential
Development special permit concept plan shall not exceed the number of lots and dwelling units which could
reasonably be expected to be developed under a conventional plan in full conformance with all applicable zoning,
subdivision and/or site plan regulations, the Wetlands Protection Act and codes of the Town of Pepperell,
notwithstanding any density bonus that may be awarded per section 7180. The Planning Board shall use the concept
plans described in section 7150 as guidance in determining the basic maximum number of OSRD lots and units. After
reviewing all pertinent information, the Planning Board shall make a finding as to the basic maximum number of lots
and dwelling units in the OSRD. The basic maximum number of lots and dwelling units is based on the number of lots
and dwelling units that can be created without zoning variances or waivers from the subdivision or site plan
regulations.
The number of lots and dwelling units will be specified in the special permit and reflected in the definitive subdivision
or site plan that follows the granting of the special permit.
Design Standards and Dimensional Requirements. The following design standards and dimensional requirementsshall
apply in an OSRD.
? There shall be adequate, safe and convenient arrangement of roadways, driveways, pedestrian and other open
areas to provide access for emergency vehicles to reach all buildings and structures at all times.
? Each lot shall be of a size and shape to provide a building site, which shall be in harmony with the natural terrain
and other features of the land and provide adequate allowance for future accessory buildings or structures. In no
instance shall any of the dimensional controls be reduced below the following table of minimum requirements.
? The nature of the soils and subsoils shall be suited for the intended purposes. This determination shall focus upon,
but shall not be limited to, the location, design and construction of access ways, buildings, septic systems and
surface water drainage systems. Soil borings or test pits shall be required prior to the issuance of any building
permits, unless waived by the Planning Board, to provide information on soil texture, color, percolation rates and
depth to the groundwater table at its maximum elevation.
? Wherever possible and at the discretion of the Planning Board, a 50-foot wide no-disturbance buffer shall be
provided around the entire perimeter of the site. This 50-foot buffer does count towards the minimum required
amount of protected open space, subject to the limitations of section 7160.

Minimum front yard 25 feet 25 feet 25 feet
Note: Lots with duplexes (two attached dwelling units) or multifamily units shall require twice the minimum lot area as
specified above for single family lots and must comply with all provisions of section 7300, Multifamily Residential
Development, of the Pepperell Zoning Bylaw. All other dimensional requirements for duplex and multi-family lots are
unchanged from the underlying zoning.
? Streets shall be designed and located in such a manner as to maintain and preserve natural topography, significant
landmarks, and trees; to avoid wetland crossings, if possible; to minimize cuts and fills; and to preserve and
enhance views and vistas on or off the subject parcel. If the street is to become a public way, all Town ofPepperell
design and engineering standards pertaining to new subdivision roads, as described in the Subdivision Rules and
Regulations, must be followed.
? The Planning Board shall require connection, at the applicant's expense, of the OSRD to the municipal sewerage
system when available. For purposes of this requirement, municipal sewerage shall be deemed available when a
line comes within a reasonable distance from an access street to the site. Factors which will be used in
determining if public sewer is available within a reasonable distance shall include, but are not limited to, theactual
distance, the capacity of the existing line, topography, grade from the site to the public sewer, size of the
development, effective density of development, ability to obtain easements, permits or license to traverse land of
others, environmental constraints and correlation with the Sewer Commission Master Plan.
? The applicant shall submit calculations for a surface water drainage design based on a twenty-five year storm
event performed and certified by a registered professional civil engineer demonstrating that the anticipated storm
water runoff from the site shall not exceed peak runoff from the site prior to development. Culverts shall be
designed on the basis of a fifty year storm with consideration being given to damage avoidance for a one hundred
year storm. Drainage and stormwater calculations shall be performed by a registered professional engineer and
shall conform to the Town of Pepperell Planning Board Rules and Regulations governing the subdivision of land.
? The site shall be preserved in its natural state, as it exists at the time of application, insofar as practicable, by
minimizing tree and soil removal until the definitive plan has been approved. Any grade changes shall be in
keeping with the general appearance of the neighboring developed areas. The orientation of individual building
sites shall be such as to maintain maximum natural topography, plant cover and solar access. Topography, tree
cover, surface water buffers and natural drainage ways shall be treated as fixed determinants of road and lot
configuration rather than as malleable elements that can be changed to follow a preferred development scheme.
? All main service lines for water, sewer and utilities shall be underground.
? Open Space Residential Developments within the Water Resource Protection Overlay District (WRPOD)
? Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8130. WRPOD Use Regulations, and Appendix A, Table of
Principle Uses, of the Pepperell Zoning Bylaw, single-family homes on lots not less than 40,000 sq.ft. and
duplexes and/or multifamily residential structures on lots not less than 80,000 sq.ft., are permitted within the
Well Protection and Aquifer and Watershed Protection Zones of the Water Resource Protection Overlay
District (WRPOD), provided the following standards can be met to the satisfaction of the Planning Board and
Pepperell Board of Health:
? All new sewage disposal systems within the above mentioned WRPOD must provide enhanced nitrogen
removal to protect public health and safety as well as the environment. The system owner is required toinstall
a recirculating sand filter or equivalent alternative technology or to obtain a groundwater discharge permit in
accordance with 314 CMR 5.00 and 6.00. Full compliance with the provisions of 310 CMR 15.000, which
includes enhanced nitrogen removal, is presumed to protect the public health, safety, welfare and the
environment. Specific site or design conditions, however, may require that additional criteria be met in order
to achieve the purpose and /or intent of 310 CMR 15.000.
7160. Common Open Space. All land identified as open space in section 7150 of this Bylaw shall be set aside as common
open space, and this land shall be preserved in essentially its natural condition. An OSRD must provide at least 40% of
the total tract area as permanently protected open space. The common land shall be, to the extent practical, adequately
distributed throughout the parcel so that it is accessible to residential lots without crossing through private property and
separates residential lots from abutting properties. Though the open space will be primarily protected for its natural
resource and wildlife habitat values, a small area, totaling no more than 10% of the required open space, may be set
aside as a playground or other area for “active” recreation by the residents and/or the town, depending on the ownership
of the open space as discussed below. The location and size of such active recreational area(s) shall be approved by the
Town of Pepperell 34 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
Planning Board prior to final action on the plan.
The following lands shall not constitute more than fifty percent (50%) of the minimum required common open space:
? Lands identified as wetland resource areas in accordance with G.L. c. 131, s. 40;
? Lands with slopes greater than twenty-five percent (25%)
? Lands within the 100 year floodplain as shown on F.I.R.M. maps.
Further subdivision of common open land or its use for other than recreation, conservation or agriculture, except for
easements for underground utilities, shall be prohibited. Structures or buildings accessory to recreation, conservation
or agricultural uses may be erected, provided that there shall be a minimum setback of one hundred (100) feet
between any common open space structures and all property lines on the site, and provided that the total of
impervious surfaces shall not exceed ten percent coverage of the total area of the common open land. Existing rights
of way and utility easements may not be counted towards the required percentage of minimum open space.
Stormwater management and shared septic and well systems may be located within the common open space when
necessary, provided such systems meet all applicable state and local codes, and are approved by the Pepperell
Planning Board and Board of Health. The Planning Board may require that such utilities be covered by a utility or
access easement. The area devoted to shared septic and large surface stormwater systems, such as retention and
detention ponds, shall not, however, qualify towards the minimum required amount of open space.
The design of the common land shall provide for linkage with existing or future planned open space lands in abutting
developments or in publicly owned or controlled open space lands, and shall be planned as large contiguous units
whenever possible, with strips or narrow parcels (fifteen foot minimum width) only permitted when necessary for
access or as vegetated buffers along the site's perimeter, and may be in more than one (1) parcel, provided that thesize,
shape and location of such parcels are suitable for the designated uses. Contiguous shall be defined as beingconnected.
Open space will still be considered connected if it is separated by a roadway or accessory amenity.
Ownership and Management of the Open Space. The land set aside as common open land shall be owned and/or
managed by one (1) of the following arrangements, as shall be determined by the Planning Board:
? Conveyed to an association, corporation or trust owned or to be owned by the owners of lots within the
development. If such association is utilized, ownership thereof shall pass with conveyances of the lots in
perpetuity.
? Conveyed to the town, at no cost, and accepted by it for park or open space use. Such conveyance shall be at the
option of the town and shall require the acceptance of the land by the Conservation Commission and the approval
of the Board of Selectmen.
? Conveyed to a nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the conservation or preservation of open
space.
? In any case where such land is not conveyed to the town, a conservation restriction, enforceable by the town
under MGL Ch. 184, Sections 31-33, shall be required ensuring that such land shall be kept in an open or natural
state and not be built upon for residential use or developed for uses such as parking or roadways. Such restrictions
shall further provide for maintenance for the common land in a manner which will ensure its suitability for its
function, the appearance, cleanliness, proper maintenance of drainage utilities and the like, and empower the town
to perform maintenance in the event of failure to comply with the program, and including a provision that the
owners of lots or units within the cluster development shall pay the cost thereof and that the cost shall constitute a
lien upon their properties until said cost has been paid. This restriction shall be recorded within sixty (60) days of
the granting of the special permit, unless the sixty day time limit is waived and extended to a date certain by the
Planning Board, or the special permit shall be null and void.
7170. Decision. In addition to the findings required by the Pepperell Special Permit rules and regulations, the Planning
Board shall consider the following criteria and make the following additional findings for any OSRD:
? The reduction in dimensional controls will result in improved protection of natural and scenic resources.
? The application includes a program satisfactory to the Planning Board describing how the common open space will
be maintained in perpetuity.
Town of Pepperell 35 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
? The degree to which the design and layout of the OSRD is better than a conventional development in preserving
open space for conservation and recreation, preserving natural features of the land, achieving more efficient
provision of streets, utilities and other public services, and providing a high degree of design quality.
? The degree to which the OSRD promotes permanent preservation of open spaces, natural landscapes and vistas,
agricultural land, forestry land, existing and proposed trails, other natural resources including water bodies,
wetlands and drinking water source areas, and historic and archeological resources.
? The degree to which the OSRD achieves sustainable design through a more efficient form of development that
consumes less land and conforms to existing topography and natural features as compared to a conventionalsubdivi
sion or comparable development.
? The degree to which the OSRD reduces the total amount of land disturbance and clearing on the site.
? The degree to which the OSRD furthers the goals and objectives of the Pepperell Master Plan, Affordable Housing
Plan, Open Space Plan and other planning documents, as determined by the Planning Board.
? The degree to which the OSRD and its supporting documentation complies with the provisions and sections of this
Bylaw.
? The Planning Board may find that the proposed location of the OSRD is better suited for a conventional
subdivision or land development, and therefore authorize the applicant to submit a conventional plan in
compliance with the Pepperell subdivision or site plan regulations.
? The degree to which the OSRD designed layout is not more detrimental than a conventional development in
protecting the water quality and quantity of Town wells.
Conditions.
? A special permit for OSRD granted by the Planning Board shall lapse, except for a good cause, two (2) years from
the date of issue unless a substantial part of the proposed construction work shall have been commenced and is
proceeding continuously toward completion. This two year period shall not include the time required to pursue or
await determination of an appeal referred to in G.L. c. 40A, s. 17. The recording of the special permit and
subsequently approved Definitive Plan shall constitute commencement of substantial use.
? At any time before, during or after the commencement of construction of the proposed development the special
permit may be amended by following the special permit procedures for the amendment.
? The Planning Board may impose a performance guaranty to insure construction in accordance with the plan.
? The Planning Board approval of a special permit hereunder shall not substitute for compliance with the
Subdivision Control Law nor oblige the Planning Board to approve a related definitive plan for subdivision.
Relationship between the Special Permit Plan and Definitive Subdivision or Site Plan. Any OSRD special permit
issued by the Planning Board shall specifically state that the subsequent definitive subdivision plan or site plan shall
substantially comply with the special permit concept plan in terms of the number of dwelling units, road and lotlayout,
open space percentage and layout, and stormwater management systems. If the Planning Board determines that the
definitive subdivision or site plan for the OSRD does not comply with the provisions of the special permit, the
Planning Board shall require the applicant to submit a revised subdivision plan that does comply with the provisions
and of the special permit, or to seek another special permit.
Any special permit for an OSRD that is granted by the Planning Board which shows a subdivision must be followed
by the submittal of a Definitive Subdivision Plan in accordance with the Subdivision Rules and Regulations of
the Town of Pepperell. The OSRD Special Permit shall be reconsidered if there is substantial variation between the
Definitive Subdivision Plan and the Special Permit Plan.
If the Planning Board finds that a substantial variation exists, it shall hold a public hearing on the modifications to the
Special Permit plan. A substantial variation will be found to exist when any of the following conditions apply:
? An increase in the number of building lots and/or dwelling units;
? A significant decrease in the open space acreage or percentage;
? A significant change in the lot layout or units placement;
Town of Pepperell 36 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
? A significant change in the general development pattern which adversely affects natural landscape features and
open space preservation;
? Significant changes to the stormwater management facilities; and/or
? Significant changes to the wastewater management systems.
Planning Board Regulations. The Pepperell Planning Board may adopt regulations to assist in the administration of
this OSRD Bylaw. These regulations may address, but not be limited to, the following considerations: plan
submittal requirements, provisions for combined special permit and subdivision hearings, site landscaping and
buffering standards, open space use restrictions, architectural design, low impact development and other site specific
planning features. Failure of the Planning Board to adopt such regulations shall not serve to invalidate any provisions
of this Bylaw.
Waivers from the Provisions of this Bylaw
The Planning Board may waive strict compliance with any of the provisions of this section when, it its judgment,
doing so is in keeping with the spirit and intent of this section, is in the public interest and is not inconsistent with
the Pepperell Zoning Bylaw.
7180. Bonuses for Additional Open Space and Affordable Housing. The Planning Board may award a density bonus to
increase the number of dwelling units beyond the basic maximum allowed as determined through the yield analysis,
which equals the number of dwelling units that could be developed in a conventional manner. The density bonus for the
OSRD shall not, in the aggregate, exceed 20% (twenty percent) of the basic maximum number. Computations for all
density bonuses shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Density bonuses are not allowed within the water
resource protection overlay districts (WRPODs) because of the overriding necessity of protecting such areas from
undue encroachment and the risk of groundwater contamination. A density bonus may be awarded in the following
circumstances:
? For each additional ten percent (10%) of the site (over and beyond the required 40%) set aside as permanently
protected open space, a bonus of five percent (5%) of the basic maximum number of dwelling units may be
awarded.
? For every two (2) dwelling units restricted in perpetuity to occupancy by Moderate-Income Households, or for
every one (1) dwelling unit restricted in perpetuity to occupancy by Low-Income Households, one (1) market rate
dwelling may be added to the basic maximum number of dwelling units. Affordable housing units may be used
toward density bonuses only if they can be counted towards the Town’s affordable housing inventory as
determined by the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development. The applicant shall
provide documentation demonstrating that the unit(s) shall count towards the community’s affordable housing
inventory to the satisfaction of the Planning Board.
? Bonus for Low Impact Development and Innovative / Environmentally-progressive land development techniques
? The Planning Board may award a density bonus for OSRDs that use Low-Impact Development (LID) /
Better Site Design Practices for stormwater management in place of the standard structural methods
such as detention basins and piped systems. LID or “soft” or “green” stormwater management systems
use vegetative and small, decentralized building lot scale systems to decrease impervious surfaces and
encourage the infiltration of clean water into the ground. When the Planning Board determines that an
OSRD is proposing a well planned LID system, it may award one additional market rate or affordable
housing unit to the basic maximum number of units.
? The Planning Board may also award one additional market rate or affordable housing unit over the basic
maximum number when it finds that the OSRD plan is most effective in connecting or linking its open
space to existing conservation or open space lands in Pepperell that are permanently protected from
development.
7190. Severability. If any provision of this Bylaw is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the
bylaw shall not be affected thereby. The invalidity of any section or sections of this bylaw shall not affect the validity
of the remainder of the Pepperell Zoning Bylaws.
7200. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
7210. General. On parcels of at least one hundred twenty thousand (120,000) square feet, the Planning Board may

permanent marker of engraved granite not greater than six (6) square feet in area shall be placed at the
end of the driveway entrance to the multifamily development where it meets the public way and shall contain
the diagram of the addresses of the properties as designated by the Board of Assessors. A similar, but smaller,
marker shall be placed where the driveway meets the individual dwelling driveway and at any location where
the driveway may split to access more than one dwelling. All driveways and parking areas for the designed
multifamily development shall be paved to a total thickness of three (3) inches with two courses of
bituminous concrete.
7330. Open Space Open space and common land, if any, shall be laid out in such manner as to tend to assure compliance
with the foregoing standards, to provide for pedestrian safety within the site and to provide an aesthetically pleasant
setting for the multifamily residential development within its neighborhood. Such open space land shall meet the
Town of Pepperell 38 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
ownership, maintenance and conservation easement requirements as provided for an open space residential
development under this chapter.
7335. Affordable Housing. All multifamily developments which will result in the creation of six (6) or more detached
single family dwelling units on the site designated as the multifamily development shall require at least 10% of the
units, and in no case, less than one unit, be priced for qualified affordable housing purchase as defined by the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
7340. Planning Board Action Before acting upon the application, the Board shall submit it with the plan to the following
boards, which may review it jointly or separately: Board of Health, Highway Surveyor, Conservation Commission,
Police Chief, Board of Fire Engineers, Water Department and Sewer Commission. The Planning Board shall grant
such special permit only when it determines that all of the standards for special permits contained in Section 9300 are
met and the requirements set forth herein.
7341. Planning Board approval of a special permit hereunder shall not substitute for compliance with the
Subdivision Control Act, nor oblige the Planning Board to approve any related plan for subdivision, nor
reduce any time periods for Board consideration under the law. However, in order to facilitate processing,
the Planning Board may, insofar as practical under existing law, accept a combined plan and application which
shall satisfy both this section and the Board’s regulations under the Subdivision Control Act.
7350. Conditions. Where a special permit for multifamily residential development is granted which is not subject to
subdivision control, the Planning Board shall impose all or such part of its subdivision control requirements as it
deems advisable as conditions upon its permit, including but not limited to the construction of roads and driveways,
drainage facilities and other facilities and utilities, and shall require a bond or covenant in the manner prescribed in the
subdivision regulations to secure performance of the entire plan for multifamily residential development as approved
for special permit.
7400. TRAILERS
7410. General No person shall use or permit to be used for dwelling purposes within the town any trailer or similar mobile
equipment, whether registered or unregistered, mobile or immobile, except that mobile trailers may be used for
temporary dwelling purposes, provided that such use is licensed by the Selectmen, said license to be applied for by the
occupant within three days after the unit is located in the town and with no license granted hereunder to be for a
period exceeding six calendar months.
7420. Preexisting Trailers. The above restrictions shall not apply to trailers which are presently or are hereafter placed in
any trailer park already in existence in the town or to any existing trailer presently being used for dwelling
purposes, which trailers shall be subject to and limited by licenses, if any, presently in effect.
7421. Such trailers may be replaced by a trailer not more than 20% larger in volume than the lawfully preexisting
trailer.
7500. REAR LOTS
7510. General In a Rural, Town Suburban or Recreational Residential District, a building and occupancy permit for one (1)
single family dwelling unit may be issued notwithstanding the minimum frontage requirements set forth in Section
4000, subject to the following conditions.
7520. Conditions
7521. The area of the lot upon which such dwelling unit is erected or to be erected shall exceed by at least two (2)
acres the minimum lot required in that district.

SECTION 8000. SPECIAL DISTRICTS
8100. WATER RESOURCE PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT (WRPOD)
8110. Purpose The intent of the Water Resource Protection Overlay District (WRPOD) is to protect the current and future
groundwater supplies of the town by regulating activities, which could generate contaminants resulting in degradation
Town of Pepperell 39 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
of the groundwater. The WRPOD shall be considered as overlaying other zoning districts; regulation hereunder is in
addition to the requirements of the districts it overlays, and no use or dimension not permitted in the portions of the
districts so overlaid shall be permitted in the WRPOD. Location of each of the WRPOD zones are as shown on the
official Zoning Map of the Town of Pepperell as the same may be amended.
8120. WRPOD Zones. The WRPOD consists of three (3) zones as described below and the areas of these zones are
depicted on the Official Zoning Map of the Town of Pepperell. Resources utilized to define the WRPOD Zones
include the 1985 Phase II Hydrogeologic Investigations prepared for the Planning Board, Pepperell, Massachusetts,
February 1985 by SEA Consultants, Inc. and the State of Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection 310
CMR 22.00.
8121. Zone 1/Water Source Protection Zone (WSPZ): The Zone 1/WSPZ consists of a protective radius of 400
feet surrounding a public wellhead/water source. The Zone 1/WSPZ areas shall be owned in fee simple or
substantially controlled by the Town of Pepperell by recorded easement, lease, or other restriction and the
use of the Zone 1/WSPZ shall be for public water supply and accessory uses thereto only. The Zone 1/WSPZ
shall consist of five (5) areas depicted on the Official Zoning Map:
a. Jersey 1 Well
b. Jersey 2 Well
c. Bemis 1 Well
d. Bemis 2 Well
e. Nashua Road Well
8122. Zone 2/Well Protection Zone (WPZ): The Zone 2/WPZ consists of the area adjacent to the Zone 1/WSPZ

Map:
a. Jersey 1 & 2
b. Bemis 1 & 2
c. Nashua Road
8123. Zone 3/Aquifer-Watershed Protection Zone (AWPZ): The Zone 3/AWPZ consists of the area outside the
Zone 2/WPZ from which surface water and groundwater drain into the Zone 2/WPZ. The Zone 3/AWPZshall
consist of three areas depicted on the Official Zoning Map:
a. Jersey 1 & 2
b. Bemis 1 & 2
c. Nashua Road
8124. Boundary Appeals: If the location of the WRPOD boundary in relation to a particular parcel in any of the
zones within the WRPOD is in doubt the resolution of the dispute shall be through a Special Permit
application to the Special Permit Granting Authority. The Application shall be accompanied by adequate
documentation and the burden of proof shall be upon the owner of the land to show where the boundary
should be located. At the request and expense of the owner of the land, the SPGA may engage a professional

8140. Special Permit Granting Authority The Planning Board is hereby established as the special permit granting
authority for the purpose of granting relief from the requirements of the WRPOD and the Planning Board shall makeall
findings required for general or specific performance standards below. Findings under Section 9300 are not necessary
except that a finding shall be made that the residence or other structure to be constructed shall have sufficient access
to utilities and other necessary public services.
8150. General Performance Standards All construction shall be in accordance with the following conditions:
8151. Swimming Pools. Should it be necessary at any time to empty the water from the pool, the water shall be left
untreated and exposed to sunlight for a period of three days prior to its being released into the soils at the
site.
8152. Any toxic materials, such as paint, swimming pool treatment and cleaning solutions or other material defined
as hazardous shall be stored in sealed containers and kept in a toxic material storage enclosure when not in
use. Adequate precautions shall be taken to ensure that a spill of any toxic materials in use at the site or
stored within the enclosure will not leach into the surrounding soil. If the material is so caustic that a spill
could not be contained, the material shall not be stored at the site.
8153. The construction road shall be the driveway to the residence or locus.
8154. The physical boundaries of the actual construction area and soil storage area shall be clearly marked. These
areas shall be made as small as possible, and operation of vehicles whose combined vehicle payload weight
exceeds 10,000 pounds shall not be allowed outside of these designated areas. No portion of any of these
areas shall be within 100 feet of wetland areas. The Planning Board may allow, for access purposes only,
reduction of the 100 foot restricted area if it has been determined that there are no reasonable alternatives to
access the upland area and a certification from a Registered Professional Hydrogeologist, Certified
Professional Geological Scientist, Registered Professional Engineer (including only those certified as a Civil
Engineer or Environmental Engineer), Certified Ground Water Professional or Certified Professional Soil
Scientist that the project will not have an adverse impact on the interests protected by the WPZ and the
AWPZ in the WRPOD. The reduction in the 100 foot setback from wetlands does not exempt the applicant
from compliance with the Wetlands Protection Act or any other applicable wetlands bylaws. Upon such
certification, the Planning Board shall issue the Special Permit unless the Planning Board determines, after
applying objective and scientifically accepted principles, that the applicant’s project, no matter what
conditions may be applied to it, will adversely and materially affect the public drinking water supply protected
by the WPZ and the AWPZ.
8155. All waste and refuse which is generated during construction shall be stored in a closable waste bin or
removed from the site on a daily basis. There shall be no onsite burial of any stumps or slash. All construction
materials shall be removed from the site after construction has been completed.

8300. WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS OVERLAY DISTRICT (WCOD)
8310. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish areas in which wireless communications facilities may be
provided while protecting Pepperell's unique community character. The WCOD has been created (a) to provide for
safe and appropriate siting of wireless communications facilities consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
and (b) to minimize visual impacts from such facilities on residential districts and scenic areas within Pepperell. The
construction and use of a wireless communications facility for which a building permit has issued prior to the
date of adoption of this new amended zoning bylaw shall continue to be governed by the zoning bylaw provisions
in effect at the time the building permit issued.
8320. Location. The terms of the WCOD shall apply to all properties within the Town of Pepperell.
8330. Applicability. The WCOD shall be construed as an overlay district with regard to said locations. All requirements of
the underlying zoning shall remain in full force and effect except Section 4110, and except as may be specifically
superseded or added to herein.
8340. Permitted Uses. Within the WCOD, wireless equipment may be placed on any appropriate existing structure,
including a permitted monopole, upon minor site plan approval by the Planning Board.
8341. Such equipment may be placed upon or inside existing buildings or structures, including water tanks and
towers, church spires, electrical transmission lines, and the like. In such cases, the facility height shall not
exceed two (2) feet above the height of the existing structure or building. Strict compliance with the two (2)
foot facility height limitations may be varied by the Planning Board during the site plan approval process
when, in the judgment of the Planning Board, such action is in the public interest and not inconsistent with
the Pepperell Zoning Bylaw.
8350. Uses Available by Special Permit. A wireless communications facility (WCF) may be erected in the WCOD upon
the issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board if the Board determines that the proposed facility will not
cause substantial detriment to the town or the neighborhood, in view of the particular characteristics of the site, and
of the proposal in relation to that site. The determination shall include consideration of each of the following:
a. communications needs served by the WCF;
b. traffic flow and safety, including parking and loading;
c. adequacy of utilities and other public services;
d. impact on neighborhood character, including aesthetics;
e. impacts on the natural environment, including visual impacts;
f. potential fiscal impact, including impact on town services, tax base, and employment;
g. new monopoles shall be considered only upon a finding that existing or approved monopoles or facilities
cannot accommodate the equipment planned for the proposed monopole.
8360. Conditions. All WCFs shall be subject to the following conditions. Strict compliance with the conditions of these
regulations may be varied by special permit, when, in the judgement of the Planning Board, such action is in the
public interest and not inconsistent with the Pepperell Zoning Bylaws.
a. To the extent feasible, service providers shall co-locate on a single facility. Monopoles shall be designed to
structurally accommodate other potential users (within a ten year period) where technically practicable.
b. New free-standing WCFs shall be limited to monopoles; no lattice towers shall be permitted. Monopole
height shall not exceed 100 feet above mean finished ground elevation at the base of the mounting

structure; provided, however, that a monopole may be erected higher than 100 feet where co-location is
approved or proposed, not to exceed a height of 140 feet above mean finished ground elevation at the base of the
mounting structure.
c. All structures associated with WCFs shall be removed within one year of cessation of
use. The Board may require a performance guarantee to effect this result.
d. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable.
e. The WCF shall minimize, to the extent feasible, adverse visual effects on the environment. The Planning
Board may impose reasonable conditions to ensure this result, including painting, lighting standards,
landscaping, and screening.
f. Traffic associated with the WCF shall not adversely affect public ways.
g. Fencing may be required to control unauthorized entry to a WCF.
h. Notwithstanding the requirements of Sec. 4140, a WCF shall be set back from the property lines of the lot
upon which it is to be located for a minimum distance that is at least equal to the height of the tower.
i. The required setback for a WCF from designated wetlands or surface waters shall be at least 100 feet.
j. A WCF shall be set back a minimum of at least 500 feet from all existing dwellings or mobile
homes and public ways.

b. A narrative report describing the capacity of the WCF, including the number and types of antennas that it can
accommodate and the basis for the calculation of capacity.
c. Copies of required federal and state permits, or a list of such permits to be acquired prior to construction.
8400. SEWER ZONING DISTRICT
8410. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to define that portion of the Town of Pepperell in which sewer service is
provided or may be planned to be provided, and to regulate sewer connections and use within the Sewer District area.
8420. Location. The Sewer District shall consist of that area of land shown within the delineated area appearing on the
Town of Pepperell Zoning Map and is additionally described and defined in a written addendum to the Official
Zoning Map.
8430. Applicability. The Sewer District shall be construed as an overlay district, and all elements of the underlying zoning
shall remain in full force and effect.
8440. Regulation. All habitable structures, whether residential or commercial, constructed after the effective date of this
section, lying within the Sewer District and having legal access to the sewers of the Town of Pepperell, shall connect
to the municipal sewer system by a sufficient drain, prior to any use or occupancy thereof. All single family
residences existing at the effective date of this section shall be allowed access to the municipal sewer system. Any single
family residence existing at the effective date of this section which is outside the Sewer District but directly abutting
a parcel within the Sewer District may be allowed access to the municipal sewer system through proof of
demonstrated hardship circumstances and by the permission of the Board of Public Works. No other properties
outside the Sewer District shall be allowed access to the municipal sewer system.
8450. Authority. The Board of Public Works shall be the enforcement authority of the Sewer District. All connections to
the municipal sewer system shall be directed as defined by the Sewer Division of the Department of Public
Works.
8500. MIXED USE OVERLAY DISTRICT
Town of Pepperell 45 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
8500. Purpose. The Mixed Use Overlay District (sometimes referred to herein as a “MUOD”), allows by Special Permit
from the Planning Board an alternative pattern of land development to the pattern normally permitted in the
underlying District(s). A Mixed Use District Overlay shall be permitted by Special Permit in the Commercial or
Industrial Districts provided the area to be so designated shall have at least five (5) acres (inclusive of wetlands). It is
intended to create mixed commercial, residential, and open space areas, called Mixed Use Developments (sometimes
referred to herein as MUD”), where the visual and physical dominance of the automobile is made secondary to
pedestrian needs; to encourage pedestrian activity by creating a pleasant, rich and diverse experience for pedestrians;
to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution by providing opportunities for retail services, housing and employment
in close proximity; and to encourage the sharing of parking lots and driveway curb cuts, minimizing the amount of
paved parking surface area, and reducing traffic congestion. For the purposes of this section, a “Mixed Use
Development (MUD)” shall mean any eligible use set forth in Section 8530, below, which may be commingled into a
single structure or structures with other eligible uses or may be located in separate structures on the site, all subject to
the issuance of a Special Permit as set forth in Section 8590.
8510. Authority. The Planning Board shall be the Special Permit Granting Authority for a MUD. The Planning Board may
vary the dimensional and parking requirements of this section if, in its opinion, such change will result in an improved
design of the MUD. This authority continues subsequent to occupancy by Special Permit issued by the Planning
Board. Section 9300 et. seq. of this Zoning Bylaw applies with respect to the Planning Board’s consideration of the
grant of a Special Permit for the MUD.
8520. Exclusivity/Control. All other uses and provisions not otherwise impacted by this Section (8500 et. seq.) shall
continue to remain in full force and effect. This Section (8500 et. seq.) of the Bylaw shall exclusively control
development of any MUD and shall take precedence over any other provision of the Zoning Bylaw (except the
provision of any other applicable overlay district). In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Section
8500 et. seq. and the Zoning Bylaws, the provisions of this Section shall govern and control. Upon the construction
and operation of a MUD pursuant to a Special Permit granted under this Section 8500, the underlying zoning
regulations shall be superseded by the MUD Special Permit.
8530. Eligible Uses. Except as noted below, all uses permitted in a Commercial District shall be eligible for consideration as
part of a MUD. In addition to the foregoing, the following types of uses shall be eligible for consideration as part of a
MUD:

8560. Parking and Curb Cut. Parking and Curb Cut Requirements. Unless as provided below, parking and circulation
requirements shall be in accordance with Section 5000 et. seq. of this Bylaw except as described below for Mixed Use
Developments:
8561. General - In a MUD adequate off-street parking shall be provided. The Planning Board and the applicant
shall have as a goal for the purposes of defining adequate off-street parking, making the most efficient
use of the parking facilities to be provided and minimizing the area of land to be paved for this purpose. In
implementing this goal the Board shall consider complimentary or shared use of parking areas by activities
having different peak demand times, and the applicant shall locate adjacent uses in such a manner as will
facilitate the complementary use of such parking areas. Implementation of such complementary use of
parking areas may result in permitted reductions in the parking requirements.
8562. Parking Locations - Parking may be provided at ground level, underground or in a parking garage. Parking
garages can be free standing or as part of buildings dedicated to other permitted uses.
8563. Parking at Buildings - Parking shall be primarily located at the rear, side or under buildings.

to govern signage in the MUD.
8580. Application. An application for a Special Permit for a Mixed Use Development shall comply with the requirements of
Section 9300 et. seq. of the Zoning Bylaws.
8590. Planning Board Findings. A Special Permit shall be issued under this Section if the Planning Board finds that the
MUD is in harmony with the purpose and intent of this Section and that it contains a compatible mix of uses
sufficiently advantageous to the Town to render it appropriate to depart from the requirements of the Bylaw otherwise
applicable to the underlying district in which the MUD is located.
8600. Affordable Housing
8610. Any MUD which will result in the creation of ten (10) or more residential dwelling units, shall include as a
condition of said permit that:
8611. At least 10% of the units, and in no case less than one unit, be priced for qualified affordable housing
purchasers;
8612. The mix of affordable dwelling units and rate of affordable dwelling units built in any one year shall be
equivalent to the overall mix for the entire MUD. It is intended that the affordable dwelling units authorized
Town of Pepperell 47 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
under the provisions of this Bylaw be considered as Local Initiative Program (LIP) dwelling units in
compliance with the requirements for the same as specified by the Department of Community Affairs,
Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), or successor, or additional
programs adopted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or its agencies, and that said units count toward
Pepperell’s requirements under Massachusetts General Law Chapter 40B, Sections 20-23, as amended.
8613. Deed restrictions, acceptable to the Town, and established in accordance with the standards of DHCD or
successor or additional programs adopted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or its agencies, shall be
placed on the appropriate property to ensure that affordable dwelling units created under this section shall
remain affordable dwelling units in perpetuity or for as long a period as is allowed by law.
8614. Dwelling units shall be considered as part of a single development if located either on a single parcel or
contiguous parcels of land which have been in the same ownership at any time subsequent to the date of
adoption of this Mixed-Use Bylaw.
8615. Affordable dwelling units required under Section 8610 may be provided in any one or combination of
methods described below, subject to the approval of the Planning Board.
a. Constructed on the locus subject to the Special Permit;
b. Constructed on a locus different than the one subject to the Special Permit;
c. An applicant may offer, and the Planning Board, in concert with the Board of Selectmen mayaccept,
donations of land in fee simple, on or off-site that the Planning Board determines are suitable for the
construction of an equivalent number of affordable dwelling units. The Planning Board mayrequire,
prior to acceptance of land by the Town, satisfaction of the requirements of this Bylaw, that the
applicant submit appraisals of the land in question, as well as other data relevant to the
determination of value;
d. For fractional affordable dwelling units, the applicant may round up to the next whole number of
units or choose to pay equivalent fees-in-lieu of units proportionate to the percentage of the unit
required; and
e. Preservation of existing market-rate dwelling units as affordable dwelling units through the
purchase of deed restrictions.
8616. All affordable dwelling units that are constructed on-site under this Bylaw shall be situated within the MUD
so as not to be in less desirable locations than market-rate units in the MUD and shall, on average, be no less
accessible to public amenities, such as open space, as the market-rate units. The Site Plan shall identify those
lots/locations selected for affordable dwelling units.
8617. With the approval of the Planning Board, as an alternative to the requirements of Section 8610, an applicant
subject to the Bylaw may develop, construct or otherwise provide affordable dwelling units equivalent to
those required by Section 8610 off-site. To the maximum extent practicable, all requirements of this Bylaw
that apply to on-site provision of affordable dwelling units shall apply to provision of off-site affordable
dwelling units. In addition, the Planning Board shall approve the location of the off-site units to be provided
as an integral element of the Special Permit review and approval process.
8618. As an alternative to the requirements of Section 8610 and as allowed by law and with the approval of the
Planning Board, an applicant may contribute an amount in cash equal to the costs of construction such
affordable dwelling units, and satisfactory to the Planning Board in consultation with other relevant Town
boards, to the Town Housing Authority or its designee for the development and preservation of affordable
housing, in consultation with the Planning Board and other appropriate Town Boards, in lieu of constructing
and offering affordable dwelling units within the locus of the proposed development or off-site, as set forth in
Section 8670, below.
8619. The applicant for a MUD subject to this Bylaw may pay fees-in-lieu of the construction. For the purposes of
this Bylaw, the fees-in-lieu of the construction or provision of each affordable dwelling unit is determined to
be three (3) times 80% of the median income for a household of four (4), as reported by the most recent
information from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and/or the
Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD).
8700. Standards for Roadways and Drainage
Town of Pepperell 48 Zoning Bylaw (xx/xx/13)
8710. Roadways - MUD roadways to be accepted by the Town of Pepperell as public ways shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the Rules and Regulations for the Subdivision of Land in the Town of
Pepperell. Private ways within the MUD, to the extent feasible, shall be constructed using the methods and
materials prescribed in the Rules and Regulations for the Subdivision of Land in the Town of Pepperell, but
shall not be required to conform to the dimensional requirements thereof, provided that those private
roadways shall be adequate for the intended vehicular and pedestrian traffic and shall be maintained by the
owner/developer or an association of owners.
8711. Storm Water Management System - The MUD shall have a storm water management system designed in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations for the Subdivision of Land in the Town of Pepperell and the
Department of Environmental Protection’s Storm Water Management Guidelines, as amended.

1.0. Purpose and Authority.
In accordance with MGL Chapter 40A, Section 9, the Planning Board of the Town of Pepperell
hereby adopts the following rules and regulations governing the organization and conduct of
the Board and for the purpose of establishing guidelines and procedures to hear and decide
applications for which it is empowered to act as the permit granting authority as specified in the
Town of Pepperell Zoning Bylaw.
2.0. Organization and Meetings.
2.1. Chairman; powers and duties.
The Chairman shall vote and be recorded on all special permits coming before the
Board. It shall be the duty of the Chairman to designate the Associate Member to sit on
the Board to act upon specific special permit applications when the Board's ability to act
is limited as in the case of a member's absence or conflict of interest on the part of any
member, in the event of vacancy on the Board or other reason creating an inability to
act on the part of a member. Subject to these rules, the Chairman shall decide all points
of order, unless overruled by a majority of the Board in session at the time and shall
appoint such committees as may be found necessary or desirable on special permit
related matters.
2.2. Clerk. The Clerk shall be a member of the Board, designated by the Board. Subject to
the direction of the Board, the Clerk shall supervise all of the clerical work of the Board
regarding special permits. In the absence of the Chairman, the Clerk shall act as
Chairman.
2.3. Associate Member. An Associate Member shall be annually appointed within thirty
(30) days of the first Planning Board meeting in May at a joint meeting of the Planning
Board and Board of Selectmen by majority vote of the members present at this meeting.
The Associate shall be called by the Chairman to act upon special permit applications in
the case of absence, inability to act or conflict of interest on the part of any member of
the Planning Board or in the event of a vacancy on the Board. The Associate shall sit as
a member of the Board at the public hearing, including any continuances; shall
participate in any and all discussions of the application and decision; and shall be
recorded on all votes on any special permit upon which the Associate was called to act.
2.4. Assistant to the Planning Board. The Assistant to the Planning Board, if one is
appointed by the Board, shall not be a member of the Board and shall, subject to the
direction of the Board and the procedures stated herein, process all applications
submitted to the Planning Board for action, to include referring applications for
comment, preparing and sending hearing notices, taking hearing and meeting minutes,
drafting decisions and notifying petitioners and parties in interest of the decision. The
Assistant shall certify the date on which decisions are filed with the Town Clerk.
2.5. Quorum. Three (3) members must be present to open any meeting of the Planning
Board and shall be required to conduct any general business. Four (4) members or three
(3) members plus the Associate Member must be present for the opening of any public
hearing. In the event only four (4) members are present at a public hearing, an applicant
Page 5 of 16
may insist upon being heard by the full five (5) member board and may request a
continuance of the hearing to a date certain for this purpose.
2 6. Meetings. All meetings of the Planning Board shall be held in accordance with the
provisions of the Massachusetts Open Meeting Law and a meeting schedule shall be
filed with the Town Clerk. A site visit for the purpose of inspection of a subject
property shall not be deemed a meeting but shall be posted with the Town Clerk.
2.7. Public Hearings. A public hearing shall be held on each application no later than sixtyfive
(65) days from the date of the filing of the application with the Town Clerk. Notice
of the hearing shall be posted in Town Hall and in a local newspaper at least fourteen
(14) days prior to the date of the hearing. A quorum, as defined above, must be present
for the public hearing. In the event a member misses one public hearing in a series of
public hearings on a Special Permit, he/she may complete an affidavit pursuant to MGL
Chapter 39, Section 23D that a hearing was missed and all evidence provided at the
missed hearing has been reviewed. This may only be done in the case of one (1) missed
hearing.
3.0. Applications for Special Permits.
Prior to filing an application for a Special Permit, applicants are encouraged to schedule a
meeting with the Planning Board to discuss the project informally. This preliminary review will
attempt to avoid unnecessary deficiencies in the application being filed and to promote
efficiency in the public hearing process.
3.1. Application Form. Every application for action by the Board shall be made on the
official forms included in these regulations. These forms may be obtained in the
Planning Board office or from the Town Clerk upon request. Any communication
purporting to be an application shall not be treated as such nor accepted by the Town
Clerk for filing until such time as it is made on the official application form, certified
parties in interest form and Appendix A cross reference form. All information called for
by the forms shall be furnished by the applicant in the manner prescribed.
3.2. Plans for Projects. Each application shall be accompanied by a plan. Plans larger than
11” x 17” shall have at least two copies provided in the original size. Plans shall show
the information required as listed and described in Appendix A. Appendix A shall be
cross referenced with the plans and submitted as part of the application.
3.3. Number of Copies. The original application, plan, and any supplemental information as
required plus 15 copies shall be submitted to the Planning Board during regular
business hours or at a scheduled meeting. An additional copy shall be submitted to the
Town Clerk during regular business hours and the date received by the Town Clerk
shall be the effective date of the submittal.
3.4. Waiver of Plan Requirement. Strict compliance with the plan requirements in these
rules and regulations may be waived, when, in the judgment of a quorum of the
Planning Board, such action is in the public interest and not inconsistent with the intent
of these regulations. The applicant shall submit a list of all waivers requested on the
form provided at the end of these regulations, which list the applicant may later amend
at the public hearing and which list the board will act on at the public hearing.
Page 6 of 16
3.5. Brief to the Board. It is recommended that every application for a special permit be
supported by a brief narrative setting forth in detail the facts of the request.
3.6. Filing Fees. Application filing fees shall be in accordance with the most recent Fee
Schedule set forth and published by the Planning Board and shall be submitted with the
application to the Planning Board.
3.7 Additional Review and/or Inspection Fees. The Planning Board may engage, at the
applicant’s expense, professional consultants, i.e., engineers, planners, lawyers, urban
designers, Town Officials, or other appropriate professionals, to assist the Board in
review or inspection of a project for compliance with all applicable laws, regulations,
and conditions. The Planning Board shall notify the applicant of its selection of a
consultant(s) and shall provide the applicant with an estimated cost of services. The
applicant in turn shall submit a payment to the Town of Pepperell and any funds
received for this purpose shall be deposited with the Treasurer and an escrow account
shall be established.
Failure of an applicant to submit the requested payment to the Town of Pepperell shall
be grounds for denial of the Special Permit. If unexpected costs should arise and the
balance in the escrow account falls below 25% of the remaining estimated cost of
services, the Planning Board may require additional deposits be made to the escrow
account to cover the remaining costs.
Expenditures from the escrow account shall be made at the direction of the Planning
Board, without further appropriation, upon receipt and approval of an invoice for
services rendered. Funds may only be spent on services rendered in connection with the
specific project for which they were collected. Accrued interest may also be spent for
this purpose. At the completion of the project, any excess funds in the escrow account,
including interest, shall be refunded to the applicant, or the applicant’s successor in
interest. A final report of said account shall be made available to the applicant or the
applicant’s successor in interest.
The applicant may appeal the selection of the consultant(s) to the Board of Selectmen
within fourteen (14) days of notification by the Planning Board of their selection of a
consultant(s). The grounds for such an appeal shall be limited to claims that the
consultant(s) selected has a conflict of interest or does not possess the minimum
required qualifications, as specified in MGL Chapter 44, Section 53G.
4.0. Procedures.
4.1. Filing. All applications shall be filed with the Planning Board together with the list of
parties in interest certified by the Board of Assessors, the plans, Appendix A, and the
filing fee. An additional copy shall be submitted to the Town Clerk during regular
business hours and the date received by the Town Clerk shall be the effective date of
the submittal.
4.2. Referral. Upon receipt of an application, the Planning Board shall, within 14 days, refer
the application to other boards and officials as it deems advisable and shall not hold a
public hearing on the application until such time as reports have been received from all
boards and officials to whom the application has been referred or 35 days have elapsed
following referral without receipt of such reports, whichever occurs sooner. Failure of
Page 7 of 16
any such board or official to submit a report within thirty-five (35) days of receipt of the
referral shall be deemed by the Planning Board as a lack of opposition thereto.
4.3. Public Hearing Notice. A notice of the public hearing to be held on each application
shall be advertised as required by the provisions of M.G.L., Chapter 40A, Section 11,
once in each of two successive weeks and not less than fourteen (14) days prior to the
hearing date in a newspaper of general local circulation, posted in Town Hall and filed
with the Town Clerk. Notices shall contain the name of the applicant, a description of
the area or premises, street address, if any, or other adequate identification of the
location of the area or premises which is the subject of the petition, the date, time and
place of the public hearing, the subject matter of the hearing, and the nature of action or
relief requested if any. No such hearing shall be held on any day on which a state or
municipal election, caucus or primary is held in town. A copy of the advertised notice
shall be sent by mail, at least seven (7) days prior to the date of the hearing, postage
prepaid, to the applicant, the owner of the property, the parties in interest as certified by
the Board of Assessors, and the Planning Boards of Groton, Townsend, and Dunstable,
Massachusetts and Brookline, Nashua and Hollis, New Hampshire.
4.4. Public Hearing.
4.4.1. A public hearing shall be held on each application no later than 65 days from the
submittal date of a complete application but no earlier than thirty-five (35) days
from the date of referral to other boards and officials.
4.4.2. All hearings shall be open to the public. No person shall be excluded unless
he/she is considered by the Chairman to be a “serious hindrance” to the conduct
of the hearing.
4.4.3. An applicant may appear in his own behalf, or be represented by an agent or
attorney. In the absence of any appearance without due cause on behalf of an
applicant, the Board may decide on the matter using the information it has
received.
4.4.4. The required time limits for a public hearing and said action may be extended by
written agreement between the petitioner and the Planning Board to a date
certain. A copy of such agreement shall be filed in the office of the Town Clerk.

for all special permit applications.
4.5.8. Lack of Decision. Failure of the Planning Board to take final action within said

failure of the board to act within such time prescribed, shall notify the Town
Clerk, in writing within fourteen (14) days from the expiration of said ninety
(90) days or extended time, if applicable, of such approval and that notice has

Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 1 10/11/05
Section 1.0. Purpose and authority.
1.1. Authority. Under the authority vested in the Planning Board of the Town of Pepperell,
Massachusetts, by the provision of MGL Ch. 41, § 81Q, said Planning Board hereby
adopts these rules and regulations governing the subdivision of land within the
boundaries of the Town of Pepperell.
1.2. Purpose. The purpose of these subdivision rules and regulations is to protect the safety,
convenience, and welfare of the inhabitants of the Town of Pepperell by:
• regulating the laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions providing access to
the several lots therein, but which have not become public ways through:
o providing adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be
safe and convenient for travel;
o lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent public ways;
o coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other and with the public ways
in the town in which it is located and with the ways in neighboring subdivisions;
o reducing danger to life and limb in the operation of motor vehicles;
o securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic and other emergencies; and
o providing for underground utility services, fire, police, and other similar
municipal equipment, and street lighting and other requirements where necessary
in a subdivision;
• ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions through securing adequate provision for
water, sewerage, and drainage;
• ensuring compliance with the applicable zoning ordinances or bylaws
• ensuring parks and open areas, but only after payment of just compensation; and
• encouraging the use of solar energy by protecting the access to direct sunlight of solar
energy systems.
1.3. Amendments. The Planning Board may, from time to time, amend these Rules and
Regulations by appropriate action taken at a public hearing, as provided by MGL, Ch. 41,
Section 81-Q, as amended. A true copy of these rules and regulations, with their most
recent amendments, shall be kept on file available for inspection in the office of the
Planning Board and in the office of the Town Clerk.
1.4. Severability. If any provision of these rules and regulations or the administration thereof
shall be declared unconstitutional, invalid or void, it shall not affect any other provision
of these rules and regulations or the administration thereof.
1.5. Reference to Statute. For matters not covered by these rules and regulations, reference is
made to §§ 81K to 81GG, inclusive, of Chapter 41 of the Massachusetts General Laws,
as amended.

landscaping techniques which will be used to blend the structures with the
surrounding area, the height of the structures in relation to the surrounding area, and
the project’s visual impact and possible interference with natural views; impact on
local schools; impact on residents’ public health due to changes in water quality, air
quality and noise levels.
N. The applicant shall submit a list of all waivers requested, which list the applicant may
later amend at public hearing.
O. A copy of the completed Notice of Intent for Stormwater Discharges Associated with
Construction Activity Under an NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System) General Permit shall be submitted (to the Planning Board) prior to the start
of construction where applicable.
P. Where applicable, a stormwater management form shall be submitted.
4.3.3. Requirements for filing. The applicant shall submit the original plan first to the
Planning Board at a regular meeting of the Planning Board or by registered mail to the
Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 16 10/11/05
Planning Board in care of the Town Clerk, together with fourteen (14) full-size contact
prints and five (5) reduced prints on 11 by 17 inch paper for the use of the Planning
Board and/or its agents, five (5) copies of the required accompanying data, an
application fee in accordance with the fee schedule in the Appendix, and a properly
executed copy of Form C, Application for Approval of a Definitive Plan. The applicant
will be billed at a later date for a postage fee equal to the number of abutters times the
then-current United States postal rate for the first-class mail payable to the Town of
Pepperell, plus the cost of advertising the public hearing. The Planning Board shall
inscribe on the Form C the date received if by delivery at a Board meeting, or the Town
Clerk shall inscribe on the Form C the date mailed if by registered mail to the Board in
care of the Town Clerk, and this shall be the submission date. In the case of filing at a
meeting of the Planning Board, the applicant shall also file with the Town Clerk one (1)
copy of Form C and the Town Clerk shall inscribe thereon the date and time received.
A complete copy of all materials submitted shall also be submitted to the Board of
Health.
4.3.4. Review by the Board of Health. At the time of filing the definitive plan, the applicant
shall also file a copy with the Board of Health, and the Board of Health shall, within
forty-five (45) days thereafter, report to the Planning Board, in writing, approval or
disapproval of the plan, and a copy of such report shall be delivered or mailed to the
applicant. If the Board of Health has reason to disapprove the plan, it shall make specific
findings as to which, if any, of the lots shown on the plan cannot be used for building
sites without injury to the public health and shall include such specific findings and the
reason or reasons therefor in such report and, where possible, shall make
recommendations for the adjustment thereof. Any approval of the plan by the Planning
Board shall then be given only on condition that the designated lots or land shall not be
built upon without the prior consent of the Board of Health, and the Planning Board shall
endorse on the plan such conditions and specify the lots or land to which such conditions
apply. Failure on the part of the Board of Health to so report shall be deemed as
approval.
4.3.5. Public hearing. Before approval, modification and approval or disapproval of a definitive
plan is given, a public hearing shall be held by the Planning Board, notice of the date,
time and place of which and subject matter sufficient for identification shall be given by
the Planning Board, at the expense of the applicant, by advertising in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Town of Pepperell once in each of two (2) successive weeks,
the first publication being not less than fourteen (14) days before the day of the hearing,
and by mailing a copy of such advertisement to the applicant and to all of the abutters as
defined in subsection 2.0 of these rules and regulations.
4.3.6. Planning Board Action.
4.3.6.1. After the hearing and after the report of the Board of Health or lapse of fortyfive
(45) days without such report, the Planning Board shall approve or, if
such plan does not comply with the Subdivision Control Law or these rules
and regulations or the recommendations of the Board of Health, shall modify
Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 17 10/11/05
and approve or shall disapprove the definitive plan by a majority vote and
state the reasons for the vote, which shall be recorded on the appropriate form
(Form C-1, Certificate of Approval/Approval with Modifications of a
Definitive Plan; Form C-2, Certificate of Disapproval of a Definitive Plan),
then filed with the Town Clerk and mailed by registered mail to the applicant.
4.3.6.2. In the event of disapproval, the Planning Board shall state in detail wherein
the plan does not conform to these rules and regulations or the
recommendations of the Board of Health. If a disapproved definitive plan is
amended by the applicant to eliminate all stated reasons for disapproval, in a
manner satisfactory to the Planning Board, the Planning Board shall hold an
advertised public hearing at the applicant’s cost and if the plan, as amended,
conforms to these rules and regulations and to other application requirements,
the Planning Board shall approve such plan as provided in these regulations.
If the report of the Board of Health shall so require, the approval by the
Planning Board shall be on the condition that no building or structure shall be
built or placed upon the areas designated without consent by the Board of
Health.
4.3.6.3. In the event that approval by the Board of Health is by failure to make a
report, the Planning Board shall note on the plan that Board of Health
approval is by failure to report. This failure shall not constitute relief from
sewerage or other health requirements as may be applied to a particular lot.
4.3.6.4. Approval, if granted, shall be endorsed, subject to the Zoning Act, on the
original drawing of the definitive plan by at least a majority of the members of
the Planning Board; however, no such endorsement shall be made until the
twenty-day statutory appeal period has elapsed following the filing of the
certificate and the plan with the Town Clerk and said Town Clerk has
endorsed the plan stating that no appeal has been made from the determination
of the Planning Board.
4.3.6.5 In the case of a subdivision showing lots in a residential district, where a
preliminary plan has been acted upon by the Planning Board or where at least
forty-five (45) days have elapsed since submission of the preliminary plan, an
applicant may file a definitive plan. The failure of the Planning Board either
to take action or to file with the Town Clerk a certificate of action on the
definitive plan within ninety (90) days after such submission, or such further
time as may be agreed upon at the written request of the applicant, shall be
deemed to be an approval thereof. Notice of any extension of time shall be
filed by the Planning Board with the Town Clerk. In the case of a subdivision
showing lots in a residential district, where no preliminary plan has been
submitted and acted upon or where forty-five (45) days have not elapsed since
submission of such preliminary plan, and a definitive plan is submitted, the
failure of the Planning Board either to take final action or to file with the
Town Clerk a certificate of such action regarding the definitive plan submitted
Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 18 10/11/05
by an applicant within one hundred thirty-five (135) days after such
submission, or such further time as may be agreed upon at the written request
of the applicant, shall be deemed to be an approval thereof
4.3.6.6. In the case of a nonresidential subdivision where the preliminary plan has
been duly submitted and acted upon or where forty-five (45) days have
elapsed since submission of the said preliminary plan and then a definitive
plan is submitted, the failure of the Planning Board either to take final action
or to file with the Town Clerk a certificate of such action regarding the
definitive plan within ninety (90) days after such submission, or such further
time as may be agreed upon at the written request of the applicant, shall be
deemed to be an approval thereof. Notice of an extension of time shall be
filed by the Planning Board with the Town Clerk.
4.3.6.7. Approval of a definitive plan does not constitute approval for the laying out of
or the acceptance by the Town of Pepperell of streets within a subdivision.
The approval of a plan by the Planning Board does not make any street shown
a public or Town way; they have the status of private ways open and
dedicated to public use. Existing laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and by-laws of the Town must be complied with for the
acceptance of any street.
4.3.7. Performance guarantee. Before endorsement of approval of a definitive plan, the
Planning Board shall require the construction of streets and ways and the installation of
municipal services to be secured in accordance with the provisions of MGL C. 41, § 81U
using one of the following methods.
A. By a proper bond, sufficient in the opinion of the Planning Board to secure
performance of the construction of ways and the installation of municipal services
required for lots in the subdivision shown on the plan, and the planning board may
require that the applicant specify the time within which such construction shall be
completed. It shall be accompanied by a properly executed Form H and shall be
contingent upon the completion of such improvements within the time specified by
the applicant following the date of receipt of such security.
B. By a deposit of money or negotiable securities, sufficient in the opinion of the
planning board to secure performance of the construction of ways and the
installation of municipal services required for lots in the subdivision shown on the
plan, and the planning board may require that the applicant specify the time within
which such construction shall be completed. It shall be accompanied by a properly
executed Form H and shall be contingent upon the completion of such
improvements within the time specified by the applicant following the date of
receipt of such security.
C. By a covenant, executed and duly recorded by the owner of record, running with the
land, whereby such ways and services shall be provided to serve any lot before such
Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 19 10/11/05
lot may be built upon or conveyed, other than by mortgage deed; provided, that a
mortgagee who acquires title to the mortgaged premises by foreclosure or otherwise
and any succeeding owner of such premises or part thereof may sell any such lot,
subject to that portion of the covenant which provides that no lot shall be built upon
until such ways and services have been provided to serve such lot; and provided,
further, that nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit a conveyance by a single
deed, subject to such covenant, of either the entire parcel of land shown on the
subdivision plan or of all lots not previously released by the planning board. A deed
of any part of the subdivision in violation hereof shall be voidable by the grantee
prior to the release of the covenant but not later than three years from the date of
such deed. If the applicant selects a restrictive covenant, it shall be a properly
executed Form I and shall be referred to on the plan.
D. By delivery to the planning board of an agreement executed after the recording of a
first mortgage covering the premises shown on the plan or a portion thereof given as
security for advances to be made to the applicant by the lender, which agreement
shall be executed by the applicant and the lender and shall provide for the retention
by the lender of funds sufficient in the opinion of the planning board and otherwise
due the applicant, to secure the construction of ways and the installation of
municipal services. Said agreement shall also provide for a schedule of
disbursements which may be made to the applicant upon completion of various
stages of the work, and shall further provide that in the event the work is not
completed within the time set forth by the applicant, any funds remaining
undisbursed shall be available for completion. A tri-party agreement shall be
accompanied by a properly executed Form H and shall be contingent upon the
completion of such improvements within the time specified by the applicant
following the date of receipt of such security.
The applicant may determine the form of performance security and may use a
combination of methods, provided that the amount of the bond, deposit of money,
negotiable security or agreement bears a direct and reasonable relationship to the
expected cost, including the effects of inflation, necessary to complete the subject work
and is sufficient in the opinion of the Planning Board. The amount shall be determined
using the Street Improvement Guarantee – Bond Amount Determination worksheet
provided by the Board. The Board may refuse security based on advice from the Town
Treasurer as to the financial status of the bank, company or institution involved. No
building permit application for a lot shall be applied for until the lot has been completely
released by the Planning Board. Release from performance security shall be properly
executed on Form J, Release.
4.3.8. Adjustment of Performance Guarantee
The Board shall have the authority to reduce the performance guarantee amount being
held from time to time. The Board shall have the authority to increase the performance
guarantee amount being held from time to time in order to reflect: A) additional work that
should have been included in the original amount; B) additional work required to correct
Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 20 10/11/05
or address problems which arose after the original amount was established; or C) to
reflect increases in construction costs over time. Interim as-built drawings shall be
submitted for review and acceptance prior to any bond reductions.
4.3.9. Recording of plan. Within thirty (30) days following the date of endorsement of approval
and return by the Planning Board of the definitive plan, the applicant shall deliver to the
Planning Board four (4) complete sets of full-size copies of the endorsed plans and any
easements and one (1) copy of all easements and covenants, deed restrictions, certificate
of approval and the performance guaranty showing the recording by the Registry of
Deeds or, in the case of registered land, filing with the Recorder of the Land Court. A
copy of the approved plan (the same submitted for endorsement) shall be submitted to the
Planning Board in electronic format deemed adequate by the Planning Board. No lot
shall be conveyed or built upon until such delivery to the Planning Board is complete.
Failure to comply with the procedural and other requirements of these rules and
regulations may result in rescission of the approval given hereunder by the Board.
After an application for a definitive subdivision is submitted, no tree removal, no utility
installation, no ditching, grading or construction of roads, no grading of lands or lots, no
excavation except for purposes of soil testing, no dredging or filling, and no construction
of buildings or structures shall be done on any part of the development site until the
definitive plan has been approved and recorded in the Registry of Deeds.
4.3.10. Evidence of satisfactory performance. Before the Planning Board will release the final
interest of the town in the performance security or covenant, the Board shall have
received and approved the as-built plan and street acceptance plan, the monument
certification, a completed Form K and a completed Inspection Form P. Upon the
completion of the subdivision, the applicant shall send by registered mail to the Town
Clerk a written statement that said construction and installation of municipal services
have been completed in accordance with the requirement of the subdivision approval, and
the Town Clerk shall furnish a copy of the statement to the Planning Board. If the
Planning Board determines that the construction and installation of municipal services
have been completed in accordance with the approved subdivision plan, it shall release
the interest of the town in the performance security or covenant. If the Planning Board
determines that the construction or installation of municipal services has not been
completed, it shall specify in writing to the applicant in detail wherein said construction
or installation fails to comply with the approved subdivision plan within forty-five (45)
days of the receipt of the Town Clerk of said statement.
4.3.11. Modification, amendment or rescission of plan. In accordance with MGL C. 41, § 81W,
the Planning Board, on its own motion or on the petition of any person interested, shall
have the power to modify, amend or rescind its approval of a definitive plan of a
subdivision or to require a change in a definitive plan as a condition of its retaining the
status of an approved plan. Failure to record or comply with an agreement, these rules
and regulations or the Subdivision Control Law or of the applicant to complete
installation of the construction of the subdivision road within three (3) years (or such
Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 21 10/11/05
other time established by agreement) of endorsement of approval shall be cause for
consideration of rescission of approval of such definitive plan.
4.3.12. Ownership.
The applicant shall retain title of the fee of each street or easement in, or appurtenant to,
the subdivision until conveyed to the Town and shall maintain and repair the streets,
drainage facilities and utilities in a manner satisfactory to the Department of Public
Works during that period. The Town of Pepperell is not required to plow snow on a
street that has not been accepted by Town Meeting.
If the Town must maintain a portion of, or enter the subdivision for the purpose of public
safety, emergency purposes or otherwise, the Town reserves the right to charge the
applicant for services rendered.
Section 5.0. Design Standards.
A table has been provided in the Appendix providing a summary of major street design
standards as well as a typical cross section for minor and subcollector roads.
5.1. Easements to town.
5.1.1. Easements for surface water drainage, municipal services and other utilities when
necessary across lots or centered on the rear or side of lots shall be at least thirty (30)
feet in width and shall be conveyed by the applicant to the town by both Form K and a
plan which clearly define the purpose and location. A properly executed grant of
easement must be delivered to the authorized agent of the town.
5.1.2. A right-of-way easement, which shall be conveyed by the applicant on Form K, shall be
granted to the Town of Pepperell for the perpetual right to pass and repass and to
construct, inspect, repair, renew, replace, operate and forever maintain the water mains,
sewer mains and storm drains with any manholes, pipes, conduits, drainage easements
and other appurtenances thereto and to do all acts incidental thereto, in, through and
under the roadway right-of-way.
5.1.3. When a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, the
Planning Board may require that there be conveyed to the town a stormwater easement
or drainage right-of-way of adequate width to conform substantially to the lines of such
watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream and to provide for access for construction
or other necessary purposes and which may require approval under and as set forth in
MGL C. 131, §§ 40, known as the Wetlands Protection Act and Section 404 of the
Federal Clean Water Act, administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
5.1.4. When, in the design of a surface water drainage system, the outlet discharges water that
has collected within the confines of the subdivision in a concentrated stream onto land
Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 22 10/11/05
of others, and this land is located beyond the external boundaries of the subdivision but
within reasonable proximity to the subdivision, the applicant, at his expense, shall be
required to obtain an easement, suitable for recording, which would legally allow such
surface drainage to flow onto or over such land of others.
5.2. Open space.
Before approval of a plan, the Planning Board may require the plan to show a park or
parks suitable for use as a playground or recreation area or for providing light and air.
The park or parks shall not be unreasonable in area in relation to the land being
subdivided and to the prospective use of the land. The Planning Board may, by
appropriate endorsement on the plan, require that no buildings shall be erected upon such
park or parks for a period of not more than three (3) years without the prior consent and
approval of the Planning Board.
5.3. Public Improvements.
The Planning Board may determine that the developer shall be responsible for the
construction or funding of public improvements which are directly related to the impact
of the subdivision on the community and in the surrounding area. Such public
improvements may include, but are not limited to, intersection improvements,
sidewalks, drainage improvements, water system improvements and replacement of
street trees.
5.4. Protection of natural features.
Due regard shall be shown for the preservation of all historic and natural features of the
environment, such as trees larger than eighteen (18) inches in diameter, watercourses,
stone walls, scenic points of interest, historic spots and other similar community assets.
5.5. Access to residential subdivision.
An access to any residential subdivision must be within the town limits. Any access to a
subdivision through another town requires certification from that town (proof of
subdivision approval may be adequate) that the street is in accordance with the plans and
subdivision requirements of that town, that bond posted is adequate and that the access is
adequate for expected traffic.
5.6. Streets and ways.
Each subdivision shall be provided with more than one (1) street for access and egress
unless the area contained in the subdivision and/or the topography of the land will not
allow for more than one (1) access and egress street or the through street would have to
cross a significant wetlands system which would be seriously compromised by the
crossing.
Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 23 10/11/05
5.6.1. Location and alignment.
5.6.1.1. All streets in a subdivision shall be designed so that they shall provide safe
vehicular travel. Due consideration shall be given to the accessibility by
emergency vehicle and maintenance equipment.
5.6.1.2. As far as practical, the proposed streets and ways shall conform to the Master
Plan of the Town of Pepperell as recommended and adopted by the Planning
Board.
5.6.1.3. Provision satisfactory to the Planning Board shall be made for the proper
projection of streets (minimum fifty-foot right-of-way easement) or for access
to adjoining property which has not yet been subdivided. The strip for future
roadway development or for access shall be laid out in such a manner so as to
be an extension of or intersect as close as possible at a ninety-degree angle
with the proposed or existing street and should address vertical concerns such
as maximum slope and grading easements.
5.6.1.4. The minimum center-line radius of curved street lines shall be one hundred
fifty (150) feet unless a greater radius is required for streets of greater width
than the specified minimum width.
5.6.1.5. Intersections with existing streets shall be as close as possible to a ninety
degree angle.
5.6.1.6. In order to provide a border area from the edge of pavement for necessary
drainage structures and maintenance of the streets, the right-of-way line at the
street intersection shall be rounded so as to provide a 25 foot radius. The
centerline of the right-of-way shall be the centerline of the roadway.
5.6.1.7. Earthwork for all subdivisions shall be designed to balance cuts and fills to
limit soil removal from the site during construction to only the amount
necessary to comply with the standards herein and to provide safe access into
the required parking areas on each lot.
5.6.1.8. All streets within a subdivision shall be constructed in conformity with the
typical cross section as shown on the final approved subdivision plan and shall
not deviate from said plan without special and specific permission, in writing,
of the Planning Board. A typical cross section is provided in the appendix.
5.6.2. Dead-end streets.
5.6.2.1. Dead-end streets, also referred to as “culs-de-sac” may only be permitted
when, in the opinion of the Planning Board, the area contained in the
subdivision and/or the topography of the land will not allow for more than one
(1) access and egress street or the through street would have to cross a
Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 24 10/11/05
significant wetlands system which would be seriously compromised by the
crossing.
5.6.2.2. In the event that a dead-end street is permitted, such shall not be longer than
five hundred (500) feet in length unless a greater length of up to seven hundred
fifty (750) feet is required by topography or other local condition. Length of a
cul-de-sac shall be measured from the farthest end of the right-of-way of the
turnaround to the edge of the right-of-way of the intersecting street. If 2 or
more streets branch out but depend on a single access/egress point or a proposed
street intersects solely with a dead-end street or cul-de-sac, it shall be deemed
an extension of the existing dead-end street or cul-de-sac, and the aggregate
length of all streets depending on said access/egress point or a dead-end or culde-
sac and its extensions shall be deemed the length of the dead-end street for
the purpose of these rules and regulations. No new dead-end street or cul-desac
shall originate from an existing dead-end street unless the total length of the
combined streets is less than 500 feet or up to 750 feet if so required by
topography or other local condition. A dead-end street shall not serve as access
to another dead-end street.
5.6.2.3. Every dead-end street shall be designed with a turnaround at the closed end of
the street. At the discretion of the Department of Public Works/Highway
Division, the turnaround shall be either a T-type design or cul-de-sac design.
The T-type design shall have the street forming the stem of the T. The bar of
the T shall be perpendicular to the stem. The paved dimensions of the bar shall
be one hundred twenty (120) feet in total length, sixty (60) feet either side of the
centerline of the stem and twenty five (25) feet in width. The minimum paved
radius at the intersection returns shall be thirty-five (35) feet. The cul-de-sac
design will have an outside edge of pavement radius of at least 65 feet (where
curbing will be installed) and an inside edge of pavement radius of at least 45
feet (where curbing will be installed). The area inside the inner radius of
curbing will be landscaped in such a manner as to minimize maintenance except
the 10 feet nearest the curbing, which will be loamed and seeded.
5.6.3. Minimum corner sight distance.
5.6.3.1. Streets and driveways shall be laid out such that there is a minimum
unobstructed corner sight distance as viewed from the standard stop position
to a vehicle on the through street as specified in the following table:
Minimum Corner Sight Distance
Design Speed Minimum Sight Distance
(mph) (feet)
30 300
35 350
40 400
45 450
Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 25 10/11/05
5.6.3.2. Corner sight distance is measured from the center of the connecting road or
driveway from a point fifteen (15) feet from the stop bar, edge of pavement of
the main road or crosswalk (whichever is greater) from an eye height of three
and five-tenths (3.5) to six and zero-tenths (6.0) feet to an object four and
twenty-five hundredths (4.25) feet in height on the major road.
5.6.3.3. All objects, such as trees, brush, signs, brick walls, stone walls, hills, etc.,
shall be cleared or cut back from the resulting sight distance triangles.
5.6.4. Street rights-of-way.
5.6.4.1. The minimum width of a right-of-way shall be fifty (50) feet.
5.6.4.2. The entire area between the right-of-way lines on each street shall be cleared
of all stumps, roots, brush, boulders and other material of similar nature and
all trees not intended for preservation.
5.6.4.3. The right-of-way for a dead-end street must be such as to accommodate a culde-
sac whether the street is a T-type or cul-de-sac design.
5.6.5. Grades.
5.6.5.1. The minimum grade of any street in a subdivision shall be no less than zero
and five-tenths percent (0.5%) and shall be no more than six percent (6%) for
collectors and shall be no more than eight percent (8%) for minor streets or
subcollectors.
5.6.5.2. All summits of vertical curves shall be so graded as to provide three hundred
(300) feet of clear sight distance to drivers and shall be measured on the center
line of the road at an eye height of three and five-tenths (3.5) feet to an object
zero and five-tenths (0.5) feet in height.
5.6.5.3. Where the grade of any street at the approach to an intersection exceeds three
percent (3%), a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a threepercent
grade for a distance of twenty-five (25) feet measured from the nearest
right-of-way line of the intersecting street.
5.6.6. Subgrade.
5.6.6.1. All loam, clay, peat or other yielding material shall be removed from the area
of the travelway to a depth sufficient to establish a subgrade base that is firm
and solid and upon which the roadway can be satisfactorily built. Where there
is a high water table [within three (3) feet of finished grade] or soil with high
clay content, the use of geotextiles may be required at the discretion of the
Highway Superintendent to ensure long-term roadway stability.
Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 26 10/11/05
5.6.6.2. The subgrade of the entire width of the travelway shall be brought to within
three and five-tenths (3.5) inches below the finish grade as shown on the
profile of the definitive plan, and at least the top number of inches specified in
the table of this section as “gravel depth” shall consist of well-compacted
bank-run gravel, the top three (3) inches of which shall be free of all coarse
aggregates. The entire surface of the subgrade shall be graded by means of a
ten-ton, self-propelled motor grader having a leveling blade of at least twelve
(12) feet in length. The subgrade and gravel base shall be compacted to not
less than 95% of maximum dry density or as shall be required by the Highway
Superintendent by means of a twelve-ton, three-wheel roller or a twelve-ton
self-propelled pneumatic-tired compaction roller to an overall width specified
in the table of this section as “gravel width” and shall be crowned to cause the
center line of the roadway to be the height specified as "crown" in the table of
this section higher than the side lines of the pavement.

5.6.7. Binder course.
5.6.7.1. After the subgrade has been properly set, there shall be laid, in two (2)
separate operations, a binder course of bituminous concrete to a depth of two
(2) inches and a surface course of bituminous concrete to a depth of one and
five-tenths (1.5) inches, both courses after compaction bringing the pavement
to the finish grade as shown on the definitive plan. The binder course shall sit
through one winter season before the surface course is installed. The
bituminous concrete shall meet all of the requirements as set forth by the
Massachusetts Department of Public Works Standard Specifications for

Pepperell Subdivision Rules & Regulations 27 10/11/05
5.6.8.1. The finished pavement shall be kept intact, and no breaking through of the
pavement shall be permitted except in the case of emergency or when, in the
opinion of the Planning Board, such excavation shall be considered in the best
interests of the public. Should a break be made in the pavement, it shall be the
responsibility of the subdivider to replace the pavement in the same manner as
it was originally put in place and in a manner approved by the Department of
Public Works/Highway Division.
5.6.8.2. After all the interest in the performance security for a subdivision has been
released under the Subdivision Control Law, the status and maintenance of the
subdivision ways are no longer within the control of the Planning Board.
5.6.8.3. Pavement depths will be confirmed by unit weight as per Mass Highway
conversion factors and delivery slips.
5.7. Drainage.
5.7.1. Storm drains, culverts and related facilities shall be designed to permit unimpeded flow
of all natural watercourses, to ensure adequate drainage at all low points along streets,
to control erosion and to intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals
reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area being drained. To the maximum
extent feasible, stormwater shall be recharged rather than piped to surface water. Under
no circumstances shall stormwater be piped to below base flood elevation. Peak stream
flows and runoff rates at the boundaries of the development from a twenty-five-year
frequency storm shall be at no greater or lesser rates of flow following development
than prior to development. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Programmatic General
Permit Category 1 standards shall be applied to all stream crossings unless the crossing
design has been reviewed and otherwise authorized by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers.
5.7.2. The surface water drainage system shall be designed on the basis of a twenty-five-year
storm. Culverts shall be designed on the basis of a fifty-year storm with consideration
being given to damage avoidance for a one-hundred-year storm. Water velocities shall
be between three (3) feet per second and eight (8) feet per second in pipes and gutters
and not more than five (5) feet per second on ground surfaces under design conditions.

subject to the approval of the Highway Superintendent. All pipes must meet the
bedding or encasement requirements of the DPW/Highway Division. Stormwater shall
not be allowed to leave the boundaries of the subdivision at greater or lesser rates of
flow or at different points than would occur without the proposed development. Design
shall be based upon the modified soil cover complex method as described in Technical
Release No. 20 (TR-20) or Technical Release No. 55 (TR-55), This document is
available through the Natural Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Westford, Massachusetts. Design consideration shall be given to beaver

precast concrete. Grates shall be twenty-four (24) inches square and shall have two-inch
square openings. Catch basins must be designed and located such that the grate capacity
of each is not exceeded. Catch basins shall be located on both sides of the roadway on
continuous grades, at intervals of not more than four hundred (400) feet or of not more
than 400 feet from roadway crests, and at low sags in the roadway and near the corners of
the roadway at intersecting streets. Proper connections shall be made with existing storm
drains. Castings must be American made and approved by the Highway Superintendent.
Pipes in to and out of all drainage structures must be flush and neat to the interior wall of
the structure. The drainage system should be designed so as to have catch basins flow
into drain manholes located outside the curbing, not in to other catch basins. Lateral
connections must be 5 feet deep for frost concerns. Infiltration systems should be
incorporated into the drainage design wherever possible. All outfalls are to have either
an endwall or a flared end section with riprap erosion protection (of adequately sized
stones).
5.7.4. If, after consultation with the Department of Public Works/Highway Division and
Department of Public Works Director/Town Engineer, the Planning Board determines
that the capacity of an existing town drain into which surface water from the proposed
drainage system shall be projected is inadequate to accommodate the entire proposed
subdivision, then only that portion thereof which can be adequately accommodated
shall be connected, and the applicant shall be required, at his expense, to obtain
easements or other means to properly project the collected surface drainage from the
remaining portion of the subdivision.
5.7.5. There shall be no open ditch or swale drainage created between the access road and the
frontage or building area of any lot.
5.7.6. Where property adjacent to the external boundaries of a proposed subdivision has not

6.1. Inspection.
6.1.1. At the time of approval of a definitive plan or shortly thereafter, the Planning Board
shall prepare for the applicant a list (Inspection Form P) of the various phases of the
subdivision, outlining the sequence in which each phase shall be prepared by the
applicant. Periodic inspections of each phase of the work shall be made by the Planning
Board or its duly appointed agent. Inspections of each phase are to insure compliance
with the subdivision rules and regulations and approved definitive subdivision plan,
checking the overall adequacy of the work. The inspections are not meant to substitute
for or replace as-built plans. All work must be confirmed to be compliant with design
requirements by the submittal and approval of as-built plans. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to notify the Planning Board, in writing, when each phase
of the work is ready for inspection. Such notice shall be made at least forty-eight (48)
hours prior to the time that inspection is requested by the applicant. It shall be the
responsibility of the Planning Board to notify its agent to make the requested
inspection. Such inspection approval does not constitute acceptance of such utilities by
the Town of Pepperell nor shall it replace or supersede as-built approval nor does such
approval constitute acceptance of said utilities by the Town of Pepperell.
6.1.2. At the time of submission of the definitive plan, the applicant shall deliver to the
Planning Board a certified check, made payable to the Town of Pepperell, in the amount
of $ 3000.00, as a deposit by the applicant for inspections. The check shall be deposited
with the Treasurer of the Town of Pepperell. The expense of all inspections shall be the
responsibility of the applicant. The charge for inspection shall be based on the rate
charged by the Planning Board Agent, and in the event that the deposit is insufficient to
cover the accumulated hours of inspection, the applicant shall be required to increase or
add to the deposit. In the event that the inspection time is less than the number of hours
that can be purchased with the total deposit, then all unused funds remaining in the
deposit shall be refunded to the applicant.

Pepperell Wetlands Protection Bylaw
1. Purpose and Application: The purpose of this Bylaw is to supplement the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Wetlands Protection Act, to further protect the wetlands, related water resources, and adjoining land areas in the Town of Pepperell by controlling activities considered by the Conservation Commission as likely to have significant or cumulative effect upon resource area values, including but not limited to the following: public or private water supply, groundwater, flood control, erosion and sedimentation control, storm damage prevention, water quality, water pollution control, fisheries, wildlife habitat, and rare species habitat deemed important to the community. This Bylaw is intended to utilize the Home Rule authority of this municipality to protect additional resource areas, for additional values, with additional standards and procedures stricter than those of the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L. Ch 131,§40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00) there under.

The definitions and forms, as well as the plan, notice, and hearing requirements utilized under the Wetland Protection Act shall continue to be applicable, and no additional application forms will be necessary. The Pepperell Conservation Commission is hereby designated as the enforcing authority for all matters within the jurisdiction of this Bylaw.

2. Resource Protection Setback: In addition to the requirements of the Wetlands Protection Act, there shall be a 50-foot wide undisturbed, vegetated strip of naturally occurring plant species maintained between certified vernal pools (Certified by Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife) or wetland resource areas (310 CMR 10.02(1), excluding land subject to flooding and riverfront area) and activities, as defined in the Wetlands Protection Act Regulations. The purpose of the 50-foot undisturbed strip is to filter out pollutants and sediment before they reach waterways, to help with floodwater absorption, and to support wildlife habitat. This additional requirement shall apply to all activities subject to the Wetlands Protection Act, except the following:

a. Activities with either current Board of Health permits, non-expired Orders of Conditions or non-expired Determinations of Applicability as of May 6, 2002, or activities for which Notices of Intent or Requests for Determination have been submitted, but not acted upon, prior to May 6, 2002.

b. "Limited projects" as defined by the Wetlands Protection Act Regulations General Provisions 310 CMR 10.00. These projects, more particularly described in 310 CMR 10.53(3), include but are not limited to public utilities, public roadways, agricultural projects, water dependent uses, and access driveways and roadways.

c. "Exempt activities" as defined by the Wetlands Protection Act Regulations 310 CMR 10.58(6). This includes, but is not limited to, the maintenance of existing landscaping, such as lawn mowing or pruning.

d. Replacement wetland areas, as allowed under 310 CMR 10.55(4), contiguous to existing wetlands.

e. Emergency projects, as defined in 310 CMR 10.06.

f. Repairs to or replacement of an existing sewage disposal system, including required grading allowed under 310 CMR 10.03(3).

g. Activities on lawfully created building lots shown on a plan recorded in the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds on or before May 6, 2002. Such plan shall bear the endorsement of the Planning Board of the Town of Pepperell if created after September 1, 1957 when the Town of Pepperell voted to accept the subdivision control law. Activities on these lots shall meet the provisions of this bylaw to the fullest extent possible. It is not the intent of this section to preclude building on an existing, approved building lot.

h. Activities determined by the Conservation Commission to have no effect on resource area values. The burden of proof for such a finding is on the applicant.

3. Filing Fees: The applicant shall pay fees additional to those required by the Wetland Protection Act Regulations by check made out to the Town of Pepperell. The fees shall be applicable to all filings or requests under the Wetland Protection Act and this Bylaw presented to the Conservation Commission after May 6, 2002 in accordance with the following fee schedule. These additional fees are instituted to pay for the true costs of administering the Wetlands Protection Act and this Bylaw. All municipal projects are exempt from Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act fees. No such projects shall be charged fees under this Bylaw.

a. Request for Determination of Applicability, $50 for activity associated with existing single family residences, $100 for all other projects.

b. Notice of Intent, Category 1 (existing single family residence projects), $50 per activity.

c. Notice of Intent, Category 2, 3, 4, or 5, $100 per activity.

d. Amendment to an Order of Conditions, $100.

e. Extension of an Order of Conditions, $100.

4. Appeals: In the event that any person has been aggrieved by a decision of the Pepperell Conservation Commission under this Bylaw, or by its failure to act thereunder, such person may appeal under M.G.L. Chapter 249, §4.

5. Severability: The invalidity of any section or provision of this Bylaw shall not invalidate any other section or provision thereof, nor shall it invalidate any permit or determination which previously has been issued.

6. Relationship to the Wetlands Protection Act: This Bylaw is adopted under the Home Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution and the Home Rule statutes, independent of the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L. Ch 131,§40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00) thereunder. Unless otherwise stated in this Bylaw the areas of jurisdiction, definitions, provisions, procedures, and performance standards of the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L. Ch 131,§40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00) shall continue to apply.
