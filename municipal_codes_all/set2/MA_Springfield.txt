ARTICLE V 

Responsible Employer Ordinance for Public Construction Contracts[Added 7-27-2009; amended 2-4-2019] 
§ 82-44. Purpose and preamble. 
Due to the City of Springfield's high level of unemployment, diversified workforce demographics, and large minority population, the residents ofSpringfield should be part of and benefit from public construction projectsin the City of Springfield. Therefore, it is appropriate for the City of Springfield to require that each public construction project, as definedherein, include employment opportunities for Springfield residents, minorities, women, and veterans through compliance with the ordinance codified in this article. Further, as the City finds and determines thattaxpayer money is most efficiently and productively spent by awardingconstruction contracts to firms that include and enforce provisions requiring compliance with state laws governing the payment of prevailingwages, the City Council hereby finds and determines that it is appropriatefor it to exercise entrepreneurial discretion by requiring firms that are awarded such contracts to comply with this article because a failure tocomply is injurious to the life, health and happiness of individuals employedby such firms and is deleterious to the quality of life in the City where most of such individuals reside. (As enacted on 07/27/2009) 
A. 	On February 2, 2019 the City of Springfield passed Ordinance Chapter82, Article V for the purpose of setting forth certain compliance standards for public works construction contracts; and 
B. 	Since the enactment of said ordinance, the City of Springfield hasengaged in further review and consideration of the contracting, which has highlighted the need to reexamine and further revise these contracting guidelines to better ensure they serve their intended purpose, comport with applicable federal and state law, and serve the best interests of Springfield; and 
C. 	The City of Springfield, like many states and localities across the UnitedStates, faces critical infrastructure needs that are substantial in scope and that must be addressed, which will require the City of Springfield toplan, manage and oversee major capital investments in both the shortand long term; and 
D. 	Securing successful delivery of public works projects is extremelydifficult due to the unique, complex, unpredictable and inherentlydangerous nature of the construction industry, wherein errors in project planning or execution can result in serious health and safetyrisks to project workers and/or the general public, unnecessary costoverruns, flawed or inferior projects, and disruptions in schedules that delay the use of critical government facilities; and 
E. The City of Springfield recognizes that the planning and execution ofsuch public works projects involves the exercise of essential police 
1:365 

§ 82-44 SPRINGFIELD CODE 	§ 82-45

ARTICLE XIII 
Assessments for Sanitary Sewers 
§ 300-58. Calculations and method of assessments for new public sewers. 
A proportionate cost of each extension of the public sewer system, includingthe cost of all required pumping stations and appurtenances thereto, shallbe distributed between the City and the abutters in an equitable manner, based on the estimated cost of the project. 
A. 	The proportionate cost shall be the sum of the following: 
(1) 	
The estimated cost of all eight-inch diameter and smaller public sewers, including appurtenances thereto. 

(2) 	
The proportionate share of the estimated costs of pumpingfacilities, including appurtenances thereto, determined by a direct ratio of design capacities as established by the Director. 

(3) 	
The proportionate share of the costs, as stated in this Part 2, of sewers larger than eight-inch diameter. For all public sewers larger than eight-inch diameter, the Director shall estimate thecost of eight-inch diameter public sewers required to serve theparcels within the sewer improvement area. The Director shall use the estimated cost of eight-inch diameter sewers to establish theproportionate share of the costs of sewers larger than eight-inchdiameter. 


B. 	The assessment for an individual parcel shall be the sum of a frontagecharge and an area charge. 
(1) 	
Frontage charge. 

(a) 	
The frontage charge shall be the product of the assessableabutter frontage and a charge per foot. The assessable abutterfrontage shall be the actual street frontage, but not less than the minimum frontage required by the Zoning Ordinance.Where a lot has frontage on more than one street, the shortestfrontage, but not less than the minimum frontage required by the Zoning Ordinance, shall be the assessable abutterfrontage. One-half of the length of any curve connecting twointersecting streets shall be included in the assessable abutter frontage. Where a parcel which has been (or could be underthe Zoning Ordinance) subdivided into two or more lots hasfrontage on more than one street, the total frontage shall be the assessable abutter frontage. Where one or more lotscan be classified as undeveloped property, a deferment of aportion of the assessment may be granted under Subsection C of § 300-64. 


1:655 

§ 300-58 	SPRINGFIELD CODE § 300-60 

(b) 	The charge per foot shall be the quotient of 20% of theestimated proportionate cost of all sewers, pump stations, and all other appurtenances that are required to serve that particular sewer improvement area divided by the total abutterfrontages in the sewer improvement area, whether or not some parcels may be deferred or excluded from assessment. 
(2) 	The area charge shall be the product of the assessable parcel areaand a charge per square foot. The assessable parcel area shall be equal to the total parcel area where the parcel depth is lessthan 100 feet; for parcels with lot depth greater than 100 feet,only that portion of the total area of the individual lots within 100 feet measured perpendicular to the street line shall be used forassessment purposes. The charge per square foot shall be 1 1/2%of the above frontage charge per foot. 
C. 	In no case shall the assessment exceed the benefit received by the landassessed. 
§ 300-59. Project costs to be paid by City. 
The City will pay the difference between the actual total project cost andthe summation of all calculated abutter costs within the sewer improvementarea, as described in § 300-58. 
A. 	The amount of assessments granted exemptions under § 300-63 will bepaid by the City. 
B. 	All assessments deferred under § 300-64 will be assumed by the City for the period of deferment. The City shall be reimbursed by the parcelowners for all deferred assessments as provided under § 300-64. 
C. 	The full amount of any abatement granted will be paid by the City. 
D. 	The assessments computed in accordance with § 300-58 and approvedby the City Council after the proceedings outlined in § 300-6 shall notbe increased as a result of exemptions, deferments, or abatements granted on some parcels. 
§ 300-60. Capacity charge to be paid by commercial and industrial users. 
A. 	A one-time capacity charge shall be paid upon connection to the City's wastewater works by all commercial and industrial users who contribute wastewater at a peak rate in excess of 10 cubic feet per minute according to the following schedule for each cubic foot perminute or fraction thereof of peak wastewater flow anticipated from the property: 
1:656 

B. 
C. 
D. 
E. 
F. 
G. 
Contribution Rate  
(cubic feet per minute)  Capacity Charge  
10 to 15  $100 per cfm for every cfm over 10cfm  
15 to 30  $500, plus $50 for each cfm over 15cfm  
Over 30  $1,250, plus $25 for each cfm over 30 

cfm 
Upon application for these services, the applicant shall submit an estimated peak wastewater flow, together with the information required in Article V of Part 1 of this chapter, plus any additional information requested by the Director for verification of the estimate. 
If the capacity charge computed above exceeds $500, the first $500shall be paid with the application and the balance may be paid in the same manner as a betterment assessment. 
At such time as the peak rate of discharge exceeds the amount paidfor in the capacity charge, application shall be made for the increased capacity required. Upon approval by the City, an additional capacitycharge shall be paid. This new capacity charge shall be calculated inaccordance with the above schedule. The amount due shall be equal to the total calculated capacity charge less credit for all previouspayments under this section. In the event that the City does not approvethe application for additional capacity, the applicant shall, within 60 days, reduce the sixty-day period allowed for reduction of flow that theactual discharge exceeds the approved capacity, shall be considereda separate violation of this Part 2. The discharger shall be subject to fine and penalty in accordance with Section 12(t) of Chapter V of 1972Revised Ordinances of Springfield. At any time, upon inspection by theCity, it is found that the discharge exceeds the approved capacity, he shall be subject to fine in accordance with Section 12(t) of Chapter V of1972 Revised Ordinances of Springfield for each day that the approvedflow is exceeded until a new application is approved. Each day shall be considered a separate offense. 
No reimbursement will be made by the City for reduction of peak rate. 
The capacity charges calculated above shall reimburse the City for capacity provided in the existing wastewater works; however, it willnot obligate the City to enlarge the capacity of the existing wastewaterworks for the benefit of an individual user. Should such enlargements be required, a separate agreement must be entered into with the City.Such agreement must provide for equitable cost recovery by the City. 
The dollar amount of the above capacity charge schedule will be revised annually by the ratio that the Engineering News Record Construction 
1:657 

§ 300-60 	SPRINGFIELD CODE § 300-62 

Cost Index for that date bears to 1850, which will become effective on the first Monday in January of each year. 
H. 	All commercial and industrial users who are connected to the publicsewer on the date that this Part 2 is adopted shall, within 180 daysfrom the date of adoption, make application for capacity on an official form obtained from the Director. Required capacity shall be computedtaking fully into account the reduction in peak discharge anticipatedby July 1977 through the separation of cooling water and the provision of equalization and surge facilities to minimize peak discharges. Priorto June 30, 1977, the Director will review the application, verify thepeak discharge, and establish the capacity charge. The capacity charge for an existing user shall be paid prior to July 1, 1977. In the eventthat the charge exceeds $500, an initial payment of $500 shall be madeprior to July 1, 1977, and the balance shall be paid in accordance with Subsection B of this section. 
I. 	Any user who qualifies for delayed payment of the capacity chargeunder § 300-64 shall forfeit such right if modifications are made (to the wastewater facilities, building, processes, production capability, etc.)which will result in an increase in the peak flow over that dischargedduring the six-month period prior to the adoption of this Part 2. 
J. 	Any user may add wastewater storage facilities which will store allpeak discharges for automatic release (controlled by time clock) duringtimes specified by or approved by the Director. If the facilities provided result in a discharge of peak flows during the hours of normal Citylow flow (1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.) and do not create a peak flow inthe public sewers greater than the average daily peak upstream of the user's discharge, then the Director may give an appropriate reductionin the capacity charge. 
§ 300-61. Wastewater service from municipal sewer. 
The owners of all properties who desire service of a public sewer or whoby law are required to have service shall pay the assessments and capacitycharges (where applicable) existing at the time of issuance of the permit (if the full assessments and charges have not already been paid) and usercharges, plus the cost of installing the necessary building sewers and private sewers (if required), including lifting devices where required as set out in § 300-19, the cost of making the connection(s) to the public sewer,and all applicable fees, as determined by the Director of Public Works. 
§ 300-62. Methods of payment. 
A. 	All assessments and charges arising from the extension of and/or theconnection to the City's wastewater works become liens against theproperties to which they apply in accordance with the provisions of the General Laws. 
1:658 

B. 	The abutters, whether or not they wish to connect to the wastewaterworks, shall pay the full assessment as a lump sum payment, or a portion of the assessment in a lump sum payment and the balance,with interest, in annual payments in accordance with the provisions ofChapter 80 of the General Laws. 
§ 300-63. Exemptions and reductions in assessments under special cases. 
In the event that property is included in the sewer improvement area which cannot be completely served by a gravity connection between thebuilding sewer and the public sewer or cannot be served in its entirety, theassessment against that property shall be adjusted accordingly: 
A. 	Owners of properties served only partially by new sewers shall pay an assessment based on the abutter frontage and assessable area computed for the number of minimum-sized lots (in accordance with the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance) which can be served (providingthe portion not served is not in common use with the portion served). 
B. 	An owner of a developed parcel which cannot be served by a gravity connection between the building sewer and public sewer will pay anassessment which is reduced by the amount equal to the extra costof providing a suitable pumping or lifting device adequate to lift the wastewater from the building plumbing system and discharge it to thepublic sewer. The owner shall fully document the extra cost involved tothe satisfaction of the Director of Public Works. 
(1) 	
The resulting reduction in the assessment shall not exceed the leastof: 

(a) 	
The reasonable extra cost to the owner; 

(b)

NOTE: 
* 	Or the assessment computed for the developed portion of the parcel, whichever amount is greater. 
(a) 	
The above schedule of deferment for undeveloped land shallapply only to the individual assessment on single parcels or on contiguous parcels; the total assessment on holdings of severalindividual scattered parcels shall not be considered. 

(b) 	
If the parcel is improved in such a manner that there is not enough undeveloped land area remaining for an additional lotin accordance with the Zoning Ordinance, then the owner mustpay the full assessment on the entire parcel. 


D. 	All deferments granted under Subsections B and C of this sectionshall be subject to an annual payment of the interest calculated at therate provided by law on the total amount deferred. Such rate shall be determined at the time of request for deferment and shall be clearlystated in the request submitted to the City Council for approval. Suchannual interest payments shall be added to the City property tax bill and shall be paid in the same manner as property taxes; delinquentpayments shall become liens on the property and shall be recorded andcollected in the same manner as assessments in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 80 of the General Laws. 
E.

§ 304-1. Findings and purpose. 
A. 	The City of Springfield recognizes that it has a compelling interest inprotecting children from the threat of sexual abuse; and 
B. 	Due to a child's vulnerability, the City Council is compelled to take aprotective role by adopting laws that are designed to protect the City'schildren from registered sex offenders; and 
C. 	Registered sex offenders continue to reside in direct proximity to publicand private schools; and 
D. 	Without adequate protective ordinances at the local level, registered sex offenders will continue to move to buildings, domiciles or residences in proximity to schools; and 
E. 	The City Council wishes to protect children in the education environment. 
§ 304-2. Intent and scope. 
A. 	The City Council finds that sex offenders pose a significant threat to the health and safety of the community and especially to children, whoseage and inexperience make them particularly vulnerable to the heinousand reprehensible acts of these offenders. 
B. 	The rate of recidivism among sex offenders is high. Limiting thefrequency of contact between registered sex offenders and areas wherechildren are likely to congregate reduces the opportunity and temptation, and can reduce the risk of repeated acts against children. 
C. 	After careful consideration, the City Council finds that this legislationis the most narrowly tailored means of limiting, to the fullest extent possible, the opportunity for registered sex offenders to approach orotherwise come in contact with children in places where children wouldnaturally congregate, and that the protection of the health and safety of our children is a compelling governmental interest. 
D. 	It is the intent of this chapter to serve and to protect the City'scompelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated 
1:671 

§ 304-2 SPRINGFIELD CODE 	§ 304-3 

numbers wherein certain registered sex offenders are prohibited fromloitering and establishing temporary or permanent residence. 
E. 	By the enactment of this or any other legislation, the City Councilunderstands that it cannot remove the threat posed to or guarantee thesafety of children, or assure the public that registered sex offenders will comply with the mandates of this chapter. This chapter is intendedto create a civil, nonpunitive regulatory scheme in order to protectchildren to the extent possible under the circumstances and not as a punitive measure of any kind. 
F. 	Registered sex offenders pose a clear threat to the children residing orvisiting in the community. Because registered sex offenders are more likely than any other type of offender to re-offend for another sexualoffense, the City Council of the City of Springfield desires to imposesafety precautions in furtherance of the goal of protecting the children. The purpose of this chapter is to reduce the potential risk of harm tochildren of the community by impacting the ability for registered sexoffenders to be in contact with unsuspecting children in locations that are primarily designed for use by or are primarily used by children,namely, the grounds of a public or private school for children, a park,or other private or public recreational facility.

The purpose and intent of this article is to foster the collection of unpaid taxes and assessments, promote neighborhood stability and reinvestmentand to reduce the large numbers of vacant and blighted conditions thatcontribute to the decline of neighborhoods. The City finds that certain neighborhoods have been adversely affected by the existence of substantialnumbers of vacant and blighted properties, and the creation of this programwould promote home ownership by owner-occupied residents as well as provide these neighborhoods with an economic stimulus and stability.Therefore, the City finds the blighted properties in the neighborhoods set out in § 355-14 of this chapter require significant rehabilitation, reconstruction or demolition to provide owner-occupied housing in decent,safe and sanitary conditions. The City further finds and determines thatsuch a program will forestall the costs and consequences of property tax foreclosure actions and will assist delinquent taxpayers in meeting theirobligations to the City while securing, expediting and expanding owner-occupied home ownership. During the term of any Urban Pioneer municipal tax repayment agreement, and provided that certain conditions listed beloware met, the City Treasurer/Collector may not bring an action to foreclosethe tax title account unless the taxpayer fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement.

ARTICLE 1 INTRODUCTION
SECTION 1.0 PURPOSE
The purposes of this Ordinance are to promote the general welfare of the City of Springfield, to protect the health and safety of its inhabitants, to promote economic development, to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the City, to preserve the cultural, historical, architectural, and OPEN SPACE heritage of the community, to increase the amenities of the City, and to reduce the hazard from fire by regulating the location, use, and arrangement of BUILDINGS and the urban and OPEN SPACEs around them.
SECTION 1.1 TITLE
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the Springfield Zoning Ordinance.
SECTION 1.2 AUTHORITY
This zoning ordinance is enacted in accordance with the provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) Chapter 40A, and any and all amendments thereto, and is authorized by Article 89 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the Home Rule Amendment). By the authority of the Home Rule Amendment, the City of Springfield has all legislative powers which the Massachusetts Legislature is empowered to grant to the City, regardless of whether or not such powers have been explicitly granted, except to the extent such powers are explicitly limited by any general or special law of the Commonwealth or by any federal law.
SECTION 1.3 INTRODUCTION AND USER GUIDE
This zoning ordinance enables Springfield to enhance economic development opportunities, protect neighborhood character, and preserve and enhance the urban fabric of the City. It is designed to strike a balance between achieving the communitys goals and protecting the property interests of landowners while providing a development approval process that is predictable, efficient and fair.
Section 1.3.10 Overview
This section provides a brief overview of the content of the zoning.
1.3.11 Definitions
Article 2 contains definitions of key terms, which are identified throughout the text using SMALL CAPS. Whenever there is a word in SMALL CAPS, it is a defined term that can be found in Article 2. For specialized definitions, such as those related to Signs, Article 2 references another location which contains those particular definitions.
Section 1.3 Introduction and User Guide 4
1.3.12 Land Use Districts
This Ordinance divides the City into land use districts and overlay districts and establishes rules for the use of land in each district. The text is accompanied by a ZONING MAP which shows where the various districts are located. Article 3 establishes the districts and identifies their purposes.
1.3.13 Allowed Uses, Procedures, and Special Situations
Article 4 contains a comprehensive Use Table (Table 4-4) which lists the uses or activities that are allowed in each district. For example, certain districts are primarily for residential use, but allow some other activities, such as HOME BASED BUSINESSES, but only if they meet certain standards. These special situations are described in the second half of Article 4. The Definitions in Article 2 explain what the different USE categories in the Use Table mean. Article 4 also includes Supplemental Regulations which address a variety of Use rules such as MOBILE HOME PARKS. The TIERED REVIEW process that is applied to certain uses in the Use Table is summarized below.
A. Tier 1: Administrative Site Plan Review.
1. Administrative Site Plan Review is a process where the USE is allowed by right and is reviewed using the criteria found in Section 12.2.20.
2. Administrative Site Plan Review is conducted by the Office of Planning and Economic Development, without a public meeting.
B. Tier 2: Planning Board Site Plan Review.
1. Planning Board Site Plan Review is similar to Administrative Site Plan Review, where the Use is allowed by right, but where conditions may be placed on the approval to better meet the intent or purpose of the district and using the criteria found in Section 12.3.50.
2. Planning Board Site Plan Review involves a public hearing. The PLANNING BOARD RULES AND REGULATIONS shall specify the process for conducting this hearing.
C. Tier 3 City Council Special Permit Review
1. The City Council Special Permit Review applies to projects that are likely to have a substantial impact and that therefore require review of the citys legislative body. The City Council must hold a
Section 1.3 Introduction and User Guide 5
public hearing and may consider the reasonableness of the USE for the site, as well as the design and impacts associated with the proposed USE under the criteria in Section 12.4.60.
D. Table 4-4, the Use Table includes a cross reference to Supplementary Regulations so that the reader sees whether a particular USE category has additional rules, such as a BED AND BREAKFAST.
1.3.14 Dimensional Standards
Article 5 contains dimensional tables for Residential, Commercial and Industrial Districts that describe the requirements for LOT size, required YARDS (also known as setbacks), and other requirements about the permissible amount, size, type, and location of DEVELOPMENT on a LOT.
1.3.15 Special Situations
Article 6 contains options for flexibility in DEVELOPMENT patterns, such as Campus Master Plans, which is an optional process for large institutions such as HOSPITALS and COLLEGES. ADULT ENTERTAINMENT and WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS are covered in this article as well.
1.3.16 Site Standards: Parking, Landscaping, etc.
Article 7 provides site design standards covering LANDSCAPING, PARKING and LOADING, lighting, vehicle access, and related matters. These apply to USES in all districts, with the exception of SINGLE-FAMILY residences.
1.3.17 Overlays and Special Districts
Article 8 covers overlay districts, which are designed to deal with unique characteristics of particular parts of the City, including floodplains, mixed-use neighborhood shopping areas, casinos and Urban Renewal Districts that have special zoning requirements. The provisions of the overlay districts apply in addition to those of the underlying land use district.
1.3.18 Sign Regulations
Article 9 contains SIGN regulations and the related special defined terms.
1.3.19 Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Lots
Article 10 contains rules for allowing the continuation
o

ARTICLE 4 USE REGULATIONS
SECTION 4.0 PURPOSE
The purpose of Article 4 is to establish regulations, standards, and review procedures for different uses of land in each of the ZONING DISTRICTS established by Article 3.
SECTION 4.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 4.1.10 Applicability of Use Regulations
Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance or by superseding state or federal law, BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, or land shall be used only for the purposes permitted in the specified districts as provided in this article.
Section 4.1.20 Determination of Use
The BUILDING COMMISSIONER, with guidance from this ordinance, shall determine whether any specific USE falls within a USE category listed in Table 4-4, Use Table, and if so, which category of USE. The determination of the Commissioner may be appealed to the Board of Appeals as provided in Section 11.2. When different USES occur together on a LOT and/or in the same BUILDING, (for example retail and office and/or residential) the USE which triggers the highest level of review shall determine the level of TIERED REVIEW for the entire application.
Section 4.1.30 Uses Not Listed
Any use not listed in Table 4-4, Use Table, shall be construed to be prohibited, except that the BUILDING COMMISSIONER may determine that a use not listed in the Use Table may be allowed if the use is substantially similar in character and impact to another use listed as permitted in the zoning district, subject to the same review and approval procedures as the listed USE.
SECTION 4.2 TIERED REVIEW LEVELS
Section 4.2.10 Tiered Review System
This Ordinance designates some USES as permitted AS OF RIGHT in specified districts, requiring only a BUILDING PERMIT as described in Article 11 and Article 12. Such USES are designated by a Y in Table 4-4, Use Table. USES not allowed are shown with an N in Table 4-4. For all other USES in Table 4-4, this Ordinance establishes a TIERED REVIEW based on the scale and potential impact of the particular USE. These tiers are outlined in Table 4-1.
Section 4.2 Tiered Review Levels Page 70
Section 4.2.20 Determination of Applicable Tiered Review
4.2.21 Tier Specified in Use Table
If Table 4-4 specifies that a certain USE is subject to a specific tier of review (1, 2 or 3), then that review level applies regardless of the size or impact of the USE.
4.2.22 Tier Not Specified in Use Table
In order to provide review procedures that match the scale of development, Table 4-4 designates many USE categories with a T designation. In that case, such USE is subject to SITE PLAN and/or Special Permit approval and the applicable TIERED REVIEW shall be based on the thresholds found in Table 4-2. These thresholds include common impact measurements such as number of DWELLINGS, FLOOR AREA, and BUILDING HEIGHT. It is the threshold that triggers the highest TIERED REVIEW that is the determining factor. In the case of a MIXED-USE BUILDING, or a USE where the threshold in Table 4-2 is not clear, then the TIERED REVIEW level shall be determined by the BUILDING COMMISSIONER, with guidance from this ordinance.
4.2.23 Higher Thresholds for Reuse of Existing Structures
Where an application for a proposed USE designated as T in table 4-4 involves the REUSE or expansion of an existing STRUCTURE in which at least three existing exterior walls will remain in place, the applicable tier shall be based on the thresholds in Table 4-2, Thresholds for TIERED REVIEW under the section Reuse of Existing Structures. The applicable TIERED REVIEW shall be based on the parameter in Table 4-2 (number of DWELLING UNITs, FLOOR AREA or HEIGHT) that triggers the highest level of TIERED REVIEW. The proposed size of the STRUCTUREs as modified (not in their existing condition) shall be used in determining which thresholds apply. In the case of a MIXED-USE BUILDING, or a USE where the threshold in Table 4-2 is not clear, then the level of TIERED REVIEW level shall be determined by the BUILDING COMMISSIONER.
4.2.24 Expansion of Uses and Changes of Tenancy and Use
A. A change of tenancy in an existing building in which the existing use is continued and no exterior site alterations are made, shall not require any approvals under this ordinance.
B. A new use occurring within an existing building shall not require any approvals under this ordinance, provided that the new use is not listed on Table 4-4 as requiring a Tier 3 special permit, that the building is not enlarged, and that no exterior site alterations are made.
C. As used in this section 4.2.24, the term exterior site alterations means any development occurring outside of an existing structure, excluding changes in the content of existing signage, the repair, replacement,
Section 4.2 Tiered Review Levels Page 71
upgrading, and maintenance of existing site facilities (such as landscaping, lighting, curb cuts, and parking, and changes to facades and storefronts.
D. Where an expansion of a building, or the construction of one (1) or more new buildings is proposed on the site of an existing building which is to be retained, such expansion or construction shall be reviewed according to the number of dwelling units or floor area as shown on Table 4-2. In applying Table 4-2, only the dwelling units and floor area being added to the site shall be counted in determining the applicable tier of review. If the building, lot or use is nonconforming, the provisions of Article 10 Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Lots shall apply to any expansion or construction.
E. The reuse of an existing building shall be reviewed as provided in Tables 4-2 and 4-4. A change of use within an existing building shall be reviewed as provided in B above.

ARTICLE 5 DIMENSIONAL AND INTENSITY REGULATIONS
SECTION 5.0 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to establish dimensional standards for all districts. As Article 4 deals with USES, this Article deals with the location and size of STRUCTURES. In addition to structural dimensions, this Article also contains the minimum LOT standards, which are related to the residential density (number of units per acre) and the intensity at which DEVELOPMENT occurs.
SECTION 5.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 5.1.10 Lots and Structures, Generally
5.1.11 No division of land shall be made which results in the creation of any LOT having dimensions less than the minimum required by this Article for the BUILDING or USE located thereon within the district in which the LOT is located.
5.1.12 No BUILDING, STRUCTURE, DEVELOPMENT or other improvement shall be constructed which results in any dimension or ratio that is greater than the maximum or less than the minimum required by this Article for the district in which the LOT is located.
Section 5.1.20 Specific Dimensional and Intensity Requirements
5.1.21 Lot Area
When this Article specifies a minimum LOT AREA, no PRINCIPAL BUILDING or USE shall be located on any LOT of lesser area, except as may be permitted by Section 10.2, NONCONFORMING LOTS.
5.1.22 Lot Frontage
When this Article specifies a minimum LOT FRONTAGE, no PRINCIPAL BUILDING or USE shall be located on a LOT which fronts a lesser distance on a STREET, except as may be permitted by Article 10.
5.1.23 Lot Width
When this Article specifies a minimum LOTWIDTH, no PRINCIPAL BUILDING shall be located where the LOTWIDTH is less than the specified width at the point of the BUILDING closest to the FRONT LOT LINE.
Section 5.1 General Provisions Page 140
5.1.24 Open Space
When this Article specifies a minimum percentage of OPEN SPACE, no BUILDING or USE shall be located on any LOT in a manner that does not provide such OPEN SPACE.
5.1.25 Yards
When this Article specifies a minimum YARD dimension, no BUILDING or STRUCTURE shall be erected within the specified distance from the applicable LOT LINE, except as permitted hereinafter.
5.1.26 Building Height
When this Article specifies a maximum BUILDING HEIGHT no part of a BUILDING shall exceed the specified number of stories, and no part of a BUILDING shall exceed the maximum height in feet, except as permitted hereinafter.
5.1.27 Building Coverage
When this Article specifies a maximum BUILDING COVERAGE, the percentage of a LOT covered by all BUILDINGs and STRUCTUREs, including ACCESSORY STRUCTUREs, shall not exceed said maximum BUILDING COVERAGE, except as permitted hereinafter.
Section 5.1.30 Application of Multiple Requirements
When this Article specifies two (2) requirements for the same dimension (e.g., maximum BUILDING HEIGHT stated both in feet and in stories, or minimum SIDE YARD stated both in feet and as a percentage of BUILDING HEIGHT), the more restrictive shall apply unless explicitly stated otherwise.

ARTICLE 7 SITE REGULATIONS
SECTION 7.0 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to establish site planning standards. In combination with Article 5, these provisions will help an applicant layout a site based on requirements for OFF-STREET PARKING, LANDSCAPING and SCREENING that are needed.
SECTION 7.1 OFF-STREET PARKING
Section 7.1.10 Off-street Parking Approach
The purpose of this section is to establish flexible regulations designed to ensure that adequate parking is provided for a particular use, taking into consideration its location and the type of neighborhood in which it is located. The number and location of parking spaces associated with a USE has a significant effect on the urban design quality of a place. This section balances the need for adequate parking with the need to avoid the negative impacts of highly visible parking lot construction, fitting parking facilities into the urban fabric in a manner that strengthens the Citys economy and improves its appearance.
Section 7.1.20 Applicability
Section 7.1 shall apply in all ZONING DISTRICTs, except that there shall be no OFF-STREET PARKING requirement imposed within the Business C District for non-residential USES.
Section 7.1.30 Number of Off-street Parking Spaces by Use Category
7.1.31 The presumptive parking requirements for land uses established below are intended to be adapted and modified to reflect the particular characteristics of a specific USE and the neighborhood in which it is located.
7.1.32 The requirements in Table 7-1 may be reduced in the course of Site Plan or Special Permit review based upon information presented by the applicant and city agencies. The applicants own estimate of parking demand, based upon the type of USE involved and its location, shall be given substantial deference. Other relevant considerations include:
A. The availability of public transportation;
B. Whether the subject property lies within walking distance from shopping, employment, restaurants, housing, schools, and other trip destinations;
C. The availability of shared parking with binding agreements to secure its long-term availability;
Section 7.1 Off-street Parking Page 182
D. The availability of safely usable on-street parking,
E. The provision of bicycle storage facilities, showers, lockers and related facilities to encourage bicycling; and
F. The establishment of transportation demand management measures to reduce automobile use.
7.1.33 In addition, Parking Generation, 3d edition (2004) published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers and Shared Parking Planning Guidelines (ITE 1995) or any subsequent editions of both documents, may be consulted for non-binding guidance in establishing appropriate parking requirements for a particular use.
7.1.34 For uses that are not listed in Table 7-1 below, there shall be no presumptive parking requirement and parking requirements shall be established at the time of Site Plan or Special Permit Review, based upon the criteria in Section 7.1.32 and 7.1.33.
7.1.35 If the USE category is allowed by right, and an applicant is applying for a BUILDING PERMIT under Section 11.1, then the applicant may request a Tier 1 Administrative Site Plan Review (Section 12.2) to change the presumptive parking requirements.
7.1.36 The term FLOOR AREA in Table 7-1 means NET FLOOR AREA and fractions should be rounded down to the closest whole number.
7.1.37 For developments with more than one (1) USE, parking shall be the cumulative parking requirements for all USES unless applicant provides evidence for a lower amount in accordance with 7.1.32.
7.1.38 Section 7.1.60 below includes additional parking alternatives.

Section 7.1.40 Dimensions of Off-street Parking Spaces
7.1.41 In a parking lot or parking BUILDING at least fifty (50) percent of the parking spaces must be eight and one-half (8 ½ ) feet wide by eighteen (18) feet deep. The remaining parking spaces may be eight (8) feet by sixteen (16) feet to accommodate smaller cars.
7.1.42 These parking space sizes are exclusive of driveways and aisles which must have direct access to a STREET or alley. Aisle widths are shown on Table 7-2.
7.1.43 Bumper or wheel guards shall be provided to keep cars from hanging over the public right-of-way or pedestrian facilities.

7.1.51 Applicability
This Section applies to all USES other than SINGLE-FAMILY and TWO-FAMILY DWELLINGS.
7.1.52 Location of Required Parking
A. The location of OFF-STREET PARKING shall be determined by the character of the immediate neighborhood where a particular USE is proposed to be located (the "Use"). In order to maintain a pedestrian friendly neighborhood where OFF-STREET PARKING is primarily located behind or to the side of a principal BUILDING and to encourage the extension of these types of neighborhoods in connection with proposed new development, OFF-STREET PARKING shall be located behind or to the side of the principal BUILDING when the dominant character of the immediate neighborhood is such that OFF-STREET PARKING is located primarily behind or to the side of BUILDINGS. There are numerous locations in neighborhoods throughout the City where it is inappropriate to require that OFF-STREET PARKING to be located behind or to the side of the principal BUILDING because of the dominant character of the immediate neighborhood where OFF-STREET PARKING is primarily located in front of BUILDINGS. For purposes of determining the dominant character of the immediate neighborhood with respect to the location of OFF-STREET PARKING, the location of OFF-STREET PARKING servicing parcels of land with BUILDINGS and other improvements (Parcels) located along the public way where the USE is located on the same side of the street and within one thousand (1,000) feet of each property line of the LOT where the USE is located shall constitute the immediate neighborhood with respect to such USE (the "Immediate Neighborhood"). Vacant lots shall not be counted and the Immediate Neighborhood shall consist of one thousand (1,000) feet of Parcels measured from each property line. The determination of the dominant character of the Immediate Neighborhood with respect to OFF-STREET PARKING shall be based upon the following:
Section 7.1 Off-street Parking Page 187
1. If the total number of linear feet of Parcels in the Immediate Neighborhood on either side of the LOT where OFF-STREET PARKING is located within the front of the BUILDING is greater than the number of linear feet of Parcels in the Immediate Neighborhood on either side of the LOT where OFF-STREET PARKING is located behind or to the side of the BUILDING, OFF-STREET PARKING in front of the BUILDING shall constitute the dominant character of the Immediate Neighborhood.
2. If Section 7.1.52.A.1 above is not satisfied, OFF-STREET PARKING behind or to the side of the BUILDING shall constitute the dominant character of the Immediate Neighborhood.
3. Where OFF-STREET PARKING is permitted in the front of the BUILDING, the applicant shall establish all required buffers as outlined in Section 7.1.53 below.
4. In the event of any dispute as to the character of the Immediate Neighborhood in relation to the location of OFF-STREET PARKING, the BUILDING COMMISSIONER shall be responsible for resolving any such dispute consistent with the provisions of Section 7.1.52.A.
C. Required OFF-STREET PARKING shall be provided either on the same LOT as the PRINCIPAL USE it is intended to serve, or on a LOT that is in the same ownership as the PRINCIPAL USE and located within three hundred (300) feet of it. OFF-STREET PARKING may be located on leased property within three hundred (300) feet if evidence of an executed lease is presented with an application.
D. OFF-STREET PARKING shall be clearly marked or striped which shall be maintained over time.
E. Parking required for two (2) or more BUILDINGS or USES may be provided in combined OFF-STREET PARKING facilities where such facilities will continue to be available for such BUILDINGs or uses.
7.1.53 Interior Parking Lot Landscaping and Design
A. Parking lots shall be designed and landscaped to avoid long, uninterrupted rows of vehicles by breaking them into separate parking lots divided by tree lines, alleys, pedestrian areas, or BUILDINGs. Parking lots containing more than seventy (70) spaces shall be divided into smaller areas by
Section 7.1 Off-street Parking Page 188
landscaped islands at least ten (10) feet wide located no more than one hundred and twenty (120) feet apart.
B. All islands shall be planted with three inch (3) minimum caliper shade trees native to the region or otherwise proven to be able to withstand conditions in urban parking lots, with at least one (1) tree for every thirty (30) linear feet of island.
C. Parking lots containing less than sixty (60) spaces shall provide at least one (1) three (3) inch minimum caliper shade tree per fifteen (15) spaces. In addition, all parking lots and vehicle display areas shall have a minimum of a three (3) foot landscaped buffer between the parking lot and the abutting sidewalks or STREET.
D. These requirements may be reduced and/or altered through the course of Site Plan Review.
7.1.54 Perimeter Screening of Off-street Parking Areas
A. OFF-STREET PARKING that adjoins LOTS in Residential Districts shall be screened from such Residential LOTS, as follows:
1. All illumination located in on OFF-STREET PARKING lots shall be shielded to avoid shining on abutting or other properties.
2. Such OFF-STREET PARKING shall use a BUFFER PLANTING STRIP consisting of a pervious landscaped surface, at least as wide as designated in Table 7-3 for buffers between adjoining ZONING DISTRICTs.
3. Such BUFFER PLANTING STRIP shall be landscaped for its full length and width and give maximum protection to an abutting property or district while also meeting the requirements for SIGHT TRIANGLE AREA described in Section 5.2.70.
4. The required screen shall be permanently maintained. It shall consist of dense evergreens, or an approved equal, not less than four (4) feet in height, and an appropriate wall or solid FENCE, not less than four (4) feet in height. (See Figure 7-1)
Section 7.1 Off-street Parking Page 189
Figure 7-1 Buffer Planting Strip
B. Residential USES which abut or are across the STREET from an OFF-STREET PARKING lot shall be protected from headlight glare by either:
1. A BUFFER PLANTING STRIP of at least seven (7) feet wide, densely planted with shrubs or trees which are at least three (3) feet high at the time of planting and which are of a type that may be expected to form a year-round dense screen.
2. Such screening shall be maintained in good condition at all times, and may be interrupted by normal entrances or exits.
7.1.55 Construction and Maintenance of Off-street Parking Lots
A. OFF-STREET PARKING lots shall be surfaced with bituminous concrete or its equal and properly maintained with adequate drainage. Parking spaces must be clearly marked and striped. Surfacing, grading, and drainage shall facilitate groundwater recharge in order to reduce stormwater runoff. All parking plans shall be reviewed and approved by the DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS.
Section 7.1 Off-street Parking Page 190
7.1.56 Lighting
A. Lighting within parking lots shall be on poles of twenty (20) feet maximum height, with color corrected lamps and cut-off luminaires designed to minimize glare and light pollution.
7.1.57 Nonconforming Parking Lots
A. NONCONFORMING parking lots shall be brought into conformity with this Section 7.1.30 to the extent practical whenever a Site Plan or Special Permit application is filed for either:
1. The expansion of a USE by more than twenty-five (25) percent gross FLOOR AREA, expansion of the parking area by more than twenty-five (25) percent of the number of parking spaces or
2. A new USE that will require an increase of more than twenty-five (25) percent in the number of parking spaces.
Section 7.1.60 Alternative Parking Solutions
7.1.61 Shared Parking
A. Where an application for a BUILDING PERMIT, Site Plan Approval, or Special Permit proposes shared parking with one (1) or more other separately owned properties and such shared parking has been approved, the owners of the properties shall enter into a legal agreement guaranteeing access to, use of, and management of designated shared parking spaces.
B. The agreement shall be in a form approved by the City Law Department and shall be included as an enforceable condition of any BUILDING PERMIT, Site Plan approval, or Special Permit.
7.1.62 Reduction of Parking Requirements for Providing Interconnections or Dedication of Land
A. Parking requirements may be reduced at the discretion of the reviewing authority where adjoining parking areas are connected directly to one another or to a service road or alley to reduce turning movements onto roads.
Section 7.3 Access and Circulation Page 191
Section 7.1.70 Parking of Trucks, Buses, and Commercial Vehicles
7.1.71 Parking stalls for trucks, buses, or other commercial vehicles exceeding either seven and a half (7 ½) feet in width or eighteen (18) feet in length shall be located at least one hundred (100) feet from the nearest DWELLING UNIT in a residential district.
7.1.72 Stalls for such vehicles shall be specifically identified in the site plan, and shall be of such dimensions as to accommodate the specified type of vehicle. Such vehicles shall be permitted to park only in the stalls so identified and approved.
SECTION 7.2 OFF-STREET LOADING
The specific loading requirements for a particular proposed USE shall be established through the Special Permit and /or Site Plan Review process based upon the operational characteristics of the use. Within the Business C District, OFF-STREET LOADING shall only be required if it is a practical option due to the availability of adequate space in a rear parking lot or alley.
Section 7.2.10 Layout of Loading Facilities
7.2.11 Each loading space shall be not less than ten (10) feet in width, fourteen (14) feet in height, and of such length that a truck or trailer occupying such a space shall be located entirely on the LOT with the BUILDING it is to serve, and shall not extend into sidewalks or the STREET.
7.2.12 Loading spaces may not include any of the required parking area. However, access ways and aisles may be used in common approaches to both parking areas and loading areas where approaches to both parking areas and loading areas are adequate for both.
SECTION 7.3 ACCESS AND CIRCULATION
Section 7.3.10 Driveway and Access Location Standards
7.3.11 Access to Off-street Parking areas

E. In accordance with a Tier 2 Site Plan Review (Section 12.3) the Planning Board may authorize, but not require, the owners of adjoining properties to establish common driveways under reciprocal easements provided that any such Special Permit shall not become effective until the easement has been recorded, notwithstanding the provisions above.
7.3.12 Access to Multi-Family Dwellings
A. In conformance with Section III-C of the Subdivision Rules and Regulations, the Planning Board shall determine the requirements for adequate access to each BUILDING. This includes the construction characteristics of the access driveways. In no case shall an access driveway or DRIVE be less than twenty (20) feet in paved width.
B. Principal criteria to be considered in this Site Plan Review are:
1. The distance from each BUILDING to the nearest way providing access. Generally, no rear wall of any BUILDING shall be more than three hundred (350) feet from a STREET built to City standards and no BUILDING shall exceed three hundred (300) feet in length.
2. Number of DWELLING UNITs or PARKING SPACES to be served by the way.
3. Accessibility to fire and other emergency or service vehicles.

Section 7.4 Fencing, Landscaping, and Screening Page 193
abutting a residential district. These requirements may be waived if it is determined that these requirements would make the accessory drive-through infeasible. This determination shall be made taking into account the required configuration of the building and related drive-through structure in order to provide drive-through services in relation to the size, shape and topography of the lot where such USE is proposed to be carried out. This prohibition applies to Structures, stacking lanes, and other related facilities.
7.3.22 This Section shall not prevent ACCESS DRIVES to DRIVE-THROUGH facilities from crossing such REQUIRED YARDS to gain access to properly located STRUCTUREs, stacking lanes, and other facilities.
SECTION 7.4 FENCING, LANDSCAPING, AND SCREENING

SECTION 8.3 REGIONAL SHOPPING CENTER OVERLAY DISTRICT
Section 8.3.10 Purpose
The stability and vitality of Springfields large SHOPPING CENTERS is vitally important to the economic welfare of Springfield and the neighborhoods in which these SHOPPING CENTERS are located. Since large anchor stores are a critical element in the success of a SHOPPING CENTER, it is necessary and appropriate to protect other users of the SHOPPING CENTER from potential harm that may be caused by changes to or the loss of an anchor store. Changes in USE or division of anchor stores in these locations into smaller shops can have a negative or positive impact on the
Article 8 Overlay Districts Page 211
viability of these commercial areas if the result is a significant change in customer traffic to the area. If the impact is a reduction in customer traffic, the result can be ABANDONED storefronts and blighted BUILDINGs. In order to protect the stability and viability of these areas and to prevent urban blight, Special Permit review is required to ensure that any change of USE or division of space in these locations does not adversely affect neighboring uses, BUILDINGS or the public welfare.
Section 8.3.20 Location

8.3.31 Any change of use involving the conversion of retail sales and services or personal services businesses to a use in any other category (unless such category is exempted from Special permit review by state law), and any division of interior space into two (2) or more smaller spaces, whether by subdivision of land, creation of separate leaseholds or licenses, division by condominium, or any other kind of spatial division that grants the right of different operators to use one existing interior space.
A. No BUILDING PERMIT shall be granted for the erection or demolition of interior walls of a STRUCTURE regulated by subsection (1) until such Special Permit approval is granted.
B. In issuing its determination as to whether or not to grant Special Permit approval, the City Council shall consider the impact of such change of USE or division of space on the character, built environment, vehicular and pedestrian access, traffic patterns, physical appearance, and structural integrity of the SHOPPING CENTER as a whole. The City Council shall grant approval only if it finds that such division will not have a negative impact on the SHOPPING CENTER as a whole. The City Council shall take into consideration the mix of uses and the sizes of different uses.
C. The City Councils approval of a Special Permit under this section may include a requirement that existing pedestrian and vehicular access and
Article 8 Overlay Districts Page 212
connections between uses be maintained, or that comparable substitute access is provided. Such pedestrian access may include the existing interior pedestrian connections between retail spaces within or between BUILDINGs.
D. A SHOPPING CENTER which is held in single ownership shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.

These regulations are designed to ensure that casinos and casino complexes contribute positively to the built environment, that the operation of casinos and casino complexes will help to enhance, expand, and stabilize employment and the local economy while simultaneously ensuring effective public services and a high quality of life for nearby businesses, institutions and residents.
The proposed development shall be subject to the provisions of a Host Community Agreement (HCA) approved by the City Council. The HCA shall establish a baseline site plan, design elevations, uses, program, signage concept, lighting concept, landscaping and streetscape plan and related information for the development.
After review and recommendation by the Office of Planning & Economic Development, the City Council shall review and approve site plans and design features for all casinos and casino complexes per the standards and criteria established herein. The Casino Overlay District and its provisions shall only apply to the specific properties so designated by the City Council as allowing a casino and related uses with a valid and current gaming license issued by the Commonwealth. Should a property so designated lose its gaming license at any point, the City Council may revoke the overlay designation and revert the property to its underlying zoning.
Section 8.5.20 Permitted Uses
CASINO and casino complexes, inclusive of accessory uses, including but not limited to retail, restaurants, hotels, accessory parking, housing, indoor place of amusement(s), outdoor place of amusement(s), daycare centers, support services and other complementary uses which enhance the success of the overall project as a viable, high quality urban entertainment venue.
Section 8.5.30 Site Plan Review
8.5.31 The Site Plan Review provisions of this Section shall apply to all STRUCTURES and USES located within the Casino Overlay District.
8.5.32 The Site Plan Review process shall follow the procedures outlined in Article 12, Section 12.3 except that the reviewing body shall be the City Council and not the Planning Board.
8.5.33 Notwithstanding pending Site Plan Review required for final project approval, site plan and design aspects which are consistent with those contained in the Host Community Agreement are pre-approved unless variations or modifications to them are proposed which exceed the provisions of 8.5.80 below.
Article 8 Overlay Districts Page 217
8.5.34 The intent of the signage regulations herein (Section 8.5.70) is to 1) guarantee minimum signage rights, 2) set parameters for specialty and unique signage inherent in urban casino and entertainment development that would exceed those minimums (such as parapet roof signs, reader boards, façade projections, etc.) so that it is understood that such additional signage is allowed, if done properly, and presented in an acceptable final signage submittal and 3) give the City final discretion on such specialty signage. Disapproval of a request in the Site Plan review for a particular specialty signage or lighting component shall not be cause to disapprove the Site Plan Review or the Use and the applicant would still have the right (if the other Site Plan Review criteria were met and approved as per Section 8.5.32) to proceed with the development without the requested specialty signage or with amended specialty signage approved by the City.
Section 8.5.40 Site Plan Review Submission Requirements

Section 10.1 Nonconforming Structures and Uses Page 263
ARTICLE 10 NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND LOTS
SECTION 10.0 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to address situations where a USE of land or a STRUCTURE legally existed prior to the adoption of this Ordinance but no longer conforms to one (1) or more requirements of this Ordinance. Such a USE of land or a STRUCTURE is known as NONCONFORMING. This Article describes how such USES and STRUCTURES may continue and how changes to NONCONFORMING USES and STRUCTURES may occur. The article also addresses NONCONFORMING LOTS and previously approved Special Permit USES.
SECTION 10.1 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND USES
Section 10.1.10 Applicability
10.1.11 This Ordinance, and amendments thereto, shall not apply to STRUCTURES or USES lawfully in existence or lawfully begun, or to a BUILDING PERMIT or Special Permit issued before the first publication of notice of the public hearing required by M.G.L Chapter 40A, Section 5, at which this Ordinance, or any part thereof, was adopted or amended.
10.1.12 This Ordinance, and amendments thereto, also shall not apply to a development project (including any future extensions, modifications, alterations or changes to structures or uses thereof), and the LOT(s) on which such development project is located as shown on an endorsed Approval-Not-Required (ANR) plan, if, as of the date of the final City Council vote adopting this Ordinance, the development project has received a Certificate from the Secretary of the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs with respect to a filed Environmental Notification Form (ENF) for the development project (which ENF included an analysis of traffic impacts and related mitigation).
10.1.13 Prior lawfully existing NONCONFORMING USES and STRUCTURES may continue until ABANDONED, provided that no extension, modification, alteration or change of such USE or STRUCTURE may be made except as provided in this Article 10.
Section 10.1.20 Nonconforming Uses
NONCONFORMING USES of BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES , and land may continue. Except as otherwise required by M.G.L. Chapter 40A, Section 6, no NONCONFORMING USE of BUILDING, STRUCTURE , or land shall be changed to another USE which is substantially different from the former NONCONFORMING USE, except one which is permitted by this Ordinance in the district in which the USE is located. Whenever a NONCONFORMING USE of land, STRUCTURE or BUILDING has been changed to a conforming USE, it shall not thereafter be changed to a NONCONFORMING USE.
Section 10.1 Nonconforming Structures and Uses Page 264
Section 10.1.30 Alteration of Nonconforming Structures or Uses
Preexisting NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES or USES may be extended or altered provided that no extension or alteration shall be permitted unless there is a finding by the permit granting authority or by a Tier 3 Special Permit Review by City Council that such change, extension or alteration shall not be substantially more detrimental that the existing NONCONFORMING USE to the neighborhood. Such findings shall be made by the special permit granting authority provided, however, that when the requested change is solely for the reconstruction, extension, or structural change of a pre-existing NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE with no change to the NONCONFORMING USE, such finding shall be made by the permit granting authority. Such finding shall be in the form of a Tier 3 Special Permit Review by City Council and such special permit shall conform to any subsequent amendments of this ordinance or bylaw unless the use or construction is commenced within a period of not more than six (6) months after issuance of the permit and in the case of construction, unless such construction is continued through to completion as continuously and expeditiously as is reasonable.
Section 10.1.40 Abandonment and Non-Use
Any NONCONFORMING USE of land, BUILDINGS or STRUCTURES not used or VACANT for a period of two (2) years or more shall not thereafter be re-established, except as provided below.

A. A NONCONFORMING residential STRUCTURE consisting of one (1), two (2) or three (3) DWELLING UNITS, may be REUSEd for the same USE provided that it complies with all applicable BUILDING CODE requirements.
B. A NONCONFORMING residential STRUCTURE, consisting of four (4) or more DWELLING UNITs, may be re-established by Tier 3 Special Permit Review by City Council, which shall make its determination taking into consideration the need to productively REUSE older BUILDINGs in the City. In the course of such Special Permit Review the City Council may waive otherwise applicable YARD, BUILDING HEIGHT, and OFF-STREET PARKING requirements.
10.1.42 Non-use, Non-residential and Mixed-use
Any NONCONFORMING MIXED-USE BUILDING or non-residential STRUCTURE or USE, including but not limited to, MOTOR VEHICLE related USES such as auto repair, auto body, brake and muffler shops, JUNKYARD, STORAGE YARD, CONTRACTORS SHOP or yard, trucking and auto sales, not used or ABANDONED or VACANT for a period of two (2) years or more, shall not be re-established without a Special Permit from the City Council.

Section 10.2.10 A Lot in Single and Separate Ownership
10.2.11 For purposes of this Section 10.2, single and separate ownership shall mean that the owner of a specific LOT does not have a sufficient ownership interest in an adjacent LOT to control the USE and disposition of that LOT. Where one (1) or more owners can control the USE and disposition of adjacent LOTs, such LOTs shall be deemed to be in common ownership.
10.2.12 In the case of a LOT held in SINGLE AND SEPARATE OWNERSHIP as of January 1, 1971, a LOT with an area of four thousand (4,000) square feet or more and a FRONTAGE of forty (40) feet or more, may be built upon with the following forms of review:

In the case of a single LOT held in ownership common with one (1) ADJACENT LOT that had a DWELLING on it at the time of enactment of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments thereto, a LOT with an area of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more with a FRONTAGE of fifty (50) feet or more, may be built upon for SINGLE-FAMILY or TWO-FAMILY use.
Section 10.2.30 Common Ownership of Four or Fewer Lots
In the case of four (4) or fewer such LOTS held in common ownership with those of ADJACENT land at the time of enactment of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments thereto, such LOTS with an area of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more and with a FRONTAGE of fifty (50) feet or more may be built upon for SINGLE-FAMILY or TWO-FAMILY USE regardless of the date of recording or endorsement.
Section 10.2.40 Common Ownership of More Than Four Lots
In the case of more than four (4) such LOTS held in common ownership with that of adjacent land at the time of the enactment of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments thereto, such LOTS may be built upon for SINGLE-FAMILY or TWO-FAMILY use only if the recording or endorsement occurred within five (5) years prior to the effective date of the amendments that made the LOTs NONCONFORMING, and the LOTS have an area of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more and a FRONTAGE of fifty (50) feet or more. In the case of more than four (4) NONCONFORMING LOTS in common ownership laid out more than five (5) years prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, the LOT LINES must be revised to conform with the minimum LOT size and FRONTAGE enacted as part of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments thereto.

Section 10.3 Pre-Existing Special Permit Uses Page 267
Section 10.2.60 Merged Lots
For the purpose of this Ordinance, any NONCONFORMING LOT which is increased in size by eliminating abutting LOT LINES, shall not be considered a new LOT and, therefore, will not have to meet the required minimum LOT size for the district, as long as the total area of the combined LOTS is four thousand (4,000) square feet or more.
Section 10.2.70 Alteration of Single and Two-family Structures on Nonconforming Lots
In the following circumstances, the reconstruction, extension, alteration or change (collectively alteration) to a SINGLE OR TWO-FAMILY STRUCTURE on a NONCONFORMING LOT shall not be considered an increase in the NONCONFORMITY and shall be permitted as of right:
10.2.71 Alteration on Lots with Insufficient Area
Alteration to a STRUCTURE which complies with all current SETBACK, FRONTAGE, and BUILDING HEIGHT requirements, but is located on a LOT with insufficient area, where the alteration will also comply with all of these current requirements;
10.2.72 Alteration on Lots with Insufficient Frontage
Alteration to a STRUCTURE which complies with all current YARD, LOT AREA, and BUILDING HEIGHT requirements but is located on a LOT with insufficient FRONTAGE, where the alteration will also comply with all of these current requirements.

ARTICLE 12 SPECIAL PERMIT AND SITE PLAN REVIEWS
SECTION 12.0 PURPOSE
The purpose of Special Permits and Site Plan Review is to provide a predictable and expeditious development review process, tailored to the scale of a proposed DEVELOPMENT, to enable the City to promote economic development while ensuring compatibility of different uses and minimizing the impact of proposed uses on their surroundings. Such review is also intended to ensure that DEVELOPMENT is designed in a way that fulfills the purposes of this Ordinance.
SECTION 12.1 APPLICABILITY AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 12.1.10 Applicability
This Ordinance includes three (3) tiers of review as set forth in Section 4.2  TIERED REVIEW System.
Section 12.1.20 Sequence of Steps
12.1.21 The following list provides the sequence of steps for the applicant as summarized in Diagram 12.1:
A. An applicant for any type of DEVELOPMENT review is advised to first contact the BUILDING COMMISSIONER S Office for advice as to which type of review is required, as provided in Section 11.1.11. The BUILDING COMMISSIONERS Office will make an initial screening review of the proposed project and indicate to the applicant whether one of the TIERED REVIEWS will apply to the application, and if so, which one.
B. Based upon that initial review, the applicant will be directed to make a specific type of application either to the BUILDING COMMISSIONER S Office for a USE AS OF RIGHT, or to the Office of Planning and Economic Development for all development review tiers.
C. If a proposed STRUCTURE or USE requires Site Plan Review and/or a Special Permit, after such approval has been issued, the applicant shall submit a BUILDING PERMIT application to the BUILDING COMMISSIONER S Office, consistent with all conditions and requirements of such approval. The BUILDING COMMISSIONER, in reviewing the application, shall ensure that all such conditions and requirements have been satisfied, including any required performance guarantees, and shall process the application as provided in Section 11.1.15.
Article 12 Special Permit and Site Plan Reviews Page 280
Section 12.1.30 Payment of Review Costs
In connection with any application for a Special Permit or Site Plan Review involving review by the Planning Board, Zoning Board of Appeals or City Council (i.e. Tiers 2 and 3), the applicant may be required to pay fees in advance to the City Treasurer to cover the reasonable costs of outside consultant review of such application. Such costs may include consultant fees covering planning, engineering, environmental analysis, wetland delineation, legal review, and other professional and technical services required for a proper and thorough review of the application. No permit shall be issued until all costs have been paid. The City Treasurer shall deposit such fees into a segregated account and return unexpended funds to the applicant as provided in M.G.L. Chapter 44, Section 53G and any regulations adopted pursuant thereto by the respective boards. The Office of Planning and Economic Development shall engage in a competitive bidding process periodically to select a group of consultants it considers to be qualified to review development proposals. Applicants shall select review consultants, in fields deemed necessary by the City, from this list of qualified consultants, and such consultants shall be retained by the City at the applicant's expense as provided in M.G.L. Chapter 44, Section 53G. In the event that a proposed development requires specialized expertise for which none of the consultants on the Citys list are qualified or that all consultants on the Citys list have a conflict of interest in reviewing a particular development proposal, the City shall select a consultant that has the requisite expertise or that does not have such a conflict, and shall provide the applicant with the opportunity to comment on the Citys proposed selection prior to retaining such consultant.

to the several lots therein, but which have not become public ways, and
ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions and in proper cases parks and open
areas.
The powers of a Planning Board and of a Board of Appeals under the Subdivision Control Law
shall be exercised with due regard for the provision of:
adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be safe and
convenient for travel;
for lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent public ways;

which such land is to be divided and the ways already existing or which are to be provided
by him for furnishing access to such lots, and the Planning Board has approved such plan in
the manner hereinafter provided."
B. Resubdivision
"After the approval of a plan the location and width of ways shown thereon shall not be
changed unless the plan is amended accordingly as provided in Section 81-W; but the
number, shape and size of lots shown on a plan so approved may, from time to time, be
changed without action by the Board, provided every lot so changed still has frontage on a
public way or way shown on a plan approved in accordance with the subdivision control
law of at least such distance, if any, as is then required by ordinance or by-law of said city or
town for erection of a building on such lot, and if no distance is so required, has such

city or town, without the consent of the Planning Board, and that such consent may be
conditional upon the providing of adequate ways furnishing access to each site for such
building, in the same manner as otherwise required for lots within a subdivision." (Section
81-Q, Chapter 41 G.L.)
D. Non-Subdivision
"Any person wishing to cause to be recorded a plan of land situated in a city or town in
which subdivision control law is in effect, who believes that his plan does not require
3
approval under the subdivision control law, may submit his plan to the Planning Board of
such city or town, in the manner prescribed in Section 81-T and, if the Board finds that the
plan does not require such approval, it shall forthwith, without a public hearing, endorse
thereon or cause to be endorsed thereon by a person authorized by it, the words "approval
under the subdivision control law not required" or words of similar import with appropriate
name or names signed thereto, and such endorsements shall be conclusive on all persons."
