(Referendum 11/2/10)
ARTICLE II. CITY COUNCIL
City of Portland Charter
Code of Ordinances
Article II Rev. 12-6-12
Section 1. City to be divided into election districts.
For the purpose of all elections the city, including its
islands, shall be divided into five (5) districts to establish
compact and contiguous districts of approximately equal
population.
The city council for voting purposes may by ordinance
divide the election districts into voting districts. (Referenda
11/2/76; 6/13/78; 11/4/86; 11/2/11)
Section 2. Composition, election, tenure of office.
The city council shall be composed of nine (9) members,
including the mayor who shall be one of the nine (9) members of
the city council, and shall hold office for a term of three (3)
years and until their successors are elected and qualified,
except as provided below for the term of mayor and for one at
large seat in the election of 2013 only. Four (4) members,
including the mayor, shall be elected at large from and by the
registered voters of the entire city, and one (1) shall be
elected from each of the five (5) districts heretofore provided
for, from and by the registered voters of each district.
References in this charter to the city council, councilors,
council, its members or membership, shall be deemed to include
the mayor, unless otherwise specifically provided.
For the municipal election in November of 2013, one of the
two at large seats up for election shall have a one-time four
year term ending in 2017. Thereafter, the council term shall
return to be three (3) years for this seat. The city clerk
shall designate which seat shall be for the four (4) year term
prior to the availability of nomination papers for the 2013
election, and nomination papers shall be separately issued for
reach of the two at large seats. Each at large candidate may
take out and file nomination papers for only one of the at large
seats. The municipal ballot will list the 4-year and 3-year
council seats as separate questions.
All candidates must be residents of the city for a period
of at least three (3) months prior to the date on or before
which nomination papers are to be filed. The candidate from each
of the five (5) districts must be a resident of such district
City of Portland Charter
Code of Ordinances
Article II Rev. 12-6-12
for a period of at least three (3) months prior to the date on
or before which the nomination papers are to be filed.
Beginning with the regular municipal election in November,
2011, the at large position then up for election shall be
designated as the mayor’s position and shall continue as the
mayor’s position thereafter. The position of mayor only shall
be elected by majority vote as provided in section 3 of this
article. The candidate(s) for mayor shall be nominated in the
same manner as other at large members of the council. The term
of mayor shall be four (4) years, with a maximum limit of two
(2) consecutive terms. The election and position of mayor shall
be a non-partisan, full-time position. (Referenda 12/1/75; 6/13/78;
11/4/86; 11/3/87; 11/2/10; 11/6/12)
Section 3. Ranked choice voting; instant runoff tabulation.
For the position of mayor only, the city clerk shall
implement a ranked choice voting protocol according to these
guidelines:
(a) The ballot shall give voters the option of ranking
mayoral candidates in order of choice.
(b) If a mayoral candidate receives a majority, i.e. at
least one more than fifty percent (50%) of the first
choice votes cast, that candidate is elected.
(c) If no candidate receives a majority of first choice
votes, an instant runoff re-tabulation shall be
promptly conducted by the city clerk and completed
within five (5) business days of the election. The
instant runoff re-tabulation shall be conducted in
successive rounds, with the majority determined for
each successive round by the number of votes cast in
that round. The candidate with the fewest votes after
each successive round in which no candidate receives a
majority of the votes cast in that round shall be
eliminated, and the votes in the successive rounds
shall be re-tabulated among the remaining candidates
until one candidate receives a majority of the votes
cast in that round. In each successive round, each
voter's ballot shall count as a single vote for
whichever candidate the voter has ranked highest who
has not been eliminated in a prior round, if any.
City of Portland Charter
Code of Ordinances
Article II Rev. 12-6-12
(d) After the first round, a majority is determined as at
least one (1) more than fifty percent (50%) of the
votes cast for a remaining candidate in a particular
round.
(e) The city clerk may adopt additional regulations
consistent with this subsection to implement these
provisions. The ballot shall contain instructions on
how to vote for each office. (Referendum 11/2/10)
Section 4. Compensation of councilors and mayor.
Except as otherwise provided in the paragraph below for the
mayor’s compensation, the city council shall by order establish
the amount each member shall be entitled to receive as
compensation for all services rendered, and specify when any
compensation shall be payable, but no such order increasing
their compensation, including that of the mayor, shall take
effect during the then current municipal year, and no such
payment of compensation shall be made in advance.
Prior to the date nomination papers are available for the
first mayoral election, the city council shall set the mayor’s
compensation and shall re-set it prior to the date nomination
papers are available for each mayoral election thereafter.
During the mayor’s term, the city council may adjust the mayor’s
compensation. At minimum, the mayor shall be paid compensation
consisting of a salary which is no less than one and one-half
(1.5) times the median household income for Portland as most
recently published by the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community
Survey, or successor index thereto, at the time such
compensation is set or adjusted, plus customary city benefits.
No member shall hold any office or employment the

examination, to the petitions.
If the clerk's certificate should show that the petitions
are insufficient, he or she shall advise both the city council
and also the person or persons whose removal was sought of that
fact. A finding of insufficiency shall not prejudice the filing
of a new petition for the same purpose, except that such new

date of the receipt of the clerk's certificate by the city
council. (Referenda 11/4/86; 11/2/10)

may consider expedient, so that all amendments thereto and all
ordinances hereafter passed may be inserted in their appropriate
place and all deletions may be extracted therefrom for the
purpose of maintaining such two (2) copies in such condition

manner that ready reference may be had thereto. In determining

No officer or employee of the city or member or employee of
any board or commission of the city shall issue, sell, or
distribute as a publication on the part of the city any book,

enactment, or as a digest, interpretation, resume, condensation,
or explanation of the same without submitting such book,
pamphlet, leaflet, card, circular or other printed matter, or
the portion of the same which purports to quote or give the law,

form and as to whether or not the law is correctly stated
therein.
(Code 1968, § 101.5)
Sec. 1-12. Numbering of sections.
No officer or employee of the city shall issue any book or

copy to the city manager, and one (1) copy to each department
head of the city and to such other persons in each department as
its head may designate. The city clerk shall sell copies of the
Code at such price as the city council shall fix; provided,
however, that the city council may direct such other free
distribution of the Code as it sees fit.
(Code 1968, § 101.7)
Sec. 1-14. Severability.
Should any provision or section of this Code or any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant to this Code be held
unconstitutional or invalid, such holding shall not be construed
as affecting the validity of any of the remaining provisions or
sections, it being the intent of the city council that this
Code, and rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto, shall
stand, notwithstanding the invalidity of any provision or
section thereof. The provisions of this section shall apply to
the amendment of any section of this Code, whether or not the
wording of this section is set forth in the amendatory
ordinance.

Sec. 1-15. General penalty; continuing violations.
(a) Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city
any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or
an offense, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of
any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to
be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the
violation of any such provision of this Code or any ordinance
shall be punished by a fine not less than one hundred dollars
($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each
offense. Wherever a minimum fine is established in this Code, it
shall be deemed a sum certain for each alleged offense in any
action brought to enforce this Code. Whenever in this Code a
minimum but no maximum fine or penalty is imposed, the court may
in its discretion fine the offender any sum of money exceeding
the minimum fine or penalty so fixed. Each act of violation and
every day upon which any such violation shall occur shall
constitute a separate offense.
(b) In all cases where the same offense is made punishable
or is created by different clauses or sections of this Code, the
corporation counsel may elect under which to proceed; but not
more than one (1) recovery shall be had against the same person
for the same offense.
(c) In addition to the penalties provided in subsection
(a), the city is authorized to institute, or cause to be
instituted by the corporation counsel, any and all actions, legal
or equitable, that may be appropriate or necessary for the
enforcement of the provisions of this Code.

Sec. 1-16. Uniform procedure for collecting assessments.
The following provisions shall apply to all liens created
by ordinance, except where this Code or state law expressly
provides otherwise:
(a) Assessments. Persons billed for assessments for
services which are enforceable by lien under this Code
or for sewer assessment charges shall have thirty (30)
days from the date of mailing in which to pay said
bill or to appeal to the city manager as provided
herein. If said bill remains unpaid at the end of the
City of Portland General Provisions
Code of Ordinances Chapter 1
Sec. 1-16 Rev. 12-1-00
1-9
thirty-day time period, the bill shall be deemed an
assessment against the property.
(b) Appeals.
1. Procedure. An appeal to the city manager may be
taken by a person aggrieved or affected by the
assessment by filing a notice of appeal within
thirty (30) days of the mailing of the bill, and
not thereafter.
A person filing an appeal must pay all
outstanding assessments, plus any interest and
fees owed on those assessments in order to enter
an appeal under this section. The manager may
waive the payments required under this paragraph
if the appeal seeks to correct administrative or
arithmetic errors only.
Every appeal shall be in writing and shall state
the basis for the appeal.
The city manager shall designate himself or any
agent or employee to act as hearing officer in
the appeal. The hearing officer shall provide
such person with the opportunity to be heard and
to demonstrate why the property is not subject to
the assessment.
The hearing officer may affirm, modify or vacate
the assessment appealed from. The written
decision of the hearing officer shall be issued
to the appellant within thirty (30) days of the
close of the hearing.
If the applicant prevails, the city shall refund
the appropriate amount within thirty (30) days of
the date of the written decision.
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the hearing

ARTICLE III-A. PORTLAND LAND BANK COMMISSION; FUND
Sec. 2-41. Definitions.
As used in this article, unless the context indicates otherwise,
the following terms have the following meanings:
Commission means the Portland Land Bank commission established
pursuant to section 2-42.
Land Bank means property interests of the types provided in
section 2-43(a) which are purchased, acquired or dedicated for the
conservation and open space purposes hereunder.
Land Bank fund means the fund established hereunder for the
purchase of property interests for the conservation and open space
purposes hereunder or for making grants or loans for such purposes.
Property interest means any fee simple interest in real property
and any lesser interest therein, including without limitation,
conservation restrictions and easements.
(Substitute Ord. No. 233, § 1, 4-5-99)
Sec. 2-42. Commission Established.
(a) Findings. The City Council hereby finds that:
1. There is a need to balance development within the
municipality with conservation of open space important for
wildlife, ecological, environmental, scenic or outdoor
recreational values;
2. there are insufficient financial resources currently in place
to plan for, and acquire significant open space lands or
easements which are or may become available within the
municipality or in adjoining buffer areas; and
City of Portland Administration
Code of Ordinances Chapter 2
Sec. 2-42 Rev. 7-10-14
2-1 6
3. there is a need to supplement the city’s open space
conservation efforts, without duplicating the efforts of
other public and private groups including the Portland
Planning Board, Portland Trails and the Portland Parks
Commission.
Therefore, in order to ensure the conservation and preservation of
limited open space with important wildlife, ecological, environmental,
scenic or outdoor recreational values, there is hereby established a
Portland Land Bank Commission, Portland Land Bank and a Portland Land
Bank Fund.
(b) Purposes. It shall be the purpose of the commission to:
1. work for the acquisition and conservation of open space
within the City, as defined in §2-43(a) below;
2. cooperate with other agencies and parties on wetlands
mitigation projects;
3. recommend on a priority basis the acquisition of various
interests in real estate in order to effectuate the goals of
this article;
4. accept gifts and funds from both private and public sources
and to disburse such funds in accordance with the
commission’s approved budget for the purposes hereunder;
5. act as a liaison to other public and private nonprofit
agencies involved in planning, acquisition, disposition, and
management of conservation and open space land within the
municipality; and
6. recommend an annual budget to the City Manager and City
Council to carry out its purposes.
(c) Appointment of commission. The Portland Land Bank Commission
shall consist of and be administered by nine (9) persons appointed by
the City Council for staggered three-year terms. Except as provided
below for non-voting members, the members must be legal residents of
the municipality and shall serve without compensation. One member of
the commission shall be appointed from the City Council. Neither a
municipal employee nor member of the Planning Board or Board of Appeals
may be a member of the commission. To the extent feasible,
representation on the board shall be diversified, including without
limitation, members representing environmental or conservation
interests, the Parks Commission, economic development, business and
financial interests, and the public generally. There shall be a
resident from each of the City Council districts on the commission.
(d) Non-voting members. In addition to the nine voting members,
City of Portland Administration
Code of Ordinances Chapter 2
Sec. 2-42 Rev. 7-10-14
2-1 7
the Board of Directors of Portland Trails and of Maine Audubon Society
shall each appoint one person from each of their memberships to serve
as non-voting members of the commission for three (3) year terms. The
only eligibility requirement for appointment to the non-voting
positions shall be membership in the respective group which they
represent. Such non-voting members shall serve at the pleasure of their
appointing Board of Directors.
(e) Vacancies. In the event of a permanent vacancy in the voting
members, the City Council shall, within 120 days of its occurrence,
appoint a person to serve for the unexpired term.
(f) Removal. Voting members of the commission may be removed by
the City Council for cause, after notice and hearing. Without limiting
the foregoing, excessive absences from regularly scheduled meetings
shall be considered cause for removal.
(g) Organization of commission. The commission shall annually
elect a chair, a secretary and a treasurer from among its voting
members and shall adopt reasonable rules for the conduct of its
meetings, which rules shall include provisions for public comment
substantially the same as those provided by City Council rules for
standing council committees. The decisions of the commission shall be
by majority vote of those present and voting and no business may be
transacted without a majority of the voting members present; provided,
however, five (5) votes shall always be required to authorize a grant
or loan for acquisition of, or to recommend to the council the
disposition of, any property interest acquired or disposed of
hereunder. The Commission shall keep accurate records of its meetings
and actions and shall file an annual report with the City Manager.
(h) Powers and duties of commission. The Commission:
1. Shall file annually with the City Council a registry of all
open space of the types in section 2-43(a), publicly or
privately owned, located within the city or abutting the City
as potential buffer areas, for the purpose of providing
information pertinent to property utilization, protection,
development or use of such open space. The registry must show
all property interests then currently held by the city,
including a description of the use of those interests and all
acquisitions, improvements or dispositions of all property
interests held by the city at any time during the year
preceding each filing. The commission shall determine and
list in the registry the open space lands which meet the
criteria in section 2-43(a) and which have significant value
for preservation through the land bank, and those which are
of lesser or no value for preservation and those which are
more appropriate for other uses. The foregoing determinations
shall include a prioritized list of any recommended
acquisitions for the Land Bank, as well as the commission’s
rationale for its determinations. The commission shall

Sec. 2-66. Physical standards and background investigation for
original appointment; Job suitability assessment for promotion, for
police lateral transfer and for police original appointment.
(a) Physical standards for original appointment.
(1) Medical examination. All candidates on the eligible list for
original appointment shall undergo a medical examination by a
physician specified by the employment subcommittee, said
medical examination to be done only after a conditional offer
of employment has been made to the candidate. The examining
physician shall report his or her findings in writing to the
subcommittee with respect to whether the candidate is
physically capable of meeting the standards established by
rule of the subcommittee. If the physician's report indicates
a disqualification which can be corrected, the candidate's
name shall be returned to the eligible list except that such
person shall not be again considered for appointment until
such time as he or she furnishes satisfactory evidence that
the disqualifying condition has been corrected. If the
physician's report indicates a disqualification which cannot
be corrected and which prevents the candidate from performing
an essential function of the position with or without
reasonable accommodation, the candidate's name shall be
permanently removed from the eligible list pursuant to
section 2-61 above.
(2) Physical fitness standards. In addition to the medical
examination, the employment subcommittee shall establish by
rule minimum standards and procedures for a physical fitness
assessment of candidates for original appointment, which
standards shall be determined by the subcommittee to be a
bona fide occupational qualification or failure to meet them
City of Portland Administration
Code of Ordinances Chapter 2
Sec. 2-66 Rev. 1-4-2010
2-46
poses a safety hazard or cannot be reasonably accommodated in
an individual case. Such physical fitness assessment shall be
administered to each candidate by the department as provided
in section 2-65(a)(3) above, and the result thereof shall be
provided to the chief.
(b) Background investigation for original appointment.
(1) Fingerprinting. Candidates for original appointment to
either department shall be directed to the police department
where they shall be fingerprinted. All candidates shall
execute any necessary waivers for the background check. The
fingerprints and records of each candidate shall be checked
against the local police files, state police files and, if
available, the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
in order to determine whether the candidate has been
convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense.
(2) Polygraph. Candidates for original appointment to the police
department shall be required to submit to a polygraph
examination to the extent such examination is permitted by
law.
(c) Job suitability assessment for promotional appointments, for
police lateral transfers and for police original appointments.
(1) All candidates whose names appear on any certified list for
promotional appointment may be required to be examined by a
psychologist for job suitability, the results of which
examination shall be used by the chief of the department and
by the city manager. Examinations hereunder for promotional
appointment shall be required every year, except that the
chief may waive said requirement if such examination has been
done within three years of the date of the candidate’s
appearance on a certified list, and the results are available
for use by the chief and the city manger. The extent of said
examination shall be determined by a psychologist on an
individual basis and may be either pre-offer or post-offer,
depending upon the content of the assessment, the
psychologist’s representation as to the purpose of the
assessment and the department’s preference.
To the extent permitted by law, the chief of either
department may request that candidates on an eligible list
undergo the job suitability examinations prior to drawing up
a certified list if (1) doing so would overcome scheduling
difficulties for a candidate and the candidate agrees to such
scheduling and (2) doing so is necessary to ensure a timely
appointment process. Nothing herein shall change a
candidate’s position on the eligible list or give him or her
any vested rights therein.
(2) Candidates for police lateral transfer shall be given a
City of Portland Administration
Code of Ordinances Chapter 2
Sec. 2-66 Rev. 1-4-2010
2-47
post-offer job suitability assessment.
(3) Candidates for police original appointment shall be given a
post-offer job suitability assessment as required by the
Maine Criminal Justice Academy.
(d) Failure to pass polygraph test or job suitability assessment
for police original appointment or job suitability assessment for
police lateral transfer or job suitability assessment for police or
fire promotional appointment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any candidate for police original appointment who fails to
pass a polygraph test as required hereunder, or, in the case of a
police original appointment, police lateral transfer or police or fire
promotional appointment, who fails to meet the job suitability
assessment pursuant to this section, shall be removed from any list on
which the candidate appears pursuant to section 2-61 above, and shall
not be eligible to retake the written test until two years from the
date the eligible list from which the candidate was removed was made.
(e) Failure to appear or complete hiring requirements. Any
candidate who fails to appear for, or to complete, any component of the
examination process, or any other requirement of the hiring procedure,
shall be disqualified as a candidate and removed from any list on which
he or she may appear. Such disqualification shall be reported to the
employment subcommittee by the Director. Upon request of the candidate,
the employment subcommittee may, in its discretion, waive the
disqualification herein if: (i) the subcommittee finds that the
candidate had sufficient excuse for such failure; and (ii) it finds
that any rescheduling necessitated by such failure can be accomplished
in a timely manner and with no disruption of the hiring process. Any
candidate disqualified hereunder may reapply for any succeeding
examination.
(f). Temporary withdrawal of applicants for original
appointments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a candidate for original
appointment may, for sufficient cause, temporarily withdraw from
consideration for a limited period of time upon the prior approval of
the chief of the department. Any denial of a request for temporary
withdrawal by the chief may be appealed to the subcommittee which may
grant the request if (i) the subcommittee finds that the candidate had
sufficient cause for such request; and (ii) it finds that any
rescheduling necessitated by request can be accomplished in a timely
manner with no disruption of the hiring process. A candidate who is
permitted to withdraw temporarily shall retain his or her place on the
eligible list but shall not be considered for hire, or in the case of
promotional appointment, shall not be placed on any certified list
requested during the period of temporary disqualification. “Sufficient
excuse” or “sufficient cause” as used herein shall include, but not be
limited to, death or serious illness of a family member; temporary
illness or disability of the candidate; completion of an academic or
training program, or similar excuse and cause.
(g) Duration of certified list. The certified list shall be
City of Portland Administration
Code of Ordinances Chapter 2
Sec. 2-66 Rev. 1-4-2010
2-48
limited to the vacancy or vacancies for which it was requested. The
names of persons not appointed shall be returned to the eligible list
from which they were drawn. Each candidate for promotion who is not
appointed shall be given, upon request, a statement by the chief of the
department as to the reason or reasons why he or she was not
recommended for appointment; or if he or she was recommended, a
statement from the City Manager as to why he or she was not appointed.

Sec. 2-67. Working test period.
(a) Except as otherwise provided below for police lateral
transfers or as otherwise provided for re-hires under subsection 2-
59(e), every person receiving any appointment or transferring pursuant
to section 2-59 above shall be tested for a working test period of one
(1) year while occupying the position to which he or she has been
appointed or transferred, except that the working test period for
original appointees or transferees to the police department shall be
two (2) years. The period of the working test shall begin immediately
upon appointment or transfer. The City Manager may at any time during
the working test period reject for reasons stated in writing any person
appointed to a position in either department. The City Manager shall
forthwith report to the employment subcommittee in writing each
rejection during such working test period, stating the date of the
rejection and the reason for the rejection.
(b) Any person rejected during the working test period shall have
no right of hearing, or appeal under this article, and in the case of a
promotional appointment, shall revert to the rank and pay status from
which he or she was promoted. No original appointment shall be
effective beyond the end of the working test period unless, within ten
(10) days preceding the end of the working test period, the City
Manager shall report to the employment subcommittee in writing that in
the opinion of the City Manager, the employee's work has been such as
to indicate that he is willing and able to perform his duties in a
satisfactory manner. Upon delivery of a favorable report from the City
Manager, the appointment shall become permanent.
(c) A police lateral transfer who has prior service as a police
officer at the time of appointment shall be credited with up to twelve
(12) months of service toward completion of the department’s two year
working test period, provided, however, that eligibility for
promotional appointment shall continue to be completion of three (3)
years in the Portland police department.

09/10, 1-4-10)
Sec. 2-68. Disciplinary action.
(a) Action by chief of department. Unless otherwise governed by a
City of Portland Administration
Code of Ordinances Chapter 2
Sec. 2-68 Rev. 3-6-2006
2-49
collective bargaining agreement, the chief of the department may, for
cause:
(1) Suspend without pay any member for one (1) offense for a
period of not more than fifteen (15) working days, resulting
in the loss of not more than three (3) weeks' pay;
(2) Issue a written reprimand to be included in the member's
personnel file.
Suspensions without pay shall not be for more than thirty (30) working
days in aggregate in a calendar year. Upon imposition of any
discipline, the chief shall immediately file with the employment
subcommittee a written statement of the disciplinary action taken and
the reason therefor. A copy of the statement shall be delivered to the
department member in person or by mail at the member's last and usual
place of abode. Actions of the chief taken within this subsection shall
be final and there shall be no appeal therefrom under this article.
(b) Action by subcommittee. The employment subcommittee shall
have the power and authority to demote, suspend with or without pay,
and remove members of the police department and the fire department for
cause and after presentation of charges and hearing. The subcommittee
shall have the right to reinstate any such demoted, suspended or
removed member of the police department or fire department after a
hearing upon recommendation of the chief of the department to which the
applicant seeks reinstatement, provided the City Manager joins in such
recommendation for reinstatement.
(c) Action by chief pending hearing. Pending a hearing before the
employment subcommittee, the chief of the department or the City
Manager may, for the cause to be presented to the subcommittee, suspend
any member, without pay, until the next succeeding meeting of the
subcommittee; provided, however, that no suspension without pay pending
a hearing by the subcommittee shall be effective for more than fifteen
(15) days; no suspension without pay shall be effective unless it is
either preceded by a filing of charges with the subcommittee or such
charges are filed within ten (10) days thereafter, Saturday, Sunday and
legal holidays excepted; and if the subcommittee determines that no
disciplinary action is warranted, it shall provide that any salary
which should have been paid during such period of suspension shall be
paid to the member.
A member may elect to waive a hearing before the employment
subcommittee and accept disciplinary action determined by the chief of
the department. Said waiver shall be made in writing prior to the
implementation of the discipline. Prior to waiving a subcommittee
hearing, the member shall be provided with written notice of the
charges against him or her, a brief statement of the evidence against
him or her, and an opportunity for a hearing before the chief. Said
hearing shall be informal in nature and shall not be an adversarial
hearing, but the member may have counsel and/or a union representative
present. The member shall have the right to confer with said counsel
City of Portland Administration
Code of Ordinances Chapter 2
Sec. 2-68 Rev. 3-6-2006
2-50
and/or representative during the hearing and to have them speak on his
or her behalf. The hearing before the chief may be tape recorded upon
the request of either party.
(d) Notice; opportunity to respond. Prior to suspending any
member without pay under subsection (c) above, the chief of the
department shall provide the member with notice of the substance of the
charges against him or her, a statement of the evidence, and an
opportunity to respond to said charges and evidence.
(e) Hearings without formal charges. Whether or not charges are
filed with the subcommittee, the subcommittee shall within thirty (30)
calendar days schedule a hearing to determine whether disciplinary
action should be taken against any member where:
(1) The member fails or refuses to testify before the
subcommittee at any disciplinary hearing; or
(2) The member becomes the defendant in a pending criminal
proceeding, the conviction in which proceeding would be a
disqualifying criminal conviction.
Either party may request a continuance of such hearing, which may be
granted by the subcommittee upon such terms and conditions as it deems
appropriate. If the continuance is requested by a city official, the
member shall receive his regular pay for the duration of the
continuance. However, if a suspended member requests a continuance of
the hearing, the member will not be paid for the duration of the
continuance period requested by him.
(f) No deferral of action. Disciplinary action by the
subcommittee for the same conduct which is the subject matter of a
pending criminal proceeding shall not be deferred unless the
subcommittee shall order such deferment at the request of the member
charged, in which case the subcommittee may impose reasonable
conditions, including but not necessarily limited to, a continuing
suspension without pay.
(g) Result of collateral criminal proceeding. The acquittal of
the member on criminal or civil charges involving material allegations
which are substantially similar to the material allegations made in the
disciplinary proceeding shall not require abatement of a disciplinary
proceeding by the Subcommittee. A final judgment of conviction of a
crime which is a disqualifying criminal offense shall operate as a
disqualification from office, and, upon proof of such conviction to the
subcommittee, such member shall be removed.
(h) Procedure at disciplinary hearings. All hearings of the
subcommittee shall be deemed to be civil in nature and shall be
informal in conduct. Such hearings shall be governed by this article
and by any rules of practice and procedure adopted by the subcommittee.
In the conduct of such hearings, the subcommittee shall not be bound to
the technical rules of evidence. No informality in any proceeding or
City of Portland Administration
Code of Ordinances Chapter 2
Sec. 2-68 Rev. 3-6-2006
2-51
hearing or in the manner of taking testimony before the subcommittee
shall invalidate any decision of the subcommittee. Disciplinary action
shall be taken only upon a preponderance of the evidence.
(i) Decision. After hearing, the subcommittee shall make written
findings of fact with respect to any specific allegations and shall
determine whether such facts constitute cause for disciplinary action,
and if the subcommittee determines that cause for disciplinary action
exists, the nature of the disciplinary action to be taken. Such
decision may be appealed as provided by law.
(j) Expenses. The subcommittee may, if it determines that charges
made were without substantial justification, recommend to the City
Council the payment of reasonable counsel and witness fees incurred by
any member in the defense of such unjustified charges.

may be specifically promulgated for any particular procurement
situation.

and responsible bidder or proposer, in addition to price and compliance
with all applicable bid specifications, the City Manager or Finance
Director may consider:

service within the time specified, without delay or
interference;
(3) The past and current compliance with City laws and
ordinances;

the bidder or proposer to perform the contract or provide the
service.

Director may disqualify a bidder or proposer from contracting with the

foregoing factors used for determining the qualifications of a bidder
or proposer.

issue a written decision, which decision shall be final.
(Ord. No. 131-00, 12-18-00)
Sec. 2-310. No prohibition.
Nothing herein is intended, nor shall it be deemed, to prevent or
prohibit the City Manager from requiring Council approval of any
proposed City contract, purchase or lease should he or she choose to do
so. Nothing in this article shall bind the City Council in its choice
of a contractor or consultant including, but not limited to, the choice
of an auditor pursuant to article VII, section 1 of the Charter.
(Ord. No. 376-90, § 3, 6-6-90; Ord. No. 131-00, 12-18-00)

persons within the school department to assume the authority of the

not required, or by a malfunctioning alarm system. However, "false
alarm" does not include signals emitted by an alarm system

an authorized alarm agent that the alarm system has been inspected
and is in proper working order.

status of the alarm system or property ownership. Any changes to
the permit shall require the payment of a fee and any change in
property ownership shall require the filing of a new permit
application along with the full application fee.

developer's violation or violations of any
provision in articles II, III, or IV of this
chapter create such a threat to life or safety that
a structure must be posted against occupancy or

Sec. 6-132. Lodging facility.
(a) Statement of policy. The intent of this section is to
provide tenant-at-will status to residents of lodging facilities,
as defined in section 6-106, after they have resided in a unit
for thirty (30) days or more. Such lodging facilities offers
sleeping accommodations but few other amenities, and residents of
such housing in the past have been subjected to summary eviction
procedures by landlords who purposefully characterize their
rentals as “lodging houses” and thereby purport to act under
state law in ejecting occupants without any recourse, regardless
of the length of residency.

more units. The requirements of this section shall apply to
buildings or structures containing three (3) or more lodging
facility units.

occupancy. Any person who has occupied a lodging facility unit
situated at the same building or structure for thirty (30)
consecutive days and has paid rent for that thirty (30) day
period will be deemed to have achieved the status of a tenant at
will as of the 30th day and may not thereafter be evicted except
in accordance with the requirements of Maine’s Forcible Entry and
Detainer Law (14 M.R.S.A. § 6001, et seq.)
(e) Termination of owner’s interest.
(1) Upon termination of an owner’s interest in any building
or structure operating as a lodging facility, whether
by sale, assignment, death, appointment of a receiver
or otherwise, the owner shall advise the successor in
title, the City of Portland and all occupants of a
lodging facility who have qualified under subsection
(d) above of the status of such occupants, which shall
be binding upon the successor in title as though it
were the owner when the status was achieved.
(2) Notice to the City of Portland shall be addressed to:

ARTICLE VI. RESIDENTIAL RENTAL UNIT REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
Sec. 6-150. Purpose.
The proliferation of real estate proprietorships,
partnerships, and trusts having undisclosed, anonymous or otherwise
unidentifiable principals, owning large numbers of residential long
term rental properties, sometimes managed through unresponsive
property management companies, has impeded the proper enforcement
of this chapter, chapter 12 and other ordinances of the city. Nonowner
occupied short term rental units may remove housing units
from the long term rental market and may contribute to the increase
in the cost of rental housing in the City.
This article is intended to require the disclosure of the
ownership of such property, and to regulate the renting of property
within the City, and to make owners and persons responsible for the
maintenance of property more accessible and accountable with
respect to the premises, to ensure that housing units remain
available for rent to those who reside or seek to reside within the
City, to ensure that residential areas are not unduly impacted by
the operation of short term rentals, and to ensure that owners and
tenants comply with chapters 6 and 10 of the City Code.

ARTICLE IV. HYDRANTS
Sec. 10-26. Purpose; definition.
(a) Purpose. In order to protect public safety and welfare
and ensure a fully operational municipal fire protection system,
it is necessary to ensure that private fire hydrants located
within the city are properly maintained, are accessible at all
times, and are compatible with the municipal water main system.
Failure to maintain such private fire hydrants in good operating
condition may negatively impact upon the entire water main system
and present a public hazard. To avoid such hazard and to protect
public safety, it is necessary to regulate the installation,
upgrading, access and maintenance of all such private fire
hydrants wherever located in the city and regardless of the use
of the property upon which they are located.
(b) Private fire hydrant as used herein shall mean and
include any fire hydrant which is owned, leased, or otherwise
under the control of any person other than the Portland Water
District and shall include any such hydrant regardless of the use
of the property upon which it is located.
(Ord. No. 193-97, § 3, 2-3-97)
Sec. 10-26.5. Use of Fire Hydrants.
All unauthorized uses of hydrants may negatively impact the
water system and the firefighting capability of the hydrant. No
person, other than a person authorized to do so by the fire
chief, shall use, open, or otherwise tamper with a public or
private fire hydrant and it shall be a violation of this Code for
any unauthorized person to so use, open or otherwise tamper with
a public or private fire hydrant. It shall further be a violation
of this Code for any person to shovel, blow or otherwise move
snow or ice onto or around any hydrant, public or private, in
such a manner as to decrease or restrict access to such hydrant.
(Ord. No. 193-97, § 1, 2-3-97, Ord. No. 188-00, § 6, 4-24-00)

upgraded on or after the effective date of this article must meet
all of the standards utilized by the Portland Water District at
the time of such installation. In addition, such hydrants shall
meet the fire flow, marking and location standards adopted by the
National Fire Protection Association and in effect at the time of
such installation. The owner of the private fire hydrant shall
provide certification of meeting such standards upon installation
in the same manner as provided in section 10-28(a)(1) below. It
shall be a violation of this Code to provide false certification
under this article.
(b) Any private fire hydrant installed prior to the
effective date of this article which does not meet any of the
above standards must be upgraded to meet the current applicable
standard or standards utilized by the Portland Water District
upon any change in occupancy or use of the property.

program utilized by the Portland Water District, and with the
following standards, at a minimum:
(1) No less than an annual inspection, annual written
statement describing the owner’s maintenance program and
who is responsible for carrying out that program and
annual written certification in regard to fire flow and
operability by a person qualified to make such
certification, which all shall be sent to the fire chief,
with a copy to the Portland Water District;
(2) Painting to match City Hydrants except that the body
shall be red, no less than every five (5) years;
(3) Repair of any and all damage to the hydrant, within no
less than seventy-two (72) hours of actual notice of such
damage.

(a) The owner of property upon which a private fire hydrant
is located shall be responsible for ensuring that said hydrant is
accessible for use by the fire department at all times.
(b) Accessible for use shall mean and include:
(1) That no later than March 31, 2001, the owner provides an
emergency access lane from a public right-of-way to the
hydrant, which access lane meets the standards under
articles IV and V of chapter 14 of this Code and the
"Section IV: Public Safety Standards" of the Technical
and Design Standards as adopted by the Portland Planning
Board; a map identifying the location of said lane shall
be provided to the fire chief upon request;
(2) That the owner maintains and repairs the emergency access
lane required hereunder, which maintenance and repair
shall include snow and ice removal, removal of
obstruction and encumbrances, including but not limited
to debris, junked vehicles and other refuse, so that the
emergency access lane shall remain reasonably passable
for firefighting and preventive apparatus and vehicles
and other public emergency vehicles of the city;
(3) That the owner removes snow from the emergency access
lane so that at no time shall the snow accumulate to an
average depth in excess of four (4) inches and shall also
remove snow from the lane of a depth of less than four
(4) inches if subsequent rain, hail or temperatures
result in the snow on the lane becoming so frozen as to
render the lane impassable by such firefighting and
public emergency vehicles; and
(4) That the owner removes snow in accordance with the
Standard for Hydrant Snow Removal of the Portland Fire
Department, which shall include removal of snow for no
less than forty-eight (48) inches from around the hydrant
in all directions, with a minimum forty-eight-inch
pathway to the open street or accessway.
(c) In addition to any other remedies provided herein, if the

owner shall fail to remove such ice within twenty-four (24) hours
after ice has accumulated or formed to the state as to render the
emergency access lane impassable for said purposes, or if the owner
shall fail to remove said obstructions and encumbrances on the
emergency access lane (that are not the result of precipitation)
which render the emergency access lane impassable for said purposes
within twenty-four (24) hours after such obstructions and
encumbrances arise, then the city shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to enter upon the emergency access lane and adjacent
land as necessary with men and machines in order to plow and clear,
or cause to be plowed and cleared, such snow and ice and to remove
said obstructions and encumbrances from the emergency access lane
and bill the owner for the expense of the same. The city shall
submit its itemized bill for such expenses to the owner which the
owner shall pay to the city within sixty (60) days of receipt. The
expenses billed to the owner shall include the time spent for
travel to and from the property.
(d) Nothing herein is intended, nor shall it be construed to
modify, amend or otherwise change any requirement to enter into an
emergency access lane agreement pursuant to articles IV or V of
chapter 14 of this Code and the standards adopted by the Portland
Planning Board nor to modify, amend or otherwise change the
requirements of any such executed emergency access lane agreement.

(Ord. No. 192A-93, 1-25-93; Ord. No. 112-96, § 3, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 140-02/03,
1-22-03; Ord. No. 219-02/03, 4-28-03; Ord. No. 165-15/16, 3-7-2016; Ord. 18-

Sec. 12-109.1. License fees.
(a) Established. The city council shall by order establish
the following fees on commercial refuse collectors or refuse
transporters:
(1) A general license fee for every commercial refuse
collector or refuse transporter;
City of Portland Garbage, Wastes and Junk
Code of Ordinances Chapter 12
Sec. 12-114 Rev. 3-23-11
12-32
(2) A vehicle license fee on each vehicle used by a
commercial refuse collector or a refuse transporter to
collect or transport Portland waste within the city;
(3) A fee on each container, capable of holding ten (10) or
more cubic yards of construction and demolition waste
or recyclables, used by a commercial refuse collector
or a refuse transporter to hold Portland waste;
(4) A tonnage fee on each ton of Portland waste collected
or transported.
(b) Calculation of tonnage fee. The tonnage fee shall be a
fee determined in a fiscal basis by multiplying the fee per ton
times the number of tons of Portland waste that the public works
authority estimates that a collector or transporter will collect
or transport in the next fiscal year.
The public works authority is authorized but not required to
rely upon tonnage reports produced by RWS in calculating the fees
herein.
The minimum tonnage estimate for the period January 1, 1997,
to June 30, 1997, shall be half of the tonnage figures supplied
by RWS for the period July 1, 1995, to June 30, 1996, which is
hereby established as the base year for the purpose of estimating
the minimum tonnage for commercial refuse collectors or refuse
transporters identified in the RWS figures. Any tonnage that is
hauled by a commercial refuse collector but is attributed by RWS
to a generator within the City of Portland shall be added to the
tonnage for which the collector must pay the tonnage fee.
(c) Payment of tonnage fee. The tonnage fee shall be
payable monthly to the public works authority in twelve (12)
equal installments, except for the period January 1, 1997, to
June 30, 1997, which shall be paid in six (6) equal installments.
Each payment is due fifteen (15) days after the end of the month
for which payment is being made.
(d) Adjustment of tonnage fee.
(1) During a fiscal year the tonnage fee shall not be
reduced unless a licensee files a written request with
supporting documents with the public works authority
that demonstrates that the number of tons used in the
original estimate will be at least twenty (20) percent
higher than the actual tonnage hauled due to a change
in conditions that occurred after the original estimate
City of Portland Garbage, Wastes and Junk
Code of Ordinances Chapter 12
Sec. 12-114 Rev. 3-23-11
12-33
was made.
(2) During a fiscal year the tonnage fee may be increased
by the public works authority whenever it determines
that an original estimate is too low due to a change
that occurred after the original estimate was made.
Thirty (30) days prior to increasing a tonnage fee, the
public works authority shall send a written notice of
its intent to increase the fee and the reasons for that
increase, but the increase may be charged from the date
the notice of increase is mailed or delivered.
(3) After a fiscal year, the public works authority may
award a credit for the next fiscal year to any
commercial refuse collector or refuse transporter who
filed written notice with supporting documents by
certified mail return receipt requested during a fiscal
year that demonstrates that the number of tons used in
the original estimate was too high in relation to the
number of tons actually hauled or transported. To be
eligible for this credit, the hauler or transporter
must have sent the written notice and documents within
ten (10) days of the date upon which the hauler or
transporter knew or should have known of the change in
conditions.
(e) Interest on unpaid tonnage fees. Interest on unpaid
fees shall begin on the sixteenth day after the end of the month
for which payment is owed. The rate of interest shall be the rate
established annually by the council on unpaid property taxes.
(f) Additional fees. An additional fee of three (3) times
the cost of any required license or permit fee shall be charged
for the issuance of any license or permit after expiration of the
holder's prior license unless the application for renewal of the
license was filed prior to such expiration.
(g) Proration of fees. The fee for a license which is
issued after July first of each fiscal year shall be prorated for
each full month the licensee will not have the use of the license
only if the licensee provides verification that it is a business
which was not in existence as of July first. In the event that
the licensee is a new business, the license fee shall be reduced
by ten (10) percent for each full month that the licensee shall
not have use of the license, but in no case shall the license fee
be reduced by more than fifty (50) percent.
(h) Application of fees. All fees established by this
chapter shall be placed in a separate account. Funds from that
City of Portland Garbage, Wastes and Junk
Code of Ordinances Chapter 12
Sec. 12-114 Rev. 3-23-11
12-34
account may only be used to pay for the city's cost of solid
waste disposal, which costs shall include but not be limited to
the costs necessary for administration, inspection, enforcement,
and to meet the city's financial obligation to RWS.
(Ord. No. 112-96, § 4, 11-4-96)
Sec. 12-109.2. Application process.
Licensed applicants who wish to be licensed for the next
fiscal year must file their applications on or before March first
with the documentation required by the public works authority,
except that for the period of January 1, 1997, to June 30, 1997,
the applications and documents must be filed by December 1, 1996.
The public works authority may require accurate lists
containing such information as the public works authority deems
necessary, including but not limited to size and location of
waste containers used to collect or transport Portland waste, the
frequency with which such containers are emptied, the amount of
Portland waste tonnage collected or transported per haul during
the preceding twelve (12) months, and the total Portland waste
tonnage collected or transported by the collector or transporter
during the preceding twelve (12) months, and the collector's or
transporter's estimate of the amount of Portland waste tonnage
that will be collected or hauled during the upcoming fiscal year.
If an applicant does not furnish the requested information,
the applicant is barred from making a request to the public works
authority to change the estimated tonnage, or from taking an
appeal from the public works authority's tonnage estimate, but
such written information and other information shall not be
conclusive upon the public works authority.
Commencing in 2003, each license application shall be
accompanied by evidence of a waste hauling agreement between the
applicant and RWS for disposal of Portland waste collected or
transported by the applicant from the date that the application
is filed and throughout the upcoming license year.
(Ord. No. 112-96, § 5, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 140-02/03, 1-22-03)
Sec. 12-109.3. RWS notification and authorization.
A copy of each commercial refuse collector or refuse
transporter license issued and of each application therefor shall
be sent by the city to RWS. Upon issuing a commercial hauler or
refuse transporter license hereunder, the city shall also issue
to the commercial refuse collector or refuse transporter for each
vehicle to be used by it a vehicle license which shall be a
numbered sticker and shall inform RWS of the number on the
sticker. A licensed commercial refuse collector or refuse

Sec. 12-114 Rev. 3-23-11
12-35
transporter shall affix this numbered sticker to each vehicle
owned or operated by it as required by RWS or the city.
A licensed commercial refuse collector or refuse transporter
shall comply with the terms of any agreement with RWS for
disposal of waste collected or transported by such collector or
transporter, and RWS is authorized and directed to notify the
public works authority of any noncompliance with any terms of
such agreement. RWS is authorized and directed to admit waste
generated in the City of Portland for processing to its
facilities only from Portland commercial collectors and refuse
transporters who are licensed and whose vehicles are licensed as
provided herein.
(Ord. No. 112-96, § 6, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 140-02/03, 1-22-03)
Sec. 12-109.4. Exemption for small collectors or transporters.
The license and fee requirements of this chapter shall not
apply to collectors or transporters who collect or transport less
than ten (10) tons of Portland waste per year.
(Ord. No. 112-96, § 7, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 303-97, § 1, 5-19-97)
Sec. 12-110. Licensing, identification and use of roll-on
roll-off containers.
(a) This licensing requirement applies only to roll-on
roll-off containers.
(b) No solid waste, construction and demolition debris or
materials to be recycled, generated within the city, may be
placed in a roll-on roll-off container unless the container is
licensed with the department of public works to hold such waste.
In addition to the general container license, a separate permit
and appropriate display stickers shall be obtained each time a
container is used to hold either construction and demolition
debris or materials to be recycled. The office of building
inspections shall issue the separate permit and stickers pursuant
to section 12-111 of this article for construction and demolition
debris for projects requiring a building or demolition permit.
All other permits and stickers shall be issued by the public
works authority.
(c) Every roll-on roll-off container used to transport
solid waste, construction and demolition debris or materials to
be recycled, generated within the city, shall be visibly marked
as follows:
(1) On the two (2) largest sides:
Name of waste hauler company;
City of Portland Garbage, Wastes and Junk
Code of Ordinances Chapter 12
Sec. 12-115 Rev. 3-23-11
12-36
Company's address and telephone number; and
Size of container, stated in cubic yards.
(2) Lower left corner/driver side:
City of Portland container license;
Demolition disposal sticker, if appropriate;
Recycling sticker, if appropriate.
(d) A container may not have a demolition disposal sticker
and a recycling sticker on it at the same time.
(e) A container may only contain one (1) type of waste at a
time. Acceptable waste, construction and demolition debris and
unacceptable waste may not be placed in the same container at the
same time.
(Ord. No. 192A-93, 1-25-93)
Sec. 12-111. Disposal of construction and demolition debris
generated within the city.
(a) Construction and demolition debris to go to city
facility. All construction and demolition debris generated within
the city shall be disposed of at the city construction and
demolition debris disposal facility until such time as the city
receives written notification from Regional Waste Systems that
RWS is accepting construction and demolition debris pursuant to
the terms of the demolition materials handling agreement. After
the city receives the notice and gives thirty (30) days prior
notice to waste haulers, all construction and demolition debris
shall be disposed of at the RWS construction and demolition
debris disposal facility. Subparts (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this
section 12-111 shall remain effective until thirty (30) days
following receipt of notification to the haulers by the city that
all construction and demolition debris shall be disposed of at
the RWS construction and demolition debris disposal facility.
(b) Permit required. No person shall collect, recycle, haul
or transport construction and demolition debris without first
obtaining a construction and demolition debris disposal facility
permit as described in this section.
(1) All persons who obtain a building or demolition permit
from the city shall simultaneously obtain a
construction and demolition debris disposal facility
City of Portland Garbage, Wastes and Junk
Code of Ordinances Chapter 12
Sec. 12-116 Rev. 3-23-11
12-37
permit from the office of building inspections. This
requirement shall not apply to a residential homeowner
whose project will create three (3) cubic yards or less
of construction and demolition debris.
(2) Prior to the issuance of a building or demolition
permit, the city's building inspector or his designee
shall inspect the premises for which the building or
demolition permit is sought to determine whether
hazardous or special wastes are present on the
premises; if hazardous or special wastes are present on
the premises, the parties seeking the building or
demolition permit must furnish the city with evidence
of lawful disposal of the hazardous or special wastes
in order to receive the building or demolition permit
and construction and demolition debris disposal
facility permit.
(3) In any case where the city issued a building or
demolition permit before the effective date of
paragraph (b)(1) above, the construction and demolition
debris disposal facility permit must be purchased from
the public works authority by the person transporting
the waste or the waste generator.
(4) The demolition debris disposal facility permit shall
authorize the person to whom it is issued to dispose of
construction and demolition debris from the premises
for which the building or demolition permit is issued,
at the city construction and demolition debris disposal
facility.
(c) Permit fee. The fee for the initial construction and
demolition debris disposal permit shall be calculated by the
office of building inspections on a case-by-case basis. It shall
depend on fees established by council order.
The fee shall be nonrefundable. The disposal permit shall
authorize the permittee to dispose of a specified amount of waste
at the city construction and demolition debris disposal facility
and shall only be valid for the amount stated on the face of the
permit.
If the amount of the original permit is too low, the permit
holder shall purchase a subsequent permit or permits from the
public works authority.
If the amount of disposal authorized by the original permit
or subsequent permits is too high, the permit owner may obtain a
City of Portland Garbage, Wastes and Junk
Code of Ordinances Chapter 12
Sec. 12-116 Rev. 3-23-11
12-38
transferable credit from the public works authority for future
disposal at the city construction and demolition disposal
facility so long as the building inspector has issued a
certificate of occupancy or completion and the owner applies
within two (2) months of the date upon which the building
inspector's certificate was issued. The maximum credit allowed
will be fifty (50) percent of the total amount paid for
construction and demolition debris permits for the project.
(d) Sorting requirement. At any site for which a building
permit is issued, any person or entity that owns or controls the
site must sort the waste generated by any construction project on
the site in such a manner that acceptable solid waste, metal, and
construction and demolition debris without metal, are distinct
and can be separately moved. Under no circumstances may these
types of waste be mixed in any type of disposal container or in
any vehicle. All sorting must be done at the generation site.
The metal sorting requirement does not apply to nails and
other fastening devices made out of metal.
Wood waste may be separated and recycled at the discretion
of the generator if it is unacceptable waste.
Metal waste may be recycled at the discretion of the
generator if it is unacceptable waste.
The city may allow clean inert fill to be disposed of at a
location designated by the city without a fee providing that
applicants receive prior written approval from the city's public
works authority.
(e) Rejected loads. The city's public works authority is
the only authority to designate a load of demolition debris as
unacceptable for disposal at the city's construction and
demolition debris disposal facility. If a load is rejected, the
public works authority will retain the transporter's trip ticket
or coupon and give the waste transporter a reasonable opportunity
to bring the load into compliance. If the load is not brought
into compliance, the ticket or coupon and the value that it
represents shall be forfeited to the city, and the transporter
shall be given permission to take the load out of the city.
(f) Controlling provisions. To the extent that any of the
provisions in this article are inconsistent with the demolition
materials handling agreement entered into between the city and
RWS, the provisions of the agreement shall control, except that
any provisions requiring disposal at the RWS construction and
demolition debris disposal facility shall not control until RWS
City of Portland Garbage, Wastes and Junk
Code of Ordinances Chapter 12

person's circumstances since the time of the third
violation; provided, however, that any further
violation shall result in the revocation of the
commercial refuse collector's or refuse transporter's
license and the barring of that commercial refuse
collector or refuse transporter from applying for a
license under this article in subsequent fiscal years.
(4) No commercial refuse collector's or refuse

notice to the commercial refuse collector or refuse
transporter.

ten (10) business days of the date upon which the notice of
appeal is received by the city unless the licensee and the city
agree to extend the hearing date.
Tonnage estimates by the public works authority shall be

ARTICLE IX. WASTE REDUCTION
Sec. 12-230. Findings; purposes.
The city council hereby finds as follows:
(a) The City Council has a duty to protect the natural
environment and the health of its citizens and
visitors; and
(b) The use of single-use carryout bags has severe
environmental impacts on a local and global scale,
including greenhouse gas emissions, litter, harm to
wildlife, atmospheric acidification, water consumption
and solid waste generation; and
(c) Despite recycling and voluntary solutions to control
pollution from single-use carryout bags, very few
single-use carryout bags are recycled; and
(d) Numerous studies have documented the prevalence of
single-use carryout bags littering the environment,
blocking storm drains, and endangering wildlife; and
(e) The City of Portland’s taxpayers must bear costs
associated with the effects of single-use carryout bags
on the solid waste stream, drainage, litter, and
wildlife; and
(e) The City, through its policies, programs, and laws,
supports efforts to reduce the amount of waste that
must be disposed of by supporting the waste management
hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle, compost, waste-toCity

to conserve resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
waste, and litter and to protect the public health and
welfare, including wildlife, all of which increase the
quality of life for the City’s residents and visitors;
and
(i) Evidence indicates that the vast majority of single-use
carryout bags are used for the bagging and carryout of
products purchased from Stores, as those business are
defined in this Ordinance; and
(j) Studies document and participating municipalities
report that prohibiting the free distribution of
single-use carryout bags will dramatically reduce the
use of those types of bags; and
(k) The City Council of the City of Portland believes that
residents and visitors should use reusable bags and
that prohibiting the free distribution of single-use
carryout bags by stores is appropriate and will
incentivize the use of reusable bags; and
(l) It is in the best interests of the health, safety and
welfare of citizens and visitors of Portland to reduce
the cost to the City of solid waste disposal, and to
protect our environment and our natural resources by
reducing the distribution of single-use carryout bags
and incentivizing the use of reusable bags at Stores,

total sales at any single location.

----------
Sec. 13-1. Statement of policy.
(a) The city administers a program of general assistance
available to all persons who are eligible to receive assistance in
accordance with the standards of eligibility as provided herein and
in 22 M.R.S.A., Chapter 1161.
(b) When possible, the general assistance program will seek
to alleviate needs other than financial, assisting recipients with
arrangements for rehabilitative, preventive, and protective
services. The applicant or recipient is expected to make use of all
available resources. The general assistance program provides a
specific amount and type of aid for current defined needs during a
limited period of time and is not intended to be a continuing
"grant-in-aid" or "categorical" welfare program.
(c) The goals of the program are to recognize and encourage
dignity, self-respect, and self-reliance, to assist each recipient
to achieve self-maintenance and adequate social functioning, and to
encourage the work incentive. An important focus of attention for
the general assistance program is the strengthening of family life,
especially for the care and protection of children.
(d) The general assistance program will not discriminate on
account of sex, sexual orientation, age, race, religion,
disability, or political affiliation. Each applicant or recipient
will be made aware of his or her rights and responsibilities under
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-1 Rev. 6-20-12
13-2
general assistance. Any applicant or recipient has a right to
request review of any decision concerning his or her right to
assistance.
(e) Complete records will be maintained, although any
information given by applicants or recipients will be recognized
confidential pursuant to 22 M.R.S.A., Section 4306.
(f) The city will post a notice in the city general
assistance office of the times and days that general assistance
applications will be processed. This chapter will be made easily
accessible to any member of the public and will be available in the
welfare office.
(g) In times of emergency, general assistance will be
available to eligible persons even at days and times when the
general assistance office is not ordinarily open. Notice will be
posted of the person to contact in an emergency in a place
accessible to the public when the office or building is closed.
(Ord. No. 399-92, 6-3-92)
Sec. 13-2. Definitions.
Unless otherwise defined here or in the text or in 22
M.R.S.A., Chapter 1161, all words used will have their common
meanings. Words and phrases having special definitions will be
defined when they first appear in the chapter, except for the
following definitions:
Administrator is the social services administrator of the
city's department of health and human services to whom the day to
day administration of the general assistance program is delegated.
The administrator is authorized to delegate some or all of his
duties to caseworkers and other employees of the city's division of
social services, and references to the administrator shall include
the duly authorized designees of said administrator.
Appellant is any applicant or recipient who has appealed a
decision of the administrator to a fair hearing officer.
Applicant is a person who has expressed a desire to receive
general assistance by means of a written application form, either
directly or through a representative authorized in writing, or
through an application accepted by telephone or who has, in an
emergency, requested assistance without first completing an
application. An applicant may simultaneously be a recipient if he
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-2 Rev. 10-15-2015
13-3
is receiving general assistance at the time of application.
Application form is a document in a form prescribed by the
administrator on which a person indicates a desire to receive
general assistance and states the necessary facts on which a
determination of eligibility can be made.
Back bills are any charges for goods and services received
prior to application. A bill that is due in the same month in which
an application is made is not a back bill.
Basic necessities are food, clothing, shelter, fuel,
electricity, nonelective medical services as recommended by a
physician, nonprescription drugs, telephone where it is necessary
for medical reasons, property taxes when a tax lien placed on the
property threatens the loss of the applicant's place of residence,
and any other commodity or service determined essential by the
municipality. "Basic necessities" do not include security deposits
for rental property, except for those situations where no other
permanent lodging is available unless a security deposit is paid,
and a waiver, deferral or installment arrangement cannot be made
between the landlord and tenant to satisfy the need for the
immediate payment of the security deposit or payment in full.
Case record is the official file of forms, correspondence, and
narrative records and all other communications pertaining to an
applicant or recipient, determination of initial or subsequent
eligibility, reasons for decisions and actions by the general
assistance administrator, and types of assistance provided each
recipient.
Caseworker is any person designated by the social services
administrator to assist in administering the general assistance
program.
Categorical assistance is all state and federal income
maintenance programs.
Disabled person is a person who is presently unable to work or
maintain a home due to a physical or mental disability that is
verified by a physician.
Dwelling unit is a building or part thereof used for separate
living quarters for one (1) or more persons living as a single
housekeeping unit.
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-2 Rev. 10-15-2015
13-4
Eligible person is a person who is qualified to receive
general assistance from the city according to the standards of
eligibility set forth in this chapter and 22 M.R.S. §4301(3).
Emergency is any life threatening situation or a situation
beyond the control of the individual which, if not alleviated
immediately, could reasonably be expected to pose a threat to the
health or safety of a person.
Fair hearing officer is a person or persons appointed by the
city council who is empowered to review any decision, act, failure
to act, or delay in action in regard to general assistance pursuant
to 22 M.R.S.A., Section 4322.
General assistance program is a service administered by the
city for the immediate aid of persons who are unable to provide the
basic necessities essential to maintain themselves or their
families. The general assistance program provides a specific amount
and type of aid for defined needs during a limited period of time
and is not intended to be a continuing "grant-in-aid" or
"categorical" welfare program. This definition shall not in any way
lessen the responsibility of the city to provide general assistance
to a person each time that the person has need and is found to be
otherwise eligible to receive general assistance.
Household is an individual or a group of individuals who share
a dwelling unit. When an applicant shares a dwelling unit with one
(1) or more individuals, even when a landlord-tenant relationship
may exist between individuals residing in the dwelling unit,
eligible applicants may receive assistance for no more than their
pro rata share of the actual costs of the shared basic needs of
that household according to the maximum levels of assistance
established herein. The income of household members not legally
liable or otherwise responsible for supporting the household shall
be considered as available to the applicant only when there is a
pooling of income.
Income is any form of income in cash or in kind received by
the household, including net remuneration for services performed,
cash received on either secured or unsecured credit, any payments
received as an annuity, retirement, or disability benefits,
veterans' pensions, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits,
benefits under any state or federal categorical assistance program,
supplemental security income, social security, and any other
payments from governmental sources, unless specifically prohibited
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-2 Rev. 10-15-2015
13-5
by any law or regulation, court ordered support payments, income
from pension or trust funds and household income from any other
source, including relatives or unrelated household members.
The following items are not income:
(a) Real or personal income-producing property, tools of
trade, governmental entitlement specifically treated as
exempt assets by state or federal law;
(b) Actual work-related expenses, whether itemized or by
standard deduction, such as taxes, retirement fund
contributions, union dues, transportation costs to and
from work, special equipment costs, and child care
expenses; or
(c) Earned income of children below the age of eighteen (18)
years who are full-time students and who are not working
full time.
In determining need, as defined herein, the period of time
used as a basis for the calculation shall be the thirty-day period
commencing on the date of the application. This prospective
calculation does not disqualify an applicant who has exhausted
income to purchase basic necessities, provided that the income does
not exceed the income standards established in section 13-8 below.
Notwithstanding this prospective calculation, if any applicant
or recipient receives a lump sum payment prior to applying for
assistance, that payment must be prorated over future months. The
period of proration is determined by disregarding any portion of
the lump sum payment that the applicant or recipient has spent to
purchase basic necessities, including but not limited to: all basic
necessities provided by general assistance; reasonable payment of
funeral or burial expenses for a family member; reasonable travel
costs related to the illness or death of a family member; repair or
replacement of essentials lost due to fire, flood or other natural
disaster; repair or purchase of a motor vehicle essential for
employment, education, training or other day-to-day living
necessities; and payment of bills earmarked for the purpose for
which the lump sum is paid. All income received by the household
between the receipt of the lump sum payment and the application for
assistance is added to the remainder of the lump sum. The period of
proration is then determined by dividing the remainder of the lump
sum payment by the aggregate maximum level of assistance designated
under section 13-8 below. That dividend represents the period of
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-2 Rev. 10-15-2015
13-6
proration determined by the administrator to commence on the date
of receipt of the lump sum payment. The prorated sum for each month
must be considered available to the household for twelve (12)
months from the date of application or during the period of
proration, whichever is less.
Just cause is a valid, verifiable reason that hinders an
individual in complying with one (1) or more conditions of
eligibility.
Lump sum payment is a one-time or typically nonrecurring sum
of money issued to an applicant or recipient after an initial
application. Lump sum payment includes, but is not limited to,
retroactive or settlement portions of social security benefits,
workers' compensation payments, unemployment benefits, disability
income, veterans' benefits, severance pay benefits, or money
received from inheritances, lottery winnings, personal injury
awards, property damage claims or divorce settlements. A lump sum
payment includes only the amount of money available to the
applicant after payment of required deductions has been made from
the gross lump sum payment. A lump sum payment does not include
conversion of a nonliquid resource to a liquid resource if the
liquid resource has been used or is intended to be used to replace
the converted resource or for other necessary expenses.
Maximum level of assistance is the amount of assistance as
established in section 13-9 below, or the actual cost of a basic
necessity, whichever is less.
Municipality of responsibility is the municipality which is
liable for the support of any eligible person at the time of
application.
Need is the condition whereby a person's income, money,
property, credit, assets, or other resources available to provide
basic necessities for the individual and the individual's family
are less than the maximum levels of assistance established herein.
Overseer is the city's social services administrator.
Period of eligibility is the time for which a person has been
granted assistance. Such period shall commence on the date the
application for assistance is granted and shall continue for the
period stated on the decision. The period of eligibility may vary
depending on the type of assistance provided; however, in no event
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-2 Rev. 10-15-2015
13-7
shall such period extend beyond one (1) month.
Pooling of income is the financial relationship among
household members who are not legally liable for mutual support in
which there occurs any commingling of funds or sharing of income or
expenses. It is a rebuttable presumption that persons sharing the
same dwelling unit are pooling their income. Applicants who are
requesting that the determination of eligibility be calculated as
though one (1) or more household members are not pooling their
income have the burden of rebutting the presumption of pooling
income by providing verification that they are not doing so.
Real estate is any land, buildings, homes, mobile homes, and
any other things affixed to that land.
Recipient is a person who has applied for and is currently
receiving general assistance.
Resident is a person who is physically present in a
municipality with the intention of remaining in that municipality
in order to maintain or establish a home and who has no other
residence. A person who applies for assistance who is not a
resident of the city nor any other municipality is the
responsibility of the municipality where the person first applies.
That municipality must take an application and grant assistance to
the applicant if he is eligible until he establishes a new
residence in another municipality.
Resources include, but are not limited to, any program,
service, or other sources of support which are an alternative or
supplement to general assistance. Potential resources include, but
are not limited to, any state or federal assistance program,
employment benefits, governmental or private pension program,
available trust funds, support from legally liable relatives, child
support payments, and jointly held resources where the applicant or
recipient share may be available to the individual. Potential
resources include AFDC, Food Stamps, fuel assistance (HEAP),
subsidized housing, and similar programs, and any medical and
rehabilitative resources recommended by a physician which are
available without financial burden and which would not constitute a
further physical risk to the applicant.
(Ord. No. 399-92, 6-3-92; Ord. No. 84-93, § 1, 9-8-93; Ord. 85-15/16, 10-15-2015)
Sec. 13-3. Administrative procedures.
(a) Records. Pursuant to 22 M.R.S.A., Section 4306, the
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-3 Rev. 6-20-12
13-8
administrator is required to keep complete and accurate records
pertaining to general assistance. These records are necessary to:
(1) Provide a valid basis of accounting for municipal funds;
(2) Support decisions concerning the applicant's or
recipient's eligibility;
(3) Assure availability of information if an aggrieved person
seeks administrative or judicial review of the
caseworker's decision.
In addition to general statistical records concerning the
number of persons given assistance and the cost of such support, a
separate case record is established for each individual applying
for general assistance and his or her household with the exception
of records of individuals presumed eligible through an approved
shelter. Each case record shall contain at least the following:
(1) The completed application for assistance;
(2) Grounds for approval or denial of assistance;
(3) A narrative social history containing the need for
relief, the results of home visits, collateral
information, referrals, changes in status, etc.;
(4) Complete data concerning the type and amount of
assistance provided.
(b) Confidentiality. Case records and all other information
relating to an applicant or recipient of general assistance are
confidential and will not be disclosed to the general public,
unless expressly permitted by the applicant or recipient in
writing. If the administrator releases information contained in an
applicant's or recipient's case record to a person with a legal
right to that information, an entry will be made in the case
record, giving the reason(s) for the release.
The applicant or recipient or his legal representative will
have the right to review any information contained in his case
record. No record will be released to a legal representative or
other third party, however, unless the administrator receives a
consent form signed by the applicant or recipient expressly
authorizing release of the records to the specified parties. The
administrator may charge a reasonable fee for the reproduction of
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-3 Rev. 6-20-12
13-9
records, when appropriate.
(c) Applications; right to apply. Any person has the right to
apply for general assistance under this chapter. The head of the
family, any other responsible household adult, or a duly authorized
representative must apply in person, except as otherwise provided
herein. The administrator may require a duly authorized
representative to present a signed statement documenting that he is
in fact so authorized. The applicant must complete a written
application form and any other required forms. The administrator is
authorized to promulgate all forms and notices necessary for the
administration of this chapter and to file said forms with the
state department of human services.
When a person in an emergency is unable to apply in person due
to illness, disability, lack of transportation, lack of child care
or other good cause, and he cannot send an authorized
representative, the caseworker will accept an application by
telephone or conduct a home visit, and assistance shall be granted,
if at all, temporarily. Any telephone application will be subject
to the caseworker receiving written verification via mail or a
visit to the applicant's home with his permission. Further
assistance shall be granted upon completion of a written
application and determination of eligibility hereunder.
The administrator will not grant any assistance as the result
of a telephone or home visit application if the applicant refuses
to allow the administrator to verify the information.
Each request for assistance will be administered in accordance
with this chapter. Applications will be taken during regular
business hours at the general assistance office. An independent
determination of eligibility for general assistance shall be made
by the caseworker upon receipt of each application. The application
form will give clear notice that the applicant has the right to a
fair hearing if he is dissatisfied with the caseworker's decision.
The administrator is authorized to enter into contracts with
emergency shelters for the presumption of eligibility of homeless
persons using the shelter.
(d) Caseworkers' responsibilities at the time of application.
At the time of application, the caseworker will inform the
applicant of the eligibility requirements of the program and ask
the applicant to provide all information and documentation
necessary for the caseworker to make a determination of
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-3 Rev. 6-20-12
13-10
eligibility. This information will include:
(1) The applicant's household income, including income
actually received from any source or due to be received
during the period of eligibility;
(2) Any assets or resources available to the applicant,
including personal property and real estate;
(3) Employment information; if the applicant is unemployed
due to a disability, the caseworker will seek information
regarding its nature and will recommend rehabilitative
services when appropriate;
(4) The amount and type of assistance requested.
The caseworker will also be responsible for informing the
applicant about the possible ways to reduce his need for general
assistance and the applicant's responsibility to:
(1) Accurately report all information necessary to determine
eligibility;
(2) Fulfill the city's work requirements pursuant to section
13-4(h), below;
(3) Make use of all available resources including, but not
limited to, those of other government benefit programs
and liable relatives of sufficient means;
(4) Participate in a rehabilitation program, when appropriate
in order to diminish his dependence on general
assistance;
(5) Reimburse the city for the amount of general assistance
granted in the event of a subsequent ability to pay;
(6) Notify the caseworker of any change in circumstances that
will affect eligibility.
The caseworker will also inform the applicant that the
parent(s) of a child under twenty-five (25) years of age and a
spouse living within or owning real or tangible property in the
state are required to support him in proportion to their ability to
pay, and that the city can seek reimbursement therefrom. Further,
if applicable, the caseworker will inform the applicant that the
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-3 Rev. 6-20-12
13-11
city will not make payments for rental assistance on behalf of an
otherwise eligible applicant when the rental payment would be made
to a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, sibling, parent's
sibling or any of their children, unless the caseworker determines
that the rental arrangement has existed for three (3) months prior
to the application for assistance and is necessary to provide the
relative with basic necessities. The applicant shall provide
reasonable information to the caseworker as to the duration of the
rental agreement and the resources of the relative in order to
permit the caseworker to make such determination. The caseworker
will also inform the applicant of the penalty for false
representation and of his right to have decisions reviewed and the
nature of the hearing process.
(e) Responsibilities of each applicant and recipient. Each
applicant and recipient has a responsibility at the time of each
application and thereafter to:
(1) Provide accurate, complete, and current information
concerning his or her needs, income, resources, assets,
and employment and the whereabouts and circumstances of
persons who may be liable for his support;
(2) Notify the caseworker when a change in his needs, income,
resources, assets, or employment will affect eligibility
for general assistance;
(3) Apply for and utilize any other available benefits or
resources that will reduce or eliminate the need for
general assistance;
(4) Use all money available to him for basic necessities on a
priority basis, before requesting general assistance or
purchasing items not required for basic needs, except in
the case of an initial application; and
(5) Participate in a training education, or rehabilitation
program, when appropriate, in order to diminish his/her
need for general assistance.
(6) Reimburse the city for assistance provided in the event
he has the ability to do so.
Each applicant is responsible for requesting assistance with
bills that are current. The city is not responsible for paying back
bills except as provided below for emergencies.
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-3 Rev. 6-20-12
13-12
(f) Action on application. The caseworker will give a written
decision concerning the applicant's eligibility within twenty-four
(24) hours after he has submitted a written application form, or a
telephone application has been accepted, together with other
documents required for verification and support of information
thereon. If approved, assistance will be furnished within that
period.
The written decision will inform the applicant of the
following:
(1) The type and amount of aid the applicant is eligible for
and the period of eligibility; or
(2) The reasons for denial;
(3) The applicant's right to a fair hearing; and
(4) The applicant's right to notify the state department of
human services and the available means for notifying said
department.
(g) Withdrawal of an application. An application is
considered withdrawn if:
(1) The applicant dies before assistance is rendered; or
(2) The applicant requests in writing that his application be
withdrawn; or
(3) The applicant refuses to complete or sign the application
or any other form needed by the general assistance
administrator.
(h) Temporary refusal to accept application. Under special
circumstances, the general assistance administrator may temporarily
refuse to accept applications for twenty-four (24) hours. Such
circumstances may include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) When the applicant's conduct is abusive, disruptive or
harassing, or when the applicant is under the influence
of drugs or alcohol. In these situations, the applicant
will be required to leave and not to return until his
conduct is under control; or
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-3 Rev. 6-20-12
13-13
(2) When a third person applies for assistance on behalf of
the applicant. That person may be required to provide
written verification that he has been duly authorized to
act as a representative for the applicant.
In addition to the foregoing, if the administrator believes
that an applicant's behavior presents a threat to the health or
safety of the public or to city employees, or if such behavior is
violent, or if an applicant has engaged in abusive, disruptive or
harassing behavior and has been required to leave on more than one
(1) occasion, then the applicant may be required to designate a
third party to apply for assistance on his behalf and the applicant
may be prohibited from entering the social services offices.
(i) Emergencies. Except as provided herein, any person who
applies for assistance to alleviate an emergency is eligible for
emergency general assistance if they do not have sufficient
resources to meet an actual immediate need for basic necessities,
although they have been found ineligible for nonemergency general
assistance. An emergency is considered to be any life threatening
situation or a situation beyond the control of the applicant, such
as a natural disaster, which could reasonably be expected to pose a
threat to the health and safety of the applicant if not alleviated
immediately. Examples of such circumstances include, but are not
limited to: fire, flood, illness or injury, imminent eviction or
termination of utilities, or being stranded in the community.
If an applicant is in emergency need of a basic necessity and
the only way to obtain that necessity is by paying a back bill, the
administrator will attempt to negotiate with the creditor in order
to determine the minimum amount which could be paid in order to
meet the emergency need. Notwithstanding the foregoing, emergency
assistance is not available to pay a back bill or obligation for a
basic necessity if the person requesting the assistance had
sufficient income, money, assets or other resources available to
pay for the basic necessity when the bill was received or the
obligation was due. The person requesting assistance shall be
required to provide evidence of income and resources for the
applicable time period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person who is currently
disqualified from general assistance for a violation of section
13-4(f) (use of potential resources), 13-4(g) (work requirement) or
13-6 (false representation) is ineligible for emergency assistance
under this subsection.
(Ord. No. 399-92, 6-3-92; Ord. No. 84-93, §§ 2, 3, 9-8-93)
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-3 Rev. 6-20-12
13-14
Sec. 13-4. Eligibility factors.
(a) Residence. The administrator shall provide general
assistance to all eligible persons applying for assistance who are
residents of the city. A resident is a person who has no other
residence and is physically present in the city and who intends to
remain here and establish a household.
The city also recognizes its responsibility to provide
assistance to eligible persons who apply here and who are not
residents of this city or any other municipality. If a person who
is not a resident of any municipality applies in this city first,
the administrator will determine his eligibility and, if eligible,
will grant assistance until he establishes a residence in another
municipality.
Moving/relocating. The city will not move or transport an
applicant or recipient into another municipality unless the person
requests assistance to relocate to another municipality. If the
administrator determines the applicant is eligible and grants
financial assistance to help the applicant relocate, the city will
be responsible for providing assistance to him for thirty (30) days
after he moves, provided the recipient remains eligible.
Institutions. If a resident of this city enters an institution
located in another municipality (such as a group home, shelter,
rehabilitation center, nursing home or hospital) and requests
assistance while at the institution, he will be the responsibility
of the city for up to six (6) months after he enters the
institution. The city thereafter retains responsibility for an
applicant in an institution only if the applicant has maintained a
home in the city to which he intends to return. The city also
recognizes its responsibility for an applicant residing in an
institution in this city if he had no residence prior to entering
the institution.
Temporary housing. For the purpose of this paragraph, a hotel,
motel or similar place of temporary lodging is considered an
institution when a municipality:
(1) Grants financial assistance for a person to move to or
stay in temporary lodging;
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-4 Rev. 12-19-2016
13-15
(2) Makes arrangements for a person to stay in temporary
lodging;
(3) Advises or encourages a person to stay in temporary
lodging; or
(4) Illegally denies housing assistance and, as a result of
that denial, the person stays in temporary lodging.
Disputes. When the administrator believes that an applicant is
a resident of another municipality but that municipality disputes
its responsibility, the administrator will notify the department of
human services in Augusta. If the applicant applies in this city
first, the administrator will determine his eligibility and, if
eligible, will grant assistance until the department has concluded
which municipality is responsible for providing assistance. If
another municipality was responsible, the department will recover
the amount due from the other municipality.
(b) Initial application. For initial applicants, need will be
the sole condition of eligibility. An initial applicant is a person
who has not applied for general assistance in this city or in any
Maine municipality.
"Need" means that the applicant's income and resources are
less than the overall maximum level of assistance contained in
section 13-9 of this chapter or the actual thirty-day costs,
whichever is less, and he does not have adequate income or other
resources available to provide basic necessities.
Subsequent applications. All applications which are not
initial applications are repeat applications. Persons who are not
initial applicants must be in need, use their income and resources
to secure basic necessities, and meet all other eligibility
conditions established by state law and this chapter.
(c) Categorical assistance. Receipt of categorical assistance
will not disqualify a person from receiving general assistance, if
he is otherwise eligible. Benefits received from other assistance
programs will be considered as income when determining need, with
the exception of food stamps, which will not be counted as income
or resources or otherwise taken into consideration when determining
need. Also, any fuel assistance (HEAP/ECIP) received by an
applicant will not be considered as income or resources; that is,
the administrator will always compute the heating needs of an
applicant who has received HEAP or ECIP as if that applicant paid
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-4 Rev. 12-19-2016
13-16
for his total fuel costs. Applicants or recipients must apply for
program benefits within seven (7) days after being advised in
writing to do so by the administrator. Persons who, without just
cause, make no good faith effort to receive a potential resource
will be disqualified from receiving assistance until they make a
good faith effort to obtain the benefit.
(d) Personal property.
(1) Liquid assets. No person owning assets easily convertible
into cash, including but not limited to, bank deposits,
stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit and other
marketable security will be eligible for general
assistance unless he uses such assets to provide for his
basic needs and thereby exhausts them. Applicants who
transfer their assets to someone else solely to appear
eligible for general assistance will be denied
assistance.
(2) Tangible assets. No person owning personal property (such
as motor vehicles, snowmobiles, boats, trailers,
recreational vehicles) or other assets which are readily
convertible to cash and are not essential to the
maintenance of the applicant or his family, shall be
eligible for general assistance. Exceptions may be made
upon an initial application or when reasonable efforts to
convert assets to cash are unsuccessful. Tools of a
trade, livestock, and farm equipment used in the
production of income are exempt from the above category
and are not considered as available assets.
The ownership of one (1) automobile per household will
not make a person ineligible for assistance if such
vehicle is essential for transportation to employment,
medical care, rehabilitation or training facilities;
however, continued eligibility for assistance will depend
upon the applicant making reasonable efforts to dispose
of the automobile if his equity interest in the
automobile exceeds twenty-five hundred dollars
($2,500.00), or if it is not essential for the
above-named purposes.
(3) Insurance. Insurance that is available to an applicant on
a noncontributory basis or that is required as a
condition of employment will not be a factor in
determining eligibility for general assistance. Life
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-4 Rev. 12-19-2016
13-17
insurance with a cash surrender value will be considered
as a tangible asset and eligibility after the initial
application shall depend upon the applicant's making
reasonable efforts to obtain the cash surrender value.
(e) Real estate. Ownership of a house used as a principal
residence will not affect eligibility. When an applicant who owns
his own home is unable to pay his mortgage, taxes, or insurance,
and is eligible for general assistance, the city will provide only
the mortgage payment up to the allowable maximum for rent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may provide assistance for
the payment of taxes on a principal residence in the event of an
emergency.
If an applicant is granted assistance in the form of a
mortgage payment, the city may claim a lien against any real estate
owned by that person pursuant to 22 M.R.S.A., Section 4320, which
lien shall be enforceable upon sale of the property or death of the
recipient.
The administrator may provide emergency assistance to persons
owning real property other than their own home. However, continued
future eligibility for assistance will depend upon the applicant
making reasonable efforts to dispose of such real property at fair
market value or obtain a loan against such property to use to meet
present need.
(f) Use of potential resources. Any applicant or recipient
must make a good faith effort to secure any potential resource
which may be available, including, but not limited to, any state or
federal assistance program, employment benefits, trust funds,
support from legally liable relatives, child-support payments, and
jointly held resources where the applicant or recipient share may
be available to the individual. Assistance shall not be withheld
pending receipt of such resource as long as application has been
made or good faith effort is being made to secure the resource.
Any individual applying for or receiving general assistance
due to a disability must make a good faith effort to make use of
any medical and rehabilitative resources that may be recommended by
a physician, psychologist or other professional retraining or
rehabilitation specialist which are available without financial
burden and would not constitute further physical risk to the
individual.
"Without financial burden" shall include without financial
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-4 Rev. 12-19-2016
13-18
burden to the city to the extent such resources are available, as
well as without financial burden to the individual.
Any applicant or recipient who refuses to utilize potential
resources without just cause as defined in subsection (h) below,
after receiving a written seven-day notice, shall be disqualified
from receiving assistance until he has made a good faith effort to
secure the resources.
Any applicant or recipient who forfeits receipt of or causes
reduction in benefits from another public assistance program
because of fraud, misrepresentation, or a knowing or intentional
violation of program rules committed by the applicant or recipient
or a refusal to comply with program rules without just cause is not
eligible to receive general assistance to replace the forfeited
assistance for the duration of the forfeiture.
(g) Work requirement.
A determination of the assigned work requirement will be made
at the time of application and the recipient will be given written
notice of the required assignment at that time.
(1) Work search; rehabilitative services. All unemployed
applicants and members of their households who are over
the age of seventeen (17), except as provided below, may
be required to search for work, accept any suitable job
offer, or job training, or opportunity for rehabilitation
services. If the work search requirement is assigned,
applicants must demonstrate to the administrator that
they are available for work forty (40) hours a week and
are actively seeking employment, except as provided in
subsection (3) below.
A "suitable job offer" as used herein means any job which
the applicant is mentally and physically able to perform.
"Available for work," as used herein, will mean that
applicants must make themselves available for work during
normal business hours prevailing in that area, Monday
through Saturday, and show that no circumstance exists
which would prevent them from accepting full-time
employment. Full-time employment means forty (40) hours a
week.
Applicants who are employed are expected to remain on the
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-4 Rev. 12-19-2016
13-19
job and not to quit employment except for just cause.
After being granted assistance at the time of initial
application, applicants will be considered ineligible for
further assistance for one hundred twenty (120) days if
they, without just cause:
a. Refuse to register for employment with the Maine
Job Service;
b. Refuse to search for employment when the search is
reasonable and appropriate; recipients who
unreasonably seek work at the same places
repeatedly will not be considered to be performing
a diligent work search and will be disqualified;
c. Refuse to accept a suitable job offer;
d. Refuse to participate in a training, education, or
rehabilitation program that would assist the
applicant in securing employment;
e. Fail to be available for work; or
f. Refuse to perform or willfully fail to perform, or
perform below average standards, an assignment
under subsection (2) below (work program).
An applicant, whether an initial or repeat applicant, who
quits work or is discharged from employment due to
misconduct as defined in Title 26, Section 1043,
subsection 23, is ineligible to receive assistance for
one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the
applicant's separation from employment.
(2) Municipal work program. In addition to or alternatively
to the requirements of subsection (1) above, the city may
require that an otherwise eligible person who is capable
of working be required to perform work for the
municipality or work for a nonprofit organization, if
that organization has agreed to participate as an
employer in the municipal work program, as a condition of
receiving general assistance. Nonprofit organizations
participating in the work program must enter into a
contract with the administrator for such participation,
which contracts the administrator is authorized to
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-4 Rev. 12-19-2016
13-20
execute on behalf of the city. The city may also require
recipients to participate in a training or educational or
rehabilitative program which would assist them in
securing employment. Any such work requirement shall be
subject to the following provisions:
a. A person may not, as a condition of general
assistance eligibility, be required to do any
amount of work that exceeds the value of the net
general assistance that the person would otherwise
receive under the general assistance standards
herein. Any person performing work under this
subsection shall be provided with net general
assistance, the value of which is computed at a
rate of at least the state's minimum wage.
b. A person may not be required to work under this
subsection for a nonprofit organization if that
work would violate a basic religious belief of that
person.
c. An eligible person performing work under this
subsection shall not replace regular municipal
employees or regular employees of a participating
nonprofit organization.
d. An eligible person in need of emergency assistance
(i.e., a person who is not on
one-hundred-twenty-day denial) shall not be
required to perform work under this subsection
prior to receiving general assistance. An applicant
who is not in need of emergency assistance may be
required to satisfactorily fulfill a workfare
requirement prior to receiving the nonemergency
assistance conditionally granted to that applicant.
e. Expenses related to work performed under this
subsection by an eligible person must be considered
in determining the amount of net general assistance
to be provided to the applicant.
f. A person may not be required to work under this
subsection if that person is physically or mentally
incapable of performing the work assigned.
(3) In no case may the requirement to search for work or
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-4 Rev. 12-19-2016
13-21
participate in a work or training program interfere with:
a. Existing employment;
b. Ability to pursue a bona fide job offer;
c. Ability to attend an interview for possible
employment;
d. Classroom participation in a primary or secondary
educational program intended to lead to a high
school diploma; or
e. Classroom or on-site participation in a training
program which is either approved or determined, or
both, by the department of labor to be reasonably
expected to assist the individual in securing
employment. This paragraph does not include
participation in a degree granting program, except
when that program is under the control of the
department of human services or department of labor
(e.g., Job Training Partnership Act or the Welfare
Employment Education and Training Program).
(4) Failure of an otherwise eligible person to comply with
this section shall not affect the eligibility of any
member of the person's household who is not capable of
working, including at least:
a. A dependent minor child;
b. An elderly, ill, or disabled person; and
c. A person whose presence is required in order to
provide care for any child under the age of six (6)
years or for any ill or disabled member of the
household.
(5) Applicants will be ineligible for assistance for one
hundred twenty (120) days if they do not comply with the
requirements of this subsection (g) without just cause,
as defined in subsection (h) below. Persons may regain
their eligibility if they become employed or complete the
workfare and work search assignments previously
established in the written decision on their application
sheet and meet all other eligibility requirements. An
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-4 Rev. 12-19-2016
13-22
applicant disqualified for failure to comply with the
municipal work program will be given only one (1)
opportunity to regain eligibility during the
one-hundred-twenty-day disqualification. An applicant who
regains eligibility and is again disqualified for failure
to comply with the municipal work program within the
initial period of disqualification is ineligible for
assistance for one hundred twenty (120) days and does not
have the opportunity to requalify during that second
one-hundred-twenty-day period.
(6) In administering the work requirement, the administrator
will:
a. Itemize work or other activities assigned to and
performed by eligible persons separately in reports
to the commissioner of human services;
b. Read or have the applicant read an information
sheet that must be signed prior to commencing the
assignment so that the applicants will understand
the conditions of their general assistance. The
information sheet will detail the amount of time
persons need to perform to meet their needs and the
type of assignment that they are required to
perform.
(h) Just cause. Just cause for failure to meet the work
requirements in subsection (g) or the use of potential resources in
subsection (f) shall be found when there is reasonable and
verifiable evidence of:
(1) Physical or mental illness or disability;
(2) Below minimum wages;
(3) Sexual harassment;
(4) Physical or mental inability to perform required job
tasks;
(5) Inability to work required hours or to meet piece work
standards;
(6) Lack of transportation to and from work or training;
(7) Inability to arrange for necessary child care or care of
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-4 Rev. 12-19-2016
13-23
ill or disabled family member;
(8) Any reason found to be good cause by the state department
of labor; and
(9) Any other evidence which is reasonable and appropriate
under the circumstances.
All claims of illness or disability under this chapter are
subject to verification except the caseworker shall not require
medical verification of medical conditions which are apparent or
which are of such short duration that a reasonable person would not
ordinarily seek medical attention. In any case in which the
caseworker requires medical verification, and the applicant has no
means of obtaining such verification, the caseworker shall grant
assistance for the purpose of obtaining such verification from a
medical provider approved by the city.
No recipient will have his assistance terminated, reduced, or
suspended prior to being given notice and an opportunity for a
hearing as provided in section 13-12 below. If the fair hearing
officer upholds the decision of the administrator, the period of
ineligibility shall commence on the date the fair hearing officer
renders a written decision. In the case of a person who chooses not
to request a hearing, the period of ineligibility shall commence on
the date the administrator renders his written decision. People who
are disqualified before the period covered by any particular form
of assistance expires shall be disqualified for one hundred twenty
(120) days from the end of the period covered by that assistance.
The period of ineligibility shall run for one hundred twenty (120)
days unless a stay is ordered by a court of law.
(i) Immigration Status. Beginning July 1, 2015, the
administrator shall provide general assistance to all eligible
persons who are lawfully present in the United States or who are
pursuing a lawful process to apply for immigration relief, except
that assistance for such a person may not exceed 24 months. Only
months of general assistance provided after July 1, 2015 for
eligible persons who are lawfully present in the United States or
who are pursuing a lawful process to apply for immigration relief
shall be counted toward the 24-month limit.
Citizens, nonimmigrants and “qualified aliens” as defined in
the provisions of § 431 of the PRWORA, as amended (8 U.S.C. §
1641) are not subject to the 24-month time limit.
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-4 Rev. 12-19-2016
13-24
(1) For the purposes of this section and determining
eligibility under this chapter, an eligible person who
is lawfully present in the United States shall be
defined as an individual described in 8 U.S.C.
§1621(a)(1)-(3) who is:
a. A qualified alien (as defined in section 1641 of
this title);
b. A nonimmigrant under the Immigration and
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. §1101 et seq.); or
c. An alien who is paroled into the United States
under section 212(d)(5) of such Act (8 U.S.C.
§1182(d)(5)) for less than one year.
(2) For the purposes of this section and determining
eligibility under this chapter, an eligible person who
is pursuing a lawful process to apply for immigration
relief shall be defined as a person who has filed an
application for immigration relief with the United
States Citizen and Immigration Service.
(Ord. No. 399-92, 6-3-92; Ord. No. 84-93, §§ 4--8, 9-8-93; Ord. 85-15/16,
10-15-2015; Ord. No. 104-16/17, 12-19-2016)
Sec. 13-5. Determination of eligibility.
(a) Determination; redetermination. The administrator shall
make a determination of eligibility each time a person applies or
reapplies for general assistance. The administrator will make a
redetermination of eligibility at least monthly, or within the
month, as often as necessary to administer the program efficiently
and meet the needs of the applicants. Upon any application, the
administrator will determine the applicant's eligibility on the
basis of a thirty-day prospective analysis, but may elect to
disburse the applicant's assistance periodically, e.g., daily,
weekly, or throughout a thirty-day period of eligibility pursuant
to that eligibility determination. Assistance will be provided for
current needs only, and the city is not responsible for back bills,
except as provided in section 13-3(i) above.
The administrator may redetermine a person's eligibility at
any time during the period he is receiving assistance if notified
of any change in the recipient's circumstances which may alter the
amount of assistance which the recipient may receive. Once a
recipient has been granted assistance, the administrator may not
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-5 Rev. 6-20-12
13-25
reduce or rescind the assistance without giving prior written
notice to the recipient explaining the reasons for the decision and
allowing the recipient to appeal the decision to the fair hearing
officer.
(b) Verification. Each applicant and recipient has the
responsibility at the time of application and continuing thereafter
to provide complete, accurate, and current information and
documents concerning his need, income, and other resources. For
documentation, the administrator will require actual bills or
receipts for rent, utilities, fuel, telephone, medical services,
and other expenses for basic necessities that are reasonably
obtainable, except that food and household supplies will be
budgeted at the actual amount paid, subject to the maximums allowed
in this chapter. The administrator will also require documentation
regarding the applicant's income and assets. When determining an
applicant's eligibility, the administrator will seek all necessary
information first from the applicant. Information needed from other
sources, with the exception of public records, will be gathered
only with the knowledge of the applicant.
The administrator may seek and verify information from all
appropriate sources including, but not limited to, the department
of human services and any other department of the state which has
information that has a bearing on an applicant's eligibility;
financial institutions except national banks; employers, landlords,
physicians, other service providers, and legally liable relatives.
The administrator will request the applicant's written consent in
order to receive necessary information. In the case of verification
of employment, the administrator will give the applicant written
notice that if he does not provide documentary verification of
benefits received within one (1) week of application, the employer
will be contacted.
Any person who is required to but who refuses to provide
necessary information to the administrator after it has been
requested must state in writing the reasons for the refusal within
three (3) days of receiving the request. Any person who refuses to
provide the information, without just cause, commits a civil
violation and may be subject to a fine of not less than twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) which
may be adjudged in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any person
who willfully renders false information to the overseer or
administrator is guilty of a Class E crime.
The applicant is required to provide all information necessary
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-5 Rev. 6-20-12
13-26
for the administrator to determine if he is eligible for
assistance. When available information is inconclusive or
conflicting regarding a material fact that is necessary to
determine eligibility, the administrator will inform the applicant
what further information is needed. In order to be considered
inconclusive or conflicting, the information on the application
must be inconsistent with other information on the application,
previous applications, or other information received by the
administrator.
The administrator will not grant assistance to any applicant
who refuses to supply necessary information and documentation of
his needs, income, and other resources, or who refuses to grant
permission for the administrator to contact other persons or
otherwise verify the information. If the administrator has
attempted to verify the information but is unable to determine if
the applicant is eligible because the applicant has refused to
provide or allow the administrator to verify the necessary
information, the applicant will be denied assistance until the
necessary verification has been accomplished.
The applicant will be given the opportunity to provide the
necessary information prior to the expiration of the
twenty-four-hour time period within which the administrator must
act on the application. If all the necessary information has been
provided and the applicant is found to be eligible, assistance will
be granted. If the applicant does not provide the required
information needed within the twenty-four-hour period, and the
administrator cannot determine the applicant's eligibility, the
application will be denied on the basis of insufficient information
and documentation. The administrator will notify the applicant that
he may reapply when he can complete the application.
(c) Eligibility of members of person's household. Failure of
an otherwise eligible person to comply with this chapter shall not
affect the general assistance eligibility of any member of the
person's household who is not capable of working, including at
least:
(1) A dependent minor child;
(2) An elderly, ill, or disabled person; and
(3) A person whose presence is required in order to provide
care for any child under the age of six (6) years, or for
any ill or disabled member of the household.
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-5 Rev. 6-20-12
13-27
(d) Minors. A person under the age of eighteen (18) who has
never married and applies for general assistance and who is
pregnant or has a dependent child or children will be eligible to
receive general assistance only if the minor is residing in the
home of his parent, legal guardian or other adult relative, in
which case the entire household will be evaluated for eligibility.
Exceptions to this limitation on eligibility will be made when:
(1) The minor is residing in a foster home, maternity home,
or other adult supervised supportive living arrangement;
or
(2) The minor has no living parent or the whereabouts of both
parents are unknown; or
(3) No parent will permit the minor to live in the parent's
home; or
(4) The minor has lived apart from both parents for at least
one (1) year before the birth of any dependent child; or
(5) The department of human services determines that the
physical or emotional health or safety of the minor or
the minor's dependent child or children would be
jeopardized if the minor and his child or children lived
with a parent; or
(6) The department of human services determines, in
accordance with its regulations, that there is good cause
to waive this limitation on eligibility.
Any unemancipated or unmarried minor under the age of eighteen
(18) who is applying independently from his parents for general
assistance will be informed that until he reaches the age of
eighteen (18), the minor's parents are still legally liable for his
support and the city has the right to seek recovery from the
parents of the cost of all assistance granted to the minor, at
least to the extent his parents are financially capable of repaying
the city. With regard to any such application, the city may seek
verification of the minor's need for general assistance by
contacting his parents. If the applicant's parents declare a
willingness to provide the applicant with his basic needs directly,
and there is no convincing evidence that the applicant would be
jeopardized by relying on his parents for basic needs, the
administrator may find the applicant to be in no need for general
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-5 Rev. 6-20-12
13-28
assistance for the reason that his needs are being provided by a
legally liable relative. Nothing herein modifies or changes
parental or spousal obligation to support an applicant under the
age of twenty-five (25) pursuant to section 13-3(d) above.
(e) Benefits pending verification. Whenever an applicant for
general assistance states to the caseworker that he is in an
emergency situation and requires immediate assistance to meet basic
necessities, the caseworker shall, pending verification, issue to
the applicant either personally or by mail, within twenty-four (24)
hours of the application, sufficient benefits to provide the basic
necessities needed immediately by the applicant, provided that the
following conditions are met:
(1) As a result of the initial interview with the applicant,
the caseworker determines that the applicant will
probably be eligible for assistance after full
verification is completed.
(2) Where possible, at the time of the initial interview, the
applicant shall submit to the caseworker adequate
documentation to verify that there is a need for
immediate assistance.
(3) When adequate documentation is not available at the time
of the initial application, the caseworker may contact at
least one (1) other person for the purpose of obtaining
information to confirm the applicant's statements about
his need for immediate assistance.
(4) Limitations. In no case:
a. May the authorization of benefits under this
section exceed thirty (30) days; and
b. May there be further authorization of benefits to
the applicant until there has been full
verification confirming the applicant's
eligibility.
(Ord. No. 399-92, 6-3-92; Ord. No. 84-93, § 9, 9-8-93)
Sec. 13-6. False representation.
It is unlawful for a person to make knowingly and willfully a
false representation of a material fact in order to receive general
assistance or to cause another to receive assistance. A material
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-6 Rev. 6-20-12
13-29
fact is any information which has a direct bearing on the person's
eligibility. False representation shall consist of any action by an
individual to knowingly and willfully:
(a) Make a false statement to the administrator or the state
department of human services or their agents, either
orally or in writing, in order to obtain assistance to
which the applicant, the applicant's household or another
is otherwise not entitled;
(b) Conceal information from the overseer, administrator or
the state department of human services or its agents in
order to obtain assistance to which the applicant or
applicant's household or another is otherwise not
entitled; or
(c) Transfer real or personal property to a third party
solely to appear eligible for general assistance. There
will be a rebuttable presumption that the applicant
transferred his assets in order to appear eligible for
general assistance if the transfer occurred within thirty
(30) days prior to applying for general assistance, or if
property is sold to a relative or acquaintance for less
than fair market value; or
(d) Use general assistance benefits for a purpose other than
that for which they were intended.
When the administrator has reason to believe a
misrepresentation of circumstances has occurred on an application,
the applicant will be asked to furnish the information needed
and/or verify the accuracy of the information provided. If the
applicant is unwilling or unable to produce the required
verification within a reasonable period of time, and the
administrator concludes that there has been a false representation
of a material fact, the applicant may be ineligible for assistance
for one hundred twenty (120) days, although the remainder of the
applicant's household may still be eligible. False representation
hereunder is a Class E crime.
A person disqualified from receiving general assistance for
making a false representation will be given notice and afforded the
opportunity to appeal the decision to the fair hearing officer in
accordance with section 13-12 of this chapter. No recipient shall
have his assistance reduced or revoked during the period of
eligibility before being notified and given the opportunity to
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-6 Rev. 6-20-12
13-30
appeal the decision.
If an applicant or recipient does not appeal the decision, or
if the fair hearing officer determines that an applicant or
recipient did make a false representation, he will be required to
reimburse the city for any assistance received to which he was not
entitled. Any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of the
fair hearing officer may appeal that decision to the superior court
pursuant to Rule 80-B, Maine Rules of Civil Procedure.
In no event will the disqualification of a person under this
section serve to disqualify any dependent in their household. In
the event one (1) or more members of a household are disqualified
and assistance is requested for the remaining dependents, the
eligibility of those dependents will be calculated as though the
household is comprised of the dependents only, except that the
entire household income will be considered available to them.
(Ord. No. 399-92, 6-3-92; Ord. No. 84-93, § 10, 9-8-93)
Sec. 13-7. Determination of need.
(a) Determination of need. The period of time used to
calculate need will be the thirty-day period starting from the date
of application. Applicants will not be considered in need of
general assistance if their income, property, credit, assets or
other resources available to provide basic necessities for their
household are greater than the applicable overall maximum level of
assistance set forth in section 13-9(a). The difference between the
applicant's income/resources and the overall maximum levels of
assistance established by this chapter is the applicant's deficit.
Once an applicant's deficit has been determined, the specific
maximum levels of assistance for each basic necessity listed in
section 13-9(c) shall be used by the administrator to determine the
distribution of assistance for which the applicant is eligible. The
specific maximum levels of assistance for each basic necessity are
intended to be reasonable and sufficient to maintain health and
decency.
The administrator will calculate applicant's expenses
according to the actual expense of the basic necessity or the
maximum levels for the specific necessities allowed in section
13-9(b) or (c), whichever is less. Applicants will not be
considered eligible if their income and other resources exceed this
calculation (or the overall maximums in section 13-9(a)) except in
an emergency.
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-7 Rev. 6-20-12
13-31
The municipality will provide assistance in an amount up to
the deficit to the extent the applicant is in need of basic
necessities. The municipality will not grant assistance in excess
of the maximum amounts allowed in section 13-9 of this chapter,
except in an emergency.
(b) Income for basic necessities. Applicants are required to
use their income for basic necessities. Except for initial
applicants, no applicant is eligible to receive assistance to
replace income that was spent within the thirty-day period prior to
an application for assistance on goods and services that are not
basic necessities. All income spent on goods and services that are
not basic necessities will be considered available to the applicant
and combined with the applicant's prospective thirty-day income for
the purposes of computing eligibility. Applicants who have
sufficient income to purchase goods or services which are not basic
necessities will not be considered eligible for assistance. Persons
who exhaust their income on basic necessities and who still need
assistance with other basic necessities will be eligible, provided
that their income does not exceed the overall maximum level of
assistance.
(c) Use-of-income requirements. Except for initial
applicants, anyone applying for general assistance must document
their use of income to the administrator.
Cable television, mail orders, cigarettes/alcohol, gifts,
purchases, costs of trips or vacations, court fines paid,
repayments of unsecured loans, credit card debt, costs associated
with pet care, legal fees, late fees or key deposits are not
considered basic necessities and will not be included in the budget
computation. The foregoing list is not intended to be exhaustive
and the administrator is authorized to promulgate and update as
needed a list of ineligible items.
The city reserves the right to impose specific use-of-income
requirements on any applicant, other than an initial applicant, who
fails to use his income for basic necessities or fails to
reasonably document his use of income. Those additional
requirements will be applied in the following manner:
(1) The administrator may require the applicant to use some
or all of his income, at the time it becomes available,
toward specific basic necessities. The administrator may
prioritize such required expenditures so that most or all
of the applicant's income is applied to housing (i.e.,
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-7 Rev. 6-20-12
13-32
rent/mortgage), energy (i.e., heating fuel, electricity),
or other specified basic necessities.
(2) The administrator will notify applicants in writing of
the specific use-of-income requirements placed on them.
(3) If upon subsequent application it cannot be determined
how the applicant's income was spent, or it is determined
that some or all of the applicant's income was not spent
as directed and was also not spent on basic necessities,
the applicant will not be eligible to receive either
regular or emergency general assistance to replace that
income.
(4) If the applicant does not spend his income as directed,
but can show with verifiable documentation that all
income was spent on basic necessities up to allowed
amounts, the applicant will remain eligible to the extent
of the applicant's eligibility and need.
(Ord. No. 399-92, 6-3-92)
Sec. 13-8. Income.
(a) Income standards. Applicants whose income exceeds the
overall maximum level of assistance provided in section 13-9(a)
shall not be eligible for general assistance except in an
emergency. The administrator will conduct an individual factual
inquiry into the applicant's income and expenses each time they
apply.
(b) Calculation of income. To determine whether applicants
are in need, the administrator will calculate the income they will
receive during the next thirty-day period commencing on the date of
application and any assets or resources that would alleviate their
need. For all applicants other than initial applicants, the
administrator will also consider as available income any income
that was not spent during the previous thirty-day period on basic
necessities, as well as any income that was spent on basic
necessities in unreasonable excess of the chapter maximums for
specific basic necessities. If the applicant's income exceeds the
amount needed for basic necessities, up to the maximum levels
contained in section 13-9, the applicant will not be considered in
need. Exceptions will be made in emergency situations which may
necessitate that the maximum levels be exceeded. To calculate
weekly income and expenses, the administrator will divide the
applicant's monthly income and expenses by four and three-tenths (4
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-8 Rev. 6-20-12
13-33
3/10).
(c) Types of income. Income, defined in section 13-2, which
will be considered in determining an applicant's need includes, but
is not limited to:
(1) Earned income. Income in cash or in kind earned by the
applicant through wages, salary, commissions or profit,
whether self-employed or as an employee, is to be
included. When income consists of wages, the amount
computed will be that available after taxes, social
security and other payroll deductions required by state,
federal and local law. Rental income and profit from
produce sold fall into this category. Income that is held
in trust and unavailable to the applicant or the
applicant's dependents will not be considered as earned
income. Actual work-related expenses such as union dues,
transportation to and from work, special equipment and
child care costs will be deducted from income.
(2) Self-employment. With respect to self-employment, total
profit is arrived at by subtracting reasonable business
expenses from gross income. In the event that business
expenses exceed income, or there is no reasonable
likelihood that the business will be profitable within a
three-month period, the applicant will be required to
comply with the work requirements.
(3) Income from spouse or support from relatives.
Contributions from a spouse or relatives who are not
members of the applicant's household will be considered
income only if it is actually received by the applicant
or used to pay any of his expenses. Income from unrelated
household members will be considered available to the
applicant, whether or not the household member is legally
obligated for the support of the applicant, if the
household members pool or share their income and expenses
or intermingle their funds so as to provide support to
one another.
(4) Income from other assistance or social services programs.
State categorical assistance benefits, SSI payments,
social security payments, VA benefits, unemployment
insurance benefits and payments from other government
sources will be considered as income, unless expressly
prohibited by federal law or regulation. Food stamps and
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-8 Rev. 6-20-12
13-34
fuel assistance payments made by the home energy
assistance program will not be considered income.
(5) Court-ordered support payments. Alimony and child support
payments will be considered income only if actually
received by the applicant. The administrator will refer
cases where support payments are not actually received to
the state department of human services' support
enforcement location unit.
(6) Income from other sources. Payments from pensions,
annuities, trust funds, and disability or other insurance
will be considered income. Income from unrelated
household members who occupy the same dwelling unit and
who contribute their fair share for living expenses such
as rent, fuel and utilities will not be considered income
that is available to the applicant unless actually
received by the applicant. However, only the applicant's
prorata share of expenses will be considered when
determining his expenses. Income also includes gifts and
cash received on secured or unsecured credit, from any
source.
(7) Earnings of a son or daughter. Income from children who
are members of the household will be considered
available. Earned income received by sons and daughters
below the age of eighteen (18) who are full-time students
and who are not working full-time will not be considered
income.
(8) Income from household members. Income from all related
members of the household will be considered available
except as provided in (7) above.
(9) Pooling of income. When two (2) or more individuals share
the same dwelling unit but not all members of the
household are applying for general assistance, there is a
rebuttable presumption that the entire household is
pooling income. One (1) or more applicants for assistance
can successfully rebut the presumption that all household
income is being pooled by providing the administrator
with verifiable information affirmatively demonstrating a
pattern of nonpooling for the duration of the shared
living arrangement. If the applicant is unable to
successfully rebut the presumption that all household
income is being pooled, eligibility of the entire
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-8 Rev. 6-20-12
13-35
household will be determined based on total household
income. If the applicant successfully rebuts the
presumption that all household income is being pooled,
the applicant's eligibility will be determined on the
basis of his income and his prorata share of actual
household expenses.
(10) Lump sum income. The lump sum proration in section 13-2
above and herein only applies to applicants who:
a. Are not initial applicants; and
b. Had notice, prior to receiving the lump sum
payment, of the authority to prorate eligibility.
If these conditions are met, the lump sum proration will
be determined as follows:
a. Subtract from the lump sum payment all deductions
required by state or federal law;
b. Subtract from the lump sum any amount the applicant
can demonstrate was spent on basic necessities,
including all basic necessities provided by general
assistance up to the specific maximum levels of
assistance, per month, provided in this chapter;
payment of funeral or burial expenses for a family
member; travel costs related to the illness or
death of a family member; repair or replacement of
essentials lost due to fire, flood or other natural
disaster; repair or purchase of a motor vehicle
essential for employment, education, training or
other day-to-day living necessities; and
c. Divide the remaining amount by the applicant's
maximum monthly allocation of general assistance.
This amount represents the number of months from the
receipt of the lump sum payment that the applicant(s)
will not be eligible for general assistance, except in an
emergency. No proration of eligibility can extend longer
than twelve (12) months from the date of application.
Applicants who have been declared ineligible by reason of
lump sum proration shall be eligible for emergency
general assistance during the period of proration
according to the standards at section 13-3(i) of this
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-8 Rev. 6-20-12
13-36
chapter.
(Ord. No. 399-92, 6-3-92)
Sec. 13-9. Basic necessities.
(a) Overall maximum levels of assistance. Notwithstanding any
of the maximum levels of assistance for specific basic necessities
listed in this section, an applicant's eligibility for general
assistance will be first determined by subtracting his total
income, less voluntary deductions mandated by state, federal or
local law, from the overall maximum level of assistance established
by 22 M.R.S.A. Sec. 4305(3-B) and published by Maine Municipal
Association for the applicable household size. Except on initial
applications, applicants must apply their income to basic
necessities. Applicants whose income exceeds the overall maximum
level of assistance and/or applicants who have not applied their
income toward basic needs as required shall not be eligible for
general assistance, unless they are in an emergency.
The overall maximum levels of assistance shall be periodically
adjusted to conform to 22 M.R.S.A. Sec. 4305(3-B) as published in
Maine Municipal Association’s General Assistance Manual. A copy of
the maximum levels of assistance shall be on file in, and available
from the city’s general assistance office.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter for the
period from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013, to comply with 22
M.R.S.A. §4305(3)(C) as enacted by the State’s supplemental budget
for FY’13, the overall maximum allowed shall be:

1124

1517
*Note: Add $68 for each additional person.
(b) Maximum levels of assistance for specific basic
necessities. The municipality will grant assistance to eligible
applicants for basic necessities according to the maximum levels
for specific types of assistance set forth below. The
administrator, in consultation with the applicant, may apply the
amount of the applicant's deficit toward assistance with any one
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-9 Rev. 6-20-12
13-37
(1) or combination of necessities not to exceed the total deficit.
In all cases, either the actual expenses the applicant incurs for
basic necessities or the maximum amount allowed in each category,
whichever is less, will be used in determining need. The maximum
levels will be strictly adhered to although, if the administrator
determines that there are exceptional circumstances and an
emergency is shown to exist, these absolute levels will be waived
in order to meet immediate needs.
No assistance will be granted to an applicant for any expense
which has been or will be paid by another person, or which has been
incurred in another person's name.
(c) Necessary expenses. Assistance will be granted pursuant
to the provisions of this section except that for the period from
July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013 the Administrator will provide rent
or mortgage payments that are reasonable within the allowed maximum
levels and in accordance with the housing assistance limits and
exceptions provided in Title 22 M.R.S.A. §4308, subsections 1-A and
1-B, as enacted by the State’s supplemental budget for FY’13 and as

When the city issues in aggregate more than six hundred
dollars ($600.00) in rental payments to any landlord in
any calendar year, a 1099 Form declaring the total amount
of rental payments during the calendar year will be
issued to the Internal Revenue Service. This may be
adjusted by the administrator to comply with IRS
regulations.
Any landlord wishing to receive rental payments from the
city on behalf of any applicant must comply with all
state and local licensing and land use codes. The city
reserves the right to inspect any rental unit whenever an

(8) Nonelective medical expenses. The city will pay for
nonelective medical expenses, other than hospital bills
(see below), provided that the city is notified and
approves the expenses and services prior to their being
made or delivered. The city will grant assistance for
medical service only when assistance cannot be obtained
from any other source and the applicant would not be able
to receive necessary medical care without the city's
assistance. The applicant is required to utilize any
resource, including any federal or state program, that
will diminish his need to seek general assistance for
medical expenses. The city will grant assistance for
nonemergency medical services only if a physician
verifies that the services are nonelective. The
administrator may require a second medical opinion from a
physician designated by the city at the city's expense to
verify the necessity of the services.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following will be
considered nonelective only in exceptional circumstances
which are verified by a physician of the city's choice:
chiropractic, acupuncture and/or massage therapy
services.
Except in the case of a medical emergency, applicants
must use available medical resources including, but not
limited to, medical providers readily accessible to
applicant and to minimize cost thereof to the city
through the use of medicaid providers. It is the
applicant's responsibility to apply promptly for medicaid
and to secure the services of a provider who accepts
medicaid reimbursement.
(9) Hospital bills. In the event of an emergency admission to
the hospital, the hospital must notify the administrator
within five (5) business days of the admission.
Notification must be by telephone, confirmed by certified
mail, or by certified mail only. If a hospital fails to
give timely notice to the administrator, the city will
have no obligation to pay the bill.
Any person who cannot pay his hospital bill must apply to
the hospital for consideration under the hospital's
charity care program as provided in Title 22 M.R.S.A.
396-F(1). Anyone who is not eligible for the hospital's
charity care program may apply for general assistance.
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-9 Rev. 6-20-12
13-45
Applicants must apply for assistance within thirty (30)
days of being discharged from the hospital and provide a
notice from the hospital certifying that they are not
eligible for the hospital's charity care program.
Before the administrator will consider whether to allow a
hospital bill as a necessary expense, the applicant must
enter into a reasonable payment arrangement with the
hospital. The payment arrangement will be based upon the
medicaid rate. In determining an applicant's eligibility,
the city will budget the monthly payment to the hospital
the applicant has agreed to pay. The applicant's need for
assistance with a hospital bill will be considered each
time he applies by including the amount of the bill in
the applicant's monthly budget, but the recipient will be
responsible for making any necessary payments to the
hospital pursuant to the use-of-income requirements found
at section 13-7(c) above.
(10) Dental. The city will pay for nonelective medically
necessary dental services only. If full mouth extractions
are necessary, the city will pay for dentures provided
the applicant has no other resources to pay for the
dentures. The applicant will be referred to a dental
clinic in the area whenever possible. The administrator
will expect the applicant to bear a reasonable part of
the cost for dental services, including extractions and
dentures, taking into account the applicant's ability to
pay.
(11) Eye care. In order to be eligible to receive general
assistance for eyeglasses, an applicant must have his
medical need certified by a person licensed to practice
optometry. The general assistance administrator will
provide assistance for eyeglasses to eligible persons
only after the applicant has exhausted all other
available resources.
(12) Telephone charge. Payment for a basic telephone charge
will only be authorized if a telephone is necessary for
medical reasons as verified by a physician.
(13) Burials/cremations. Burial services will be provided only
in instances where there is no other person or agency to
perform the function. The administrator will respect the
wishes of family members with regard to whether the
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-9 Rev. 6-20-12
13-46
deceased is interred by means of burial or cremated.
a. Burials. The maximum amount of general assistance
granted for the purpose of burial is $1,125.00,
with additional payments, where there is an actual
cost, for:
1. the wholesale cost of a cement liner if the
cemetery by-laws require one;
2. the opening and closing of the grave site; and
3. a lot in the least expensive section of the
cemetery. If the municipality is able to
provide a cemetery lot in a city owned
cemetery or in a cemetery under city control,
the cost of the cemetery lot in any other
cemetery will not be paid by the city.
The city’s obligation to provide funds for burial
purposes is limited to a reasonable calculation of
the funeral director’s direct costs, not to exceed
the maximum amounts of assistance described in this
section. Allowable burial expenses are limited to:
removal of the body from a local residence or
institution; a secured death certificate or
obituary; embalming; a minimum casket; a reasonable
cost for necessary transportation; and other
reasonable and necessary specified direct costs, as
itemized by the funeral director and approved by
the administrator.
b. Cremation expenses. In the absence of any objection
by any family members of the deceased known to the
administrator, or when neither the administrator
nor the funeral director can locate any family
members, the administrator may issue general
assistance for cremation services. The maximum
amount of assistance granted for a cremation shall
be $785.00, with additional payments, where there
is an actual cost, for a cremation lot in the least
expensive section of the cemetery, a reasonable
cost for a burial urn not to exceed $50.00, and
transportation costs borne by the funeral director
at a reasonable rate per mile for transporting the
remains to and from the cremation facility.
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-9 Rev. 6-20-12
13-47
c. Application for burial/cremation expenses must be
made by the closest relative available before the
burial/cremation takes place to be eligible for
city assistance. Such application shall be made on
behalf of and in the name of the deceased. When
there is no relative, the city will provide
assistance only if written notification is received
prior to burial or cremation or by the end of the
next business day following the funeral director's
receipt of the body, whichever is earlier. It is
the funeral director’s responsibility to make a
good faith effort to determine if the family or any
other persons are going to pay all or part of the
burial/cremation expenses. If family members or
others are unable to pay the expenses, and the
funeral director wants the city to pay all or part
of the expenses, the funeral director must make
timely contact to the administrator. Any and all
contributions or benefits from any other sources
which are available must be deducted from the
maximum amounts which the city will pay for burial
or cremation.
d. A decision on any application for assistance with
burial/cremation expenses need not be rendered
until the administrator has verified that no
relative or other resource is available to pay for
the burial/cremation costs, but the decision must
be rendered within ten (10) days after receiving an
application. The father, mother, grandfather,
grandmother, children, grandchildren or siblings,
by consanguinity, living within or owning real or
tangible property within the state shall be
responsible for burial or cremation costs for the
eligible person in proportion to their respective
abilities, on either a lump sum or installment
payment basis. All legally liable relatives must
provide the administrator with any reasonably
requested information regarding their income,
assets, and basic living expenses.
e. The administrator may adjust the maximum levels of
assistance for burials and cremation expenses to
conform to those adopted in the Maine Municipal
Association General Assistance Manual, as it may be
City of Portland General Assistance
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13
Sec. 13-9 Rev. 6-20-12
13-48
amended from time to time.
(14) Property taxes. In the event an applicant requests
assistance with his property taxes, the administrator
will inform the applicant that there are two (2)
procedures to request that relief, i.e., the poverty
general assistance. If the applicant chooses to seek
property tax assistance through general assistance, or if
the applicant is denied a poverty tax abatement, the
administrator may consider using general assistance to
meet this need only if:
a. The property tax in question is for the applicant's
place of residence; and
b. There is a tax lien on the property which is due to
mature within sixty (60) days of the date of
application; and
c. The applicant uses all available resources for
property tax relief.
(15) Transportation. Applicants are expected to utilize all
resources available for transportation, including walking
reasonable distances. Assistance for transportation will
be granted only if necessary to pursue a bona fide job
offer or as a work-related expense or if determined to be
necessary to the applicant's health and safety and
transportation cannot be obtained from any other source
or through any other means. Resources in the city which
minimize the need for transportation assistance must be
utilized. The amount and type of assistance granted will
be the minimum necessary to alleviate the need.
(16) Other assistance. Assistance may be granted with
household items only upon a determination by the
administrator that such assistance is essential to the
applicant's health and safety and cannot be obtained from
any other source or through any other means. The amount
and type of assistance will be the minimum necessary to
alleviate the need.

The city may recover general assistance granted to a recipient
from relatives or others pursuant to state law and to the extent of
their liability thereunder. Further, the city may claim a lien for
the value of all general assistance payments made to a recipient on
any lump sum payment made to the recipient under the worker's
compensation act or similar law of any other state. Such lien shall
be claimed pursuant to state law. The city will be reimbursed for
general assistance payments to a recipient who receives
Supplemental Security Income pursuant to state and federal law and
regulation.

person may still apply for and, if eligible, receive assistance.

ARTICLE II. DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION
DIVISION 1. GENERALLY
Sec. 13.5-21. Legislative findings and statement of policy.
The council finds that:
(a) The population of the city consists of people of every
sexual orientation, some of whom are discriminated against in
employment opportunities, housing, access to public accommodations
and in the extension of financial credit;
(b) Neither the federal government, nor the state, nor the
city currently has any law prohibiting discrimination based on
sexual orientation;
(c) There has been a disturbing increase in the number of
violent incidents within the city in which individuals have been
attacked because of their sexual orientation; and
(d) The lack of legal protection for individuals discourages
them from publicizing acts of discrimination out of fear of
reprisal.
Therefore, in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare, it is declared to be the policy of this city to prevent
discrimination in employment, housing, access to public
accommodations or in the extension of credit, on account of sexual
orientation.

ARTICLE II. CREATION OF DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP AND RELATED RIGHTS

(b) the diverse composition of its citizenry is an
important part of the social fabric of the community;
(c) the citizens’ lives have evolved from when laws
governing family relationships were enacted;
(d) the traditional definition of “family” excludes a

deprives them of recognition and validation, and
denies certain rights that should be afforded to
persons who share their homes, their hearts and their
lives;
(e) the City is committed to nondiscrimination and fair
treatment of its citizens and employees;
Therefore, in order to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare, it is declared to be the policy of this city to
allow persons in committed relationships who meet the criteria
established by the City as constituting domestic partnerships to
register at the office of the City Clerk and obtain a
certificate attesting to their status; to provide certain rights
of access for domestic partners; and to equalize the treatment
of City employees.

13.6-8
School Committee:
(1) A domestic partner, who is also the parent or
legal guardian of a child, may file a form at or
send a letter to the child’s school to indicate
that the parent’s domestic partner shall have
access to the child’s records, access to school
personnel in matters concerning the child, and
access to the child, including the right to
remove such child from the school for sickness or
family emergency. The school shall afford such
person access as directed by the child’s parent.
(2) When a domestic partnership is terminated
pursuant to Section 13.6-23, it is the
responsibility of the parent or guardian to
notify the school, in writing, of the termination
of rights of the former domestic partner.
(3) The term “school” includes, but is not limited
to, high schools, vocational schools, junior high
and middle schools, elementary schools, preschool
programs, after-school programs and day care
programs directly funded by the city in whole or
in part.
(c) Subsections (b)(1), (2), and (3) above apply to any
non-public school or school system, and any child care
programs in those schools, or any other child care
programs, that accept city grant funds for any
purpose, regardless of any vote by that school or
school system’s or child care program’s governing
body.
(d) Domestic partners shall be considered a family for the
purpose of eligibility for any benefits or programs
provided by the city to families and, wherever the

or guidelines, the term shall include domestic
partners.
(Ord. No. 250-01, 5-21-01)
Section 13.6-27 Employment benefits.
(a) The City and, upon approval of this section, in whole

City of Portland Domestic Partnership
Code of Ordinances Chapter 13.6
Sec. 13.6-28 Rev. 7-20-05
13.6-9
School Department shall provide the same health and employment
fringe benefits to employees with domestic partners as to
employees with spouses. As used in this chapter, “employees”
refers to active and retired employees of the City and the
Portland School Department eligible for benefits pursuant to
state or municipal law, employment policies or collective
bargaining agreements.
(b) Employees must file a declaration or affidavit of
domestic partnership, signed under the pains and penalties of
perjury, with their department administrator or Department of
Human Resources of the City or School Department, as
appropriate, in order to obtain benefits under this chapter. On
such declaration, employees shall agree to notify their
department administrator or the Department of Human Resources of

file a domestic partnership registration form with the City
Clerk.
(c) The City and School Department shall provide medical
insurance coverage to an employee’s domestic partner as it does
to an employee’s spouse, and to the dependent(s) of an
employee’s domestic partnership as it does to an employee’s
child(ren). An employee may opt to decline medical insurance
coverage for her or his domestic partner, without foregoing the
right to obtain medical insurance coverage for her or his
domestic partner at a later date on the same terms that late
enrollment is allowed to other employees.
(d) Upon termination of a domestic partnership by an
employee, the domestic partner shall be covered by medical
insurance until the end of the month in which termination
paperwork is dated. If the employee leaves employment with the
City or School Department prior to the end of the month in which
termination paperwork is dated, the medical insurance shall
lapse on the date that the former employee’s insurance lapses.
The former domestic partner and children of the domestic
partner (if applicable) will be offered the coverage provided by
federal law under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act (COBRA), as amended.
(e) Upon termination of a domestic partnership by the
death of an employee, the surviving domestic partner’s medical

married employee, upon the death of such employee.
(f) Employees shall be granted the same bereavement or
funeral leave, with pay, for the death of a domestic partner or
family member of a domestic partner as that provided for a
spouse or family member of a spouse. Use of the term “in-law”
in employee handbooks shall include the relatives of a domestic
partner.
(g) Employees shall be granted sick leave to care for a
domestic partner to the same extent permitted to care for a
spouse, and to care for a dependent of a domestic partnership to
the same extent permitted to care for a child.
(h) Employees shall be entitled to take parental leave to
take care of a child born to their domestic partner or a newly
adopted child to the same extent as a married person.

exception of the medical insurance contributions assumed by a

partnership.

injunctions against the sale or rental to others of
the housing accommodations as to which the violation
allegedly occurred, or against the sale or rental of a
single housing accommodation substantially identical
thereto and controlled by the alleged violator shall
be liberally granted in the interests of furthering
the purposes of this article, when it appears probable
that the plaintiff will succeed upon final disposition
of the case.

retaliation occurred, its judgment shall specify an
appropriate remedy or remedies therefore. Such
remedies may include, but are not limited to:

shown, lines within blocks less than two hundred (200)
feet wide are median lines between their sides, and
lines within blocks two hundred (200) feet or more
wide are one hundred (100) feet distant from the less
restricted side of the block.
(b) The depictions of the shoreland zoning districts and

determined by measurement of the distance indicated on
the maps from the normal high water line of the water
body or the upland edge of wetland vegetation. Where
such measurement is not the same as the location of
the boundary on the Shoreland Zoning Maps, the
measurement shall control, unless the Shoreland Zoning

more restricted portion, provided that the lot has at least
twenty (20) feet of street frontage in the less restricted zone
when taken together with adjacent premises which are under the
same or equivalent ownership or control. If such boundary line
divides a business or industrial zone from a residence zone, no
frontage on a street other than the principal business street in

available by law. No alleged violation of a contract or
conditional rezoning may be prosecuted until the City has
delivered written notice of the alleged violation(s) to the
owner or operator of the property that is subject to the
contract or conditional rezoning and given the owner or operator
an opportunity to cure the violation(s) within thirty (30) days
of receipt of the notice.

a finding that the terms of the conditional or contract zone
have been violated, then the City may act to modify or rescind
the conditional or contract zone and to rezone the property.

Sec. 14-135. Purpose.
The purpose of the R-6 residential zone is:
(a) To set aside areas on the peninsula for housing
characterized primarily by multifamily dwellings at a high
density providing a wide range of housing for differing types of
households; and to conserve the existing housing stock and
residential character of neighborhoods by controlling the scale
and external impacts of professional offices and other
nonresidential uses.
(b) In cases of qualifying small, vacant, underutilized
lots located in the urban residential and business zone, to
encourage new housing development consistent with the compact
lot development pattern typically found on the peninsula.
The purpose of the R-6A residential zone is:
(c) To encourage neighborhood livability with higher density
multi-family housing on large parcels located off the peninsula.
The zone is appropriate in areas that are along major public
transportation routes, near service areas, and in redevelopment
(underutilized) or infill areas.

Sec. 14-140.5. Munjoy Hill Neighborhood Conservation Overlay
District.
The residential neighborhoods on Munjoy Hill are experiencing
specific development pressures related to its location and the
nature of the existing building stock, further documented in work
by the City’s Planning & Urban Development Department in the
winter of 2018. In order to address the negative impacts of these
pressures and create a positive framework for investment in the
area, there shall be a Munjoy Hill Neighborhood Conservation
Overlay District (the “District”).
(a) Area of Effect.
This District will apply in the highlighted area depicted on
the map below and includes all properties in the R-6 zoning
district in an area east of Washington Avenue and Mountfort
Street, north of Fore Street, and west of the Eastern Promenade.

(b) Effect of the District.
In addition to the standards contained in Chapter 14,
Division 7 of the Portland City Code that are applicable to
properties in the R-6 zone all properties within this District
shall meet the standards in this Section 14-140.5. Where this
Section imposes a standard that differs from the standards
contained in Articles III, IV, and V of Chapter 14, the City of
Portland Design Manual or City of Portland Technical Manual, the
standards in this Section shall control.
(c) Dimensional Standards.
Within the District, the following dimensional standards
requirements supersede those dimensional standards outlined
elsewhere in Chapter 14:

lots over 2000 sf. that include at least one
“workforce housing unit for rent” or “workforce
housing unit for sale”, defined elsewhere in
this ordinance. Workforce units shall be no
smaller than 50% of the average size of the
other units in the development, must meet the
definition for such units and only be sold or
rented to a household at or below the applicable
income levels. These requirements shall be deed
restricted for affordability for the longest
term possible under state and federal law.
Rooftop appurtenances other than chimneys shall
not exceed permitted heights, except that HVAC
equipment is permitted for up to 5’ above these
maximum heights if (a) out of view from public
rights-of-way, screened adequately, and
integrated with the building design and (b) set
back at least 5’ from the building edge. In
addition, height limits and placement of
alternative energy equipment is permitted as

(d) Design Standards.
1. In addition, the
following design
standards shall apply
in the District and
shall supersede any
conflicting design
standards:
a. All
buildings shall
use simple,
traditional roof
forms as
illustrated in
Diagrams 14-
140.5.c-f.,
except that flat
roofs are
permitted in
buildings of 3 or
more units. This
requirement may
also be modified
through (d)2
below. Dormers
and cross gables
are allowed but
where readily
visible from the
public right-ofway
shall be
clearly
subsidiary to the
primary roof form
(see Diagram 14-
140.5.g);
b. The first
floor shall
contain active
living space, such as a living room or bedroom, with
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-140.5 Rev. 6-5-2018
14-173
windows for at least 50% of the width of the front
façade in total (see Diagram 14-140.5.h). Active living
space does not include space intended primarily for
circulation or storage;
c. Use of tandem spaces to meet desired parking
levels, consistent with the built pattern of the
neighborhood, is strongly preferred. Parking shall be
located on the side or in the rear of a building, and
not within the front 10’ depth of the building. The
only exception shall be for lots smaller than 2,000
sf., which shall be permitted one garage door on the
front façade no wider than 30% of the building width,
but no less than 9’. In that case, the garage door
shall (1) be of high quality design, consistent with
the character and pattern of the rest of the façade,
including windows as appropriate; and (2) be located on
one side of the façade (see Diagrams 14-140.5.i-j).
2. Within the District, developments are only eligible for
the R-6 “Alternative Design Review” as outlined by the
following process, which shall supersede the process in the
City of Portland Design Manual in cases of conflict:
a. Any use of Alternative Design Review must be
approved by a majority of the Historic Preservation
Board after a required public hearing;
b. Alternative Design Review does not permit waivers
of the additional design requirements in section (d)1
above except as explicitly stated; and
c. Alternative Design Review is a privilege and is
granted at the discretion of the Historic Preservation
Board. The applicant has the burden of demonstrating
that their proposal meets the criteria for Alternative
Design Review Design Certificate.
(e) Demolition Review.
1. The purpose of this section is to preserve and protect
buildings within the District that contribute significantly
to one’s understanding and appreciation of the
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-140.5 Rev. 6-5-2018
14-174
architectural, cultural, and/or social history and
development pattern of Munjoy Hill and which are outside any
designated historic district (“Preferably Preserved
Buildings”) encouraging owners of such Preferably Preserved
Buildings to explore alternatives to demolition. To achieve
this purpose, the issuance of demolition permits for
Preferably Preserved Buildings is regulated and may be
delayed as provided below.
2. Definitions: For the purposes of this section, the
following words and phrases shall have the meanings set
forth below:
Demolition: Removal of more than 10% of the front façade of
any building, removal of the primary roof line, or removal
of 50% or more of the building surface, determined
cumulatively over a three year period. In kind replacement
or similar replacement (such as new windows or siding that
may differ from the original) is not considered demolition.
Preferably Preserved Building: Any building which is
determined to be in the public interest to be preserved or
rehabilitated rather than demolished based on findings that
the building meets the following criteria:
a. It was constructed prior to 1930;
b. It is representative of a building type and/or
architectural style that contributes to the
identifiable historic visual character of Munjoy Hill;
and
c. It retains sufficient integrity of design,
materials, condition and craftsmanship that adaptive
reuse is a viable option.
Voluntarily Demolished: Any act(s) done by design or
intention, which is proposed, intended, or not accidental,
that result in demolition. Results of weather events or
natural hazards are not considered voluntary demolition.
For the purposes of this chapter, the destruction of a
preferably preserved building for failure to properly secure
it or by neglect shall be considered voluntary demolition.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-140.5 Rev. 6-5-2018
14-175
3. Exclusions: This section shall not apply to (a) any
building either individually designated as a local landmark
or located within the boundaries of any designated historic
district; (b) accessory structures with a ground coverage of
144 square feet or less; (c) buildings that the Building
Authority has determined are dangerous to life or property
due to fire, accidental catastrophic damage, or a natural
disaster; and (d) buildings that have received a previous
determination that they are not Preferably Preserved.
4. Procedure: When the Building Authority receives a
demolition permit application for a building within the
District, s/he shall, within three business days, notify the
Planning Authority in writing that a demolition permit
application has been received.
a. Determination of Preferably Preserved.
i. Initial Determination: The Planning Authority
shall make an initial written determination as to
whether the building that is the subject of the
demolition permit application is a Preferably
Preserved Building within thirty days of receiving
a copy of the application. In making this
determination, the Planning Authority may request
additional information from the applicant,
including photos of the existing building and the
surrounding context or other data that s/he
determines may be relevant to making an initial
determination. If the Planning Authority
determines that the building is not Preferably
Preserved, this determination shall be transmitted
to the Building Authority and the applicant of
record. The applicant will not be required to take
any further steps and the permit may be reviewed
by the Building Authority under the standards in
Chapter 6.
ii. If the Planning Authority makes an initial
determination that the building is Preferably
Preserved, it shall notify the Building Authority
and the applicant.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-140.5 Rev. 6-5-2018
14-176
iii. If the Planning Authority fails to act in
accordance with this section or within the
prescribed time periods, the Building Authority
may grant the demolition permit, provided that the
applicant has met all other required by Chapter 6
for a permit, and shall notify the Planning
Authority that the permit has been granted.
iv. Right to Appeal Planning Authority Determination:
After the Planning Authority's initial
determination that a demolition permit application
involves a Preferably Preserved Building, the
applicant for a demolition permit may appeal the
determination to the Historic Preservation Board
with any background information regarding the
structure and its context that may be deemed
relevant to or appropriate for that review. Such
material shall include plans for any replacement
use of the parcel that may assist in making a
determination. Such appeal must be made within
thirty days of the initial determination.
v. Public Hearing: The Historic Preservation Board
shall conduct a hearing on the appeal and the
initial determination within forty-five days of
the Planning Authority's initial determination.
The Board shall give the public notice of the
hearing at least fourteen days prior to the
hearing. The Board shall also mail a notice of
the public hearing to the applicant, the building
owner and all property owners within 100 feet of
the subject property at least ten days prior to
the hearing.
vi. Final Determination of Preferably Preserved
Building: Within twenty-one days following the
date of the public hearing, the Historic
Preservation Board shall file a final
determination with the Building Authority. If the
Board determines that the demolition of the
building would be detrimental to the
architectural, cultural, or social heritage of
Munjoy Hill, it must uphold the initial
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-140.5 Rev. 6-5-2018
14-177
determination of the Planning Authority of a
Preferably Preserved Building. In a case where
the initial determination of the Planning
Authority is not appealed, that determination
shall be considered a final determination upon
lapse of the appeal period in 4., above, in which
case the Planning Authority shall forward a final
determination to the Building Authority.
5. Upon the final determination of Preferably Preserved
status, the Building Authority shall not issue a demolition
permit for a period of up to 12 months except as specified
in b. below. During this period, the applicant and the owner
should actively pursue alternatives to demolition of the
Preferably Preserved Building. Should the Historic
Preservation Board determine that the building is of
sufficient historic and/or architectural significance that
it should be designated a landmark or otherwise gain
historic designation, that process will proceed as it would
for any other building.
a. Upon a determination of Preferably Preserved
status, the owner shall be responsible for properly
securing the building.
b. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Building
Authority may issue a demolition permit for all or any
portion of subject building at any time upon
authorization from the Planning Authority in the event
the Historic Preservation Board approves a development
for the site as consistent with the Historic Resource
Design Standards as applied to a new building prior to
the conclusion of the 12-month delay period. Examples
of such proposals may include but are not limited to:
• Demolition of a portion of the building while
maintaining the principal structure and/or most
architecturally significant portion of the
building;
• Demolition of the Preferably Preserved Building
but with a replacement proposal that is acceptably
contextual in the surrounding neighborhood. In
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-140.5 Rev. 6-5-2018
14-178
this case, the Board may condition demolition on
construction of a project substantively consistent
with the approved replacement proposal, and any
substantive variation from that plan would be
treated as a violation under 7. below; or
• Notwithstanding the initial determination,
demonstration by the applicant, substantiated by
the written opinion of a licensed engineer with
experience in renovation, restoration or
rehabilitation and confirmed by the Building
Authority, that the structural condition of the
building is so severe as to make it infeasible to
rehabilitate.
6. Emergency demolition: Nothing in this article shall
interfere with the ability of the Building Authority to
permit demolition of buildings determined dangerous to life
or property due to a condition that pre-dates the effective
date of this section or is the result of fire, accidental
catastrophic damage, or a natural disaster.
7. Enforcement.
a. The Planning Authority and Building Authority are
each specifically authorized to institute any and all
actions and proceedings, in law or in equity, as they
deem necessary and appropriate to obtain compliance
with the requirements of this article, or to prevent a
threatened violation thereof.
b. No building permit shall issue for a new building
on any premises where a significant building is
voluntarily demolished in violation of this ordinance
for a period of two years after the date of demolition.
8. A demolition review shall be reported to the City
Council annually as a Communication.

DIVISION 7.01. R-7 COMPACT URBAN RESIDENTIAL OVERLAY ZONE
Section 14-141. Purpose.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-141 Rev. 12-20-1999
14-179
The purpose of the R-7 Compact Urban Residential Overlay
Zone is to encourage and accommodate compact residential
development on appropriate locations on the Portland peninsula,
pursuant to the New Vision for Bayside element of the
comprehensive plan and housing plans of the City of Portland.
Sites suitable for in-city living should be within walking
distance of downtown or other work places, shopping and
community facilities and have access to public or private offsite
parking or transit service. The intent of this zone is to
foster increased opportunities for compact in-city living for
owners and renters representing a variety of income levels and
household types.
Locations for siting the R-7 Zone are intended to be
located on the peninsula of Portland, in the area encompassed in
the Bayside plan, and other peninsula R-6 locations
characterized by moderate to high density multi-family housing
in a form and density exceeding that allowed in the R-6 Zone and
where infill development opportunities exist; and areas on the
peninsula with mixed business and residential zoning and uses
which can accommodate higher density infill residential
development without negatively impacting the existing
neighborhood or adjacent properties. It may be appropriate in
some cases to rezone to R-7 overlay through conditional or
contract zoning to ensure that the new development is
architecturally appropriate and compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood.
(Ord. No. 122, 12-20-99)
Sec. 14-142. Permitted Uses.
Permitted uses in the R-7 Compact Urban Residential Overlay
Zone, shall be the uses permitted in the R-6 Zone, except that:
(a) Residential uses shall comply with the following

Sec. 14-143. Design Standards.
Residential development in the R-7 Zone shall be reviewed
by the Planning Board under Article V, Site Plan. Such
development shall also comply with the following development
standards. The general intent of these development standards is
to achieve an attractive and comfortable city neighborhood
environment. Varied and human-scaled building facades are key
to making a place "pedestrian-oriented." Building designs
should provide a high level of visual interest, without creating
a chaotic image. Residences should include design elements that
enhance the streetscape and address the street.
(a) Porches and bays should face the street.
(b) Primary ground floor residential entries to multi-family
buildings must orient to street, not to interior blocks
or parking lots. Secondary and upper-floor entries from
the interior of a block are acceptable. The front door
to single-family homes, duplexes, and townhouses must be
visible from the street.

will be a visible and permanent expression of the
character of the neighborhood;
(d) The facade shall be varied and articulated to provide
visual interest to pedestrians;

sidewalks and streets through appropriately scaled
entries, porches, fenestration, landscaping, and
architectural details;
(f) Provide visual and acoustical privacy between units;
(g) Maximize natural light and ventilation within units.

DIVISION 7.2. IR-2 ISLAND RESIDENTIAL ZONE
Sec. 14-145.7. Purpose.
The purpose of the IR-2 island residential zone is to
protect the character of existing developed residential
neighborhoods on the islands and to allow infill where there are
adequate public services available. Expansion or extension of an
existing IR-2 zone should be strictly limited, generally focused
toward areas adjacent to existing village IR-2 areas, and
restricted by such factors as adequacy of access, whether
adequate water will be available for private use and for fire
protection, and whether soils in the area are adequate for
subsurface water disposal or whether public sewers are
available. IR-2 rezoning on substantially sized parcels should
not be considered for those sites that should be more
appropriately zoned I or IR-3.
(Ord. No. 28-85, § l. 7.15-85)
Sec. 14-145.8. Permitted use.
The following uses are permitted in the IR-2 island

lots which conform either to the provisions of
section 14-433 or to the minimum lot sizes set
forth in (a)1 of this section. Conservation
easements shall not be granted over any lot which
is encumbered by any other easement which
prohibits all construction on that lot.

or grant a third-party right of enforcement to a
nonprofit corporation or charitable trust, the
purposes or powers of which include retaining or
protecting the natural, scenic or open space
values of real property; assuring the
availability of real property for agricultural,

enhancing air or water quality of real property.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to
allow an owner of a currently existing and

the existing lot nonconforming under the terms of
this chapter. The lot upon which a building is to
be constructed shall meet the minimum lot size
requirements of section 14-433.
7. Where an existing subsurface wastewater disposal
system serving an existing structure requires

described in section 14-433 (lots of record and accessory
structure setbacks for existing buildings) and lots
created after July 15, 1985, which are not part of a
subdivision need not provide street frontage if access is
available by means of a permanent easement or
right-of-way which existed as of July 15, 1985. Such
easement or right-of-way shall have a minimum width of
sixteen (16) feet and a minimum travel width of eight (8)
feet except that an easement or right-of-way providing
access for three (3) or more lots or providing the only
means of access to a parcel or parcels of three (3) acres
or more, shall be a minimum thirty-two (32) feet wide and
meet the construction requirements of article III of

in use at that time and at all times subsequent
thereto as a year-round, single-family residence,
and which is served by public sewer and water, at
the time of any expansion permitted by this
section, where the reduction is necessary either
to bring the use into compliance with health and
safety codes or to improve a condition which the
Board of Appeals determines constitutes a health
or safety problem. Any alteration or expansion

DIVISION 7.3. IR-3 ISLAND RESIDENTIAL ZONE
Sec. 14-145.13. Purpose.
The purpose of the IR-3 island residential zone is to allow
for a planned unit development in a manner compatible with both
the natural and built environment, which provides for adequate
circulation and waterfront access, adequate water supply for
private use and fire protection, and safe and clean disposal of
solid and septic wastes. The following guidelines shall be
considered, among others, in establishing an IR-3 zone:
(a) An IR-3 zone should have a minimum land area of twenty
(20) acres;
(b) A site for an IR-3 zone should be able to accommodate
a higher density of development by providing buffers
from surrounding areas on a substantially sized parcel
for which natural amenities are capable of being
conserved in a development plan for the site;
(c) IR-3 zones should not be established unless issues of
municipal services, including infrastructure,
education, and police and fire services and other
municipal services can be appropriately and adequately
addressed;
(d) The differences in scale and intensity of uses between
existing development and the IR-3 zone, and the
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-145.13 Rev. 1-18-2012

-----
*Editor’s note—Ord. No. 293-88, adopted Apr. 4, 1988, with
an effective date of July 1, 1988, repealed §§ 14-181—14-187 of
Div. 10, B-2 Business Zone, of this article and enacted in lieu
thereof similar new provisions as set out in §§ 14-181—14-187.
Formerly, such sections derived from §§ 602.9.A—602.9.G of the
city’s 1968 Code and from Ord. No. 74-72, adopted Mar. 6, 1972;
Ord. No. 499-74, § 4, adopted Aug. 19, 1974; Ord. No. 334-76, §

1977.
-----
Sec. 14-181. Purpose.
(a) B-2 Community Business Zone
The purpose of the B-2 community business zone is:
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-181 Rev.1-15-2014
14-260
1. To provide appropriate locations for the
development and operation of community centers
offering a mixture of commercial uses, housing
and services serving the adjoining neighborhoods
and the larger community.
2. The variety, sites and intensity of the permitted
commercial uses in the B-2 zone are intended to
be greater than those permitted in the B-1
neighborhood business zone.
3. The B-2 zone will provide a broad range of goods
and services and general businesses with a
mixture of large and small buildings such as
grocery stores, shops and services located in
major shopping centers and along arterial
streets. Such establishments should be readily
accessible by automobile, by pedestrians and by
bicycle. Development in the B-2 zone should
relate to the surrounding neighborhoods by
design, orientation, and circulation patterns.
4. The B-2 and B-2b will provide locations for
moderate to high density housing in urban
neighborhoods along arterials.
(b) B-2b Community Business Zone
The B-2b zone is intended to provide neighborhood and
community retail, business and service establishments that are
oriented to and built close to the street. The B-2b zone is
appropriate in areas where a more compact urban development
pattern exists such as on-peninsula or in areas off-peninsula
where a neighborhood compatible commercial district is
established which exhibits a pedestrian scale and character.
Such locations may include the peninsula and other arterials and
intersections with an existing urban or neighborhood oriented
building pattern.
(c) B-2c Community Business Zone
To protect and enhance the quiet enjoyment of adjoining
residential neighborhoods from the impacts of businesses that
serve liquor and from other uses that are incompatible with
adjoining neighborhoods due to noise.

necessary by the reviewing authority,
mitigation measures shall consist of
installation of solid fencing with
landscaping along any residential property
line which is exposed to the drive-through
or the enclosure of the drive-through
fixtures and lanes so as to buffer abutting

Sec. 14-216. Purpose.
(a) The purposes of the B-3 and B-3b downtown business
zones are to:
(1) Maintain and enhance the role of the downtown as the
business and commercial center of the region;
(2) Enhance and promote the orderly expansion of retail
and service businesses downtown, satisfying the
related needs of the city’s resident, working and
visitor populations;
(3) Encourage increased housing opportunity downtown for a
diverse residential population;
(4) Enhance the pedestrian environment through the
encouragement of intensive mixed-use activities,
through the enhancement and maintenance of public and
private open space, and through the enlivenment and
increased attractiveness of the street environment;
(5) Encourage excellence in urban design;
(6) Preserve and capitalize on the unique character and
historic fabric of the downtown through the
encouragement of reuse of significant existing
structures;
(7) Provide opportunity for an enhanced presence and
integration of the arts and cultural activities
downtown;

(8) Reinforce the role of the downtown as a meeting place
for community residents and visitors alike from all
walks of life and all socio-economic groups;
(9) Provide adequate parking and transportation facilities
which promote accessibility, enhance and encourage
development opportunity, and enhance and protect the
pedestrian environment;
(10) In the pedestrian activities district (PAD) overlay
zone, create continuity of pedestrian-oriented uses
along streets where such uses predominate and along
streets which, over time, will establish and maintain
a strong retail and pedestrian-oriented use pattern;
and
(11) Provide for the relocation of residents who are
displaced by development.

is to promote the safety, quiet enjoyment, and general welfare
of citizens residing in a dense urban neighborhood by decreasing
the conflicts between residential uses and loud, uncontrolled
late night activities.

authority shall be substituted for the board of appeals as the
reviewing authority:
1. Ground floor uses in the mandated pedestrian-oriented use
area of the PAD overlay zone: Any use permitted in the
B-3 and B-3b zone, provided that such uses shall meet the
following conditions and standards:
a. The applicant can prove by competent evidence
(including but not limited to reliable
documentation of advertising, real estate

to provide relief and shall include mitigating
design factors.
The Planning Board shall adopt rules and
regulations governing the planning authority’s
review of an applicant’s marketing efforts under
this subsection.

DIVISION 12.6. B-5 URBAN COMMERCIAL MIXED USE ZONE
Sec. 14-230. Purpose.
The purpose of the B-5 and B-5b zones is to provide zones
in areas of the peninsula near the central business district
where a mixture of uses, including marine, industrial,
commercial, and residential, is encouraged. The B-5 and B-5b
zones are characterized by larger underdeveloped lots with great
potential for denser, clustered, urban mixed use development and
more efficient reuse of existing land and buildings.
It is anticipated that such denser, mixed uses would rely
on a shared infrastructure system, including service alleys,
parking lots, public transportation facilities, stormwater
management, and driveways.

Sec. 14-230.5 Rev.6-21-2010
14-335
(j) Materials or wastes: Any permitted outdoor storage of
materials shall be done in such a manner as to prevent
the breeding and harboring of insects or vermin, to
prevent the transfer of such materials from the site
by natural causes or forces and to contain fumes,
dust, or other materials which constitute a fire
hazard. This storage shall be accomplished within
enclosed containers or by one (1) or more of the
following methods: raising materials above ground,
separating materials, preventing stagnant water, or by
some other means. Any areas used for permitted outdoor
storage of materials shall be screened from view of
any adjoining properties and public rights-of-way. No
outdoor storage shall be permitted in the required
yard between the front of any building on the site and

(k) Odor: It shall be a violation of this chapter to
create an odor nuisance.
1. Determination of odor nuisance: An odor nuisance
shall be considered to exist when ten (10)
confirmed complaints occur in an area within two
(2) separate twenty-four-hour periods. The ten
(10) confirmed complaints must originate from ten
(10) different households in an area zoned
residential or from ten (10) different
individuals in a commercial or industrial
facility. The building authority shall only
respond to a complainant who confirms that the
odor is detectable at the time of the actual
complaint. In order to confirm a complaint, the
building authority or its designee shall first
determine that an odor is detectable in the area
of the complaint. The building authority or its
designee shall interview the complainant to
verify that the detectable odor is in fact the
odor that resulted in the complaint. If the
complainant verifies the odor as the source of
the complaint, then the building authority shall
notify the owner or operator of the alleged odor
source either in person or by telephone within
one (1) working day, with a written confirmation
within seven (7) working days of the complaint.
In the event that the building authority is
unable to contact the owner or operator of the
alleged odor source in person or by telephone
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-230.5 Rev.6-21-2010
14-336
within one (1) working day, then the building
authority shall send written notice to the
operator within seven (7) working days of the
complaint.
In the event that ten (10) complaints are
confirmed as set forth in subsection 1. in two
(2) separate twenty-four-hour periods within a
ninety-day period, the building authority shall
cause a certified odor inspector to investigate
any odor complaints received in the next thirty
(30) days following the receipt of the tenth
confirmed complaint from the second
twenty-four-hour period. If the odors remain
under the ambient intensity standard as
established in this subsection for the next
thirty (30) days, then a new odor nuisance must
be established after that time in accordance with
the requirements of this section. The certified
odor inspector shall do the following in response
to a complaint under this section:
a. Verify that an odor is detectable in the
area of the complaint and confirm that it is
the odor that resulted in the complaint;
b. Quantify the intensity of the odor on the
eight-point n-butanol intensity scale as
defined in regulations promulgated by the
director of the planning authority to
establish training and technical standards
to support this section; and
c. Track the odor to its source.
When the certified odor inspector determines that
a violation has occurred because an odor has
exceeded the maximum ambient odor levels set
forth in this section, the building authority
shall notify the owner or operator either by
telephone or in person of the violation within
one (1) working day of the violation. The
building authority shall confirm this
notification in writing within seven (7) working
days of this initial notice. In the event that
the building authority is unable to contact the
owner or operator by telephone or in person
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-230.5 Rev.6-21-2010
14-337
within the required time period, then it will
send written notification within seven (7)
working days of the violation.
Upon receipt of the written notice of violation,
the owner or operator of the odor source shall do
the following:
a. Implement odor reduction procedures
immediately upon notification by the
building authority that the facility has
violated this section wherever odor
reduction can be achieved by operational or
procedural changes at the facility;
b. Submit to the building authority, within
thirty (30) days of the written notice of
violation, an odor reduction plan which is
designed to reduce ambient odors
attributable to emissions from that source
to the maximum allowable intensity for that
zone. The plan shall include a detailed
summary of the measures that the owner or
operator will take to mitigate the community
annoyance and estimated dates for completion
of those measures. In the event that it will
take longer than thirty (30) days to develop
the odor reduction plan, the owner or
operator of the facility shall submit within
the thirty-day time period a schedule for
the development of the odor reduction plan.
The building authority shall review this
plan to determine whether it will be
adequate to resolve the odor nuisance in a
reasonable time period; and
c. Implement the plan in accordance with the
schedule approved by the building authority.
2. Ambient odor limits: The maximum ambient
intensity standard for odors generated by uses
located in the I-L zone shall not exceed the
following levels when the odor is measured in the
zone indicated:
4.0 in any industrial or business zone for odors
resulting from any use in the B-5 zone.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-230.5 Rev.6-21-2010
14-338
3.0 in any residential zone for odors resulting
from any use in the B-5 zone.
(l) Smoke: Discharges of smoke shall not exceed opacity
percentage of forty (40) percent or number 2 on the
Ringelman chart.
(m) Discharge into sewers: No discharge shall be permitted
at any point into any private sewage disposal system,
or stream, or into the ground, of any materials in
such a way or of such nature or temperature as to
contaminate any water supply, or otherwise cause the
emission of dangerous or objectionable elements,
except in accordance with standards approved by the
health authority or by the public works authority.
(n) Lighting: All lighting shall be designed and installed
with cut-off fixtures to direct illumination onto the
site and to prevent illumination from such fixtures on
neighboring properties.

Sec. 14-231. Purpose.
The low impact industrial zone is intended to provide areas
in which low impact industrial uses and limited other uses
serving employees and residents of the surrounding neighborhood
will be compatible with adjacent residential uses, will provide
a buffer between residential neighborhoods and the I-M or I-H
industrial zones, or will stand alone as a smaller scale
industrial district.
The I-L zone is located adjacent to residential
neighborhoods, business uses and other industrial uses where the
low intensity nature of the uses, as well as their strict
performance standards, will ensure the compatibility of the uses
with other adjacent industrial and nonindustrial uses.
Performance standards for uses in the I-L zone are designed
to maintain compatibility between low impact industrial uses and
neighboring nonindustrial and industrial uses. Performance
standards include full enclosure of uses and requirements for
buffers and screening from adjacent properties.

Uses in the I-L and I-Lb zones shall comply with the
following standards:
(a) Noise:
1. Definitions:
a. Tonal sounds are defined as sound waves
usually perceived as a hum or whine because
their instantaneous sound pressure varies
essentially as a simple sinusoidal function
of time.
b. Impulse sounds are defined as sound events
characterized by brief excursions of sound
pressure, each with a duration of less than
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-236 Rev.1-6-1997
14-357
one (1) second.
2. Measurement: Sound levels shall be measured with
a sound level meter with a frequency weighting
network manufactured according to standards
prescribed by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) or its successor body.
Measurements shall be made at all major lot lines
of the site, at a height of at least four (4)
feet above the ground surface. In measuring sound
levels under this section, sounds with a
continuous duration of less than sixty (60)
seconds shall be measured by the maximum reading
on a sound level meter set to the A weighted
scale and the fast meter response (L maxfast).
Sounds with a continuous duration of sixty (60)
seconds or more shall be measured on the basis of
the energy average sound level over a period of
sixty (60) seconds (LEQ1).
3. Maximum permissible sound levels: The maximum
permissible sound level of any continuous,
regular or frequent source of sound produced by
an activity shall be as follows:
a. Sixty (60) dBA between the hours of 7:00
a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
b. Fifty (50) dBA between the hours of 10:00
p.m. and 7:00 a.m., as measured at or within
the boundaries of any residential zone.
In addition to the sound level standards
established above, all uses located within this
zone shall employ best practicable sound
abatement techniques to prevent tonal sounds and
impulse sounds or, if such tonal and impulse
sounds cannot be prevented, to minimize the
impact of such sounds in residential zones.
4. Exemptions:
a. Noises created by construction and
maintenance activities between 7:00 a.m. and
10:00 p.m. are exempt from the maximum
permissible sound levels set forth in
subsection (a)3 of this section.

of toxic or noxious matter shall be made in accordance
with all applicable state and federal regulations.
(f) Odor: It shall be a violation of this chapter to
create an odor nuisance.
1. Determination of odor nuisance: An odor nuisance
shall be considered to exist when ten (10)
confirmed complaints occur in an area within two
(2) separate twenty-four-hour periods. The ten
(10) confirmed complaints must originate from ten
(10) different households in an area zoned
residential or from ten (10) different
individuals in a commercial or industrial
facility. The building authority shall only
respond to a complainant who confirms that the
odor is detectable at the time of the actual
complaint. In order to confirm a complaint, the
building authority or its designee shall first
determine that an odor is detectable in the area
of the complaint. The building authority or its
designee shall interview the complainant to
verify that the detectable odor is in fact the
odor that resulted in the complaint. If the
complainant verifies the odor as the source of
the complaint, then the building authority shall
notify the owner or operator of the alleged odor
source either in person or by telephone within
one (1) working day, with a written confirmation
within seven (7) working days of the complaint.
In the event that the building authority is
unable to contact the owner or operator of the
alleged odor source in person or by telephone
within one (1) working day, then the building
authority shall send written notice to the
operator within seven (7) working days of the
complaint.
In the event that ten (10) complaints are
confirmed as set forth in subsection (1) in two
(2) separate twenty-four-hour periods within a
ninety-day period, the building authority shall
cause a certified odor inspector to investigate
any odor complaints received in the next thirty
(30) days following the receipt of the tenth
confirmed complaint from the second
twenty-four-hour period. If the odors remain
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-236 Rev.1-6-1997
14-360
under the ambient intensity standard as
established in this subsection for the next
thirty (30) days, then a new odor nuisance must
be established after that time in accordance with
the requirements of this section. The certified
odor inspector shall do the following in response
to a complaint under this section:
a. Verify that an odor is detectable in the
area of the complaint and confirm that it is
the odor that resulted in the complaint;
b. Quantify the intensity of the odor on the
eight-point n-butanol intensity scale as
defined in regulations promulgated by the
director of the planning authority to
establish training and technical standards
to support this section; and
c. Track the odor to its source.
When the certified odor inspector determines that
a violation has occurred because an odor has
exceeded the maximum ambient odor levels set
forth in this section, the building authority
shall notify the owner or operator either by
telephone or in person of the violation within
one (1) working day of the violation. The
building authority shall confirm this
notification in writing within seven (7) working
days of this initial notice. In the event that
the building authority is unable to contact the
owner or operator by telephone or in person
within the required time period, then it will
send written notification within seven (7)
working days of the violation.
Upon receipt of the written notice of violation,
the owner or operator of the odor source shall do
the following:
a. Implement odor reduction procedures
immediately upon notification by the
building authority that the facility has
violated this section wherever odor
reduction can be achieved by operational or
procedural changes at the facility;
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-236 Rev.1-6-1997
14-361
b. Submit to the building authority, within
thirty (30) days of the written notice of
violation, an odor reduction plan which is
designed to reduce ambient odors
attributable to emissions from that source
to the maximum allowable intensity for that
zone. The plan shall include a detailed
summary of the measures that the owner or
operator will take to mitigate the community
annoyance and estimated dates for completion
of those measures. In the event that it will
take longer than thirty (30) days to develop
the odor reduction plan, the owner or
operator of the facility shall submit within
the thirty-day time period a schedule for
the development of the odor reduction plan.
The building authority shall review this
plan to determine whether it will be
adequate to resolve the odor nuisance in a
reasonable time period; and
c. Implement the plan in accordance with the
schedule approved by the building authority.
2. Ambient odor limits: The maximum ambient
intensity standard for odors generated by uses
located in the I-L zone shall not exceed the
following levels when the odor is measured in the
zone indicated:
4.0 in any industrial or business zone for odors
resulting from any industrial use.
3.0 in any residential zone for odors resulting
from any industrial use.
(g) Smoke: Discharges of smoke shall not exceed opacity
percentage of forty (40) percent or number 2 on the
Ringelmann chart.
(h) Emissions: All emissions shall be made in accordance
with all applicable state and federal regulations.
(i) Radiation: Radiation at a site shall comply with all
applicable state and federal regulations.

(j) Discharge into sewers: No discharge shall be permitted
at any point into any private sewage disposal system,
or stream, or into the ground of any materials in such
a way or of such nature or temperature as to
contaminate any water supply, or otherwise cause the
emission of dangerous or objectionable elements,
except in accordance with standards approved by the
health authority or by the public works authority.
(k) Lighting: All lighting shall be designed and installed
with cut-off fixtures to direct illumination onto the
site and to prevent illumination from such fixtures on
neighboring properties.

Sec. 14-246. Purpose.
The moderate impact industrial zones are intended to
provide zones in areas of the city in which light and moderate
impact industries and transportation-related uses will coexist.
The moderate impact industrial (I-M and I-Ma) zones are
located on arterials or collectors. The I-Mb zones are similarly
located on the peninsula. These locations provide for direct
access onto arterials, thereby protecting residential
neighborhoods from drive-through traffic.
The I-M, I-Ma and I-Mb industrial zones are intended to
provide for larger industrial buildings and for the limited or
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-246 Rev.1-6-1997

controlled use of areas outside of structures for storage of
materials and machinery. These facilities often require large
volumes of imported materials and products which result in large
volumes of shipping and receiving. Often uses may be
highway-oriented and transportation-related, thus relying on
citywide and regional transportation infrastructure.
Industrial uses in the moderate impact industrial zones may
require separation from higher impact uses, which should be
directed to the high impact industrial zone.
(Ord. No. 164-97, § 7, 1-6-97)
Sec. 14-247. Permitted uses.
The following uses are permitted whether provided by

Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-252 Rev.1-6-1997
14-372
(a) Noise:
1. Definitions:
a. Tonal sounds are defined as sound waves
usually perceived as a hum or whine because
their instantaneous sound pressure varies
essentially as a simple sinusoidal function
of time.
b. Impulse sounds are defined as sound events
characterized by brief excursions of sound
pressure, each with a duration of less than
one (1) second.
2. Measurement: Sound levels shall be measured with
a sound level meter with a frequency weighting
network manufactured according to standards
prescribed by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) or its successor body.
Measurements shall be made at all major lot lines
of the site, at a height of at least four (4)
feet above the ground surface. In measuring sound
levels under this section, sounds with a
continuous duration of less than sixty (60)
seconds shall be measured by the maximum reading
on a sound level meter set to the A weighted
scale and the fast meter response (L maxfast).
Sounds with a continuous duration of sixty (60)
seconds or more shall be measured on the basis of
the energy average sound level over a period of
sixty (60) seconds (LEQ1).
3. Maximum permissible sound levels: The maximum
permissible sound level of any continuous,
regular or frequent source of sound produced by
an activity shall be as follows:
a. Seventy (70) dBA between the hours of 7:00
a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
b. Fifty-five (55) dBA between the hours of
10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., as measured at or
within the boundaries of any residential
zone.

In addition to the sound level standards
established above, all uses located within this
zone shall employ best practicable sound
abatement techniques to prevent tonal sounds and
impulse sounds or, if such tonal and impulse
sounds cannot be prevented, to minimize the
impact of such sounds in residential zones.
4. Exemptions:
a. Noises created by construction and
maintenance activities between 7:00 a.m. and
10:00 p.m. are exempt from the maximum
permissible sound levels set forth in
subsection (d)3 of this section.
Construction activities on a site abutting
any residential use between the hours of
10:00 p.m. of one (1) day and 7:00 a.m. of
the following day shall not exceed fifty
(50) dBA.
b. The following uses and activities shall also
be exempt from the requirements of
subsection (d)3 of this section:
i. The noises of safety signals, warning
devices, emergency pressure relief
valves, and any other emergency devices.
ii. Traffic noise on public roads or noise
created by airplanes and railroads.

shall be controlled in such a manner as to prevent
transmission beyond lot lines of vibrations causing a
displacement of .003 or greater on one (1) inch, as
measured by a vibrograph or similar instrument at the
property boundaries.
(d) Glare, heat: Any use shall be in an enclosed structure
in such a manner that glare and heat shall be
imperceptible from neighboring properties.
(e) Discharge of toxic or noxious matter: All discharges
of toxic or noxious matter shall be made in accordance
with all applicable state and federal regulations.
(f) Odor: It shall be a violation of this chapter to
create an odor nuisance.
1. Determination of odor nuisance: An odor nuisance
shall be considered to exist when ten (10)
confirmed complaints occur in an area within two
(2) separate twenty-four-hour periods. The ten
(10) confirmed complaints must originate from ten
(10) different households in an area zoned
residential or from ten (10) different
individuals in a commercial or industrial
facility. The building authority shall only
respond to a complainant who confirms that the
odor is detectable at the time of the actual
complaint. In order to confirm a complaint, the
building authority or its designee shall first
determine that an odor is detectable in the area
of the complaint. The building authority or its
designee shall interview the complainant to
verify that the detectable odor is in fact the
odor that resulted in the complaint. If the
complainant verifies the odor as the source of
the complaint, then the building authority shall
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-252 Rev.1-6-1997
14-375
notify the owner or operator of the alleged odor
source either in person or by telephone within
one (1) working day, with a written confirmation
within seven (7) working days of the complaint.
In the event that the building authority is
unable to contact the owner or operator of the
alleged odor source in person or by telephone
within one (1) working day, then the building
authority shall send written notice to the
operator within seven (7) working days of the
complaint.
In the event that ten (10) complaints are
confirmed as set forth in subsection (1) in two
(2) separate twenty-four-hour periods within a
ninety-day period, the building authority shall
cause a certified odor inspector to investigate
any odor complaints received in the next thirty
(30) days following the receipt of the tenth
confirmed complaint from the second
twenty-four-hour period. If the odors remain
under the ambient intensity standard as
established in this subsection for the next
thirty (30) days, then a new odor nuisance must
be established after that time in accordance with
the requirements of this section. The certified
odor inspector shall do the following in response
to a complaint under this section:
a. Verify that an odor is detectable in the
area of the complaint and confirm that it is
the odor that resulted in the complaint;
b. Quantify the intensity of the odor on the
eight-point n-butanol intensity scale as
defined in regulations promulgated by the
director of the planning authority to
establish training and technical standards
to support this section; and
c. Track the odor to its source.
When the certified odor inspector determines that
a violation has occurred because an odor has
exceeded the maximum ambient odor levels set
forth in this section, the building authority
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-252 Rev.1-6-1997
14-376
shall notify the owner or operator either by
telephone or in person of the violation within
one (1) working day of the violation. The
building authority shall confirm this
notification in writing within seven (7) working
days of this initial notice. In the event that
the building authority is unable to contact the
owner or operator by telephone or in person
within the required time period, then it will
send written notification within seven (7)
working days of the violation.
Upon receipt of the written notice of violation,
the owner or operator of the odor source shall do
the following:
a. Implement odor reduction procedures
immediately upon notification by the
building authority that the facility has
violated this section wherever odor
reduction can be achieved by operational or
procedural changes at the facility;
b. Submit to the building authority, within
thirty (30) days of the written notice of
violation, an odor reduction plan which is
designed to reduce ambient odors
attributable to emissions from that source
to the maximum allowable intensity for that
zone. The plan shall include a detailed
summary of the measures that the owner or
operator will take to mitigate the community
annoyance and estimated dates for completion
of those measures. In the event that it will
take longer than thirty (30) days to develop
the odor reduction plan, the owner or
operator of the facility shall submit within
the thirty-day time period a schedule for
the development of the odor reduction plan.
The building authority shall review this
plan to determine whether it will be
adequate to resolve the odor nuisance in a
reasonable time period; and
c. Implement the plan in accordance with the
schedule approved by the building authority.

2. Ambient odor limits: The maximum ambient
intensity standard for odors generated by uses
located in the I-M zones shall not exceed the
following levels when the odor is measured in the
zone indicated:
4.0 in any industrial or business zone for odors
resulting from any industrial use.
3.0 in any residential zone for odors resulting
from any industrial use.
(g) Smoke: Discharges of smoke shall not exceed opacity
percentage of forty (40) percent or number 2 on the
Ringelmann chart.
(h) Emissions: All emissions shall be made in accordance
with all applicable state and federal regulations.
(i) Radiation: Radiation at a site shall comply with all
applicable state and federal regulations.
(j) Discharge into sewers: No discharge shall be permitted
at any point into any private sewage disposal system,
or stream, or into the ground of any materials in such
a way or of such nature or temperature as to
contaminate any water supply, or otherwise cause the
emission of dangerous or objectionable elements,
except in accordance with standards approved by the
health authority or by the public works authority.
(k) Lighting: All lighting shall be designed and installed
with cut-off fixtures to direct illumination onto the
site and to prevent illumination from such fixtures on
neighboring properties.
(l) Traffic: Development in the I-M, I-Ma and I-Mb zones
shall utilize to the greatest extent possible arterial
streets as delineated on the Maine Department of
Transportation Map, a copy of which is on file in the

*Editor’s note—Ord. No. 164-97, § 8, passed Jan. 6, 1997, repealed div.
15, §§ 14-261—14-266 of this article and enacted new provisions as herein set
out. Formerly, such provisions pertained to the I-3 and I-3b industrial zones
and derived from §§ 602.13.A—602.13.F of the 1968 Code as amended by Ord. No.
499-74, § 5, adopted Aug. 19, 1974; Ord. No. 334-76, §§ 4—6, adopted Jul. 7,

adopted Jun. 15, 1992; and Ord. No. 193A-93, §§ 3, 4, adopted Feb. 17, 1993.
----------
Sec. 14-261. Purpose.
The high impact industrial zones are intended to provide
areas suitable for higher impact industrial uses than are
permitted in other industrial zones and other uses including
hospital campuses that are capable of demonstrating, through
design, layout and topography, their compatibility with, or nonintrusion
on, existing or future higher impact industrial uses
on adjacent or neighboring I-H zoned properties.
Due to the intensity of use, the I-H zones are intended for
uses which may require extensive outdoor storage and usage and
may utilize heavy equipment. Processes may require separation
from residential or sensitive environmental areas. The I-H zones
are separated from other nonindustrial uses as well as natural
or constructed features.
High impact industrial uses will be of a higher intensity,
with a greater lot coverage, than the other zones. Due to the
intensity of uses, the performance standards will allow for the
higher intensity of use.

1. Definitions:
a. Tonal sounds are defined as sound waves
usually perceived as a hum or whine because
their instantaneous sound pressure varies
essentially as a simple sinusoidal function
of time.
b. Impulse sounds are defined as sound events
characterized by brief excursions of sound
pressure, each with a duration of less than
one (1) second.
2. Measurement: Sound levels shall be measured with

prescribed by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) or its successor body.
Measurements shall be made at all major lot lines
of the site, at a height of at least four (4)
feet above the ground surface. In measuring sound
levels under this section, sounds with a
continuous duration of less than sixty (60)
seconds shall be measured by the maximum reading
on a sound level meter set to the A weighted
scale and the fast meter response (L maxfast).
Sounds with a continuous duration of sixty (60)
seconds or more shall be measured on the basis of
the energy average sound level over a period of
sixty (60) seconds (LEQ1).
3. Maximum permissible sound levels: The maximum
permissible sound level of any continuous,
regular or frequent source of sound produced by
an activity shall be as follows:
a. Seventy-five (75) dBA between the hours of
7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
b. Fifty-five (55) dBA between the hours of
10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., as measured at or
within the boundaries of any residential
zone.
In addition to the sound level standards
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-267 Rev.1-6-1997
14-387
established above, all uses located within this
zone shall employ best practicable sound
abatement techniques to prevent tonal sounds and
impulse sounds or, if such tonal and impulse
sounds cannot be prevented, to minimize the
impact of such sounds in residential zones.
4. Exemptions:
a. Noises created by construction and
maintenance activities between 7:00 a.m. and
10:00 p.m. are exempt from the maximum
permissible sound levels set forth in
subsection (a)3 of this section.
Construction activities on a site abutting
any residential use between the hours of
10:00 p.m. of one (1) day and 7:00 a.m. of
the following day shall not exceed fifty
(50) dBA.
b. The following uses and activities shall also
be exempt from the requirements of
subsection (a)3 of this section:
i. The noises of safety signals, warning
devices, emergency pressure relief
valves, and any other emergency devices.

activities which are permitted by law and
for which a license or permit has been
granted by the city, including but not
limited to parades, sporting events, and
fireworks displays.
(b) Electromagnetic interference: There shall be no
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-267 Rev.1-6-1997
14-388
electromagnetic interference that adversely affects
the operation of any equipment other than that
belonging to the creator of such interference, or that
does not conform to the regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission.
(c) Vibrations: Any use creating earthshaking vibrations
shall be controlled in such a manner as to prevent
transmission beyond lot lines of vibrations causing a
displacement of .003 or greater on one (1) inch, as
measured by a vibrograph or similar instrument at the
property boundaries.
(d) Glare, heat: Any use shall be in an enclosed structure
in such a manner that glare and heat shall be
imperceptible from neighboring properties.
(e) Discharge of toxic or noxious matter: All discharges
of toxic or noxious matter shall be made in accordance
with all applicable state and federal regulations.
(f) Odor: It shall be a violation of this chapter to
create an odor nuisance.
1. Determination of odor nuisance: An odor nuisance
shall be considered to exist when ten (10)
confirmed complaints occur in an area within two
(2) separate twenty-four-hour periods. The ten
(10) confirmed complaints must originate from ten
(10) different households in an area zoned
residential or from ten (10) different
individuals in a commercial or industrial
facility. The building authority shall only
respond to a complainant who confirms that the
odor is detectable at the time of the actual
complaint. In order to confirm a complaint, the
building authority or its designee shall first
determine that an odor is detectable in the area
of the complaint. The building authority or its
designee shall interview the complainant to
verify that the detectable odor is in fact the
odor that resulted in the complaint. If the
complainant verifies the odor as the source of
the complaint, then the building authority shall
notify the owner or operator of the alleged odor
source either in person or by telephone within
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-267 Rev.1-6-1997
14-389
one (1) working day, with a written confirmation
within seven (7) working days of the complaint.
In the event that the building authority is
unable to contact the owner or operator of the
alleged odor source in person or by telephone
within one (1) working day, then the building
authority shall send written notice to the
operator within seven (7) working days of the
complaint.
In the event that ten (10) complaints are
confirmed as set forth in subsection (a) in two
(2) separate twenty-four-hour periods within a
ninety-day period, the building authority shall
cause a certified odor inspector to investigate
any odor complaints received in the next thirty
(30) days following the receipt of the tenth
confirmed complaint from the second
twenty-four-hour period. If the odors remain
under the ambient intensity standard as
established in this subsection for the next
thirty (30) days, then a new odor nuisance must
be established after that time in accordance with
the requirements of this section. The certified
odor inspector shall do the following in response
to a complaint under this section:
a. Verify that an odor is detectable in the
area of the complaint and confirm that it is
the odor that resulted in the complaint;
b. Quantify the intensity of the odor on the
eight-point n-butanol intensity scale as
defined in regulations promulgated by the
director of the planning authority to
establish training and technical standards
to support this section; and
c. Track the odor to its source.
When the certified odor inspector determines that
a violation has occurred because an odor has

DIVISION 15.1. B-6 EASTERN WATERFRONT MIXED ZONE
Sec. 14-268. Purpose.
The purpose of the B-6, eastern waterfront mixed zone is to
establish a zoning district for the upland portion of the
eastern waterfront area. The B-6 zone encourages this district
to acquire a distinctly urban from through development that
emphasizes a quality pedestrian experience, promotes public
transit, and demonstrates exemplary urban design. The zone
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14

promotes a range of uses to achieve twenty-four urban vitality
and shared use of parking infrastructure as recommended in the
eastern waterfront master plan for redevelopment.
The zone language established herein provides regulatory
framework to promote the mixed-use development pattern
envisioned for urban land on Portland’s peninsula. Specific
development criteria, including building height overlays and
design standards, may be established for this district to
supplement the provisions of this section. District-specific
design standards and overlay maps can be found at the city
planning and development office.

Sec. 14-270 Rev.9-15-2014
14-397
ii. Biotechnology facilities must demonstrate
approvals by all applicable regulatory
authorities prior to commencement of
operations.
(2) Parking:
a. All surface parking lots shall meet the
applicable conditions outlined below.
----------
Editor’s note: These conditions promote parking development in a manner
that creates an urban street form with streetscapes dominated by buildings,
not surface parking. This code recognizes that many parcels will develop
incrementally over time and a phased approach may be needed to fully achieve
the goals of this provision.
----------
i. No surface parking lot shall be encumbered
by lease or other use commitment exceeding a
twenty-four month term.
ii. Any such parking shall in its lease
stipulate that developer/owner reserves the
right to relocate said parking (to a parking
structure) or convert surface parking to
structured parking as long as the
replacement parking is located a reasonable
distance from the associated use.
iii. Surface lots shall be laid out in a manner
conducive to development of future
buildings, and/or structured parking.
b. All structured parking, including multi-level
parking garages shall meet the applicable
conditions outlined below.
i. Parking garages shall incorporate first
floor retail space or other mixed use (an
active use other than parking) along all
street frontages unless the applicant
requests from the planning board a waiver of
this provision subject to the following
criteria:
ii. Waivers: the planning board may waive the
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-270 Rev.9-15-2014
14-398
requirement for first floor mixed use upon
demonstration that the project meets one or
more of the criteria listed under provisions
a, b, and c below.
Where the board allows a waiver of first
floor mixed use, garages shall display
architecture that enhances the pedestrian
experience and disguises the parking use to
the extent possible.
----------
Editor’s note: Use of traditional storefront design concepts and
traditional building materials is encouraged. Developers should look to the
eastern waterfront design guidelines for additional direction in meeting
these standards.
----------
Standards for waiving first floor mixed use:
a. That the applicant demonstrates that
steepness of grade or the character of
the adjacent street will not support
retail or first-floor mixed use in the
foreseeable future.
b. That the first floor of the garage is
set back a minimum of 35 feet from the
street right of way and its design does
not provide an impediment for
development of such space for mixed use
in the future. Such space (between the
garage and the street) shall, in the
interim, not be used for surface
parking.
c. Where the applicant can demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the Planning Board
that a market for first floor mixed
uses currently does not exist, the
Planning Board may grant a waiver of
this condition, provided that the
structure of the garage is designed to
accommodate retail and or mixed uses in
the future.
The Planning Board will need to find
that on the street level deck of a
proposed parking garage a minimum of
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-270 Rev.9-15-2014
14-399
twenty (20) feet horizontal distance of
depth from the street and nine (9) feet
finished floor to finished ceiling
clearance could in future house retail
and or mixed use. The applicant will
further need to demonstrate that the
garage design anticipates the future
development of utilities and
circulation necessary for non-parking
uses.
Where a parking garage fronts on more
than one public street and where there
is a existing change in grade elevation
of over 5% across the footprint of the
garage, the nine foot floor to ceiling
requirement of this section only
applies to the primary (higher traffic
volume) street.
(b) The following use shall be permitted only upon the
issuance of a conditional use permit subject to the provisions
of section 14-474 (conditional uses), and any special
provisions, standards or requirements specified below:
(1) Temporary wind anemometer towers, as defined in Sec
14-47, are permitted provided the following standards
are met in addition to Sec 14-430:
a. Towers may be installed for the purpose of wind
data collection for no more than two (2) years
after the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy
for the tower. At the conclusion of the
aforementioned two (2) years, the tower must be
dismantled and removed from the site within sixty
(60) days; and
b. Towers shall be constructed according to plans
and specifications stamped by a licensed
professional engineer, which shall be provided to
the Board of Appeals with the application; and
c. Towers shall be set back from habitable buildings
by a distance equal to 1.1 times the tower
height; and
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-270 Rev.9-15-2014
14-400
d. The applicant shall provide a safety report
prepared and stamped by a licensed professional
engineer to the Board of Appeals with their
application for conditional use, which
demonstrates how the proposed temporary wind
anemometer tower is safe in terms of strength,
stability, security, grounding, icing impacts and
maintenance; and
e. The applicant shall provide evidence of
commercial general liability insurance, such
insurance to be satisfactory to Corporation
Counsel and cover damage or injury resulting from
construction, operation or dismantling of any
part of the temporary wind anemometer tower; and
f. Towers and associated guy wires shall be sited to
minimize their prominence from and impacts on
public ways (including pedestrian ways); and
g. Towers shall be used for installing anemometers
and similar devices at a range of heights from
the ground to measure wind characteristics
(speed, direction, frequency) and related
meteorological data, but shall not be used for
any other purpose; and
h. A performance guarantee shall be required
for the cost of removal of the tower, guy
wires and anchors. This requirement may be
satisfied by surety bond, letter of credit,
escrow account or by evidence, acceptable to
the City, or the financial and technical
ability and commitment of the applicant or
its agents to remove the facility at the end
of the use period.

DIVISION 15.2. INDIA STREET FORM-BASED CODE ZONE (IS-FBC)
Sec. 14-275.1 Purpose.
The India Street Form-based Code is different than traditional
zoning, placing the primary emphasis on a building’s physical
form and its relationship to the street, and de-emphasizing land
use. The intent of the India Street Form-based Code Zone is to
establish a zoning district that encourages a vibrant, walkable,
mixed-use urban district, preserves and values the existing
historic neighborhood fabric, and fosters and supports local
businesses and residential areas. The components of a Form-Based
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-275.1 Rev. 9-18-2017
Code include the Guiding Principles, REGULATING PLAN,
Subdistricts, General Development Standards, Dimensional
Requirements, BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS, Diagrams, and
Definitions.
The goal of the India Street Form-based Code is the creation and
preservation of an active and human-scale public realm and the
reinforcement of existing neighborhood character through good
street space design.
(a) GENERAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES: The General Guiding
Principles set forth here shall be applicable to all subdistricts
within the India Street Form-based Code Zone.
1. The street is a coherent space, with consistent
building and streetscape character on both sides of
the street. This agreement of buildings and
streetscape across the street contributes to a
clear public space and district identity.
2. The street wall is visually well defined. Land
should be clearly public or private. Buildings
contribute to the vital and safe public space while
providing a clear boundary to the private,
protected realm.
3. Street walls are engaged with the street
environment. Buildings are inviting places that
interact with and contribute to the street
vitality. Inactive edges, vehicle storage,
garbage, and mechanical equipment should be kept
away from the street. Shared infrastructure, to
the extent practicable, including, but not limited
to, service alleys, parking areas, stormwater
treatment, public transportation facilities, and
driveways, shall be utilized.
4. Buildings are designed for the urban environment.
Buildings must be designed for the urban situation
within the subdistrict which often includes mixeduses.
Buildings are positioned near the street and
FACADES are oriented to the street.
5. Respect historic character. If a property is within
the India Street Historic District, Article IX
Historic Preservation is applicable. New
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-275.1 Rev. 9-18-2017
construction, BUILDING ADDITIONS, or alteratons in
the India Street Historic District shall reflect
and complement the character defining features and
elements of the existing historic development to
which it is visually related.
(Ord. 83-15/16, 11-2-2015; Ord. No. 49-17/18, 9-18-2017)

1. The intent of the ISFBC zone as stated in Sec. 14.27.1
Purpose and Sec. 14-275.7 Subdistrict dimensional
requirements;
2. Be the least adjustment necessary to satisfy the
practical, programmatic, or functional needs of the
proposed development; and
3. At least one (1) of the following applies:
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-275.2 Rev. 9-18-2017
i. The proposed zoning alternative better achieves
the zone and subdistrict intent;
ii. The zone or subdistrict intent will not be met by
applying the requirement in this particular
circumstance;
iii. There is a legal or practical necessity or unique
conditions; or
iv. Unique site factors make the zoning requirement
impractical or cost prohibitive.

Sec. 14-275.7. Subdistrict dimensional requirements.
(a) Urban Neighborhood (UN) subdistrict.
Intent: The intent of this subdistrict is to maintain and
promote a small-scale, less active urban fabric. Buildings may
be more private in character and have smaller footprints with
building types including, but not limited to, single-family,
rowhouses, duplexes, triple-deckers, and double-triples.
Building frontages may be less transparent and entries may be
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-275.6 Rev. 11-2-2015
raised above sidewalk level with frontage types including
raised, recessed doorways, porches, and stoops. The streetscape
has variable setbacks and landscaping with many buildings within
one block and streets tend to be narrow.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-275.6 Rev. 11-2-2015
(b) Urban Transitional (UT) subdistrict.
Intent: The intent of this subdistrict is to encourage higher
density, mixed-use building types that accommodate any use.
Building frontages are a mix of activity level, have larger
footprints, and the most flexibility of height and scale.
Building ground floor spaces tend to accommodate flexible and
changing uses with frontage types including doorways,
forecourts, arcades, and storefronts. The streetscape may be
less active than the UA subdistrict with wide sidewalks, street
trees, and setbacks and stepbacks providing relief from large
building masses.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-275.6 Rev. 11-2-2015
(c) Urban Active (UA) subdistrict.
Intent: The intent of this subdistrict is to maintain and
promote a moderate-scale, diverse, mixed-use neighborhood with
vibrant streets and active ground floor spaces. Buildings are
more active and engage the street at the ground level. Building
frontages are transparent and entries are at sidewalk level with
frontage types including storefronts and recessed doorways. The
streetscape has steady street planting, and buildings set close
to the street providing a consistent street wall.

For corner lots where two subdistricts intersect at a street
corner, the Dimensional Requirements and Building Design
Standards of the “dominant” subdistrict shall apply 35 feet deep
into the lot measured from the dominant lot line along its
associated street frontage or public ways including required
mid-block permeability. Otherwise, Dimensional Requirements
shall be according to the subdistrict onto which the building
FAÇADE faces.

adopted Feb. 17, 1993; pursuant to Order 138-09/10 passed on 1/20/10 Division
16 (Waynflete School Overlay Zone) was adopted in its entirety.
----------
Sec. 14-276. Purpose.
The intention of this division is to establish an overlay zone
which protects the value and integrity of established residential
neighborhoods, establishes clearly defined boundaries beyond which
residential conversions cannot occur and results in no net loss of
dwelling units, while allowing Waynflete School, an existing
private day school, to continue and reasonably augment its existing
uses and programs, thereby maintaining compatible development at
medium densities appropriate to the existing neighborhood patterns.
As used in this division, the term “Waynflete School” includes any
successor institution that operates as a private day school.
(Ord. No. 138 – 09/10, 1-20-10)
Sec. 14-276.1. Location and applicability of Waynfete School
Overlay Zone.
The Waynflete School Overlay Zone, as shown on the zoning map,
is intended to encompass and define Waynflete School’s principal
campus on the Portland peninsula. Properties in the Waynflete
School Overlay Zone shall continue to be governed by the
regulations applicable to the underlying zoning districts except as
specifically modified by this division.
(Ord. No. 138-09/10, 1-20-10)
Sec. 14-276.2. Overlay Zone sub-districts.
The Waynflete School Overlay Zone consists of two subdistricts,
as shown on the Waynflete School Overlay Zone subdistrict
map, incorporated herein by reference, as follows:
(a) The Campus Core sub-district defines the interior core
of the campus and is intended to allow compact
development of school uses, with specific space and
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-276.8 Rev.1-20-2010
bulk regualtions designed to accommodate school uses.
(b) The Campus Edge sub-district is intended to preserve
residential character along the streets bordering the
campus, by limiting the amount of residential space
which can be converted to school uses, by maintaining
a nmber of dwelling units within the sub-district
which equals the number of dwelling units existing in
the sub-district at the time of enactment of this
Overlay Zone and by encouraging mixed use building s
along the street frontages. The space and bulk
regulations of the R-4 district continue to apply
within the Campus Edge sub-district.
Except where otherwise specified in this division, all
provisions of this Waynflete School Overlay Zone apply in both
sub-districts.
(Ord. No. 138-09/10, 1-20-10)

Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-276.8 Rev.1-20-2010
as part of a previous approval shall remain in effect until revised
or updated pursuant to this section. In determining the amount of
parking required for any building within the Waynflete School
Overlay Zone, the Planning Authority or the Planning Board may take
into account such factors as:
(a) The use of centrally located on-campus parking facilities
so situated that students, faculty, staff and visitors
arriving on campus can reasonably be expected to park in
the central facilities and walk to their various oncampus
destinations during th course of a school day.
(b) Shared use of a single parking facility by two or more
buildings when the peak parking demand periods for such
buildings do not overlap.
(c) Development and implementation of a parking management
plan which discourages on-stsreet parking.
(d) Development and implementation of a TDM plan subject to
the review and approval of the planning authority or the
planning board. The TDM plan shall employe elements such
as public transit initiatives, parking cash-out, car
sharing, car and van pooling incentives, provision of
bicycle and pedestrian commuting accommodations,
guaranteed ride home programs, employee surveys,
newsletters and alternative transportation information
sharing and other such strategies that reduce signle
occupancy vehicle trips to and from Waynflete school.
Waynflete School shall follow the standards and
guidelines for developing a TDM plan found in the TDM
section of the City of Portland Technical and Design
Standards and Guidelines.
(Ord. No. 138-09/10, 1-20-10)
14-276.8. Loading.
The requirements of section 14-351 shall not apply to
buildings within the Waynflete School Overlay one. Instead, the
amount of locading area required for any building within the zone
shall be determined by the planning board during site plan review,
based on a campus-wide analysis, treating all land owned by
Waynflete School within the Waynflete School Overlay Zone as one
lot. In determining the amount of loading space required for any
building within the Waynflete School Overlay zone, the planning
board may take into account such factors as:
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-276.8 Rev.1-20-2010
(a) The use of centrally located on-campus loading facilities
so situated that vehicles making deliveries can load and
unload in central facilities, provided no single location
is overburdened with loading facilities.
(b) Shared use of a single loading facility by two or more
buildings.
(c) Impacts of the loading area on adjacent uses outside the
Waynflete School Overlay Zone.
(Ord. No. 138-09/10, 1-20-10)
Sec. 14-276.9. Signage.
Signs shall comply with the requirements of Division 22.
(Ord. No. 138-09/10, 1-20-10)
Sec. 14-276.10. Restrictions outside the Waynflete School
Overlay Zone.
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 14-103(b)(1) or
section 14-137(b)(1), Waynflete School cannot locate a school use
listed in section 14-276.3(a) on any lot in the R-4 or R-6
Districts outside the boundaries of the Waynflete School Overlay
Zone that was occupied by a residential use or structure on or
after January 20, 2010. This restriction does not prevent
Waynflete School from seeking a conditional use permit for a school
use, where otherwise allowed by the zoning district regulations, on
lots outside the Waynflete School Overlay Zone that were not
occupied by a residential use or structure on or after January 20,
2010.
(Ord. No. 138-09/10, 1-20-10)
DIVISION 16.1. INSTITUTIONAL OVERLAY ZONE (IOZ)
14-277. Purpose of the Institutional Overlay Zone
The Institutional Overlay Zone (IOZ) designation provides a
regulatory mechanism available to the city’s four major medical
and higher education campuses where an improved regulatory
structure is needed to facilitate a consistent, predictable, and
clear growth management process. The purposes of the
Institutional Overlay Zone are to:
(a) Acknowledge that the city’s major academic and medical
institutions play a prominent role in the health and well-being
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-277 Rev. 5-1-2017
of the local and regional community, and in order to sustain that
role, these institutions need flexibility to change and grow;
(b) Encourage proactive planning for institutional change
and growth which identifies and addresses likely long-term
institutional needs and cumulative impacts while leveraging
potential benefits at the neighborhood, city, and regional level;
(c) Ensure that institutional change and growth both
complements and, as appropriate, integrates adjacent or
surrounding neighborhoods through carefully planned transitions;
(d) Support the formation and continuation of mutually
beneficial public-private cooperation;
(e) Support an ongoing public engagement process that
benefits both the institutions and nearby neighborhoods;
(f) Reflect Comprehensive Plan and other policy objectives;
and
(g) Provide a consistent regulatory approach to all major
institutions which allows unique regulatory requirements that
balance the particular needs of institutions with the needs of
the surrounding neighborhood and wider community.
(Ord. No. 221-16/17, 5-1-2017)
Sec. 14-278. Location and Applicability
The city’s four primary medical and higher education
institutions are eligible to apply for designation as
Institutional Overlay Zones. The Eligible Institutions are the
two major hospital institutions of Maine Medical Center and Mercy
Hospital and the two major academic institutions of University of
Southern Maine and University of New England, their successors
and assigns. Designation as an IOZ is the preferred mechanism
where the Eligible Institution’s proposed development is
inconsistent with the existing zoning.
(Ord. No. 221-16/17, 5-1-2017)
14-279. Establishment of an Institutional Overlay Zone
(a) Application for an Institutional Overlay Zone. Where
the Eligible Institution seeks designation as an IOZ, they shall
submit a zone change application consisting of two components:
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-279 Rev. 5-1-2017
1. An Institutional Development Plan (IDP) (see Section
14-280).
2. A Regulatory Framework (see Section 14-281) that would,
when and if adopted, be the text and map amendment to
the City’s Land Use Code and Zoning Map.
(b) Required Public Involvement. At least two neighborhood
meetings shall be required. The first shall be held prior to the
formal submission of a zone change application for an
Institutional Overlay Zone and the second shall be held during
the City’s review. Meetings shall identify the concerns, if any,
of affected residents and property owners, and inform the
development of the Institutional Development Plan (IDP) and
Regulatory Framework. Meetings shall be held in a convenient
location proximate to the institution. The applicant shall
provide written notification to property owners of record within
500 feet of the proposed IOZ boundary at least ten days prior to
the meeting dates and maintain written records of the meetings.
(c) Required Scoping Meeting. The Eligible Institution
shall meet with the Planning Authority after the first required
neighborhood meeting and prior to submission of the zone change
application to confirm the focus of the Institutional Development
Plan (IDP) and Regulatory Framework, including associated study
areas that may be outside of the proposed IOZ boundary. The IDP
and Regulatory Framework will vary in detail and focus depending
on the Eligible Institution and its particular context. The
content requirements in Sections 14-280 and 14-281 and the
comments from neighborhood meeting(s) shall provide direction for
the content of the IDP. The Planning Authority or Planning Board
may require additional information or modify content requirements
as is relevant to the Eligible Institution (see Section 14-
280(c)).
(d) Reviewing Authority.
1. The Planning Board shall review the zone change
application, including the IDP and Regulatory
Framework. At least one public workshop and a public
hearing before the Planning Board are required.
2. Upon recommendation of the Planning Board, the City
Council shall review and consider adoption of the
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-279 Rev. 5-1-2017
Institutional Overlay Zone and the accompanying
Regulatory Framework as an amendment to the city’s code
of ordinances.
(e) Future Institutional Development.
1. All new development by the Eligible Institution within
the boundary of the IOZ shall be compliant with the
IOZ and accompanying Regulatory Framework, consistent
with the IDP, consistent with the Comprehensive Plan,
and meet applicable site plan standards, unless such
standards are superseded by the Regulatory Framework.
2. Any use/development proposed by the Eligible
Institution outside the IOZ boundary that complies
with the zoning for permitted uses in that location
shall be reviewed under the standards of that zone.
Any use/development proposed by an Eligible
Institution outside of the IOZ boundary that is
proposed in a residential zone and is functionally
related to the operations within the IOZ shall be
addressed by the IDP and require an amendment to the
IDP.
(Ord. No. 221-16/17, 5-1-2017)
14-280. Institutional Development Plan (IDP)
(a) Purpose. Any use conducted by an Eligible Institution
and any construction by an Eligible Institution in an
Institutional Overlay Zone shall be consistent with an
Institutional Development Plan (IDP) approved by the Planning
Board in accordance with this ordinance. The purpose of the IDP
is to establish baseline data about institutional land uses,
facilities, and services and measure, analyze, and address the
anticipated or potential impacts of planned institutional growth
and change. The IDP shall serve as a background document that
supports the proposed Regulatory Framework and frames subsequent
site plan review(s).
(b) Planning Horizon. An IDP shall provide the city and
abutting neighborhoods with a clear outline of the anticipated or
potential growth and change of the Eligible Institution for the
short- to medium-term (e.g. 1-5 and 5-10 years respectively), as
well as a conceptual growth plan for the long-term (e.g. 10 years
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14

baseline data in the IDP shall be updated as appropriate.
(Ord. No. 221-16/17, 5-1-2017)
14-281. Regulatory Framework
(a) Purpose. The Regulatory Framework translates the IDP
into a set of clear and specific zoning requirements for the IOZ
that constitute the text and map amendments to the City’s Land
Use Code and Zoning Map. The zoning requirements are anticipated
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-281 Rev. 5-1-2017
to include parameters that guide the growth and change of the
institution as well as broad strategies to address potential
impacts, with plans and details to be developed under site plan
review.
(b) Applicability. The Regulatory Framework shall apply
only to properties that are within the IOZ boundary and to which
the Eligible Institution holds right, title, or interest. For
these properties, the Institutional Overlay Zone shall supersede
the underlying zoning, and all new institutional development
shall be conducted in compliance with the Regulatory Framework
and the approved Institutional Development Plan. Properties
located within the Institutional Overlay Zone not subject to
right, title, or interest of the Eligible Institution shall
continue to be governed by the regulations of the underlying
zoning designation.
(c) Uses. Institutional uses, including hospitals and
higher education facilities, shall be permitted, as shall uses
that are functionally integrated with, ancillary to, and/or
substantively related to supporting the primary institutional
use, consistent with the applicable approved IDP.
(d) Content. The Regulatory Framework shall reflect the
information and analysis of the IDP. The content shall be
tailored to address the particular issues associated with the
institution and its neighborhoods. The Regulatory Framework
should be succinct and use tables and graphics as possible to
address the following, if applicable:
1. Zoning boundary of the IOZ: The area to which the
regulations apply, as shown on the zoning map, subject
to other provisions of this ordinance (i.e. the map
amendment to the City’s Zoning Map);
2. Phasing and schedules: Requirements that relate to
particular proposed phases; a chart showing the
schedule or thresholds for submitting an amended IDP

(b) Updates and amendments.
1. It is intended that the IDP will be updated on a
regular basis to ensure that the data is current and
that the document remains accurate. Accordingly,
monitoring reports will be filed every three years and
shall include a summary of progress on IDP
implementation and of acquisitions and divestment
since the date of IDP approval. At the time of the
submission of the monitoring report, MMC shall
identify any updates to the IDP which may result from
updated master planning, changes in baseline
information, or changes in the adjacent neighborhoods
which affect MMC, to allow the IDP to remain current.
Updates and minor amendments not described below shall
be reviewed administratively by the Planning
Authority.
2. Minor amendments that impact phasing of the long-term
development blocks or change the approach to parking,
transportation, neighborhood engagement or design
shall be reviewed by the Planning Board for
consistency with the objectives of the IDP. In
addition to consistency with the objectives of the
IDP, review of phasing and development program
amendments shall focus on integration with the campus
and impacts on transportation or infrastructure. This
review may occur simultaneously with the site plan
review of an anticipated project.
3. Major amendments shall be reviewed by the Planning
Board and are required under the following
circumstances:
a. A change to the Regulatory Framework is required;
b. The IDP is no longer representative of the

a result of redevelopment in the area or City
upgrades to neighborhood planning (such as
roadway changes, infrastructure upgrades,
community design, lighting, etc.); or
c. Development proposed by MMC is inconsistent with
the master facility plan, transportation plan
intent, design plan intent, or environment and
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-282 Rev. 11-20-2017

DIVISION 17. B-7 MIXED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT ZONE
Sec. 14-294. Purpose.
The purpose of the B-7, mixed development district zone is
to establish a zoning district for urban areas in which the city
has adopted master plans for redevelopment. Certain districts,
including but not limited to bayside, lie at the perimeter of
the established downtown and contain significant redevelopment
opportunities. The B-7 zone encourages these districts to
acquire a distinctly urban form through dense development
featuring a mix of uses such as housing, retail, offices,
research and development, and artisan studios and that
emphasizes a quality pedestrian experience, promotes public
transit, and demonstrates exemplary urban design. Utilization
of transportation, other than the automobile is strongly
encouraged and is advanced by the installation of bicycle
amenities, such as bicycle racks and storage areas. The zone
promotes a wide range of uses in high quality structures and
public open spaces to achieve twenty-four (24) hour urban
vitality and shared parking infrastructure.
The following regulatory framework is intended to promote
the mixed-use development pattern envisioned on Portland’s
peninsula. District-specific design standards and overlay maps
can be found at the city planning and development office.

(b) Noise:
1. Definitions:
a. Tonal sounds are defined as sound waves
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-299 Rev. 3-7-2016
usually perceived as a hum or whine because
their instantaneous sound pressure varies
essentially as a simple sinusoidal function
of time.
b. Impulse sounds are defined as sound events
characterized by brief excursions of sound
pressure, each with duration of less than
one (1) second.
2. Measurement: Sound levels shall be measured with
a sound level meter with a frequency weighting
network manufactured according to standards
prescribed by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) or its successor body.
Measurements shall be made at all major lot lines
of the site, at a height of at least four (4)
feet above the ground surface. In measuring sound
levels under this section, sounds with a
continuous duration of less than sixty (60)
seconds shall be measured by the maximum reading
on a sound level meter set to the A weighted
scale and the fast meter response (L maxfast).
Sounds with a continuous duration of sixty (60)
seconds or more shall be measured on the basis of
the energy average sound level over a period of
sixty (60) seconds (LEQ1).
3. Maximum permissible sound levels: The maximum
permissible sound level of any continuous,
regular or frequent source of sound produced by
an activity shall be as follows:
a. Sixty (60) dBA between the hours of 7:00
a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
b. Fifty (50) dBA between the hours of 10:00
p.m. and 7:00 a.m., as measured at or within
the boundaries of any residential zone.
In addition to the sound level standards
established above, all uses located within this
zone shall employ best practicable sound

DIVISION 17.5. EASTERN WATERFRONT PORT ZONE*
----------
*Editor’s Note- Order No. 297-05/06 adopted on September 18, 2006,
implemented a new Eastern Waterfront Port Zone for the Maine State Pier and
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-300 Rev.9-18-06
Portland Ocean Terminal. The proposed changes for the Portland Ocean
Terminal and the Maine State Pier would allow for a wider range of uses for
the piers and properties of the Portland Ocean Terminal.
----------
Sec. 14-300. Purpose.
The Eastern Waterfront Port Zone is created to nurture
deepwater dependent activity within the context of the
established waterfront. The transport of goods and passengers
by water is an important component of both the local and
regional economies and this transport and other forms of marine
industry are dependent upon land and piers with direct access to
Portland Harbor. Given the existing pier infrastructure,
proximity to deep water, and urban context, Portland’s Eastern
Waterfront is uniquely situated to support a wide range of
water-dependent industry and commerce through a variety of
marine activities.
The support and expansion of Portland’s marine industry
requires piers, uplands, and circulation consistent with the
transportation purpose and use of marine facilities. The growth
of Portland’s marine passenger industry also requires supporting
services and activities to provide a safe, convenient, and
enjoyable travel experience for users of marine passenger
facilities. Non-marine uses that complement the marine
passenger industry, are compatible with existing and future
water-dependent uses, and provide opportunities for residents
and visitors alike to enjoy the Eastern Waterfront throughout
the year, are encouraged.
The primary use of the deep-water resources must be for the
berthing and support of large vessels. Non-marine uses that
complement and support the deepwater infrastructure and do not
conflict or compete for limited space with existing or
anticipated deepwater-dependent uses are encouraged. Existing
and future pier infrastructure and upland support areas should
be designed and maintained to support a variety of marine uses
and be responsive to future technologies and trends in the
marine industry.
Given the need to nurture and support deepwater-dependent
uses and the need for non-deepwater dependent uses to complement
the marine passenger industry and to support the maintenance and
repair of pier infrastructure, the Eastern Waterfront Port Zone
recognizes the following hierarchy of uses:
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-300 Rev.9-18-06
(a) The first priority of this zone is to protect and
nurture existing and potential deepwater dependent
uses (those uses requiring a minimum of 15 feet of
water depth);
(b) The second priority is to allow shallow waterdependent
and other permitted marine uses, so long as
they do not interfere with deepwater dependent uses,
either directly by displacement or indirectly by
placing incompatible demands on the zone’s
infrastructure; and
(c) Other uses specified herein are allowed only if they
do not interfere with and are not incompatible with
higher priority uses.
(Ord. No. 297-05/06, 9-18-06)
Sec. 14-300.1. No adverse impact on marine uses.
No use shall be permitted, approved or established in this
zone if it will have an impermissible adverse impact on future
marine development opportunities. A proposed non-water
dependent component of a development will have an impermissible
adverse impact if it will result in any one (1) or more of the
following:
(a) The proposed use will displace an existing waterdependent
use;
(b) The proposed use will reduce existing commercial
vessel berthing space;
(c) The proposed use, structure or activities, including
but not limited to access, circulation, parking,
dumpsters, exterior storage or loading facilities, and
other structures, will unreasonably interfere with the
activities and operation of existing water-dependent
uses or significantly impede access to vessel berthing
or other access to the water by water-dependent uses;
or
(d) The siting of a proposed use will substantially reduce
or inhibit existing public access to marine or tidal
waters.

Order 184-14/15 repealed Division 18.7 on 6-1-2015.
----------
Sec. 14-305. Purpose.
The Waterfront Central Zone was created to protect and nurture
water-dependent and marine-related support uses so that they may
grow and prosper in the present and into the future in an
environment and area dedicated to this purpose. The following
priority of uses is recognized:
(a) The first priority of this zone is to protect and nurture
existing and potential water-dependent uses in a setting that
enforces their continued economic viability;
(b) The second priority is to encourage other marine and
marine-related support uses so long as they do not interfere with
water-dependent uses, either directly by displacement or indirectly
by placing incompatible demands on the zone’s infrastructure;
(c) Non-marine uses are encouraged provided that they do not
interfere with and are not incompatible with first and second
priority uses. Non-marine uses are beneficial to the waterfront
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-305 Rev. 6-17-2019
economy because they provide the financial return to property
owners necessary for the maintenance and improvement of the marine
infrastructure.
Water-dependent and marine-related support uses by their
nature have activities and operational needs that are unique to
this area and are not shared by other commercial and industrial
uses in the city. These first and second priority uses and related
activities may result in noise, odor, dust, hours of operation,
parking and traffic patterns and traffic control needs that are
necessary for the convenient and successful conduct of such uses.
Other uses may not be compatible with these types of effects.
Other specified uses are permitted in the waterfront central zone,
provided that they do not significantly interfere with the
activities and operation of water-dependent and marine-related
support uses. Such uses must be, and are assumed to be, aware of
the impacts associated with marine uses and therefore must accept
and be tolerant of them. Other specified uses in the zone shall
accommodate to those patterns and needs of the higher priority uses
so long as those higher priority uses are not detrimental to public
health and safety and the higher priority activities are conducted
in accordance with sound practices or practices customary in the
trade.
Commercial Street is recognized as an important economic
center for the city and region. Marine compatible uses are
encouraged to locate and grow along Commercial Street while higher
priority marine uses are protected on the waterfront.

Sec. 14-306. Definitions.
For the purposes of the Waterfront Central Zone only the
following terms shall have the following definitions:
Common circulation drives: private driveways, roadways and
circulation areas accessible to all on-site tenants and/or
occupants of a lot within the waterfront central zone providing
access from/to the public street network.
Lot: any abutting property under common ownership.

Commercial Street Overlay Zone (CSOZ): The Commercial Street
Overlay Zone (CSOZ) is a portion of the Waterfront Central Zone,
as described below, where new and existing development may be
occupied with 100% non-marine use tenants listed under 14-
307(b), subject to the standards and use limitations provided in
section 14-311(b).
The geographic limits of the CSOZ are defined by parcels of land
and piers within the Waterfront Central Zone located on the
landward side of a line established one hundred twenty-five
(125) feet south of the southerly sideline of Commercial Street
and modified as follows: the seaward limit of the CSOZ extends
to a line three hundred (300) feet south of the southerly
sideline of Commercial Street in the area between the easterly
and westerly sideline of Long Wharf. Additionally, all areas
subject to this provision are set back landward at least twentyfive
(25) feet from the average high tide line of Portland
Harbor and associated coastal wetlands. Where the one hundred
twenty-five (125) foot offset intersects with the footprint of a
building existing as of May 2019 and such intersection leaves
75% or more of the building within the CSOZ, the entire building
shall be considered included in the CSOZ. All offset distances
are measured horizontally.
All applicants for development within the CSOZ are responsible
for demonstrating their location within the CSOZ according to
the findings of a site-specific land survey conducted by a
professional land surveyor licensed by the State of Maine. The
limits of the CSOZ shall be shown on all site plans and
subdivision plats for proposed development within the CSOZ.
On-Site shall mean that portion of any lot included within or
directly impacted by a proposed development.

Sec. 14-311. Development standards.
(a) Standards for non-marine uses located outside of the
CSOZ: Non-marine uses listed above in Sec. 14-307(b) and 14-308(b)
that are located outside of the CSOZ shall be subject to the
performance standards listed in 14-311(d) as well as the following
standards:
1. 55% marine use required on ground floors: At least
55% of the leasable ground floor area of all buildings on
a lot (defined in 14-306 above), shall be occupied by
marine uses, as listed under 14-307(a)or 14-308(a)(1).
2. 55% marine use required for all open areas: After
subtracting areas used for common circulation drives
(defined in 14-306 above), at least 55% of un-built area
(meaning area not occupied by a building) on the lot,
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-311 Rev. 6-17-2019
when calculated using the aggregate of all such un-built
areas, shall be occupied by marine uses, as listed under
14-307(a) or 14-308 (a)1.
3. Ground floor vacancies and change of occupancy offered to
water dependent/marine uses: Ground floor vacant space
and areas proposed for a change of occupant outside of
the CSOZ shall not be filled with any non-marine use
without adequate opportunity for marine uses to occupy
the space.
a. Ground floor vacancy and change of occupant outside
of the CSOZ advertised to marine users: In any lot
or portion of lot outside of the CSOZ, each time a
ground floor occupant departs or gives notice to
depart from the lot, the space, along with any
associated parking spaces to be vacated, must be
made available to new marine occupants.
Prior to renting to a non-marine user the
property owner shall advertise for a new marine
occupant for not less than a one hundred
eighty(180) day period in targeted media and by
other means reasonably calculated to reach marine
users (e.g. local marine trade publications, marine
trade websites, waterfront bulletins .) Should one
or more marine users apply, the property owner
shall make the space available to a marine
occupant, in accordance with terms and rates
generally consistent with comparable space in the
55% marine use portion of the zone (outside of the
CSOZ). The property owner may stop advertising
sooner than the end of the 180-day period if a
lease is signed with a marine user. Should no
marine user apply by the end of the 180-day period,
the owner may fill the space with a non-marine user
provided that the new non-marine occupant will not
cause the lot to exceed the non-marine use
occupancy maximum of 45% of the ground floor area
or open area.
b. Uses inventoried: To demonstrate adherence to the
55% marine use requirement, the applicant shall
submit to the planning authority, upon request, an
inventory which lists each occupant (tenant or
otherwise), as well as a map which depicts the
location of each occupant. The map shall show all
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-311 Rev. 6-17-2019
ground level space, including buildings, parking,
open areas and submerged lands associated with the
subject lot. For each occupant, the property owner
must indicate the square footage of area occupied
and whether the occupant is a marine use as defined
herein. For vacant space, the last previous
occupant shall be listed, along with the date of
departure.
c. Prior to changes of occupancy and/or as part of
applications for new development outside of the
CSOZ, the property owner or applicant shall provide
proof of compliance with the requirements of this
section as a condition of approval.
4. Pier or bulkhead edge reserved for marine uses:
Notwithstanding any provision of this ordinance to the
contrary, excepting only the portion of any pier which
might be used for non-commercial berthing pursuant to 14-
307(a)(20), all berthing and/or dockage space and
associated floats plus the entire linear edge of that
portion of every pier or bulkhead which is adjacent to
greater than zero feet of water depth at mean low water,
to a minimum setback line of at least ten (10) feet from
the edge of the pier, bulkhead, or engineered shoreline
may only be used or occupied by one or more marine uses
as defined in 14-307(a)) or 14-308(a). Said edge shall
be the seaward extent of any engineered shoreline or
working deck of any pier or wharf.
(b) CSOZ standards: Non-marine uses listed under 14-307(b),
14-307(e) and 14-308 located within the CSOZ , as defined in 14-
306, shall be subject to the performance standards listed in 14-
311(d) as well as the following standards:
1. Vessel access: Non-marine uses allowed under this
provision shall not disrupt or block access to vessel
berthing and shall otherwise adhere to the performance
standards of this zone described in Sec. 14-311(d).
2. Maximum setback for new development on lots with
seventy-five (75) or more feet of Commercial Street
frontage: Any new non-marine development constructed
subject to this provision which is located on a lot with
seventy-five (75) or more feet of frontage along the
Commercial Street right of way shall be located with its
front façade no further than thirty-five feet (35) from
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-311 Rev. 6-17-2019
the southerly sideline of the Commercial Street right of
way. Furthermore, any such development shall orient its
front façade and its primary pedestrian entrance toward
Commercial Street and no vehicular circulation or parking
may occupy the land or pier area between the front façade
of the building and Commercial Street.
Non-marine development subject to this provision on
lots with fewer than seventy-five (75) feet of frontage
along the Commercial Street right-of-way, changes of use
within existing buildings, and/or building additions of
less than 5,000 square feet of new development to
existing buildings are exempt from the maximum setback
provisions established herein.
3. Investment in marine infrastructure: All applicants for
site plan review or a change of use permit for non-marine
development in the CSOZ are required to invest in marine
infrastructure as a condition of development, provided
that the total project costs exceed $250,000. The value
of the investment shall be not less than five percent
(5%) of total project costs over $250,000 for
constructing non-marine space and associated site
improvements in the CSOZ.
Required investment may occur by one or both the
following methods:
a. Direct investment in marine infrastructure located
on the same lot: Investment shall be for the
benefit of marine uses listed in 14-307(a) within
the same lot as the proposed non-marine
development. Investment may include dredging, pile
replacement, new or replaced structural decking
(but not pavement resurfacing), new or replaced
fendering systems, new or replaced floats, pier
expansions, permanent conversions of recreational
berthing to commercial berthing, bulkhead or
seawall repair or improvements, or any combination
of similar improvements. Plans for the marine
infrastructure investment shall be submitted to the
planning authority with the application for site
plan review or change of use permit and shall
include details and a commitment as to how the
marine infrastructure will be utilized by marine
users. The marine infrastructure improvements
shall be completed prior to the issuance of a
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-311 Rev. 6-17-2019
certificate of occupancy for the non-marine
development project.
b. Financial contribution: If direct investment in
marine infrastructure is not made, the developer
shall make a financial contribution to the city’s
waterfront loan and investment fund.
(c) No Contract or Conditional Rezoning Permitted
This section is intended to accomplish goals from Portland’s
Plan 2030. Specifically, these changes will:
• Prioritize and promote Portland’s unique mix of waterdependent,
marine-related uses and compatible non-marine
uses;
• Recognize and reinforce the respective roles of the
Eastern, Central and Western Waterfronts; and
• Celebrate, promote and protect Portland’s lobster and
fishing industry as a foundation of the region’s economy
and a feature of civic pride.
1. In light of this purpose and the significance of the
central waterfront to the City’s future, no contract or
conditional rezoning applications may be approved in the
Waterfront Central Zone.
(b) Performance standards: All uses in the waterfront central
zone shall comply with the following standards. The Operations and
Access Management Plan (standard 13) shall be reviewed by the
planning authority:
1. Outdoor storage of materials: Outdoor storage of
commodities and materials accessory to normal conduct of
business, except pilings and/or cranes, shall be
permitted to a maximum height of forty-five (45) feet,
and such materials shall be entirely contained, including
runoff contaminants and residual material, within a
designated area within the lot boundaries.
2. Noise: The level of sound, measured by a sound level
meter with frequency weighting network (manufactured
according to standards prescribed by the American
National Standards Institute, Inc.), inherently and
recurrently generated within the waterfront central zone

Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-311 Rev. 6-17-2019
shall not exceed seventy-five (75) decibels on the A
scale at the boundaries of any lot, except for sound from
construction activities, sound from traffic on public
streets, sound from temporary activities such as
festivals, and sound created as a result of, or relating
to, an emergency, including sound from emergency warning
signal devices. In measuring sound levels under this
section, sounds with a continuous duration of less than
sixty (60) seconds shall be measured by the maximum
reading on a sound level meter set to the A weighted
scale and the fast meter response (L maxfast). Sounds
with a continuous duration of sixty (60) seconds or more
shall be measured on the basis of the energy average
sound level over a period of sixty (60) seconds (LEQ1).
3. Vibration: Vibration inherently and recurrently generated
shall be imperceptible without instruments at lot
boundaries. This shall not apply to vibration resulting
from activities aboard a vessel or from railroad vehicle
activities, or from activities on a pile supported pier.
4. Discharges into harbor areas: No discharge into harbor
water areas shall be permitted, unless permitted by the
Maine Department of Environmental Protection under a
waste discharge license and as approved by the department
of public works in accordance with chapter 24, article

6. Landfill of docking and berthing areas: Landfill of
docking and berthing areas shall be governed by 38
M.R.S.A. sections 480-A through 480-HH, and permitted
only if the landfill does not reduce the amount of linear
berthing areas or space, or berthing capacity. If
approved, construction shall be undertaken using methods
approved by the department of public works and shall be
accomplished in accordance with the provisions of
division 25 of this article and in a manner so as to
ensure that a stable and impermeable wall of acceptable
materials will completely contain the fill material and
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-311 Rev. 6-17-2019
will not permit any fill material to leach into docking
areas or navigable waters.
7. Off-street parking and loading: Division 20 (off-street
parking) and division 21 (off-street loading) of this
article shall not apply.
8. Lighting: All lighting on the site shall be shielded such
that direct light sources shall not unreasonably
interfere with vessels transiting the harbor nor have an
unreasonable adverse impact on adjacent residential
zones. Lighting: All lighting on the site shall be
shielded such that direct light sources shall not
unreasonably interfere with vessels transiting the harbor
nor have an unreasonable adverse impact on adjacent
residential zones
. Storage of pollutants and oily wastes: On-premises
storage of pollutants and oily wastes shall not be
permitted for more than forty-five (45) days.
10. Urban design: Construction of new structures located
within thirty-five (35) feet of the southerly edge of
Commercial Street between Maine Wharf and the easterly
property line of the city fish pier shall conform to the
guidelines set forth in the downtown urban design
guidelines, unless such structures are also located
within one-hundred (100) feet of the water. Such
structures that are also located within one-hundred (100)
feet of the water shall conform to the extent practicable
to the downtown urban design guidelines.
11. Pier and wharf expansions: In addition to meeting
Harbor Commission and Coast Guard requirements for
navigation, any expansion or extension of a pier and
or wharf in the waterfront central zone shall
demonstrate its compatibility with fixed route ferry
service and emergency vessel operations.
12. Public view protection: Any new development in the
waterfront central zone shall perform a public view
impact analysis for review and approval by the planning
board or planning authority as a condition of site plan
approval. The analysis shall: (a) demonstrate the
project’s adherence to the Portland View Corridor
Protection Plan (City of Portland Comprehensive Plan,
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-311 Rev. 6-17-2019
2002)to the extent practicable; and (b) promote the
public’s visual access to the water through sensitive
building placement.
The planning board or planning authority shall find at a
minimum that the proposed development (a) retains street
corridor views as extended across Commercial Street from
the Portland peninsula; (b) retains panoramic views of
the water from Commercial Street to the extent
practicable; and (c) where loss of existing public views
to the water is shown to be necessary for the reasonable
development of the site, the developer provides
alternative public views to the water through newly
established view corridors or publicly accessible
pedestrian ways. Such pedestrian ways shall not interfere
with existing or potential water-dependent uses, nor
shall they endanger the public through uncontrolled
proximity to industrial activity.
3. Operations and Access Management Plan: Any new
development, including changes of use or expansion of
uses in the Waterfront Central Zone shall submit a scaled
plan and accompanying narrative that demonstrates
waterfront access and functional accommodation for waterdependent
uses. In accordance with Portland’s Plan 2030,
the plan shall demonstrate consistency with the hierarchy
of waterfront uses, as further detailed in Sec. 14-305
(Purpose), with non-marine and marine-related uses being
subordinate in placement and disposition to waterdependent
uses, and designed so as not to impede access
to the pier edge and vessel berthing nor interfere with
marine operations.
a. Submission Requirements. The plan shall, at a
minimum, illustrate the following information:
i. Location of all existing and proposed
structures, rights-of-way, common circulation
drives as defined in Sec. 14-306, access-ways,
sidewalks, pier edges, floats and docks,
showing the entire lot in the context of its
respective pier.
ii. Existing and proposed off-street parking,
labeled with associated uses.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-311 Rev. 6-17-2019
iii. Facilities for the loading and unloading of
goods and materials.
iv. Regularly occurring exterior activities
including but not limited to the storage of
material, equipment and vehicles, yard area,
outdoor seating and on-site waste management.
v. Signage showing parking use, wayfinding, and
posted operational restrictions.
vi. Plan narrative detailing how the standards
listed below are achieved, tenant/landlord
communication protocols, private enforcement
actions to be employed to ensure plan
compliance, and the responsible parties
representing the property owner.
b. Review Standards. In addition to the information
above, the plan shall demonstrate compliance with
the following standards:
i. Off-street parking is subject to the
limitations described in Sec. 14-311(a)(“55%
Rule”). Off-street parking spaces intended for
use by water-dependent uses shall be sited as
close as reasonably possible to associated
vessels and/or ground-floor lease area.
ii. Proposals for new non-marine parking,
accessory to an otherwise permitted use in the
WCZ, shall submit a parking analysis for all
uses on the subject lot, justifying the number
of non-marine spaces based upon the proposed
use and demonstrating sufficient parking
supply for marine uses. If sufficient parking
is not available to marine uses, off-street
parking for non-marine uses shall not be
permitted.
iii. Off-street parking, loading facilities and
access ways designated for water-dependent
uses shall be exclusive to such uses, except
that, if not being occupied by water-dependent
tenants, such parking may be made available to
non-marine uses between the hours of 5:00 p.m.
and 2:00 a.m. Any such shared parking
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-311 Rev. 6-17-2019
arrangements shall be documented in the
Operations and Access Management narrative
described above, and clearly signed on-site.
iv. All properties providing commercial berthing
shall demonstrate reasonable opportunities to
load and unload vessels from the subject lot.
v. Facilities for the loading and unloading of
goods shall account for the frequency of use
and vehicle type and, to the extent possible,
minimize impacts to pedestrian and vehicle
circulation patterns.
vi. Provisions for the storage and movement of
goods and materials shall be designed into all
pier edge development. Circulation routes must
be maintained or otherwise provided as an
element of all development. The siting,
design, and circulation of non-marine uses,
particularly those allowed on first floors,
shall accommodate reasonable access for
pedestrians, vehicles, and freight transfer to
and from berthed vessels.
vii. Non-marine uses shall provide a dedicated
pedestrian route between the proposed use and
Commercial Street, and shall seek to minimize
conflict with vehicle traffic.

DIVISION 18.5. WATERFRONT PORT DEVELOPMENT ZONE*
-----
*Editor’s Note—See the editor’s note to division 18 of this article.
-----
Sec. 14-318. Purpose.
Transport of goods by water to and from Portland is an
important component of both the local and regional economy. This
commerce is dependent upon land with direct access to the dredged
deep-water channel of the Fore River and Portland Harbor.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-318 Rev. 9-6-2017
The Port of Portland is integral to the city’s economic,
cultural and fiscal health. This zone exists to ensure the
continued viability of the Port of Portland. Uses in the port
development zone, while governed by the similar performance
standards as other industrial zones, are primarily limited to
those uses which are dependent upon deep water and which
contribute to port activity.
Nonmarine activity may be allowed to the extent it will not
have any adverse impact on marine uses.
(Ord. No. 168-93, § 2, 1-4-93; Ord. No. 33-17/18, 9-6-2017)
Sec. 14-318.5. No adverse impact on marine uses.
No use shall be permitted, approved or established in this
zone if it will have an impermissible adverse impact on future
marine development. A proposed development will have an
impermissible adverse impact if it will result in any one (1) or
more of the following:
(a) The proposed nonwater-dependent use will displace an
existing water-dependent use;
(b) The proposed use will reduce existing commercial
vessel berthing space;
(b) The proposed nonwater-dependent use, structure or
activities, including but not limited to access,
circulation, parking, dumpsters, exterior storage or
loading facilities, and other structures, will
unreasonably interfere with the activities and operation
of existing water-dependent uses or significantly impede
access to vessel berthing or other access to the water by
water-dependent uses; or
(d) The siting of a proposed nonwater-dependent use will
substantially reduce or inhibit existing public access
to marine or tidal waters.

DIVISION 19.8. DOWNTOWN ENTERTAINMENT OVERLAY ZONE
Sec. 14-330.11. Purpose.
The purpose and intent of this section is to regulate the
location of businesses with entertainment licenses in order to
maintain and improve public safety and the quality of life of
Portland residents by preventing an over concentration of
businesses with entertainment licenses, particularly those which
also have liquor licenses, and the public safety problems that
have and will be experienced when too many of these businesses
are located too close to each other. These problems include
large late-night crowds within which fights and assaults,
disorderly conduct and other breaches of the peace occur and

designed to reduce the number of automobiles
parking on campus, such as ride share programs and
incentives for use of bicycles and public

shall be provided. Parking needs projections provided
by the applicant or the planning department should be

this division for all uses on the site
including the change of use.

deemed to satisfy eight (8) required car spaces,
but in no case shall more than 50% of the parking
requirement be satisfied by shared vehicle use.
3. The planning board may establish a parking
requirement that is less than the normally required
number of spaces upon a finding of unique
conditions that result in a lesser parking demand,
such as housing for persons who cannot drive,
housing that participates in a travel demand
management program, availability of transit, or
housing which includes permanent restrictions on
automobile usage, and which is permanently
restricted from utilizing resident on-street
parking stickers.

parking requirement for affordable housing units for
rent or sale within an eligible project that is less
than one (1) parking space per affordable housing
unit, regardless of the size of the structure.
(c) Site plans over 50,000 square feet and projects in the

may approve joint use.
(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) below, the Board
of Appeals may approve the joint use of a parking facility by
two (2) or more principal buildings or uses where it is clearly
demonstrated that the parking facility will substantially meet
the intent of the requirements by reason of variation in the
probable time of maximum use by patrons or employees among such
establishments. This section shall apply to residential uses in
the B-1, B-1b, B-2, B-2c and B-3 zone which propose joint use of
a parking facility with another principal use in the B-1, B-1b,
B-2 and B-3 zone. The Planning Board may be substituted for the

in the B-2b zone shall be permitted to share parking
spaces with commercial uses located in the same building;
and
2. It is clearly demonstrated that the joint parking
arrangement will substantially meet the intent of the
parking requirements by reason of a variation in the
probable time of maximum use by patrons or employees of
the commercial establishment and tenants of the
residential dwelling units; and
3. Parties involved in the joint use of parking shall
provide evidence of a binding agreement for the joint
use of parking. Any subsequent modifications to the
structure or change in the tenant occupancy of the
commercial use(s) shall require review by the Zoning
Administrator for conformance with this section.
Any decision by the Zoning Administrator on shared parking
requests may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals as an
interpretive appeal pursuant to 14-471(a).

located in and conforming with the provisions of a nearby
business or industrial zone (except B-1 zones) if the lot on
which the use is proposed is located wholly within three hundred
(300) feet, measured along lines of public access, of the
principal building of the use to which the proposed use would be
accessory and provided further that:
(a) The lot where the parking use is proposed shall be
under the control of the owner of the use to which the
parking use would be accessory. Evidence of such
control by deed or lease shall be required before the
certificate of occupancy is issued. If such control
should be abrogated, the parking use thus allowed
shall automatically revert to a nonconforming use in
violation of this article and shall be terminated
forthwith.

broadening transportation choice and facilitating development
with lower traffic impacts and reduced parking requirements.
The mechanism and protocol for collecting fees and spending
funds are consistent with state requirements for utilizing
transportation related impact fees.

(a) Signs allowed on private property with and without
permits. Signs shall be allowed on private property in the city in
accordance with, and only in accordance with, Table 1 of section

such sign is allowed without prior approval as provided in this
division in the zoning district(s) represented by that column. If
the notation “B” appears for a sign type in a column, such sign is
allowed only with prior permit approval in the zoning district(s)
represented by that column. Special conditions may apply in some
cases. If the notation “D” appears for a sign type in a column,
such a sign is not allowed in the zoning district(s) represented by
that column under any circumstances.
Although permitted under the previous paragraph, a sign
designated by an “A” or “B” in Table 1 of section 14-369.5 shall be
allowed only if:
1. The sum of the area of all building and freestanding
signs on the lot conforms with the maximum permitted sign
areas for such as determined by the formula for the
zoning district in which the lot is located as specified
in Table 2 of section 14-369.5; and
2. The size, location and number of signs on the lot conform
with the requirements of Table 2 of section 14-369.5,
which establish permitted sign dimensions by sign type,
and with any additional limitations listed therein.
(b) Permits required. If a sign requiring a permit under the
provisions of this division is to be placed, constructed, erected
or modified on a lot, the owner of the lot shall secure a sign
construction permit prior to the construction, placement, erection
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-368. Rev.5-21-12
14-573
or modification of such a sign in accordance with the requirements
of section 14-368.5. In addition, the property owner shall maintain
in force at all times a sign construction permit for such sign in
accordance with section 14-368.5.
No signs shall be erected in the public right-of-way except in
accordance with subsection (e) of this section and the permit
requirements of section 14-368.5.
No sign permit of any kind shall be issued for an existing or
proposed sign unless such sign is in compliance with the
requirements of this division, including those protecting existing
signs.
(c) Design, construction and maintenance. All signs shall be
designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the
following standards:
1. All signs shall comply with applicable provisions of the
building code and the electrical code of the city at all
times;
2. Except for banners, flags, temporary signs, portable
signs and window signs conforming in all respects with
the requirements of this division, all signs shall be

3. All signs shall be maintained in good structural
condition, in compliance with all building and electrical
codes, and in conformance with this Code, at all times;
4. Signs located in or adjacent to residential zones shall
not cause light spillover or glare into properties within
the residential zone.
(d) Signage plan. No permit shall be issued for an individual
sign requiring a sign construction permit unless and until a
signage plan for the lot on which the sign will be erected has been
submitted to the department.
For any lot on which the owner proposes to erect one (1) or
more signs requiring a permit, the owner shall submit to the
department a signage plan containing the following:
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-368. Rev.5-21-12
14-574
1. A sketch plan of the lot. The sketch plan should indicate
the location of buildings and driveways on the lot, as
well as any abutting streets. Length of building
frontages and street frontage(s) should also be noted;
2. An indication on the sketch plan of the proposed location
of each existing and proposed sign of any type, except
that incidental, portable, temporary and window signs
need not be shown. For building signs, a sketch or a
photograph of each building wall shall be provided
indicating wall and sign dimensions; and
3. Computations of the following:
a. A listing of each building sign (existing and
proposed), identifying the location of each such
sign and its sign area;
b. A listing of each freestanding sign (existing and
proposed), indicating the area, height and setback
of each such sign; and
4. A sketch of proposed signs, indicating dimensions,
materials, source of illumination and construction
method.
For purposes of this section, a sketch plan shall not require
a stamp by a licensed professional such as an engineer or an
architect. Measurements may be estimated. For multi-tenant lots or
buildings, individual tenants shall be required to submit only
those measurements applicable to their individual frontage or as
otherwise required to review their application. Once a sketch plan
has been filed for a property, the department shall keep a record
of such plan so that a new sketch plan shall not be required for
later changes to signage on a site for which a sketch plan has been
previously submitted.
(e) Signs in the public right-of-way. No signs shall be
allowed in the public right-of-way, except for the following:
1. Permanent signs, limited to the following: Public signs

off-premise signs to be located on a major or
minor arterial in a location determined safe by the city
traffic engineer and upon the payment of an initial fee
of $300.00, with an annual renewal fee of $30.00. In the
event the sign is damaged or destroyed, the replacement
of any sign shall be the sole responsibility of the
permittee. The permittee shall be required to obtain a
permit for said sign from the building inspections
department, after securing $400,000 insurance for said
sign, naming the City of Portland as an additional
insured.

regulations set forth in this division, the more stringent standard
shall apply.
(Ord. No. 252-94, § 2, 4-4-94; Ord. No. 143-07/08, 5-19-08; Ord. No. 91-11/12, 5-
21-12)
Sec. 14-368.5. Permits.
The procedures set forth below shall govern the application
for, and issuance of, all sign permits under this division, unless
a sign is also subject to review under any other division or
section of this chapter or any other chapter of this Code,
including site plan and historic preservation ordinances. Where a
sign requires such other review, the time periods set forth in the
ordinance for that review process shall control.
(a) Applications. All applications for sign permits of any
kind shall be submitted to the department on an
application form or in accordance with application
specifications published by the department.
(b) Fees. Each application for a sign permit shall be
accompanied by the applicable fees, which shall be
established by the council order.
(c) Action on sign permit application. Within ten (10)
working days of receipt of a complete application, the
department shall either:
1. Issue the sign permit, if the sign that is the
subject of the application conforms in every
respect with the requirements of this division; or
2. Deny the sign permit if the sign that is the
subject of the application fails in any way to
conform with the requirements of this division. In
the event of a denial, the department shall set
forth in writing the reasons for the denial.
(d) Permits to construct or modify signs. Signs identified
with the notation “B” on Table 1 shall be erected,
installed or created only in accordance with a duly
issued and valid sign construction permit issued by the
department. Such permits shall be issued only in
accordance with the requirements and procedures of
subsection (f) of this section.
(e) Application for new sign or for sign modification. An
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-368.5 Rev.7-19-10
14-577
application for construction, creation or installation of
a new sign or for modification of an existing sign shall
be accompanied by drawings to show the dimensions,
design, source of illumination, construction method and
location of each particular sign. One (1) application and
construction permit may include more than one (1) sign on
the same lot.
(f) Assignability of sign permits. A current and valid sign
permit issued under this division shall be freely
assignable to a successor as owner of the property or
operator of the premises. The assignment shall not
require approval by the department. This provision shall
also apply to signs lawfully in existence on April 4,
1994, which are further subject to the provisions of
section 14-372.
(g) Issuance pursuant to level II site plan review. An
applicant for a permit or other approval under this
division whose application has been denied for failure to
meet the regulations contained in section 14-369.5 may
apply to the planning authority for review of the denied
signage pursuant to the standards set forth in section
14-526(d)8, provided, however, that no site plan fee
shall be required for this review and no site plan
submission materials shall be required beyond those
necessary to allow review under this section.
(Ord. No. 252-94, § 2, 4-4-94; Ord. No. 278-09/10, 7-19-10)
Sec. 14-369. Computations.
Sign area, sign height and number of signs shall be computed
in accordance with the following principals:
(a) Computation of area of individual signs: For all signs
other than awning signs, the area of a sign face shall be
computed by means of the smallest square, circle,
rectangle, triangle or simple polygon that will encompass
the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem
or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the
display, but not any supporting framework, bracing or
decorative fence or wall when such fence is clearly
incidental to the display itself.
(b) Computation of area of multifaced signs: The sign area
for a sign with more than one (1) face shall be computed
by adding together the area of all sign faces visible
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-369 Rev.4-9-94
14-578
from any one (1) point. When two (2) identical sign faces
are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be
viewed from any point at the same time and when such sign
faces are part of the same sign structure and are not
more than forty-two (42) inches apart, the sign shall be
computed by the measurement of one (1) of the faces.
(c) Computation of area of awning signs:
1. For opaque awnings, only those sections which
incorporate writing, symbols, emblems or other
types of graphics used for the purposes of
identification or advertisement shall be included
in computing sign area. The methods set forth in
subsection (1) of this section shall be utilized in
measuring sign area on opaque awnings. Street names
and numbers on opaque awnings shall not be
considered to be signs for purposes of this
section, unless a business located within the
building has the street name and/or the street
number as its name.
2. For awnings that are translucent and internally
illuminated and that incorporate any commercial
message, trademark or symbol, the sign area shall
be computed as the two-dimensional projection of
the awning onto the face of the building on which
the awning is to be installed. Such awnings which
wrap around building corner(s) shall be treated as
separate awnings on each respective building face
and shall be considered as signs if they include
any message, trademark or symbol. Internally
illuminated bands shall be permitted across the
building face without being included in the
calculations under this subsection, provided that
such bands do not include any message, trademark or
symbol and that the bands do not exceed three (3)
feet in height.
3. Where only a portion of the awning is translucent
and internally illuminated, only the area of the
translucent illuminated portion shall be included
in computing sign area, unless commercial message
content appears on other opaque portion(s) of the
awning. Opaque portions of these types of awnings
shall be computed in accordance with subsection a.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-369 Rev.4-9-94
14-579
above.
(d) Computation of height: The height of a sign shall be
computed as the distance from the base of the sign at
normal grade to the top of the highest attached component
of the sign. Normal grade shall be considered the lower
of either existing grade prior to construction or the
newly established grade after construction excluding any
filling, berming, mounding or excavating accomplished
solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases
where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined,
sign height shall be computed based upon the assumption
that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the
sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of
the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at
the principal entrance to the principal structure on the
lot, whichever is lower.
(e) Computation of number of signs: For purposes of computing
the number of signs, a single sign shall be considered
either enclosed within a single frame or composed of
modular parts with identical frame elements designed to
be joined together to form a single composite sign.

improvements do not require replacement of the nonconforming sign:
1. Level III site plan review is sought for any new
structures or building additions on the site, except as
provided in subsection (5).
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-372 Rev.7-19-10
14-607
2. A building permit is sought for a rehabilitation of a
building where the value of the rehabilitation exceeds
fifty (50) percent of the assessed value of the building,
or one hundred thousand dollars ($100,00.00), whichever
is less, provided that where rehabilitation is of a
multi-tenant building, only the tenant or tenants whose

for a change in the message panel only, unless otherwise
required to conform under this section. Repair of sudden
and accidental damage shall not include replacement of
the entire sign, which shall be treated as a modification
under this subsection. Letters on nonconforming signs
designed for changeable messages may be changed without
triggering the terms of this subsection as long as no
other change is made to the sign. Replacement of an
awning covering with substantially the same material and
text shall also not be considered a modification.
5. In the case of nonconforming freestanding joint
identification signs for multi-tenant properties, signs
may be added or modified to reflect a change in
individual tenants without triggering the terms of this
subsection, provided that the degree of nonconformity is
not increased. In the case of building signs on
multi-tenant properties, this subsection shall apply only
to the individual business tenant that is adding or
modifying a sign or seeking level III site plan review
and shall not trigger the conformance requirement for

DIVISION 22.5. ADULT BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS*
*Cross reference(s)—Amusements, Ch. 4.
Sec. 14-373. Findings and purpose.
The council hereby finds that, because of their unique and
potentially offensive nature, adult business establishments can
have a blighting influence on the surrounding neighborhood if
permitted at all in certain zones, or if allowed to concentrate in
certain other zones, within the city. Moreover, such establishments
are incompatible with uses characterized by family and
youth-related activities. The purpose of this division is,
therefore, to prevent such deleterious effects and, thus, protect
the public health, safety, and general welfare by regulating the
location and certain other aspects of adult business
establishments.

Sec. 14-374. Definitions.
Except as provided herein or in section 14-47, all words used
in this division shall have their common meanings unless the
context clearly implies otherwise.
Adult business establishment means and includes any retail

operation of any adult amusement device as defined in
section 4-16; or
(b) Customarily exhibits motion pictures or displays any
other visual representation described or advertised as
being “X-rated” or “for adults only,” or which
customarily excludes persons from any portion of the
premises by reason of immaturity of age by the use of
such, or similar, phrases; or
(c) Is adjudged to be in violation of 17 M.R.S.A. §§ 2911,
2912.
Customarily means more often than an average of one (1)
calendar week during any calendar month of operation.

Cross reference(s)—Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 14-375. Adult business establishments permitted; special
requirements.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article,
adult business establishments shall be permitted only in the B-2
and B-3 zones, provided that such establishments, but for this
division, would otherwise be permitted therein, and subject to the
following special requirements:
1. Such establishment shall be at least one thousand (1,000)
feet from any other adult business establishment, and at
least five hundred (500) feet from any residential zone,
as measured in a straight line, without regard to
intervening structures or objects;

DIVISION 23. NONCONFORMING USE AND NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS
Sec. 14-381. Continuation.
Any building, structure, lots, or use, that were legally existing
at the time of its creation and made nonconforming by the
provisions of this ordinance or any amendment thereto may be
continued although such use does not conform with the provisions of
this ordinance.
(Code 1968, § 602.17.A; Order No. 222-17/18, 6-4-2018)
Sec. 14-382. Increase in nonconforming use of structure or
alterations to nonconforming structures limited.
(a) A lawful nonconforming non-residential structure may be
maintained, repaired, or reconstructed in kind within a one (1)
year period or within a two (2) year period for a lawful
nonconforming residential structure, but no alterations,
modifications or additions shall be made to it, except as provided
in this division, and as permitted in 14-436, Building extensions.
(b) A building whose use is wholly nonconforming shall not be
altered so as to increase the cubical content or the degree of
nonconformity.
(c) No alterations, modifications or additions shall be made
so as to increase the cubical content or the degree of
nonconforming use, nor shall a nonconforming use be extended to any
other part of such building, unless such part was clearly arranged
and designed for such nonconforming use prior to June 5, 1957, or
such extension of a nonconforming use is solely for the purpose of
bringing the use into compliance with health or safety codes, or to
correct a condition that may not technically be in violation but
which is determined by the board of appeals to constitute a health
or safety problem. In either case, the expansion shall be limited
to the minimum necessary to accomplish that purpose.
(d) Alteration, modification or addition may be made to a
building which is lawfully nonconforming as to space and bulk or
any dimensional requirement where the proposed changes in existing
exterior walls and/or roofs would be within the space occupied by
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-382 Rev. 6-4-2018
14-611
the existing shell of the building, and would not create any new
nonconformity nor increase any existing nonconformity, except as
provided in this Division, and as permitted under 14-436, Building
extensions. This subsection shall not apply to buildings located
within shoreland zones and existing on June 15, 1992, which are
nonconforming only as to setbacks from wetlands, tributary streams
or other water bodies, which shall be regulated in accordance with
subsection (f) of this section.
(e) Except as expressly provided herein, any alteration,
modification or addition permitted under this section shall be in
compliance with all other applicable sections of this chapter.
Nothing within this section shall be construed to permit an
increase in the number of nonconforming units in a building which
is nonconforming as to the number of dwelling units or will become
nonconforming as a result of such alteration, modification or
addition.
(f) Expansions. A non-conforming structure may be added to
or expanded after obtaining a permit from the same permitting
authority as that for a new structure, if such addition or
expansion does not increase the non-conformity of the structure and
is in accordance with the sections below.
1. After January 1, 1989, if any portion of a structure is
less than the required setback from the normal high water
line of a water body or tributary stream or the upland
edge of a wetland that portion of the structure shall not
be expanded, as measured in floor area or volume, by
thirty (30%) percent or more, during the lifetime of the
structure. If a replacement structure conforms with the
requirements of section 14-382, and is less than the
required setback from a water body, tributary stream or
wetland, the replacement structure may not be expanded if
the original structure existing on January 1, 1989 had
been expanded by thirty (30%) percent in floor area and
volume since that date.
2. Whenever a new, enlarged, or replacement foundation is
constructed under a non-conforming structure, the
structure and new foundation must be placed such that the
setback requirement is met to the greatest practical
extent as determined by building authority, basing its
decision the criteria specified in subsection (3) below.
If the completed foundation does not extend beyond the
exterior dimensions of the structure, except for
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-382 Rev. 6-4-2018
14-612
expansion in conformity with section (f) above, and the
foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated
by more than three (3) additional feet as measured from
the uphill side of the structure (from original ground
level to the bottom of the first floor sill), it shall
not be considered to be an expansion of the structure.
3. A nonconforming structure may be relocated within the
boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is
located, provided that the site of the relocation
conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest
practical extent as determined by the building authority,
and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the
present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the
requirements of state law, the State of Maine Subsurface
Wastewater Disposal Rules (Rules), or that a new system
can be installed in compliance with state law, such
rules, and all applicable sections of this Code. In no
event shall a structure be relocated in a manner that
causes the structure to be more nonconforming. In
determining whether the building relocation meets the
setback requirements to the greatest practical extent,
the building authority shall consider the size of the
lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil
erosion, the location of other structures on the property
and on adjacent properties, the location of septic system
and other on-site soils suitable for septic systems, the
type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish
the relocation. When it is necessary to remove
vegetation within the water or wetland setback are in
order to relocate a structure, the building authority
shall require replanting of native vegetation to
compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In addition,
the area from which the relocated structure was removed
must be replanted with vegetation. Replanting shall be
required as follows:
a. Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must
be replanted with at least one native tree, three
(3) feet in height, for every tree removed. If
more than five trees are planted, no one species of
tree shall make up more than fifty (50%) percent of
the number of trees planted. Replaced trees must
be planted no further from the water or wetland
than the trees that were removed.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-382 Rev. 6-4-2018
14-613
Other woody and herbaceous vegetation, and ground
cover, that are removed or destroyed in order to
relocate a structure must be re-established within
the setback area. The vegetation and/or ground
cover must consist of similar native vegetation
and/or ground cover that was disturbed, destroyed
or removed.
b. Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a
parcel the original location of the structure shall
be replanted with vegetation which may consist of
grasses, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof.
4. Buildings in existence on January 1, 1989, and located in
shoreland zones may be expanded once during the lifetime
of the structure up to twenty-five (25) feet toward a
freshwater wetland or tributary stream, provided that a
minimum setback of forty (40) feet is maintained and that
the existing floor area or volume is not increased by
more than thirty (30%) percent, and shall not create any
undue environmental impact or flood prone condition.

A lawful nonconforming use existing on premises outside of a
building shall not be extended to or allowed to occupy any part or
parts of such premises outside of the building.
(Code 1968, § 602.17.C; Ord. No. 354-85, § 3, 1-7-85)
Sec. 14-384. Change of nonconforming use.
A lawful nonconforming use in a structure designed for a use
permitted in the zone in which it is located shall not be changed
to any use other than a use permitted in the zone in which the
structure is located. When a nonconforming use in such a structure
has been changed to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be
changed back to any non-permitted use. For purposes of this
section, a use shall be deemed to have been so changed when an
existing nonconforming use shall have been terminated and a
permitted use shall have commenced and continued for a period of
seven (7) days. Any change of use in violation of this division
shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the lawfully existing
nonconforming use. A lawful nonconforming use in a structure not
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-384 Rev.9-19-74
14-614
designed for a use permitted in the zone in which it is located
shall not be changed to any use other than a use permitted in the
zone in which the use is located or to any use other than a
nonconforming use of a more restricted zone, as set forth in the
following schedule, provided that in no such case shall any
structural alterations be made in any building except those
required by law, ordinance or other regulations:
(a) In a business zone, from any use permitted in an
industrial zone to any use permitted in a business zone.
(b) In a B-1 zone, from any use permitted in a B-3 zone to
any use permitted in a B-2 zone.
(c) In a residence zone, from any use permitted in a B-2 zone
to any use permitted in a B-1 zone.
(d) In a residence zone, from any use permitted in any other
residence zone to any use permitted in a more restricted
residence zone. For the purpose of this subsection, an
R-6 zone shall be deemed the least restricted and an R-2
zone shall be deemed the most restricted, with the
intervening zones restricted in order of zone number.

Sec. 14-385. Restoration or reconstruction within an existing
footprint of damaged nonconforming structure.
A nonconforming structure damaged by fire, explosion, flood,
riot, act of the public enemy, accident of any kind, decay or
otherwise may be restored or rebuilt only where:
(a) The restoration or reconstruction is of a building which
is nonconforming only as to land area, setbacks or any
other dimensional requirements; and
(b) Where the restoration or reconstruction will occur
entirely within the existing footprint and previous shell
of the building and will not create a new nonconformity;
and
(c) Restoration or reconstruction occurs within one (1) year
for a nonconforming non-residential structure, or two (2)
years for a nonconforming residential structure, of the
initial damage where such damage is sudden and
accidental. Note that for buildings in SHoreland zones,
stte regulations may also govern and provide for a
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-385 Rev.2-4-13
14-615
shorter period for restoration or reconstruction of nonconforming
structures; and
(d) Restoration or reconstruction necessitated by decay must
be completed within one (1) year of the demolition of the
building or the commencement of the restoration or
reconstruction, whichever occurs first; and
(e) Any reconstruction, under this provision, in the
residential R-6 zone on a lot with 10,000 square feet or
less, other than the exact restoration of a previously
existing building on the site, shall comply with the
applicable standards contained within the Planning and
Development Design Manual; and
(f) A nonconforming building located in the R-6 which is
destroyed by fire, explosion, flood, riot, act of the
enemy, or accident may be rebuilt under the small
residential lot development provisions of the R-6 zone as
if the lot were vacant as of January 1, 2005 and such
reconstruction shall meet the setback requirements
contained therein to the extent practicable; otherwise
the building shall be reconstructed within the footprint
of the previously existing building such that any
nonconformity will not be enlarged.
For the purpose of this section, the footprint of a building is the
perimeter of the foundation supporting a structure.

If a legally nonconforming non-residential use is discontinued
for a period of twelve (12) months or if a legally nonconforming
residential use is discontinued for a period of twenty-four (24)
months, such discontinuance shall constitute an abandonment of the

land which is incidental or accessory to such nonconforming
structure shall be considered as being discontinued at the same
time as the nonconforming use of the structure. Note that for

(a) Purpose. The purpose of this provision is to
establish a process whereby certain dwellings which contain more
dwelling units than the number permitted by the applicable
provisions of the Land Use Code may be recognized as legal,
nonconforming uses. This provision shall not apply to rooming
units.
(b) Approval by Zoning Administrator.
1. Application. Application for validation of such nonconforming
dwelling units shall be on a form provided
by the Division of Housing and Neighborhood Services,
Inspection Services Office. The application fee will
be $300.00 for each dwelling unit which is the subject
of the application, and will be accompanied by: (i) a
plan, drawn to scale, which shows the location of the
building(s) on the lot, parking, easements, dumpsters,
fencing, public ways and any other significant feature
and (ii) a floor plan for each unit in the dwelling,
whether or not it is the subject of the application.
(c) Eligibility. In order for a nonconforming dwelling unit to
be validated by administrative action of the Zoning
Administrator as authorized herein, the Zoning
Administrator must find, based on competent evidence,
supported by public records, that:
1. The nonconforming dwelling units were either in
existence April 1, 1995, or the structure in which
they are located was originally designed to
accommodate more than the number of such units
presently in use.
2. The applicant neither constructed nor established the
non-conforming dwelling units.
3. The nonconforming dwelling units comply with or can be
made to comply with current standards of the National

units is located in the R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 or R-7
Zones; or the B-1, B-1(b), B-2, B-2(b) or B-3 Zones.
6. In the absence of legally competent evidence,
supported by records, (such as, but not limited to,
Assessor’s records, purchase and sale agreements,
affidavits, deeds, mortgages, as well as reliable
secondary sources, such as the Portland Director),
that the conditions of subsections c(1), C(2), c(3),
c(4), or c(5) can be met, the Zoning Administrator may
not approve the application, but shall advise the
applicant that the matter may be appealed to the Board
of Appeals.
(d) Notice to Abutters. Upon receipt of a completed
application, the Zoning Administrator will provide both the
owners of abutting properties as well as the owners of
property situated within 300 feet of the structure of the
essential information contained in the application, along
with a notice that they may object to the Zoning
Administrator’s acting on the application and require the
applicant to appeal to the Board of Appeals. The notice
shall be in conspicuous type and advise the abutters and
owners of property within 300 feet that any objection must
be submitted in writing to the Zoning Administrator within
ten (10) days of the date of the notice sent to them.
The failure of any property owner to receive the notice
described above shall not invalidate any action by the
Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall
promptly notify the applicant of receipt of the objection,
that the Zoning Administrator is without authority to
proceed and advise the applicant that, within 30 days from
receipt of the letter, an application may be filed to have
the matter reviewed by the Board of Appeals as a
conditional use.

nonconforming dwelling unit which has been recognized
as a lawful, nonconforming use, the Zoning
Administrator will issue a certificate of occupancy.
(f) Disapproval of Application. In the event the application
is not approved by the Zoning Administrator or in the event
of a timely objection filed by a person qualified herein to

from the decision of the Zoning Administrator or objection,
may appeal the matter to the Board of Appeals as a
conditional use.

application for a conditional use (§14-474) applying the
standards applicable to conditional uses as well as the
requirements of this section.

decisions under this section neither the Zoning
Administrator nor the Board of Appeals shall apply the
dimensional or parking requirements which would otherwise
apply in the zones where the nonconforming dwelling units
are situated.

rooming units (§14-47), but shall apply to efficiency
apartments (§6-110(b)).

abutting any portion of a street which is unimproved or improved
but not permanently paved, the following shall occur: (1) A plan of

hereby. The provisions of this subsection (b) shall not apply to
the erection of any single-family dwelling on any lot where the
owner of the lot establishes that he or she was the owner of that

her personal residence.

(b) Procedure. Application for a setback reduction shall be
submitted to the building inspections division. A payment of a
nonrefundable application fee, as established from time to time by
order of the city council to cover administrative costs, shall
accompany each application. The application shall be in such form
as prescribed by the zoning administrator and shall contain at
least the following information and documentation:
1. The name and address of the applicant and his or her
interest in the subject property;
2. The name and address of the owner, if different from the
applicant;
3. The address or location and the city assessor’s chart,
block and lot number of the subject property;
4. The present use and zoning classification of the subject
property;
5. Plot plan showing sufficient information to indicate the
location of all structures existing and proposed in
relation to the lot lines. Such a plan must be prepared
by a state registered land surveyor. If, in the opinion
of the surveyor, sufficient monumentation is not
available, then a standard boundary survey will be
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-437 Rev. 11-15-1993
14-640
necessary to meet the requirements of this section.
(c) Purpose. The purpose of setback reductions is to validate
the sites of mislocated single-family, owner-occupied residential
structures and those structures accessory thereto, which are not
otherwise legally sited and which were in existence on November 15,
1993.
(d) Conditions for setback reductions. Setback reductions
which may be granted by the zoning administrator are subject to the
following conditions:
1. The sole use of the property is (and, if the application
should be granted, will remain) as a single-family
detached dwelling.
2. The property is located in R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6,
IR-1, IR-2, IR-3 or RP zones.
3. The reduction sought cannot be reduced by more than the
following:
IR-1, IR-2, IR-3, R-3, RP, R-1, R-2, R-4 and R-5 zones:
Front yard: Ten (10) feet
Rear yard: Ten (10) feet
Side yard: Five (5) feet
R-6 zone:
Front yard: Five (5) feet
Rear yard: Ten (10) feet
Side yard: Five (5) feet
4. No relief may be granted under this section in cases
where the building authority determines that the setback
violation was the result of a willful act by either the
applicant or a prior owner.
5. This section shall only apply to the inadvertent
misplacement of a structure.

(Ord. No. 138-93, 11-15-93)
Sec. 14-438. Setback reductions for porches and other similar
uses.
(a) Porches, decks and sheds which are accessory to
single-family dwellings built five (5) years prior to the date of
application will be eligible for setback reductions as provided in
this section. Such structures are not subject to the limitations in
section 14-437, must be set back two (2) feet from the rear and
side property lines, and must comply with the front yard setback
required for the applicable zone. A reduced setback may be
permitted only when the applicant can show that there will be no
development within the setback required by the zoning ordinance on
adjacent property which abuts the area for which a reduced setback
is sought. The applicant will demonstrate compliance with the above
requirement by providing an affidavit from the abutting property
owner stating that the area in question will never be developed.
Reduced setbacks will not be permitted when the area proposed for
such setbacks abuts either city or state owned property. No setback
reduction may be granted which would permit any structure on the
lot which is the subject of the application to be within fifteen
(15) feet of any existing residential structure on an adjacent lot.
(b) Recording of setback reduction. The zoning administrator
shall provide a signed instrument in recordable form, indicating
any setback reduction granted under the terms of this section. The
applicant for such reduction shall be responsible for recording
this instrument in the Cumberland County Registry of Deeds. The
abutter’s affidavit will also be recorded.

and as set forth below if at least one (1) of the following
conditions exists:
(a) The property is encumbered by an easement or right-of-way
that substantially impedes or prohibits development;
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-439 Rev.3-17-1997
14-642
(b) The yard for which the setback reduction is sought abuts
an easement or right-of-way area that prohibits buildings
within the area of such easement or right-of-way; or
(c) The yard for which the setback reduction is sought abuts
an area whose natural features, such as slopes or
drainage areas, prohibit development in such area.
The Planning Board may reduce the required setback to the
extent necessary for development, but in no event shall any side or
rear setback be reduced to less than ten (10) feet or any front
setback be reduced to less than five (5) feet. The Planning Board
may require increased buffering to mitigate the impacts of a
setback reduction under this section. This section shall not apply
to reductions of setbacks required by division 26 of this chapter.
The planning authority shall be responsible for providing to
the applicant for setback reduction an instrument signed by the
chair or vice-chair of the Planning Board, indicating any setback
reduction granted under the terms of this section. The applicant
for such setback reduction shall be responsible for recording this
instrument in the Cumberland County Registry of Deeds within sixty
(60) days of the Planning Board’s grant of the reduction. Failure
to record such instrument within the required time period shall
render the reduction null and void.

Sec. 14-440. Exterior egress.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the building
authority may permit the installation of an exterior egress stair
or an upgrade of an existing exterior fire escape for a conforming
or lawfully nonconforming dwelling unit existing as of January 5,
1998, if such egress is required to meet current fire or other life
safety codes, provided that the owner demonstrates to the building
authority that:
(a) There is no practical and economically reasonable way to
provide such egress within the interior of the building,
as demonstrated by the submission of detailed floor plans
showing the projected cost of and the impact on the
existing dwelling from an interior stair;
(b) The stairway and associated landings and other building
fixtures are designed and will be constructed to have a
minimal visual impact upon the building, especially as

viewed from any public way or public open space, as
demonstrated by photographs of the front and any other
affected facades of the building and plans or drawings of
the proposed egress stairs;
(c) Reductions to setbacks granted under this section shall
be the least amount required to meet life safety code
requirements; and
(d) Exterior stairways on buildings subject to regulation
under article IX of this chapter shall require review and
approval under the provisions of that article.

than one hundred (100) square feet of floor area
shall be permitted with no setback, provided that
such structures shall be used only for the storage
of fish, bait, and related equipment. No setback
shall be required for piers, docks, retaining
walls, or any other structures which require direct
access to the water as an operational necessity.
2. Development activities within the shoreland zone
are reviewed by the Zoning Administrator for
compliance with required setbacks of this Division.
Submission of plans for such development activity
shall be prepared by competent professionals, based
upon a boundary survey.
3. The lowest floor elevation or openings of all
buildings and structures including basements shall
be elevated at least one (1) foot above the
elevation of the one hundred (100) year flood, the
flood of record, or in the absence of these, the
flood as defined by soil types identified as recent
flood plain soils.

a. The structure is limited to a maximum of four
(4) feet in width;
b. The structure does not extend below or over
the normal high water line of a water body or
upland edge of a wetland, unless permitted by
the department of environmental protection
pursuant to 38 M.R.S.A. Section 480-C; and
c. The applicant demonstrates that no reasonable
access alternative exists on the property.
(b) Piers, docks, wharves, bridges and other structures and
uses extending over or below the normal high water line
of a water body or within a wetland:
1. Access from shore shall be developed on soils
appropriate for such use and constructed so as to
control erosion;
2. The location shall not interfere with existing
developed or natural beach areas;
3. The facility shall be located so as to minimize
adverse effects on fisheries;
4. The facility shall be no larger in dimension than
necessary to carry on the activity and shall be
consistent with surrounding character and uses;
5. New permanent structures, and expansions thereof,
projecting into or over water bodies shall require
a permit from the Department of Environmental
Protection pursuant to the national Resources
Protection Act, 38 M.R.S.A. § 480-C. Permits may
also be required from the Army Corps of Engineers
if located in navigable waters.
6. Except in the W-C, EWP, W-PD, and I-B zones, no new
structure shall be built on, over or abutting a
pier, wharf, dock or other structure extending
beyond the normal high water line of a water body

or within a wetland shall be converted to
residential dwelling units in any zone.
(c) Clearing or removal of vegetation:
1. In all shoreland areas in resource protection
zones, the cutting or removal of vegetation shall
be limited to that which is necessary for uses
expressly authorized in that zone.
2. The clearing or removal of vegetation standards of
this section shall not apply to the following
zones: EWP, WCZ, WPD, B-3, B-5, B-5b, B-6, B-7, I-L
(south and east of I-295) and I-M zones (south and
east of I-295).
3. Other than cutting or removal of vegetation as
provided for in this section, timber harvesting
shall not be permitted. For purposes of this
section, timber harvesting is defined as the
cutting and removal of timber for the primary
purpose of selling or processing forest products.
The cutting or removal of trees in the shoreland
zone on a lot that has less than (2) acres within
the shoreland zone shall not be considered timber
harvesting. Cutting or removal of such trees shall
be regulated pursuant to this section.
4. For purposes of this section, vegetation is defined
as all live trees, shrubs and other plants
including without limitation, trees both over and
under 4 inches in diameter, measured at 4 ½ feet
above ground level.
a. In all areas other than resource protection
zones, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be
preserved, except where clearance is required
for development of permitted uses, within a
strip of land extending seventy-five (75)
feet, horizontal distance, from the normal
high-water or upland edge of a coastal
wetland, river, stream or tributary stream
within a shoreland zone, in accordance with

the following:
i. There shall be no cleared opening greater
than two hundred fifty (250) square feet
in the forest canopy or other existing
vegetation if a forested canopy is not
presented as measured from the outer
limits of the tree or shrub crown.
Notwithstanding this limitation, a
footpath not to exceed six (6) feet in
width as measured between tree trunks
and/or shrub stems is allowed provided
that a cleared line of sight to the water
through the buffer strip is not created.
ii. Selective cutting of trees within the
buffer strip is allowed provided that a
well-distributed stand of trees and other
vegetation is maintained. For the
purposes of this section, a
“well-distributed stand of trees”
adjacent to a water body, tributary
stream or wetland shall be defined as
maintaining a minimum rating score of
sixteen (16) or more in any
twenty-five-foot by fifty-foot rectangle
area as determined by the following
rating system:
Diameter of tree at four and one-half (4
½ ) feet above ground level
(Inches)
Points
2 = 4 . . . . . . . . . . . 1
4 = 8 . . . . . . . . . . . 2
8 — 12 . . . . . . . . . . 4
12 in. or greater . . . . . 8
The following shall govern in applying this
point system:
a. The 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-449 Rev. 3-7-2016
14-649
plots must be established where the
landowner or lessee proposes
clearing within the required buffer;
b. Each successive plot must be
adjacent to, but not overlap a
previous plot;
c. Any plot not containing the required
points must have no vegetation
removed except as otherwise allowed
by this ordinance;
d. Any plot containing the required
points may have vegetation removed
down to the minimum points required
or as otherwise allowed by this
ordinance;
e. Where conditions permit, no more
than 50% of the points on any 25-
foot by 50-foot rectangular area may
consist of trees greater than 12
inches in diameter.
For the purposes of this section, “other
natural vegetation” is defined as retaining
existing vegetation under three (3) feet in
height and other ground cover and retaining at
least five (5) saplings less than two (2)
inches in diameter at four and one-half (4
½)feet above ground level for each 25-foot by
50-foot rectangular area. If five samplings
do not exist, no woody stems less than two (2)
inches in diameter can be removed until 5
samplings have been recruited into the plot.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more
than forty (40%) percent of the total volume
of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter,
measured at four and one-half (4 ½) feet above
ground level may be removed in any ten-year
period.
iii. In order to protect water quality and
wildlife habitat, existing vegetation
under three (3) feet in height and other
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-449 Rev. 3-7-2016
14-650
groundcover, including leaf litter and
the forest duff layer, shall not be cut,
covered, or removed, except to provide a
footpath or other permitted uses as
described in this section.
iv. Pruning of tree branches on the bottom
one-third of the tree is allowed.
v. In order to maintain a buffer strip of
vegetation when the removal of
storm-damaged, diseased, unsafe or dead
trees results in the creation of cleared
openings, these openings shall be
replanted with native tree species unless
existing new tree growth is present.
The provisions contained in subsection b. of this
section shall not apply to those portions of public
recreational facilities adjacent to public swimming
areas. Cleared areas in these locations shall be
limited to the minimum amount necessary.
2. Selective cutting of not more than forty (40%)
percent of the volume of trees four (4) inches or
more in diameter, measured four and one-half (4
1/2) feet above ground level, shall be allowed
within any ten-year period at distances greater
than seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance,
from the normal high water line of any other water
body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a
wetland, except to allow for the development of
permitted uses. Tree removal in conjunction with
the development of permitted uses shall be included
in the forty (40) percent calculation. For the
purposes of these standards, volume may be
considered to be equivalent to basal area. In no
event shall cleared openings for any purpose,
including but not limited to, principal and
accessory structures, driveways, lawns and sewage
disposal areas, exceed in the aggregate twenty-five
(25%) percent of the lot area within the shoreland
zone, including land previously cleared.
3. Legally existing nonconforming cleared openings may
be maintained but shall not be enlarged, except as
allowed by this division.

4. Fields and other cleared openings which have
reverted to primarily shrubs, trees, or other woody
vegetation shall be regulated under the provisions
of this section.
(d) Erosion and sedimentation control:
1. All activities which involve filling, grading,
excavation or other similar activities which result
in unstabilized soil conditions and which require a
permit shall require a written soil erosion and
sedimentation control plan in accordance with Maine
Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for
Construction: Best Management Practices, published
by the Cumberland County Soil and Water
Conservation District and the Maine Department of
Environmental Protection and the City of Portland
Technical Manual. The plan shall be submitted to
the permitting authority for approval and shall
include, where applicable, provisions for:
a. Mulching and revegetation of disturbed soil.
b. Temporary runoff control features such as hay
bales, silt fencing or diversion ditches.
c. Permanent stabilization structures such as
retaining walls or riprap.
2. In order to create the least potential for erosion,
development shall be designed to fit with the
topography and soils of the site. Areas of steep
slopes where high cuts and fills may be required
shall be avoided wherever possible, and natural
contours shall be followed as closely as possible.
3. Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall
apply to all aspects of the proposed project
involving land disturbance, and shall be in
operation during all stages of the activity. The
amount of exposed ground area at every phase of
construction shall be minimized to reduce the
potential for erosion.
4. Any exposed ground area shall be temporarily or
permanently stabilized within one (1) week from the
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-449 Rev. 3-7-2016
14-652
time it was last actively worked, by use of riprap,
sod, seed, and mulch, or other effective measures.
In all cases, permanent stabilization shall occur
within nine (9) months of initial exposure. The
following standards shall also be met:
a. Where mulch is used, it shall be applied at a
rate of at least one (1) bale per five hundred
(500) square feet and shall be maintained
until a catch of vegetation is established.
b. Anchoring the mulch with netting, peg and
twine or other suitable method may be required
to maintain the mulch cover.
c. Additional measures shall be taken where
necessary in order to avoid siltation into the
water. Such measures may include the use of
staked hay bales and/or silt fences.
5. Natural and man-made drainage ways and drainage
outlets shall be protected from erosion from water
flowing through them. Drainage ways shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with the
City of Portland Technical Manual.
(e) Soils: All land uses shall be located on soils in or upon
which the proposed uses or structures can be established
or maintained without causing adverse environmental
impacts, including severe erosion, mass soil movement,
improper drainage, and water pollution, either during or
after construction. Proposed uses requiring subsurface
wastewater disposal and commercial or industrial
development or other similar intensive land uses shall
require a soils report based on an on-site investigation
and prepared by state-certified professionals. Certified
persons may include Maine Certified Soil Scientists,
Maine Registered Professional Engineers, Maine State
Certified Geologists and other persons who have training
and experience in the recognition and evaluation of soil
properties. The report shall be based upon the analysis
of the characteristics of the soil and surrounding land
and water areas, maximum ground water elevation, presence
of ledge, drainage conditions, and other pertinent data
which the evaluator deems appropriate. The soils report
shall include recommendations for a proposed use to
counteract soil limitations where they exist.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-449 Rev. 3-7-2016
14-653
(f) Water quality: No activity shall deposit on or into the
ground or discharge to the waters of the state any
pollutant that by itself or in combination with other
activities or substances will impair designated uses or
the water classification of the water body, tributary
stream or wetland.
(g) Archaeological sites: Any proposed land use activity
involving structural development or soil disturbance on
or adjacent to sites listed on, or eligible to be listed
on, the National Register of Historic Places, as
determined by the department of planning and urban
development, shall be submitted by the applicant to the
Maine Historic Preservation Commission for review and
comment at least twenty (20) days prior to action being
taken by the Planning Authority. The Planning Authority
shall consider comments received from the commission
prior to rendering a decision on the application. Such
sites shall also comply with all applicable provisions of
article IX of this chapter.
(h) Installation of public utility service: No public utility
of any kind shall install services to any new structure
located in the shoreland zone unless written
authorization attesting to the validity and currency of
all local permits required under this Code has been
issued by the appropriate municipal authorities.
Following installation of service, the public utility
shall forward the written authorization to the
appropriate municipal authorities, indicating that
installation has been completed.
(i) Essential services:
1. Where feasible, the installation of essential
services shall be limited to existing public ways
and existing service corridors.
2. The installation of essential services, other than
road-side distribution lines and within existing
service corridors, is not allowed in a Resource
Protection or Stream Protection District, except
where the applicant demonstrates that no reasonable
alternative exists.
3. Damaged or destroyed public utility transmission
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-449 Rev. 3-7-2016
14-654
and distribution lines, towers and related
equipment may be replaced or reconstructed without
a permit.
(j) Roads and driveways:
1. Roads and driveways shall be setback a minimum of
seventy-five (75) feet from the normal high-water
or upland edge of a coastal wetland, freshwater
wetland, river or tributary stream within a
shoreland zone, except:
a. In the EWP, WC, WPD, B-3, B-5, B-5b, I-L
(south and east of I-295) and I-M (south and
east of I-295) roads and driveways shall be
setback as established for structures in those
zones; as specified in Sec. 14-449(a)1.
b. Where the planning board determines that no
other reasonable alternative exists. If no
other reasonable alternative exists, the
planning board may reduce the road and/or
driveway setback requirement to no less than
fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, upon
clear showing by the applicant that
appropriate techniques will be used to prevent
sedimentation of the water body, tributary
stream or wetland. Such techniques may
include, but are not limited to, the
installation of settling basins, and/or
effective use of additional ditch relief
culverts and turnouts place so as to avoid
sedimentation of the water body, tributary
stream or wetland.
2. Existing public roads may be expanded within the
legal road right of way regardless of their setback
from a waterbody, tributary stream or wetland.
3. New roads and driveways are prohibited in a
Resource Protection Zone except that the planning
board may grant a permit to construct a road or
driveway to provide access to permitted uses within
the district. A road or driveway may also be
approved by the planning board in a Resource
Protection Zone, upon a finding that no reasonable
alternative route or location is available outside
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-449 Rev. 3-7-2016
14-655
the district. When a roadway or driveway is
permitted in a Resource Protection District the
road and/or driveway shall be setback as far as
practicable from the normal high-water line of a
water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of
wetland.
4. Road and driveways banks shall be no steeper than
slope of two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical,
and shall be graded and stabilized in accordance
with the provisions for erosion and sedimentation
control contained in sec. 14-449(d).
5. Road and driveway grades shall be no grater than
ten (10%) percent except segments of less than two
hundred (200) feet.
6. In order to prevent road and driveway surface
drainage from directly entering water bodies,
tributary streams or wetlands, roads and driveways
shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to
empty onto an unscarified buffer strip at least
(50) feet plus two times the average slope, in
width between the outflow point of the ditch or
culver and the normal high-water line of a water
body, tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland.
Surface drainage which is directed to an
unscarified buffer strip shall be diffused or
spread out to promote infiltration of the runoff
and to minimize channelized flow of the drainage
through the buffer strip.
7. Ditch relief (cross drainage) culverts, drainage
dips and water turnout shall be installed in a
manner effective in directing drainage onto
unscarified buffer strips before the flow gains
sufficient volume or head to erode the road,
driveway, or ditch. To accomplish this, the
following shall apply:
a. Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and
associated water turnouts shall be spaced
along the road, or driveway at intervals no
greater than indicated in the following
table:
Grade (percent) Spacing (feet)

b. Drainage dips may be used in place of ditch
relief culverts only where the grade is ten
(10%) percent or less.
c. On sections having slopes greater than ten
(10%) percent, ditch relief culverts shall
be placed at approximately a thirty (30)
degree angle downslope from a line
perpendicular to the centerline of the road
or driveway.
d. Ditch relief culverts shall be sufficiently
sized and properly installed in order to
allow for effective functioning, and their
inlet and outlet ends shall be stabilized
with appropriate materials.
8. Ditches, culverts, bridges, dips, water turnouts
and other storm water runoff control
installations associated with roads and driveways
shall be maintained on a regular basis to assure

City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-450.1 Rev. 11-16-1998
14-660
The City of Portland, Maine, elects to comply with the 42 USC
Section 4001 et seq. requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Act of 1968, as amended from time to time. The National Flood
Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid act, provides that
areas of the city having a special flood hazard be identified by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency and that flood plain
management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas. This
division establishes a flood hazard development permit system and
review procedure for development activities in the designated flood
hazard areas of the city.
(Ord. No. 660-86, 7-7-86; Ord. No. 579-87, 6-15-87; Ord. No. 156-98, 11-16-98)
Sec. 14-450.2. Purposes.
The purposes of this division are to reduce future flood risks
and losses, protect against financial and human loss resulting from
flood disasters, and to control the placement of structures,
construction materials, and methods used to minimize potential
property damage due to flooding.
(Ord. No. 660-86, 7-7-86; Ord. No. 579-87, 6-15-87; Ord. No. 156-98, 11-16-98)
Sec. 14-450.3. Applicability.
This division applies to all land areas, uses, structures, and
land use activities lying in the special flood hazard areas as
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a report
entitled “Flood Insurance Study — City of Portland, Maine, County
of Cumberland,” with accompanying “flood insurance rate map” and
“flood boundary and floodway map,” dated July 17, 1986. This Flood
Insurance Study with accompanying maps, and any subsequent
amendments thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to
be a part of this Code.

City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-450.5 Rev. 3-7-2016
14-661
For the purpose of this division, the following terms and
words shall have the meanings given herein:
Area of special flood hazard: The land in the flood plain
having a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given
year as specifically identified in the Flood Insurance Study cited
in section 14-450.3.
Base flood: The flood having a one (1) percent chance of being
hereof or exceeded in any given year (i.e., a one-hundred-year
storm).
Building Authority: The Department of Permitting and
Inspections.
Coastal high hazard area: The area subject to high velocity
waters, including but not limited to, hurricane wave wash or
tsunamis. The area is designated on the flood insurance rate map as
zone V1-30.
Development: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to, the construction of,
alteration or addition to, any buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling
operations, or storage of equipment or materials.
Floodproofing: Any combination of structural or nonstructural
additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or
eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real estate, to
water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.
Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than one (1) foot as designated on the flood
boundary and floodway map. When not designated on the flood
boundary and floodway map, it is considered to be the channel of a
river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas to a
distance of one-half (1/2) the width of the flood plain, as
measured from the normal high water mark to the upland limit of the
flood plain.
Flood boundary and floodway map: The official map issued by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on which the
boundaries of the flood have been designated. (This may
alternatively be referred to as a flood hazard boundary map.)
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-450.5 Rev. 3-7-2016
14-662
Flood insurance rate map: The official map (FIRM) on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated both the
areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable
to the city.
Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure,
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage,
in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a
building’s lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built
so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable
nonelevation design requirements of this division.
Manufactured home or housing: As defined in section 14-47
(definitions) of this Code.
Mean high tide: The mean height of tidal high waters at a
particular point or station over a period of time to such length
that increasing its length does not appreciably change this mean.
For tidal waters, the cycle of change covers a period of nineteen
(19) years, and mean high tide is defined as the average of the
high waters over a nineteen-year period.
Mean sea level: For purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or
other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on the city’s
FIRM are referenced.
Structure: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or
liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, or
manufactured housing. “Principally above ground,” as used above,
means either that at least two-thirds (2/3) of its floor-to-ceiling
height is above the average adjoining ground level, or at least
fifty-one (51) percent of the actual cash value of the structure,
less land value, is above ground.
Substantial improvement: Any repair, reconstruction, addition
to or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure
either before the improvement or repair is started or, if the
structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage
occurred. For purposes of this definition “substantial improvement”
is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-450.5 Rev. 3-7-2016
14-663
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions or for any alteration of
a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a
state inventory of historic places.

fraud or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances; and
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-450.6 Rev.11-16-1998
14-683
3. A showing that the issuance of the variance will not
conflict with other state, federal or local laws or
ordinances; and

restoration will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
(f) Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
1. The criteria of this section and section 14-450.8 are

the base flood level will result in greatly increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high
as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars
($100.00) of insurance coverage;
2. Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property; and

Sec. 14-451. Purposes.
The purposes of the S-P stream protection zone are to preserve
and protect significant streams as defined in 38 M.R.S.A. Section
438-A(1) by providing a buffer from land development activities in
order to conserve stream channel capacity and to minimize siltation
and stream bank erosion.

The S-P stream protection zone includes all land areas within
seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high
water line of a stream as shown on the City of Portland Zoning Map.
The regulations set forth in this division shall not apply to a
stream and its associated shoreland area when they are also located
in an area designated as a shoreland zone. Streams located within
shoreland zones shall be subject to the provisions of division 26.
(Ord. No. 15-92, § 30, 6-15-92)
Sec. 14-453. Development standards.
(a) Minimum building setback from normal high water line of
stream: Seventy-five (75) feet. Notwithstanding this requirement,
when a lot is a lot of record as defined in section 14-433 or
cannot otherwise meet the setback requirement of this section due
to physical limitations of the site, the Planning Board may approve
a reduction of the setback requirement for a principal structure to
the least amount necessary to achieve a building dimension of
twenty-eight (28) feet, provided that the setback is not reduced to
less than forty (40) feet. Structures in existence on June 15,
1992, may be expanded once during the lifetime of the structure up
to twenty-five (25) feet toward a stream or tributary stream,
provided that the setback is not reduced to less than forty (40)
feet and the floor area or volume is not increased by more than
thirty (30) percent.
(b) Filling of material within a stream protection zone:
Filling of material within a stream protection zone shall require
site plan review in accordance with article V of this chapter.
(c) Minimum parking setback from normal high water line of
stream: Seventy-five (75) feet. Notwithstanding this
requirement, the Planning Board may reduce the parking setback
where the required setback cannot be met to the least extent
necessary, provided that such setback shall not be less than the
setback of the principal structure from the stream.

City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-472 Rev.7-1-1974
14-691
the grounds thereof. A payment of a nonrefundable filing

2. Public hearing. A public hearing shall be set, advertised
and conducted by the board of appeals in accordance with

3. Action by the board of appeals. Within thirty (30) days
following the close of the public hearing, the board of
appeals shall render a decision on the appeal in the

shall be deemed an approval of the appeal unless mutually
extended in writing by the appellant and the board.
Within five (5) days of such decision or failure to act
notice thereof shall be mailed by the secretary to each
party.
4. Right to grant variance in deciding appeals. In any case
where the notice is accompanied by an application for
variance in accordance with section 14-473(b)(1), the
board of appeals shall have the authority to grant, as
part of the relief, a variance, but only in strict
compliance with each provision of section 14-473 hereof.
5. Conditions and limitations on rights granted by appeal.
Any right granted by the board of appeals on appeal shall

(Code 1968, § 602.24.B; Ord. No. 437-74, 7-1-74)
Sec. 14-473. Variances.
(a) Authority. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
subsection (c)(3) and (c)(4), the board of appeals may authorize
variances from the provisions of this article as meet the
requirements of this division including but not limited to use
variance, dwelling unit conversion, space and bulk such as lot
size, density and side yard, parking, loading and signs.
(b) Procedure:
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-473 Rev.11-19-2012
14-692
1. Application. Application for a variance shall be
submitted to the building authority. A payment of a
nonrefundable application fee, as established from time
to time by the city council to cover administrative costs
and costs of a hearing, shall accompany each application.
The application shall be in such form as prescribed by
the building authority and contain at least the following
information and documentation:
a. The name and address of the applicant and his or
her interest in the subject property;
b. The name and address of the owner, if different
from the applicant;
c. The address or location of the subject property;
d. The present use and zoning classification of the
subject property;
e. Where the site plan approval is required by article
V of this chapter, a preliminary or final site plan
as defined by article V of this chapter;
f. The relief sought from the board of appeals.
2. Public hearing. A public hearing shall be set, advertised
and conducted by the board of appeals in accordance with
article VI of this chapter.
A copy of each variance request pertaining to division
26 (shoreland regulations) including the application
and all supporting information supplied by the
applicant, shall be forwarded by the municipal
officials to the Commission of the Department of
Environmental Protection at least twenty (20) days
prior to action by the board. Any comments received
from the Commissioner prior to action by the board
shall be made part of the record and shall be taken
into consideration by the board.
3. Action by board of appeals. Within thirty (30) days
following the close of the public hearing, the board of
appeals shall render its decision granting or denying the
variance, in the manner and form specified by article VI
of this chapter. The failure of the board to act within
thirty (30) days shall be deemed an approval of the
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-473 Rev.11-19-2012
14-693
variance unless mutually extended in writing by the
applicant and the board. Within seven (7) days of such
decision or the expiration of such period, the secretary
shall mail notice of such decision or failure to act to
the applicant.
(c) Conditions for variances:
1. Undue hardship required; defined. Except as provided in
subsection (2) below, a variance may be granted by the
board only where strict application of the ordinance, or
a provision thereof, to the petitioner and his property
would cause undue hardship. The words “undue hardship” as
used in this subsection mean:
a. That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable
return unless a variance is granted;
b. That the need for a variance is due to the unique
circumstances of the property and not to the
general conditions in the neighborhood;
c. That the granting of a variance will not alter the
essential character of the locality; and
d. That the hardship is not the result of action taken
by the applicant or a prior owner.
2. Disability variance: Notwithstanding the provisions of
subsection (c)(1) of this section, the board may grant a
variance to an owner of a residential dwelling for the
purpose of making that dwelling accessible to a person
with a disability who resides in or regularly uses the
dwelling. The board shall restrict any variance granted
under this subsection solely to the installation of
equipment or the construction of structures necessary for
access to or egress from the dwelling by the person with
the disability. The board may impose conditions on the
variance, including limiting the variance to the duration
of the disability or to the time that the person with the
disability lives in the dwelling. The term “structures
necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling”
shall include railing, wall or roof systems necessary for
the safety or effectiveness of the structure. For the
purpose of this subsection, a disability has the same
meaning as a physical or mental handicap under 5 M.R.S.A.
Section 4553.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-473 Rev.11-19-2012
14-694
3. Practical difficulty variance:
a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections
14-473(c)(1) and (2) of this section, the board of
appeals may grant a variance from the dimensional
standards of this article when strict application
of the provisions of the ordinance would create a
practical difficulty, as defined herein, and when
all the following conditions are found to exist:
1. The need for a variance is due to the unique
circumstances of the property, and not to the
general conditions in the neighborhood;
2. The granting of the variance will not produce
an undesirable change in the character of the
neighborhood and will not have an unreasonably
detrimental effect on either the use or fair
market value of abutting properties;
3. The practical difficulty is not the result of
action taken by the applicant or a prior
owner;
4. No other feasible alternative is available to
the applicant, except a variance;
5. The granting of a variance will not have an
unreasonably adverse effect on the natural
environment; and
6. The property is not located, in whole or in
part, within a shoreland area, as defined in
38 M.R.S.A. § 435, nor within a shoreland zone
or flood hazard zone, as defined in this
article.
b. The following words have the meanings set forth
below:
1. Dimensional standards: Those provisions of
this article which relate to lot area, lot
coverage, frontage, and setback requirements.
2. Practical difficulty: A case where strict
application of the dimensional standards of
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-473 Rev.11-19-2012
14-695
the ordinance to the property for which a
variance is sought would both preclude a use
of the property which is permitted in the zone
in which it is located and also would result
in significant economic injury to the
applicant.
3. Significant economic injury: The value of the
property if the variance were denied would be
substantially lower than its value if the
variance were granted. To satisfy this
standard, the applicant need not prove that
denial of the variance would mean the
practical loss of all beneficial use of the
land.
c. Except as modified above, the other provisions of
section 14-473 will apply to practical difficulty
variances, including, but not limited to, the
provisions of section 14-473(b)(2) (public
hearing), and section 14-473(d) (specified
variances prohibited).
d. A practical difficulty variance may not be used to
grant relief from the provisions of section 14-449
(land use standards), to increase either volume or
floor area, nor to permit the location of a
structure, including, but not limited to,
single-component manufactured homes, to be situated
on a lot in a way which is contrary to the
provisions of this article.
4. Specified variances prohibited:
a. No use permitted in medium- and high-density
residential districts shall be permitted in
low-density residential districts. No use permitted
in business districts shall be permitted in any
residential district. No use permitted in
industrial districts shall be permitted in any
business or residential district. No use permitted
in residential districts shall be permitted in any
industrial district. The general use categories are
listed below:
1. Low-density residential: IR-1, IR-2, IR-3,
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-473 Rev.11-19-2012
14-696
R-1, R-2, R-3.
2. Medium- and high-density residential: R-4,
R-5, R-6.
3. Business: R-P, B-1, B-2, B-3, A-B, B-4, B-5,
I-B.
4. Industrial: I-L, I-Lb, I-M, I-Ma, I-Mb, I-H,
I-Hb.
b. No variance shall be granted which would permit the
creation of a lot or parcel that cannot be
developed in compliance with the zoning,
subdivision and other regulations applicable
thereto.
c. No variance shall be granted which would result in
a use or development of the lot or parcel in
question which would not be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this article or the
land development plan of the city; which would be
materially detrimental to the public welfare or
materially injurious to the enjoyment, use or
development of property or improvement permitted in
the vicinity; or which would materially impair an
adequate supply of light and air to properties and
improvements in the vicinity, substantially
increase congestion in the public streets, increase
the danger of flood or fire, or endanger the public
safety.
d. No variance shall be granted which would be greater
than the minimum variance necessary to relieve the
undue hardship or the hardship of the applicant.
e. Except for appeals concerning nonconforming
dwelling units in existence and use prior to April
18, 1984, no variance shall be granted which would
permit the alteration of a structure to accommodate
any additional dwelling unit as a conditional use
without meeting the requirements which would
otherwise be a condition precedent to such
conditional use treatment.
f. No variance shall be granted which would permit the
alteration of an existing residential structure in
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-473 Rev.11-19-2012
14-697
an R-4 or an R-5 zone to accommodate more than
three (3) dwelling units. No such variance shall be
granted unless:
1. No additional unit shall have less than six
hundred (600) square feet of floor area,
exclusive of common hallways and storage in
basement and attic;
2. No open outside stairways or fire escapes
above the ground floor shall be or have been
constructed in the immediately preceding five
(5) years;
3. A lower level dwelling unit shall have a
minimum of one-half of its floor-to-ceiling
height above the average adjoining ground
level;
4. No existing dwelling unit shall be decreased
to less than one thousand (1,000) square feet
of floor area;
5. The building shall have been in existence
prior to January 1, 1984;
6. A minimum of nine thousand (9,000) square feet
of land area shall be required;
7. A minimum of four (4) on-site parking spaces
shall be required;
8. A minimum of seventy-five (75) feet of street
frontage shall be required; provided, further,
before a building permit may be issued, site
plan approval under article V of this chapter
shall be required with the following
additional review standards:
(i) Any addition or exterior alterations such
as facade materials, building form and
roof pitch shall be designed to be
compatible with the architectural style
of the structure;
(ii) The scale and surface area of parking,
driveways, and paved areas shall be
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-473 Rev.11-19-2012
14-698
arranged and landscaped to be compatible
in size and scale with neighboring
properties in the area and to properly
screen vehicles from adjacent properties
and streets;
provided, further, that no variance shall be
granted with respect to any of the preceding
additional requirements.
g. No variance shall be granted from the minimum lot
sizes set forth in section 14-433 for lots in the
IR-1, IR-2 and I-B zones.
h. No variance shall be granted from the requirements
in Section 14-403.
(d) Conditions on variances; variances less than requested.
Reasonable conditions and safeguards relating to construction,
character, location, landscaping, screening and other matters may
be imposed upon the premises benefited by a variance as considered
necessary to prevent injurious effects upon other property and
improvements in the vicinity or upon public facilities and
services. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the
resolution granting the variance and in the notice informing the
applicant thereof. Violation of such conditions and safeguards
shall be a violation of this article. A variance less than or
different from that requested may be granted when the record
supports the applicant’s right to some relief but not to the relief
requested.
(e) Limitations on variances. No variance permitting the
erection or alteration of a building shall be valid for a period
longer than six (6) months, or such other time as may be fixed at
the time granted not to exceed two (2) years, unless a building
permit for such erection or alteration is issued and construction
is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently
pursued to completion. One (1) or more extensions of said
expiration dates may be granted if the facts constituting the basis
of the decision have not materially changed and the two-year period
is not exceeded thereby. No variance relating to the establishment
or maintenance of a use not involving a building or structure shall
be valid for a period longer than six (6) months, or such other
time as may be fixed at the time granted not to exceed two (2)
years, unless an occupancy permit is issued and a use commenced
within such period; provided, however, that one (1) or more
extensions of said time may be granted if the facts constituting
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-473 Rev.11-19-2012
14-699
the basis of the decision have not materially changed, and the
two-year period is not exceeded thereby.
(f) Recording of variances. No variance shall be valid
unless, within thirty (30) days of final approval of the variance,
a certificate describing the variance has been recorded by the
applicant for the variance in the registry of deeds as required by
30 M.R.S.A. Section 4963.

d. The zoning classification and present use of the
subject property;
e. The particular provision of this article
authorizing the proposed conditional use;
f. A general description of the proposed conditional
use;
g. Where site plan approval is required by article V
of this chapter, a preliminary or final site plan

2. Public hearing. A public hearing shall be set, advertised
and conducted by the board of appeals in accordance with
article VI of this chapter.
3. Action by the board of appeals. Within thirty (30) days
following the close of the public hearing, the board of
appeals shall render its decision, in a manner and form
specified by article VI of this chapter, granting the
application for a conditional use permit, granting it
subject to conditions as specified in subsection (d), or
denying it. The failure of the board to act within thirty
(30) days shall be deemed an approval of the conditional
use permit, unless such time period is mutually extended
in writing by the applicant and the board. Within five
(5) days of such decision or the expiration of such
period, the secretary shall mail notice of such decision
or failure to act to the applicant and, if a permit is
authorized, shall issue such permit, listing therein any
and all conditions imposed by the board of appeals.
(c) Conditions for conditional uses:
1. Authorized uses. A conditional use permit may be issued
for any use denominated as a conditional use in the
regulations applicable to the zone in which it is
proposed to be located.
2. Standards. The Board shall, after review of required
materials, authorize issuance of a conditional use
permit, upon a showing that the proposed use, at the size
and intensity contemplated at the proposed location, will
not have substantially greater negative impacts than
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-474 Rev. 6-5-2017
14-701
would normally occur from surrounding uses or other
allowable uses in the same zoning district. The Board
shall find that this standard is satisfied if it finds
that:
a. The volume and type of vehicle traffic to be
generated, hours of operation, expanse of pavement,
and the number of parking spaces required are not
substantially greater than would normally occur at
surrounding uses or other allowable uses in the
same zone; and
b. The proposed use will not create unsanitary or
harmful conditions by reason of noise, glare, dust,
sewage disposal, emissions to the air, odor,
lighting, or litter; and
c. The design and operation of the proposed use,
including but not limited to landscaping,
screening, signs, loading, deliveries, trash or
waste generation, arrangement of structures, and
materials storage will not have a substantially
greater effect/impact on surrounding properties
than those associated with surrounding uses or
other allowable uses in the zone.
3. Use Specific Standards. The following additional
standards of review apply to the specific uses.
a. Emergency shelters are subject to the following
conditions, in addition to the provisions of
section 14-474 (c) 2. Notwithstanding section 14-
474(a) or any other provision of this Code, the
Planning Board shall be substituted for the Board
of Appeals as the reviewing authority for any
shelter also subject to Level III site plan review:
i. The facility shall provide adequate space for
conducting security searches and other
assessments;
ii. The facility shall be designed with a
centralized shelter operations office on
each level providing sight lines to sleeping
areas;
iii. A Management Plan adequately outlining the
following areas shall be provided:
City of Portland Land Use

Management responsibilities; Process for
resolving neighborhood concerns; Staffing;
Access restrictions; On-site surveillance;
Safety measures; Controls for resident
behavior and noise levels; and Monitoring
Reports.
iv. Adequate access to and from METRO service
shall be provided. The facility shall be
within a ¼ mile of a METRO line, or shall be
within ½ mile of a METRO line and provide
adequate indoor space to permit all shelter
guests day shelter, as well as implement
strategies to help residents utilize
transit;
v. The facility shall provide on-site services
to support residents, such as case
management, life skills training,
counseling, employment and educational
services, housing assistance, or other
programs;
vi. Suitable laundry, kitchen, pantry, bicycle
storage, and secure storage facilities for
shelter stayers shall be provided on-site;
and
vii. An outdoor area for guest use shall be
provided on-site with adequate screening to
protect privacy of guests.
(d) Conditions on conditional use permits. The board of
appeals may impose such reasonable conditions upon the premises
benefited by a conditional use as may be necessary to prevent or
minimize adverse effects therefrom upon other property in the
neighborhood. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the
resolution authorizing the conditional use permit and in the
permit. Violation of such conditions shall be a violation of this
article.
(e) Effect of issuance of a conditional use permit. The
issuance of a conditional use permit shall not authorize the
establishment or extension of any use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building
or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing
and processing of applications for any permits or approvals which
may be required by the codes and ordinances of the city, including
but not limited to a building permit, a certificate of occupancy,

subdivision approval and site plan approval.
(f) Limitations on conditional use permits. No conditional
use permit shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months
from the date of issue, or such other time as may be fixed at the
time granted not to exceed two (2) years, unless the conditional
use has been commenced or is issued and construction is actually
begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion; provided, however, that one (1) or more extensions of
said time may be granted if the facts constituting the basis of the
decision have not materially changed, and the two-year period is
not exceeded thereby. A conditional use permit shall be deemed to
authorize only the particular use for which it was issued and such
permit shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or
effect if such use shall for any reason be discontinued for a
period of twelve (12) consecutive months or more.
(g) Appeals from board decisions. Appeals from any decision
of the board of appeals or, where applicable, the Planning Board
respecting a conditional use permit shall be to superior court.

*Editor’s Note—Pursuant to Council Order 280-09/10 passed on 7/19/10 Division
29 (Preservation and Replacement of Housing Units) was repealed in its
entirety and replaced with a new Division 29 (Housing Preservation and
Replacement).
---------
DIVISION 29. HOUSING PRESERVATION AND REPLACEMENT
Sec. 14-483. Housing preservation and replacement.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is:
1. To promote and facilitate an adequate supply of
housing, particularly affordable housing for all
economic groups;
2. To limit the net loss of housing units in the city;
3. To preserve housing in zones where housing is
permitted for in the city for all residents in order
to promote the health, safety and welfare of its
citizens.
(b) Definitions.
Dwelling unit. A dwelling unit is one (1) or more rooms with
private bath and kitchen facilities comprising an independent selfcontained
dwelling unit. For purposes of this section only it also
includes single family, two-family and multi-family dwellings and
any dwelling units in those dwellings, or dwelling units, or rooms
that people rent or sleep in within lodging houses, dormitories,
shelters and sheltered care group homes.
Loss of dwelling unit for purposes of this section means
the elimination or conversion to nonresidential use of a
dwelling unit and dwelling units that remain vacant for three
years or more or are lost due to demolition unless the vacancy
or demolition results from accidents outside of the owner’s
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-483 Rev. 1-4-2016
14-705
control, fire, natural disasters, or acts of war.
Original site means the location where the demolition or
conversion to non-residential use of dwelling units will take
place.
(c) Applicability. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, this section shall apply to the loss of three or more
dwelling units in a five year period, provided that such dwelling
units were a legally registered residential use as of July 1, 2002.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, this section
shall also apply to proposals that (a) result in the loss of fewer
than three (3) dwelling units which were legally registered
residential use as of July 1, 2002, and (b) creates surface
parking.
Determination of number of the dwelling units within a
structure or structures and the number of units lost will be based
on records in the Department of Planning and Urban Development
indicating the legal, registered use of the property since July 1,
2002 through the time of application. The actual use of the
property for purposes of applicability of this section may be
rebutted by the owner by proof of documentary evidence including
but not limited to photographs, letters, and sworn affidavits. The
Planning Authority may conduct its own investigation of the actual
use and shall determine the applicability of this section based on
the totality of the evidence.
(d) Exemptions.
This section does not apply to:
1. Consolidation, elimination or reconfiguration of one
(1) or more dwelling units within an existing
structure, as long as all the resulting units remain
as dwelling units after such consolidation,
elimination or reconfiguration, except as provided by
subsection 5 below. Conversion of a dwelling unit to
a hotel or motel room shall not qualify for the
exemption provided by the paragraph.
The amendments to paragraph (d)(1) approved by the
City Council on June 6, 2011 shall have an effective
date of April 25, 2011 but not apply to any final
determination regarding the applicability of this
section made by the Planning Authority prior to April

2. Proposals that result in a number of units equal to or
greater than the number of units lost as determined by
the Planning Authority; or
3. Grandfathered dwelling units existing in zones which
no longer permit residential uses.
4. Property which has been ordered demolished by the
City, pursuant to 17 M.R.S.A. §2851, et seq., as
amended, except where it is determined by the Building
Authority that the deterioration was caused by neglect
or lack of maintenance.
5. Subparagraph 1, above notwithstanding, the conversion to
a non-residential use of any dwelling units located on
the ground floor of a building within a business zone.
(e) Site plan administrative authorization or approval
required. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a
person who proposes to demolish or to convert to a nonresidential
use three or more dwelling units in the City, in a zone where such
use is otherwise permitted, must first obtain administrative
authorization or site plan approval from the City’s Planning
Authority or Planning Board pursuant to Sec. 14-521, et. seq.
In addition the requirements of 14-521, et. seq., where this
section is applicable, the applicant must also submit a statement
certifying the number of dwelling units to be demolished or
converted to nonresidential use, as well as a description of the

a result of demolition or conversion to non-residential use, the
owner shall:
1. Provide the Planning Authority a list containing the name
of each tenant currently residing in the dwelling units
to be demolished or converted to non-residential use, as
well as verification of compliance with tenant notice
requirements of this section.
2. Deliver to each tenant who occupies such a dwelling
unit a written notice to vacate the unit. The notice
shall either be sent by certified mail, return receipt

Sec. 14-483 Rev. 1-4-2016
14-707
the tenant not less than ninety (90) days from the
date of receipt of the notice to vacate the unit; and

Authority.
(g) Housing Replacement Requirements. In addition to the
requirements of 14-521, et. seq, the Planning Authority shall
require, as a condition of approval, that an owner shall replace
any dwelling units that are demolished or converted to non
residential use.
This section may be satisfied in any one of the following
ways:
1. Construction of Units. The construction of housing units
within a new structure or a new addition either on site
or off-site;
2. Residential Conversion. The conversion of a
nonresidential building to residential use; or
The applicant may use either of the two methods or a
combination of the two to fulfill their replacement requirement.

application;
3. Be situated within a development which has not been a
candidate for site plan approval as of the date of the
application; and
4. Be comparable in size to the units replaced; for the
purpose of this section, “comparable in size” means that
the aggregate size of the replacement units will be no
less than 80% of the size of the aggregate of the
original units.

(i) Contribution to the Housing Trust Fund.
1. The applicant may meet the requirements of this section
by depositing $50,000 for each dwelling unit into the
City’s Housing Trust Fund in section 14-489.
2. Beginning on January 1, 2004 and annually thereafter,
the amount of the contribution shall be adjusted by
multiplying this amount originally deposited for each
unit by a fraction, the denominator of which shall be
the “Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and
Clerical Workers (“CPI-W”),” U.S. City Average, “All
Items Index,” as published by the United States
Bureau of Labor Statistics (“the Index”) for
January 1, 2003 Year, and the numerator of which shall
be the Index for the same month in each subsequent
year. In the event that the Index is not then in
existence, the parties shall use such equivalent price
index as is published by any successor governmental
agency then in existence; or, if none, then by such
nongovernmental agency as may then be publishing an
equivalent price index, in lieu of and adjusted to the
Index. If the Index shall cease to use 1982-84 equals
100 as the basis of calculation, or if a substantial
change is made in the terms or number of items
contained in the Index, the Base Index shall be
adjusted to conform to such change, using such
computation thereof, if available, as shall be employed
by the United States Department of Labor in computing
same. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
contributions made after January 1, 2004 shall not be
less than the amount originally required to be
deposited pursuant to sub-section (i)(1) for each
rooming or dwelling unit.
(j) Performance Guaranty/Letter of Credit. Owners or
affiliates must post a performance guaranty in the form of a letter
of credit, or other security acceptable to the city attorney, in
the amount equivalent to the amount the applicant would have been
required to contribute to the City’s Housing Trust Fund if the
applicant had chosen that option pursuant to sub-section g. Such a
performance guaranty shall be valid for no more than three years,
after which the full amount due shall be provided to the City’s
Housing Trust Fund if replacement units satisfying the conditions
of this Division 29 do not have Certificates of Occupancy.
(k) Partial waiver of replacement requirements. Any owner who
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-483 Rev. 1-4-2016
14-709
has applied for site plan review for elimination or conversion to
non-residential use of dwelling units may apply to the Zoning Board
of Appeals for a partial waiver from the housing replacement
requirements of this section. Such waiver may be a downward
adjustment of up to fifty percent (50%) of the owner’s housing
replacement obligation if the owner establishes to the board’s
satisfaction that:
1. The proposed development is consistent with the
comprehensive plan;
2. The proposed development provides significant value and
benefit to the immediate and surrounding neighborhood,
including, but not limited to, community enhancement,
social benefits or job creation;
3. The applicant demonstrates with objective evidence that
the imposition of the requirements of this section would
impose such an economic burden upon the project relative
to its scope that it renders the project impossible to
develop; and
4. The requested relief does not constitute a grant of a
special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon
similar properties.
The Zoning Board of Appeals must make positive findings on
each of the four (4) criteria above in order for any such
adjustment to be valid. An applicant aggrieved of a decision of
the Zoning Board of Appeals may appeal a decision under this subsection
pursuant to Sec. 14-553 of the City Code.
(l) Effect of Other City Ordinances.
1. Historic Preservation. Nothing in this division shall
permit the demolition or conversion to non-residential
use, of dwelling units in residential property protected
by the Historic Preservation Ordinance (Sections 14-601,
et seq.), except as permitted by that ordinance.
2. Conditional Zone. A conditional zone may not be used
to circumvent the application of this section. The
terms of this section shall apply to any conditional
zone which involves dwelling units affected by this
section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
shall be deemed to prevent the City and the applicant
from agreeing to terms which exceed those imposed by
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-483 Rev. 1-4-2016

this section by means of a conditional zone.
(m) Appeals. Any applicant aggrieved by a decision of the
Planning Authority under this section may appeal to the Zoning
Board of Appeals within 30 days of that decision.

DIVISION 30. AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Sec.14-484. Purpose.
It is in the public interest to promote an adequate supply
of affordable housing for the city’s residents. The purpose of
this division therefore is to offer incentives to developers to
include units of affordable housing within development projects,
thereby mitigating the impact of market rate housing
construction, or the demonstrated increase in affordable housing
needs resulting from the creation of new lower-income jobs, on
the limited supply of available land for suitable housing, and
helping to meet the housing needs of all economic groups within
the city. The city believes that this division will assist in
meeting the city’s comprehensive goals for affordable housing,
in the prevention of overcrowding and deterioration of the
limited supply of affordable housing, and by doing so promote
the health, safety and welfare of its citizens.

Sec. 14-487. Ensuring Workforce Housing.
(a) Purpose. Based on the city’s Comprehensive Plan and
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-487 Rev. 6-18-2018
14-714
the housing study completed in 2015, it is in the public
interest to promote an adequate supply of housing that is
affordable to a range of households at different income levels.
The purpose of this section is to ensure that housing
developments over a certain size provide a portion of workforce
housing units and, by doing so, promote the health, safety, and
welfare of Portland citizens.
(b) Applicability. This division shall apply to development
projects that create ten or more new dwelling units for rent or
for sale through new construction, substantial rehabilitation of
existing structures, adaptive reuse or conversion of a nonresidential
use to residential use, or any combination of these
elements.
(c) All Developments of Ten Units or More Conditional Uses.
Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in Chapter 14, all
developments of ten units or more are conditional uses subject
to Planning Board review on the condition that they comply with
the requirements of this section, 14-487 unless they are within
the India Street Form Based Code district, in which case the
review will be conducted administratively or by the Planning
Board in accordance with the thresholds of site plan review for
the district.
(d) Workforce Housing Minimum. At least ten percent (10%)
of the units in the project shall meet the definition of
workforce housing unit for sale or for rent. The project shall
have the option of paying a partial fee-in-lieu as per (e)4
below for any fractional value or providing an additional unit
on site.
(e) Standards.
1. Projects shall not be segmented or phased to
avoid compliance with these provisions. In cases
where projects are completed in phases,
affordable units shall be provided in proportion
to the development of market rate units unless
otherwise permitted through regulations.
2. Workforce units are encouraged to be integrated
with the rest of the development, should use a
common entrance and should provide no indications
from common areas that these units are workforce
housing units.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-487 Rev. 6-18-2018
14-715
3. Workforce units need not be the same size as
other units in the development but the number of
bedrooms in such units, either on- or off-site,
shall be no less than 10 percent of the total
number of bedrooms in the development. For the
purposes of calculating the number of bedrooms in
a development, every 400 square feet in each
market rate unit will count as a bedroom if the
Planning Authority determines this method is
appropriate in lieu of counting actual bedrooms.
4. As an alternative to providing workforce housing
units, projects may pay a fee in lieu of some or
all of the units. In-lieu fees shall be paid into
the Housing Trust Fund as defined in Sec. 14-489.
The fee for affordable units not provided shall
be $100,000 per unit, adjusted annually in the
same way as the fee under Division 29 for Housing
Replacement.
5. Workforce housing units for sale, if converted to
workforce housing units for rent, shall become
subject to the income limits and other
requirements of such units.
6. If at least 33 percent of the units in a
development are workforce units, the development
is eligible for subsidy through an Affordable
Housing TIF, subject to City Council approval.
7. The term of affordability for the required 10
percent workforce units provided shall be defined
as follows:
Percentage of Workforce
Units Provided
Minimum Term of
Affordability for Required
Workforce Units
10% Longest term permitted

2. Situations where less than permanent
affordability might be considered; and
3. Guidelines for meeting the requirement that offsite
units be “in the same neighborhood”.
(g) Reporting to City Council. In conjunction with the
annual report on the Housing Trust, city planning staff shall
annually report on developments subject to this section, the
number of units produced, the amount of fee-in-lieu collected,
and the overall effectiveness of this section in achieving its
stated purpose.

(d) Planned Residential Unit Developments (PRUDs). In
order to promote orderly development of low- and moderateincome
development as PRUDs, any project in which more than
50% of the units are low-income or workforce units for rent or
for sale may utilize the following dimensional bonuses and
changes:
1. Minimum lot area per dwelling unit is reduced by
50%;
2. Maximum number of units and maximum length of
buildings do not apply but may be set through site
plan review;

The Planning Board may adopt regulations regarding the content
and processes for noticing as part of the Technical Manual.
(g) Projects under 14-487. Projects that are subject to
14-487 that choose to provide the required workforce housing
units on site are eligible for a 25% increase in total
permitted units. If an eligible project is also subject to 14-
487, the applicant shall have the option of utilizing either
this bonus or any bonuses they are eligible for under 14-488.1
but not both.
(Ord. No. 98-06/07, 12-4-06; Ord No. 240-09/10, 6-21-10; Ord. 82-15/16, 10-

14-488.1 Inclusionary Zoning for Hotel Projects.
(a) Purpose. This section is based on City analysis, most
specifically the analysis documented in the Greater Portland
Council of Government study “Proposed Hotel Linkage Fee:
Supportable Range” dated August 29, 2018, that finds that new
hospitality developments create a need for new affordable
housing. This need is the result of the fact that hospitality
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-488 Rev. 1-23-2019
14-719
developments necessarily create a number of jobs that do not pay
employees at a rate sufficient to allow those employees to afford
market-rate housing in the City of Portland.
(b) Hotel Projects Conditional Uses. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Chapter 14, all hotel projects are
conditional uses subject to Planning Board review on the
condition that they comply with the requirements of this Section
14-488.1.
(c) Low Income Housing Minimum. All hotel projects shall
provide one unit of Low Income Housing for rent in the City of
Portland for every 28 rooms in the hotel project which shall meet
the standards outlined in Section 14-487 and in the implementing
regulations governing Low Income Units. This amount shall be
rounded up to the nearest increment of 28 rooms. These units
shall be deed restricted for the longest period permitted by law;
shall not be used for Short Term Rentals of less than 30 days;
and must be provided with distinct entrances from the street to
delineate them from the hotel itself.
(d) Fee-in-Lieu Alternative. As an alternative to providing
Low Income Housing units under subsection (c) above, a Hotel
Project may pay a fee-in-lieu of $3,806 per hotel guest room.
This amount shall be paid into the City’s Housing Trust and used
for the purposes set forth in the ordinance and regulations
applicable to that trust.
(e) Annual Adjustments. The amounts in (d) above shall be
adjusted annually in the same way as the fee under Division 29
for Housing Replacement.
(f) Regulations. The Planning Board may promulgate
implementing regulations based on this ordinance.
(g) Applicability. Notwithstanding the provisions of 1
M.R.S. § 302, Sec. 14-488.1 shall apply retroactively and include
any and all actions and proceedings pending on September 26, 2018
or thereafter.

Sec. 14-494. Guidance to subdivider.
The purpose of the preapplication procedure is to afford the
subdivider an opportunity to avail himself of the advice and
assistance of the Planning Board, and to consult early and
informally with the board staff before preparation of the
subdivision plat and before formal application for its approval, to
insure the development of a subdivision plan with mutual benefits
for the subdivider and the city.
(Code 1968, § 603.2; Ord. No. 158-68, § 10, 5-6-68; Ord. No. 149-79, 6-6-79)
Sec. 14-495. Procedure for approval of a subdivision.
(a) Application for approval:
1. To obtain approval of a proposed subdivision the
subdivider or applicant shall prepare for the Planning
Board a subdivision plat, a vicinity sketch, and a
recording plat in accordance with the requirements and
standards established by this article.
2. The sketch plan may be prepared for staff and Planning
Board review if desired by the applicant prior to formal
submission of the subdivision plat.
3. The subdivider shall supply and submit five (5) copies of
the complete subdivision plat and the vicinity sketch to
the office of the planning authority at least fifteen
(15) days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting of the
Planning Board, to be in order for consideration by the
board at the meeting.
4. The planning authority shall forward a copy of the
subdivision plat and vicinity sketch to the public works
authority, parks authority, fire department and building
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-495 Rev.4-2-2001
14-728
authority, all of which shall submit recommendations to
the planning authority by the time of the initial hearing
on the subdivision plat.
5. Prior to the date upon which the planning authority meets
to consider the subdivision plat the applicant shall pay
all costs incurred in providing public notice. The
planning authority shall determine the amount of this fee
based on the actual costs incurred in newspaper
advertising and postage, and shall also be responsible
for collecting and accounting for such fee. Public notice
in the form of newspaper advertisement shall be provided
as required under 14-32.
6. Notice shall be provided in accordance with section
14-32. Notice shall also be sent to the clerk and the
reviewing authority of municipalities that abut or
include any portion of a proposed subdivision.
7. The city council may from time to time establish by order
reasonable application fees to defray the costs of
reviewing subdivisions.
(b) Timing of subdivision review: A public hearing shall be
commenced within thirty (30) days following the receipt of a
complete subdivision application. The staff shall notify the
applicant in writing either that the application is complete or, if
it is determined to be incomplete, the specific additional
materials needed to make it a complete application. The Planning
Board shall render its decision on any application submitted to it
within sixty (60) days following receipt of a complete application,
or such other time as may be mutually agreed to by the Planning
Board and the applicant.
(c) Engineering requirements:
1. The applicant shall furnish the public works authority
with all engineering data and plans necessary for the
completion of the required improvements, as enumerated in
section 14-496(b). Such plans may be furnished apart from
but at the same time as the subdivision plat and vicinity
sketch and shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer.
2. The public works authority shall review the plans
submitted as required in subsection (c)(1) above and
shall approve, approve conditionally, or disapprove same
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-495 Rev.4-2-2001
14-729
within ten (10) days of submission as to whether such
plans are in conformance with the standards set forth in
this article.
(d) Subdivision plat approval: The Planning Board shall
approve, approve conditionally or disapprove such subdivision plat
at a public meeting. If approved conditionally, the conditions and
reasons shall be stated and given in writing to the subdivider and,
if necessary, the Planning Board may require the subdivider to
submit a revised subdivision plat. If the Planning Board should
disapprove the subdivision plat, the reasons for such action shall
be stated and given in writing to the subdivider, and the board may
state the conditions under which the proposed subdivision would be
approved. One (1) copy of the subdivision plat as acted upon by the
Planning Board shall be retained in its office, one (1) copy
forwarded to the public works authority and one (1) copy returned
to the subdivider.
(e) Effect of subdivision plat approval: Receipt of the
approved copy of the subdivision plat of the subdivider is not
authorization that he may proceed with the construction of any
improvements. No construction will proceed until the recording plat
has been approved by the Planning Board and has been properly
recorded as required hereinafter in subsection (g).
(f) Recording plat approval:
1. The applicant shall submit the recording plat and five
(5) copies thereof to the planning authority at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the meeting of the
Planning Board at which it is intended to be considered,
which copies shall be distributed as hereinafter
provided.
2. Consideration of the recording plat, however, shall not
take place until approvals required in subsections (c)
and (d) are obtained.
(g) Recording:
1. When the recording plat is approved, the subdivider shall
pay the actual cost of recording and reproducing five (5)
copies of the plat, one (1) of which shall be on mylar
for the public works authority records.
2. The recording plat shall be recorded in the office of the
county registry of deeds by the subdivider.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-495 Rev.4-2-2001
14-730
3. The registry book and page numbers will then be recorded
on the five (5) copies of the plan, of which one (1)
shall be kept at the office of the Planning Board, one
(1) sent to the building authority, one (1) copy on mylar
sent to the public works authority, one (1) to the
assessor's office and one (1) to the subdivider.
4. Unless the subdivider shall record his or her approved
recording plat within three (3) years after the Planning
Board has approved the subdivision plat, the recording
plat approval shall become null and void. The preceding
sentence notwithstanding, if the Planning Board's initial
approval of a subdivision is based in part upon the
granting of a variance from any of the applicable
subdivision approval standards, no such variance shall be
valid unless that fact shall be expressly noted on the
face of the recording plat and shall be noted in a
certificate, each of which shall conform to 30-A M.R.S.A.
Section 4406, and such recording plat or such certificate
or both of them are recorded in the Cumberland County
Registry of Deeds within ninety (90) days of final
subdivision approval.
(h) Sectional recordings: Following subdivision plat
approval, the Planning Board may permit the subdivision to be
divided into two (2) or more sections for recording purposes
subject to any conditions that the board deems necessary in order
to insure the orderly development of the plan. The applicant may
seek approval of and record a sectional recording plat with the
county registry of deeds only if the section constitutes at least
twenty (20) percent of the total number of lots contained in the
approval plat and, in addition, shows the entire tract or parcel.
In these circumstances, if the first section of the plat has been
recorded within three (3) years after Planning Board approval,
subdivision plat approval of the remaining sections of the plat
shall remain in effect for five (5) years after Planning Board
approval.

anticipated use of the land.
2. The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the
street system of the surrounding areas. All streets must
provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of
streets in surrounding areas and provide means of ingress
and egress for surrounding acreage tracts.
When connecting streets within residential neighborhoods,
new streets shall contribute to a neighborhood street
system characterized by a network of interconnected
streets, which minimizes through-traffic in residential
neighborhoods. The layout of subdivision lots, streets,
and pedestrian ways shall promote multiple paths of
travel to get to destinations within and between
neighborhoods by foot and bicycle, as well as auto.
The interconnection of new and existing streets is
further subject to the following provisions to minimize
and mitigate through-traffic in residential
neighborhoods:
a. Where a determination is made that a proposed
street connection will result in substantial
increases in traffic volume and speed on the
effected public streets, the planning board may
require appropriate traffic calming solutions as
set forth in the traffic calming ordinance.
(Section 28-250) The department of public works
(DPW) may by regulation and amendment to the
Technical Manual establish standards for
determining what is a “substantial increase in
traffic volume and speed”; and
b. In any circumstances where a street connection is
allowed, the planning board may condition
subdivision approval to require the developer to
monitor future traffic patterns to determine
whether, using existing traffic calming standards,
new or additional traffic calming measures should
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-498 Rev. 11-16-2015
14-742
be employed. The extent and design of traffic
calming shall be determined by the DPW to mitigate
the post development impact of connecting new and
existing streets.
In cases where post development monitoring shows
that increased traffic volume and speed is such
that further traffic calming would be insufficient
to mitigate traffic negative impacts of throughtraffic,
the DPW may require that the connection be
modified to exclude regular vehicular traffic,
while retaining bicycle, pedestrian, and where
needed, emergency vehicle connections. The DPW
shall develop typical standards and specifications
for bicycle, pedestrian, and emergency vehicle
connections and/or turnarounds.
c. Where a determination is made by the DPW that a
proposed street connection will result in
substantial increases in traffic volume and speed
on the affected public streets, the planning board
may disallow a proposed street connection for
vehicular purposes in favor of a connection for
non-vehicular purposes in situations where a
proposed residential street connection meets all of
the following criteria:
i. the new street would result in the connection
of two arterials; and
ii. the street would be located in a neighborhood
where there is no existing public throughstreet
network connecting the same arterials;
and
iii. there is no likelihood that other public
street connections will be developed in the
future that would connect the arterials,
whether because of topography limitations,
existing development patterns, or other
similar reason.
In circumstances where vehicular connections are
disallowed per section (c) above, the planning
board shall require that adequate right-of-way is
reserved to permit the extension of the street for
pedestrian, bicycle, emergency use, and potential
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-498 Rev. 11-16-2015
14-743
vehicle connections as may develop in the future.
3. Reserve strips or spite strips for unspecified or
unacceptable purposes are prohibited.
4. Street right-of-way widths shall not be less than:
a. Fifty (50) feet for marginal access street;
b. Fifty (50) feet for minor street;
c. Sixty (60) feet for collector street.
Proposed subdivisions along existing, or dedicated, or platted
streets where rights-of-way are inadequate shall provide
additional land to meet the minimum standards.
5. Streets shall not occupy more land than needed to provide
access nor create unnecessary fragmentation of the
subdivision into small blocks. Streets will be designed
to discourage outside traffic from traversing the
development.
6. All dead-end streets shall provide for a cul-de-sac or,
in the case of a dead-end street which will be extended,
a temporary turn-around at the end of the street, subject
to the approval of the public works authority.
7. The minimum roadway width including esplanades and
sidewalks shall be:
a. Fifty (50) foot right-of-way, street pavement
width, curbing, sidewalk width and esplanade width
to conform to the requirements contained within the
City of Portland Technical Manual.
b. Sixty (60) foot right-of-way, street pavement
width, curbing, sidewalk width and esplanade width
to conform to the requirements contained within the
City of Portland technical and design standards and
guidelines manual.
c. Street right-of-way on the islands in Casco Bay
shall comply with article III of chapter 25.
8. Sidewalks and curbs:
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-498 Rev. 11-16-2015
14-744
a. Sidewalks shall be constructed on each side of each
street in accordance with article III of chapter
25. Sidewalks to be used by pedestrians are to be
so located as to minimize contacts with normal
automotive traffic, with preference given to
interior walks away from streets in common open
space in block interiors.
b. Curbs shall be constructed on each side of each
street. The curbing shall be constructed as
provided in article VI of chapter 25.
(c) Street design:
1. Profiles of each street or way in the subdivision shall
be shown on the subdivision plat. They shall be drawn to
a longitudinal scale of forty (40) feet to one (1) foot
and a vertical scale of four (4) feet to one (1) inch.
Such profiles shall include separate profiles of each
side line and center line of the street or way. Any
buildings abutting on the street shall be shown in
standard engineering format as requested by the public
works authority.
2. Street grades in all proposed subdivisions shall be
subject to the approval of the public works authority.
3. The public works authority shall establish the sequence
in which work is to be accomplished. Where it is
determined by the public works authority that work has
been completed prior to the receipt of all approvals
required by this article or which is out of sequence or
is not in compliance with the standards of this section
and of chapter 25, the director of parks and public works
or an inspector from the public works authority may issue
a stop work order. Work shall recommence only after the
stop work order has been lifted by the director of parks
and public works or an inspector from the public works
authority. Violation of the stop work order shall be
considered an offense.
(d) Street and subdivision names:
1. Street names for all subdivisions shall appear on the
subdivision plat and be subject to approval by the
Planning Board.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-498 Rev. 11-16-2015
14-745
2. Subdivision names for plats shall be subject to approval
by the Planning Board and not duplicate the name of any
plat already recorded.
(e) Exception for private streets within PRUD's and
manufactured housing parks. Private streets within PRUD's and
manufactured housing parks shall be exempt from the street
right-of-way and roadway width requirements set forth above,
provided that no such street shall be accepted by the city unless
it is first improved to the standards set forth above at the
expense of those persons requesting the street acceptance. Private
streets within a PRUD or a manufactured housing park shall meet
specifications established by the public works department. All
private streets shall be designed by a professional engineer and
shall be built according to accepted engineering standards.
(f) Sewers and storm drains:
1. The design of all sewers and storm drains shall be
subject to approval by the public works authority.
2. All subdivisions shall be provided with adequate storm
drain systems within the subdivision separate from any
sanitary sewer system required in article III of chapter
25.
3. Any natural or manmade areas, systems or facilities
designated for stormwater control purposes and intended
for city maintenance shall, except for detention or
retention ponds or basins and regularly free-flowing
watercourses, be structurally enclosed in accordance with
the standards of the public works authority, and shall be
dedicated with sufficient land for maintenance purposes.
Warranty deeds to such areas shall be submitted for
acceptance by the city council at the same time as the
acceptance of streets. All such areas as are not intended
for city maintenance shall be permanently protected and
maintained by private agreement, deed covenant or
restriction, as appropriate, in form approved by the
corporation counsel.
4. The approval of the plumbing inspector is required for
all subdivisions involving the use of septic tanks and
drainage fields for sewage disposal.

Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-498 Rev. 11-16-2015
14-746
basins and any other appurtenances as may be deemed
necessary by the public works authority. All work shall
be in accordance with public works specifications.
6. The public works authority shall establish the sequence
in which work is to be accomplished. Where it is
determined by the public works authority that work has
been completed prior to the receipt of all approvals
required by this article or which is out of sequence or
is not in compliance with the standards of this section
and of chapter 24, the director of parks and public works
or an inspector from the public works authority may issue
a stop work order. Work shall recommence only after the
stop work order has been lifted by the director of parks
and public works or an inspector from the public works
authority. Violation of the stop work order shall be
considered an offense.
(g) Blocks:
1. A maximum block length of eight hundred (800) feet,
measured from the nearest street lines of intersecting
streets, shall be observed except where, in the opinion
of the Planning Board, conditions justify a departure
from this standard. In general, block size should be the
maximum consistent with the use and shape of the site and
the convenience and safety of the occupants.
2. In blocks exceeding eight hundred (800) feet in length,
measured from the nearest street lines of intersecting
streets, the Planning Board may require where feasible
the reservation of a twenty (20) foot wide easement to
the city through the block to provide for the crossing of
underground utilities and pedestrian traffic where needed
or desirable and may further specify, at its discretion,
that a four (4) foot wide paved foot path be included.
3. The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined
on the basis of:
a. Provision of adequate building sites suitable to
the special needs of the type of use contemplated;
b. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes, setbacks and
dimensions;
c. Needs for convenient access, circulation, control
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-498 Rev. 11-16-2015
14-747
and safety of street traffic;
d. Limitations and opportunities of topography.
4. Blocks with lots having double frontage on streets shall
be avoided.
5. The foregoing dimensions may be adjusted by the Planning
Board where type of use or topography requires such
modification.
(h) Lots:
1. Lot sizes shall conform to the zoning ordinance in
article III of this chapter and the city health code.
2. Where easements for public utilities, storm or sanitary
sewers are contemplated, the lot lines shall be located
in such a manner as to facilitate construction of such
facilities and the maintenance thereof.
3. Lots which are reserved or laid out for business,
commercial or industrial purposes shall have sufficient
width and depth to accommodate the off-street parking and
loading facilities required for the type of use and
development contemplated, as established in article III
of this chapter.
4. Where feasible, side lot lines shall be at right angles
to street lines (or radial to curving street lines).
(i) Public open space:
1. In all subdivisions open space may be provided for parks,
recreational and other public areas. Where no public open
space or recreational areas exist in close proximity to
the subdivision, or where a lack of such areas in the
subdivision would require its disapproval under section
14-497(a), general requirements, the Planning Board may
require provision of land for park or recreational
purposes. Such lands may be designated for public or
private ownership in accordance with the conditions
stated in this section, subject to the approval of the
Planning Board.
2. If a tract or parcel is intended for public ownership and
is so designated on the subdivision plat, the acceptance
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-498 Rev. 11-16-2015
14-748
of such land shall be first recommended by the various
departments and the Planning Board and sent to the city
council for final determination.
3. If a tract or parcel is designed or intended to be owned
and used in common for recreational or other public or
semipublic purposes and such intent is so designated on
the subdivision plat, appropriate documents in form
approved by the corporation counsel shall be submitted to
the Planning Board. Such documents shall clearly:
a. Set forth the nature of the permanent organization
under which common ownership is to be established,
including its purpose; how it shall be governed and
administered; the provisions made for permanent
care and maintenance of the common property for its
share of the cost of administering and maintaining
such common property;
b. Set forth the extent of common interest held by the
owner of each individual parcel in the tract held
in common with others.
(j) Access to shoreline:
1. In all subdivisions having shore frontage on the island
of Casco Bay, existing legal rights of public access to
the shoreline shall be preserved. The proposed street
layout and circulation plan shall be suitably integrated
with such existing public access in a manner that
reasonably promotes the public use of such access. The
proposed street layout and circulation plan shall also be
designed to preserve any legal rights to any significant
water views and scenic vistas from such rights-of-way.
2. In all subdivisions having any lots within the shoreland
zone, legal rights of private access to waters shall, to
the extent reasonably feasible, be established for the
benefit of all lots within the subdivision not otherwise
having such access.

Sec. 14-499.5. Additional requirements for manufactured housing
parks.
All manufactured housing parks and subdivisions as defined in
section 14-47 shall meet the requirements for residential
subdivisions established by this article, the site plan and the
zoning ordinance, in addition to the following requirements for
manufactured housing parks:
(a) The entire development shall be properly screened from
abutting neighborhoods and uses. Such screen shall
consist of plantings, or a combination of earth berm and
plantings, not less than three (3) feet in width and six
(6) feet in height at the time of initial occupancy of
such development, and shall be set back on corner lots so
as to comply with section 14-434. Individual shrubs or
trees, as approved by the city arborist, shall be planted
so as to establish a dense visual screen year round. At
least fifty (50) percent of the plantings shall consist
of evergreens. Such screen shall thereafter be
permanently maintained in a condition meeting the
specifications and intent of this subsection. In cases
where such screen areas are to be separately owned, the
deed of conveyance shall contain a requirement that the
grantee shall likewise maintain the screen area. Such
requirement shall be in a form acceptable to the
corporation counsel. Any area intended to be owned and
used in common shall thereafter be maintained by a
permanent organization as set forth in section
14-498(i)(3). Existing vegetation may substitute for new
plantings if it forms an acceptable dense visual screen

14-751
consistent with the intent of this subsection.
(b) All manufactured housing units and any accessory
structure within such development shall be located at
least fifty (50) feet from any external property boundary
of the development where the proposed park density is two
(2) or more times greater than the density of residential
development on adjacent parcels or the maximum permitted
density of adjacent vacant parcels.
(c) All units within such development shall be set back from
any existing collector or arterial street, as defined in

installed within the foundation wall or underground in
accordance with all applicable codes and regulations.
(e) All trash containers, bottled gas tanks, storage sheds,
utility meters, or other similar items or accessory
structures except parking garages, shall be located and
suitably screened by plantings or fencing so as not to be
clearly visible from the street or abutting properties.
(f) All manufactured housing units shall be placed either on
a foundation which forms a complete enclosure under
exterior walls, or on suitable blocks on a foundation
pad, in which case the unit shall be boxed or skirted
with suitable material designed for such use.
(g) All manufactured housing units shall be properly
installed, blocked and leveled or affixed to a foundation
wall, so as to rest on the wheels used to transport the
unit. Any hitch or tow bar shall be removed from the unit
after it is placed on its foundation.
(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 14-498 and
14-499, private roads within a manufactured housing park

Sec. 14-501. Performance and defect guarantees; engineering
review, inspection fees and administrative fees.
(a) The performance guarantee shall be a letter of credit or
escrow account with a responsible financial institution or the
deposit, with the finance department of the city, of a sum required
for the guarantee. (The city shall hold such funds in a noninterest
bearing account until the completion of all of the improvements.)
The performance guarantee shall be in the name of the city and
shall be approved by the finance director as to financial
sufficiency and the corporation counsel as to proper form and legal
sufficiency.
(b) Performance guarantees shall be required to ensure the
fulfillment of all improvements as required by section 14-499, as
well as the requirement in article III of chapter 25 that the
subdivider shall give to the city, prior to the release of the
performance guarantee a warranty deed (with metes and bounds
description) to the property within each street within the
subdivision, as well as delivery to the city of the warranty deeds
to all other improvements intended for city maintenance. Such
guarantee shall specify the completion date of the improvements
required in the subdivision and the delivery date to the city of
such deed or deeds prior to the expiration of the performance
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-501 Rev.11-16-2015
14-753
guarantee. The performance guarantee shall be for a term not less
than one (1) year. Furthermore, the performance guarantee shall be
released only upon the completion, to the satisfaction of the city,
of the public improvements and the tendering of a defect guarantee
as required in subsections (e) and (f).
(c) The guarantee shall be equal in value to one hundred
(100) percent of the estimated cost of the improvements as
determined by the public works authority and the planning
authority. The guarantor shall not be released from the guarantee
except by a release in writing from the public works authority and
the planning authority.
(d) Performance guarantees may be reduced periodically by the
public works authority and the planning authority in the manner
provided herein. Upon request, but in no event more than three (3)
times in any calendar year, the developer shall be eligible to
receive reductions in the performance guarantee equal to the
estimated cost of the completed improvements. In no case, however,
shall any performance guarantee be reduced (1) by less than one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or fifty (50) percent of the
initial amount of the performance guarantee, whichever is less, at
any one (1) time; or (2) in any line item where improvements remain
to be completed: or (3) to a value which is less than the estimated
cost of completing all remaining prescribed improvements for which
a performance guarantee is required by section 14-530 as determined
by the public works authority. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this section, no performance guarantee shall be reduced to less
than the amount of the defect guarantee to be posted upon
completion of the improvements.
(e) Upon the satisfactory completion of the subdivision's
prescribed improvements, excepting tree planting and other
landscaping if in the opinion of the city arborist the installation
of such plantings is not feasible due to weather conditions, and
following the city's receipt of the warranty deeds referred to in
(b) above, the subdivider shall file a defect guarantee with the
city. The defect guarantee shall ensure the workmanship and the
durability of all materials used in the construction of the
roadways, curbing, esplanades, sidewalks, sanitary sewerage systems
(including manholes and house drain laterals), storm drainage
systems (including manholes, catch basins and catch basin drains),
street lighting, tree planting, other appropriate landscaping and
all other public improvements which may become defective within one
(1) year period, all as determined by the public works authority.
The defect guarantee shall also ensure the proper installation of
any required tree plantings or landscaping which were not installed
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-501 Rev.11-16-2015
14-754
prior to the filing of the defect guarantee during the next
appropriate planting season, as determined by the city arborist.
The defect guarantee shall be filed prior to the release of the
performance guarantee and it shall not expire between October 30
and April 15 of the following year.
(f) The defect guarantee shall be a letter of credit or
escrow account with a responsible financial institution or the
deposit, with the finance department of the city, of a sum required
for the guarantee (the city shall hold such funds in a noninterest
bearing account until the completion of all of the improvements),
equal in value to ten (10) percent of the estimated cost of public
improvements. It shall be in the name of the city and shall be
approved by the finance director as to financial sufficiency and
the corporation counsel as to proper form and legal sufficiency. A
guarantee which contains appropriate terms and conditions to cover
both the performance and defect guarantee provisions as specified
in subsections (a)--(e) above is an acceptable form of guarantee.
(g) A performance guarantee and defect guarantee shall also
be required to ensure the completion of all improvements as
required by section 14-499.5, as well as all improvements for the
circulation, recreation, landscaping, light, air, drainage and
service needs of a planned unit development which are not subject
to section 14-501(b). For purposes of this subsection, sections
14-501(c) and (d) shall also apply. The planning authority may
waive all or any portion of this requirement if it determines that
the developer has a proven record of satisfactory performance and
sufficient financial capability.
(h) At the same time that the developer posts a performance
guarantee, the developer shall also pay to the city the subdivision
inspection fee equal to two (2) percent of the estimated costs of
improvements required by this article, with actual inspection costs
in excess of two (2) percent invoiced by the city at the completion
of the project or as deemed necessary by the city. If a
performance guarantee is extended beyond its original expiration
date, then an additional inspection fee in an amount to be
determined by the city shall be required.
(i) The developer shall also pay a fee to cover the
engineering review costs and administrative costs to be incurred by

Sec. 14-506. Modifications.
(a) Except for the requirements set forth in sections 14-498
and 14-499 pertaining to the provision and construction of curbs
and sidewalks, the Planning Board if it finds that extraordinary
conditions exist or that undue hardship may result from strict
compliance with these regulations may vary the regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured;
provided that such variation will not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of the land development plan and the
regulations of this article.
(b) Where the Planning Board or planning authority finds
that, for each of the requirements listed below, two or more of the
conditions exist with respect to compliance with the requirements
set forth in sections 14-498 and 14-499 pertaining to the provision
and construction of curbs and/or sidewalks, it may waive, in whole
or in part, the regulations so that substantial justice may be done
and the public interest secured:
Sidewalks-
1. There is no reasonable expectation for pedestrian usage
coming from, going to and traversing the site.
2. There is no sidewalk in existence or expected within 1000
feet and the construction of sidewalks does not
contribute to the development of a pedestrian oriented
infrastructure.
3. A safe alternative-walking route is reasonably and safely
available, for example, by way of a sidewalk on the other
side of the street that is lightly traveled.
4. The reconstruction of the street is specifically
identified and approved in the first or second year of
the current Capital Improvement Program or has been
funded through an earlier CIP or through other sources.
5. The street has been constructed or reconstructed without
sidewalks within the last 24 months.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-506 Rev.5-29-2003
14-758
6. Strict adherence to the sidewalk requirement would result
in the loss of significant site features related to
landscaping or topography that are deemed to be of a
greater public value.
Curbing-
1. The cost to construct the curbing, including any
applicable street opening fees, is in excess of 5% of the
overall project cost.
2. The reconstruction of the street is specifically
identified and approved in the first or second year of
the current Capital Improvement Program or has been
funded through an earlier CIP or through other sources.
3. The street has been rehabilitated without curbing in the
last 60 months.
4. Strict adherence to the curb requirement would result in
the loss of significant site features related to
landscaping or topography that are deemed to be of a
greater public value.
5. Runoff from the development site or within the street
does not require curbing for stormwater management.
In no event shall the waiver have the effect of creating
potentially hazardous vehicle and pedestrian conflict or nullifying
the intent and purpose and policies of the land development plan
relating to transportation and pedestrian infrastructure and the
regulations of this article.
At its discretion, the planning authority may refer any
petition for a waiver from the curb and sidewalk requirement to the
Planning Board for decision.
(c) The standards and requirements of this article may be
modified by the Planning Board in the case of a plan and program
for a planned unit development which in the judgment of the
Planning Board provides adequate public spaces and improvements for
the circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the
tract when fully developed and populated, and which also provides
such covenants or other legal provisions as will assure conformity
to and achievement of the land development plan.

(d) If at any time before or during the construction of the
required improvements the subdivider demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the project engineer and the public works authority
that unforeseen conditions make it necessary or preferable to
modify the design of the required improvements, the public works
authority may authorize modifications provided that the
modifications do not amount to a waiver or substantial alteration
of the function of any improvements required by the Planning Board.

judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards
or requirement so varied or modified.

thereof.
(b) Understory Plantings. All development
subject to required zoning setbacks
shall include a minimum of six (6)
shrubs per forty five (45) linear feet
of all frontages as measured along the
property line. A shrub shall be
defined as one shrub, one ornamental
grass, and/or 3 perennials. Required
shrubs may be installed anywhere on the

Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-526 Rev. 11-7-2016
14-798
(iii)Street Trees:
(a) All development shall include street
trees in numbers and locations as
specified in Section 4 of the Technical
Manual. Street trees are intended to
benefit public spaces by providing
green and natural elements that
contribute to the streetscape and the
urban forest ecosystem, provide health
benefits, and increase the tree canopy
to maximize shade and reduce energy
use. Street trees shall be planted in
the right-of-way, as specified in
Section 4 of the Technical Manual,
except where section (b) below applies.
Street trees shall be of a species
identified on the City of Portland
Recommended Tree List, unless otherwise
approved by the City Arborist or
his/her designee.
(b) Where the applicant can demonstrate
that site constraints prevent the
planting of required street trees in
the City right-of-way, the Reviewing
Authority may permit the following to
be counted towards the street tree
requirement, subject to the detailed
standards set out in the Technical
Manual:
i. The planting of new street trees
on public land or public
facilities in the neighborhood
where a reasonable chance of good
health and longevity is
documented;
ii. The provision of measures to
enhance tree survival (such as
raised planters, irrigation and
structural soils, as recommended
by the City Arborist) in
association with a street tree
will be counted towards the total
street tree requirement, based on
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-526 Rev. 11-7-2016
14-799
the cost of the measure divided by
the current street tree
contribution for a new tree;
iii. The preservation of existing
healthy trees that are six (6)
inches or more in caliper, visible
from the right-of-way and on the
site within twenty feet of the
property line;
iv. The planting of street trees where
visible from the right-of-way on
the site and within twenty feet of
the property line;
v. The installation of other planted
features in the right-of-way or
within 10 feet of the right-of-way
and visible from the right-of-way,
which are documented to the
satisfaction of the City Arborist
and Planning Authority to meet the
objectives of street trees and to
be feasible, viable and long-term
street features;
vi. A contribution for each required
street tree made to the City of
Portland’s Tree Fund as outlined
in the Technical Manual where the
other alternatives are not
feasible. The contribution would
primarily be for new trees in the
neighborhood of the development,
but would include an element of
maintenance; and/or
vii. Where the proposed development
includes the removal of an
existing street tree determined by
the City Arborist to be a Heritage
or feature tree, the applicant
shall be required to contribute to
the Tree Fund at the designated
rate in the Technical Manual so
that the total replacement cost is
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-526 Rev. 11-7-2016
14-800
significantly higher than planting
a new street tree/contributing for
a new street tree.
3. Water Quality, Stormwater Management and Erosion
Control:
a. All development must demonstrate that the
proposed site improvements are designed to
minimize the amount of stormwater leaving the
site. This must include consideration of the
design and location of improvements to minimize
the total area of impervious surface on the site
and stormwater management techniques to minimize
both the volume and rate of runoff from the lot.
The stormwater management plan must demonstrate
the following:
(i) Any stormwater draining onto or across the
lot in its pre-improvement state will not be
impeded or re-directed so as to create
ponding on, or flooding of, adjacent lots;
(ii) Any increase in volume or rate of stormwater
draining from the lot onto an adjacent lot
following the improvement can be handled on
the adjacent lot without creating ponding,
flooding or other drainage problems and that
the owner of the lot being improved has the
legal right to increase the flow of
stormwater onto the adjacent lot;
(iii)Any increase in volume or rate of stormwater
draining from the lot onto City property
following the improvement can be handled
without creating ponding, flooding or other
drainage problems and that the owner of the
lot being improved has the legal right to
increase the flow of stormwater onto the
City’s property; and
(iv) Any increase in volume or rate of stormwater
draining from the lot into the City’s
separate storm sewer system can be
accommodated in the system without creating
downstream problems or exceeding the
capacity of the storm sewer system.

precludes a building having an
average minimum lot depth
dimension of one hundred seventy
(170) feet; or
2. The proposed building has an
architecturally significant design
that is articulated to avoid a
monolithic appearance and
emphasizes slender, verticallyoriented
proportions while
employing a variety of scales,
materials, fenestration, and
massing to assure a rich visually
interesting experience as viewed
within the context of the downtown
skyline and provide visual
interest and human scale at the
pedestrian level;
3. In the event such a waiver is
granted the Planning Board may
require the applicant to mitigate
the impacts of the waiver by
requiring the following:
a. Along all public street
frontages and public open
spaces, all buildings
(regardless of height) shall
meet the B-7 Design Standard
E-4 Articulation to maintain
a pedestrian scale through

development site should be
separated to avoid the
appearance of a tall, solid
block massing. In accordance
with this policy, development
sites of 500 feet or greater
as measured parallel to
Marginal Way, the aggregate
building façade widths above
85 feet shall not exceed
fifty percent (50% of the
total development site
distance parallel to Marginal
Way. Buildings over one
hundred twenty-five (125)
feet in height that are being
reviewed as separate phases
of a Master Development Plan
shall be entitled to meet the
fifty percent (50%) building
requirement in aggregate for
all such buildings over one
hundred twenty-five (125)
feet in height in the Master
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14

public works authority, landscaping
improvements cannot practically be
completed due to seasonal weather
conditions.
(c) A performance guarantee shall be in place
and in an amount sufficient to cover all
remaining required improvements and not
less than 10% of the initial performance
guarantee amount.
iii. No temporary or permanent certificate of
occupancy shall be issued to any portion of
development where, in the opinion of the

Sec. 14-532. General requirements and enforcement.
(a) Approved site plans and required permits.
1. An approved site plan is a prerequisite to
issuance of building, street opening or
certificate of occupancy permits for development
subject to the provisions of this ordinance,
except the Planning Authority may grant written
authorization for the release of a demolition or
interior building permit upon written request of
the applicant describing the extent of proposed
work. Any exterior demolition requires a
performance guarantee for site stabilization.
2. Neither the acceptance of any application nor any
determination or approval hereunder shall
authorize the issuance of a permit under Chapter
6 (Building Code) for any use which would violate
the provisions of Article III of this chapter.
3. No building permit, certificate of occupancy or
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-532 Rev. 11-16-2015
14-838
street opening permit shall be issued until a
final site plan, or applicable components
thereof, has been approved under this article and
such permit is determined to be consistent with
the plan and any conditions of approval. In the
event of any inconsistency between the approved
site plan and any permit issued, the approved
site plan shall control; provided, however, site
plan approval shall not excuse failure to meet
any independent requirement of any other law or
ordinance.
4. The site shall be developed and maintained as
depicted in the site plan and the written
submission of the applicant. Modification of any
approved site plan or alteration of a parcel
which was the subject of site plan approval after
May 20, 1974, shall require the prior approval of
a revised site plan by the Planning Board or the
Planning Authority pursuant to the terms of this
article. Any such parcel lawfully altered prior
to the enactment date of these revisions shall
not be further altered without approval as
provided herein. Modification or alteration shall
mean and include any deviations from the approved
site plan including, but not limited to,
topography, vegetation and impervious surfaces
shown on the site plan.
(b) Revisions and amendments to Master Plans and approved
site plans.
1. Amendments to a Master Development Plan.
a. Minor amendments. A minor amendment to a Master
Development Plan shall be defined as a change
which is generally consistent with the approved
Master Developmetn Plan layout of buildings,
circulation infrastructure, and open spaces, and:
(i) Does not propose any new general type of use
beyond those approved initially;
(ii) Does not increase the building ground
coverage, floor area ratio or residential
density of the Master Development Plan;
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-532 Rev. 11-16-2015
14-839
(iii)Does not decrease any specified area
regulations or enumerated parking ratios;
and
(iv) Does not substantially change access,
circulation, or infrastructure on or
adjacent to the site.
The Planning Authority shall be authorized to
approve such minor amendments to a Master
Development Plan upon written application and
explanation of the change(s) by the owner (or its
agent) of the property. No further public
hearings shall be required.
2. Approved site plan: If at any time before or during
development the applicant requests minor amendments to
an approved plan for Level III development, the
Planning Authority may approve such minor amendments
under the procedures for minor development, provided
that they do not amount to a waiver or substantial
alteration of the site plan, and do not affect any
condition or requirement of the Planning Board. The
applicant shall supply an application and written
statement of the proposed amendment(s) and proposed
amended plans to the Planning Authority, whose
decision as to whether the amendment is minor shall be
final. The Planning Authority shall determine if a
notice of amendment shall be required and the extent
of such notice based on the extent and nature of the
proposed amendment to plan and the demonstrated public
interest related thereto.
3. Limited In-Field Changes: approved by the Public Works
Authority must be in writing and submitted to the
Planning Authority and are specifically limited to
minor variation necessary to deal with unforeseen
difficulties that arise during the course of
construction involving such technical detail as
utility location and substitution of equivalent
plantings and shall not include any substantial
alteration of the approved plan or change any
condition imposed by the Planning Board or Planning
Authority.

14-840
(c) Expiration of site plan approval.
1. A site plan approved under this article shall expire
twelve (12) months from the date of approval unless:
a. Development has been undertaken in accordance
with the approved plan and site work or building
construction is ongoing. Any lapse in
construction for a period in excess of twelve
(12) months shall result in an expiration of the
site plan; or
b. Prior to the expiration of the site plan, such
other time period is agreed upon, in writing, by
the Planning Authority and the applicant, not to
exceed three (3) years from the date of approval;
Provided that such extensions may not be granted if
changes to the City’s zoning ordinance would render the
development nonconforming in any respect or if changes in
the subdivision or site plan ordinance or in the Public
Works Technical Standards Manual or Planning and
Development Design Standards would otherwise
significantly impact the approved site plan as determined
by the Director of Planning and Urban Development.
2. Where the approval or any related land use approval
granted to the same applicant by any agency of the
City with respect to the same development is appealed
to any court by an opponent of the development, the
applicant shall be granted further extensions, beyond
the expiration of said period, where the applicant has
exercised due diligence with respect to defending such
appeal, which extensions shall not last beyond one (1)
year from entry of final judgment.
(d) Expiration of Master Development Plan:
1. A Master Development Plan approved under this article
shall expire six (6) years from the date of approval
unless:
a. Prior to the expiration nof the Master Development
Plan, an applicant may submit a written request to
the Planning Authority for an extension of a Master
Development Plan approval and associated waivers.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-532 Rev. 11-16-2015
14-841
Only two (2) such extensions may be granted by the
Planning Authority, and each such extension shall
be limited to two (2) years from the date of
expiration of the Master Development Plan.
Provided there have not been substantial changes to
the underlying zoning or site plan standards since
the date of the Master Development Plan approval
that would have a substantial impact on the Master
Development approval, the Planning Authority may
grant an extension. The Planning Authority may
condition the extension on an amendment of the
Master Development Plan to comply with such
applicable ordinance or site plan standard changes
provided that the Planning Authority may not
require changes in the uses approved on the Master
Development Plan or changes that would reduce the
gross floor area of the buildings described or
shown on the approved Master Development Plan. For
the purposes of this provision, gross floor area
includes the sum of the gross horizontal areas of
each floor of each building or structure from the
exterior face of exterior walls, or from the
centerline of a wall separating two buildings, but
excluding any space where the floor to ceiling
height is less than six (6) feet. Any decision by
the Planning Authority regarding the granting of an
extension may be appealed to the Planning Board as
provided for in Section 14-529;
b. Approved major or minor amendments to a Master
Development Plan do not alter the expiration date
for the Master Plan that is based upon the original
date of approval.
(e) Enforcement.
1. All construction or alterations to the site performed
under authorization of building permits or
certificates of occupancy issued for development
within the scope of the article shall be in
conformance with the approved final site plan or an
amendment thereto under section 14-532. The
Department of Planning and Urban Development shall
institute or cause to be instituted any and all
actions, legal or equitable, that may be appropriate
or necessary for the enforcement of this article.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14

14-842
Where work is required pursuant to the terms of
chapters 24 or 25 as part of an approval granted under
this article, such work shall be accomplished in the
sequence established by the Public Works Authority.
Where the Public Works Authority determines that work
has been completed prior to the receipt of all
approvals required by this article or which is out of
sequence or is not in compliance with the standards of
chapters 24 and 25, the Public Works Authority or an
inspector from the Department of Planning and Urban
Development may issue a stop work order. Work shall
recommence only after such order has been lifted by
the Department of Public Works or the Building
Authority on the basis of an approved mitigation plan
or action by the developer.
2. No alterations shall be made to a site with a pending
or approved site plan application until:
a. The performance guarantee has been posted and
final site plans have been submitted to the
Planning Authority.
b. Written permission has been received from the
Director of Planning and Urban Development or
his/her designee. Such permission shall be
granted only after submission of a written
request describing the proposed scope of work to
be conducted on the site and the planning
authority concludes that the request is
reasonable, time is imperative and the work
will not compromise any aspect of the ensuing
review process. All such work shall be done in
compliance with information provided with the
site plan application including, but not limited
to, an erosion control plan. Such written
permission shall not be required if the only work
proposed is the digging of test pits.
3. Where construction, alteration or modification to a
site is performed without a valid site plan
improvement permit, an after-the-fact permit shall be
obtained from the Planning Board or Planning
Authority, as applicable. The cost of an after-thefact
permit shall be as provided in section 6-18 of
this code, plus the cost of engineering and

ARTICLE VII. CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION
Sec. 14-565. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate the conversion of
rental housing to condominiums; to minimize the potential adverse
impacts of such conversion on tenants; to ensure that converted
such housing is safe and decent; and to maintain a reasonable
balance of housing alternatives within the city for persons of all
incomes. To these ends, this article shall be liberally construed.
(Ord. No. 213-81, § 608.1, 11-16-81)
Sec. 14-566. Applicability.
This article shall apply to the conversion of any rental unit
to a condominium unit.
(Ord. No. 213-81, § 608.2, 11-16-81)
Sec. 14-567. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, the following terms shall be
defined as follows, unless otherwise clearly implied:
Condominium means any interest in real estate created pursuant
to the Unit Ownership Act, 33 M.R.S.A. § 560 et seq., or its
equivalent, as it may from time to time be amended.
Developer means and includes any person or other legal entity,
but not including an established lending institution unless it is
an active participant in a common promotional scheme, who, whether
acting as principal or agent, records a declaration of condominium
that includes real estate, any portion of which was previously a
rental unit.
Tenant means and includes any occupant in lawful possession of
a rental unit, whether by lease, sublease, or otherwise.
Unit means any building, or portion thereof, used or intended
to be used primarily as a separate dwelling.

City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-567 Rev.11-16-1981
14-849
Sec. 14-568. Protection of tenants.
(a) Notice of intent to convert. A developer shall give to
each tenant written notice of intent to convert at least one
hundred twenty (120) days before the tenant is required by the
developer to vacate. If a tenant has been in possession of any unit
within the same building for more than four (4) consecutive years,
the notice period shall be increased by thirty (30) additional days
for each additional year, or fraction thereof, to a maximum of two
hundred forty (240) additional days. The notice shall set forth
specifically the rights of tenants under subsections (a) and (b) of
this section and section 14-569, and shall contain the following
statement:
If you do not buy your apartment, the developer of this
project is required by law to assist you in finding another place
to live and in determining your eligibility for relocation
payments. If you have questions about your rights under the law, or
complaints about the way you have been treated by the developer,
you may contact the Building Inspection Division, Department of
Planning and Urban Development, City of Portland, 389 Congress
Street, Portland, Maine 04101 (telephone: 874-8703).
If the notice specifies a date by which the tenant is required
to vacate, the notice may also serve as a notice of termination
under the applicable law of forcible entry and detainer, if it
meets the requirements thereof. The notice shall be hand-delivered
to the tenant or mailed, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, to the tenant at the address of the
unit or such other address as the tenant may provide. The notice
shall be effective when actually received. No tenant may be
required by a developer to vacate without having been given notice
as required herein, except for the reasons specified in the
applicable law of forcible entry and detainer, and in accordance
with the procedures thereof. The terms of a tenancy, including
rent, may not be altered during the notice period, except as
expressly provided in a preexisting written lease. If, within one
hundred twenty (120) days after a tenant is required by a developer
to vacate, the developer records a declaration of condominium
without having given notice as required herein, the developer shall
be presumed to have converted in violation of this article.
(b) Option to purchase. For a sixty-day period following the
giving of notice as required in subsection (a), the developer shall
grant to the tenant an exclusive and irrevocable option to purchase
the unit of which the tenant is then possessed, which option may
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-568 Rev.11-16-1981
14-850
not be assigned. If the tenant does not purchase or contract to
purchase the unit during the sixty-day period, the developer may
not convey or offer to convey the unit to any other person during
the following one hundred eighty (180) days at a price or on terms
more favorable than the price or terms previously offered to the
tenant, unless the more favorable price or terms are first offered
exclusively and irrevocably to the tenant for an additional

process.
(b) An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall
be treated as an application for a certificate of economic hardship
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-637 Rev.5-17-1993
14-878
under division 8, whenever the historic preservation board or the
Planning Board, as applicable, determines that the proposed
alteration includes any demolition which would:
1. Have the effect of causing the structure to no longer
meet the criteria for designation of division 3; or
2. Materially impair the significance and integrity of the
structure.
(c) Where a determination under paragraph (b) is made by the
historic preservation board, the planning board shall review that
decision as a preliminary matter, whether the historic preservation
board has taken final action with respect to the application or
not. Upon any final determination that an application for a
certificate of appropriateness is required to be treated as an
application for a certificate of economic hardship, no further
action shall be taken with respect to the application until that
certificate is applied for and is granted.
(d) Where the applicant has done work or caused work to be
done on a structure or a property for which a certificate of
appropriateness is sought and such work is either not done in
compliance with an approval received under this article or was
performed without the approvals required under this article, no
application for such structure or property shall be considered by
the department or by the historic preservation board until such
work is brought into compliance with the requirements of this
article. The historic preservation board may waive this requirement
if the historic preservation board determines that the work does
not alter the essential character of the structure or district and
one (1) or more of the following standards are also met:
1. The work was needed to bring a building into conformance
with any building or safety code;
2. The applicant can demonstrate a good faith belief that
necessary approvals had been received for the work at
issue prior to the commencement of the work; or
3. The applicant can demonstrate a good faith belief that
the work done was not subject to review under this
article.
Review of any application by the department or by the historic
preservation board shall not constitute waiver of any future claims
by the city concerning violations and shall not stop the city from
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-637 Rev.5-17-1993
14-879
prosecuting any violation.
(e) Once a completed application has been submitted, it shall
be diligently pursued. Failure of an applicant to attend two (2) or
more historic preservation board meetings at which an application
is scheduled for review shall cause the application to expire and
to be deemed null and void, unless the department determines that
good cause is shown for the failure to attend. Where good cause is
shown for a failure to attend, the historic preservation board
shall table an application to a date mutually agreed upon in
writing.

Sec. 14-638. Review process for certificate of appropriateness,
except as provided elsewhere in this division.
(a) The process for review of an application for a
certificate of appropriateness shall be as follows, except to the
extent specifically provided elsewhere in this division:
1. The department shall review the application and make a
recommendation to the historic preservation board based
upon the standards in division 7, except as provided in
subsection (b) for historic plaques or markers. The
recommendation of the department shall be made within
(30) days of receipt of a complete application.
2. Whenever the recommendation of the department is that the
application shall be approved, the application shall be
placed upon the next consent agenda of the historic
preservation board, except as provided in subsection (b).
Any member of the historic preservation board may remove
an application from the consent agenda for the purpose of
giving it a public hearing.
3. Whenever the recommendation of the department is that the
application not be approved or there is no timely
recommendation, the application shall be scheduled for a
public hearing at the next meeting of the historic
preservation board which allows for adequate notice.
4. The historic preservation board shall either conduct a
public hearing or make a decision on the application
within thirty (30) days following receipt of the
application from the department. The historic
preservation board shall review the application and any
negative recommendation of the department. If an item is
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-638 Rev.9-8-2004
14-880
scheduled for historic preservation board review, the
historic preservation board shall cause notice of the
application to be given to all property owners within one
hundred (100) feet of the property at least seven (7)
days prior to the date of the hearing.
5. The historic preservation board shall enter findings of
fact concerning the relationship between the application
and the applicable standards of division 7 immediately
following a denial or conditional approval of any
certificate of appropriateness.
6. Written notice of the determination of the historic
preservation board on the application, including a copy
of the findings of fact, shall be sent by regular mail to
the applicant and to the planning board within ten (10)
business days following its determination.
7. The applicant and any owner of abutting property or of
property located within the same district aggrieved by
the decision may object to the proposed decision by
filing a notice of objection with the department within
thirty (30) days following the mailing of the notice of
determination of the historic preservation board;
provided, however, only the applicant may object where no
building permit or site plan review is required for the
work which requires the issuance of the certificate of
appropriateness, and a proposed decision approving any
such application shall be deemed final upon being reduced
to writing and provided to the applicant. In the absence
of filing of such objection, upon expiration of said
thirty (30) days the proposed decision shall become
final. If a timely objection is received, the application
shall be placed on the planning board agenda and shall be
disposed of in accordance with section 14-639. The
planning board shall deny the appeal unless it finds that
the action of the historic preservation board was
arbitrary or capricious or was not based on substantial
evidence. Review by the planning board under this section
is intended to be appellate in nature. Except where the
planning board determines that injustice would result,
the planning board shall determine the appeal without
considering any facts or arguments which were not
presented to the historic preservation board. Where the
planning board finds it necessary to consider such new
evidence in order to do substantial justice, it shall
remand the matter to the historic preservation board for
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14

DIVISION 7. STANDARDS FOR REVIEW OF APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE
OF APPROPRIATENESS
Sec. 14-650. Standards for review of alteration.
In considering an application for a certificate of
appropriateness involving alteration, the historic preservation
board and the Planning Board shall apply the following general
standards, as further described in the design manual and any design
guidelines in the ordinance designating the landmark or district:
(a) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a
compatible use for a property which requires minimal
alteration to the character-defining features of the
structure, object or site and its environment or to use a
property for its originally intended purpose.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-650 Rev.5-17-1993
14-886
(b) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a
structure, object or site and its environment shall not
be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic
material or distinctive architectural features should be
avoided when possible.
(c) All sites, structures and objects shall be recognized as
products of their own time, place and use. Alterations
that have no historical basis or create a false sense of
historical development, such as adding conjectural
features or elements from other properties, shall be
discouraged.
(d) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time
are evidence of the history and development of a
structure, object or site and its environment. Changes
that have acquired significance in their own right shall
not be destroyed.
(e) Distinctive features, finishes and construction
techniques or examples of skilled craftsmanship which
characterize a structure, object or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
(f) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather
than replaced wherever feasible. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature should match the feature being
replaced in composition, design, texture and other visual
qualities and, where possible, materials. Repair or
replacement of missing historic features should be based
on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by
documentary, physical or pictorial evidence rather than
on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other structures or objects.
(g) The surface cleaning of structures and objects, if
appropriate, shall be undertaken with the gentlest means
possible. Chemical or physical treatments, such as
sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials
shall not be undertaken.
(h) Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and
preserve significant archeological resources affected by
or adjacent to any project. If resources must be
disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.

alterations and additions do not destroy significant
cultural, historical, architectural or archeological
materials that characterize the property. The new work
shall be differentiated from the old and shall be
compatible with the size, scale, color, material and
character of the property, neighborhood or environment.
(j) Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to
structures and objects shall be undertaken in such a
manner that, if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity
of the historic property would be unimpaired.

ARTICLE XIV. MORATORIUM ON DEMOLITION OF HOUSING UNITS
-------
*Editor's Note: Order No. 221-99 adopted February 1, 1999 enacted a
moratorium on the demolition of buildings in the area of Bayside. The moratorium
was in effect January 1, 1999 through May 1, 1999.
-------
Sec. 14-902. Findings and declaration of emergency.
The city council hereby finds and declares:
(a) The strong economy has increased the demand for housing
beyond the supply available in the city and the
surrounding area;
(b) The rental vacancy rate in the city has been extremely
tight (0 to 2%) for the last 3 years, well below the
vacancy rate which is considered healthy for a community,
allowing choice and maintaining moderate prices;
(c) The lack of supply has pushed rent levels beyond the
level which low and moderate income families and
individuals can afford;

Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-899 Rev.8-5-2002
14-949
(d) Due to high cost of construction and the lack of land,
very few new affordable multifamily units are being built
in the city;
(e) The lack of supply of affordable housing and high rents
hurt the vulnerable populations the most, e.g. those with
disabilities, the working poor and the elderly;
(f) Several pending developments in the City contemplate the
demolition of residential property or its conversion to
nonresidential use;
(g) Housing, because of its scarcity and high costs, is an
extremely valuable resource in the City of Portland. Once
lost, it is very difficult to replace; and
(h) The City currently has under consideration methods to
preserve and expand existing housing as well as proposals
to require the replacement of housing which is either
demolished or converted to nonresidential use:
Now, therefore, in order to permit the development and
implementation of methods which will preserve Portland’s existing
housing stock as well as to require replacement of dwelling units
which are demolished or converted to nonresidential use, it is
found and declared that a temporary moratorium is necessary to
allow the City to accomplish those goals.
(Ord. No. 26-02/03, 8-5-02)
Sec. 14-903. Moratorium on demolition of housing units.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, including,
but not limited to, the provisions of Chapters 6 and 14, no permit
shall be issued or granted and no new applications shall be
accepted by the Building Authority or the Planning Authority from
and after August 5, 2002 up to and including Monday, October 7,
2002, for the demolition of any dwelling or dwelling units,
including single-family, two-family, and multi-family dwellings,
lodging houses, sheltered care group homes, and rooming units
anywhere within the City of Portland.
It is further found and determined that it is necessary that
this article take effect immediately as an emergency, pursuant to
article II, section 8 of the City Charter.

non-residential use.
(c) Any demolition or conversion approved by the Portland
Planning Board under the Site Plan Review and Conditional Use
Standards of Chapter 14 of the Portland Code prior to July 1,

ARTICLE XVI. CITIZEN ADVISORY COMMITTEE
Sec. 14-1000. Purpose.
Pressures of growth in the community strain the
relationship between neighborhoods and business and therefore a
challenge exists to improve communication with, and timely

common ground and a desire to address the planning development
challenges by constructively working and communicating with the
public. The City desires a committee to meet on a quarterly
basis that will 1) comment upon the integration and consistency
of neighborhood plans with the Comprehensive Plan, 2) facilitate
the exchange of information between existing and future planning

ARTICLE XVII. Impact Fees.
14-1004. Authority.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-1002 Rev. 11-19-2018
14-954
This article is enacted pursuant to the authority of 30-A M.R.S. §
4354 and 30-A M.R.S. § 3001.
(Ord. No. 98-18/19, 11-19-2018
14-1005. Purpose.
The purpose of these impact fee provisions is to ensure that new
development in the City of Portland bears a proportional or
reasonably-related share of the cost of new, expanded, or
replacement infrastructure necessary to service that development
through:
(a) The payment of impact fees dedicated to funding
improvements made necessary by development; or
(b) The construction of improvements as provided for herein.
(Ord. No. 98-18/19, 11-19-2018)
14-1006. Applicability.
The following shall be subject to impact fees, with the exception
of municipal buildings, which shall be considered exempt:
(a) Any new building or addition to existing buildings which
results in net new residential dwelling units, non-residential
building square footage, or water/wastewater meters; and
(b) Any change of use which results in a net increase in
impact fee per Section 14-1007(f).
(Ord. No. 98-18/19, 11-19-2018)
14-1007. Calculation of Impact Fee.
(a) In General. Impact fees shall be calculated based on the
impact fee schedule in effect at the time of submittal of a
complete application for a building permit.
(b) Determination of Use. The determination of the applicable
land use category in the impact fee schedule shall be made by the
Department of Permitting and Inspections with reference to the City
of Portland’s most recent Impact Fee Study. If the proposed
development is of a type not listed in the impact fee schedule,
then the impact fees applicable to the most nearly comparable type
of land use listed in the impact fee schedule shall be used.
(c) Mixed Use Development. In the event that there is more
than one use within a building, impact fees shall be calculated
separately for each use.
City of Portland Land Use

Sec. 14-1002 Rev. 11-19-2018
14-955
(d) Redevelopment. In calculating the impact fee for a new
building that involves the full or partial demolition of a building
housing an existing, legally established use or uses, such new
building shall be credited with an amount equal to the fee that
would have been charged to the use or uses which occupied the
structure at the time of demolition permit. If the impact fee
calculation for the post-development condition is greater than the
credit, the applicant shall pay the difference. If the impact fee
calculation for the post-development condition is less than the
credit, then the applicant shall not be required to pay an impact
fee. The City shall not grant credits for demolitions for which a
permit was issued more than 12 months prior to the complete
application for a building permit.

of use, each developed property shall be credited with an amount
equal to the fee that would have been charged to the existing use
at the time of application for building permit. If the impact fee
calculation for the proposed use is greater than the credit, the
applicant shall pay the difference. If the impact fee calculation
for the proposed use is less than the credit, then the applicant
shall not be required to pay an impact fee. The City shall not
grant credits for uses which have been discontinued for a period of

permit.
(Ord. No. 98-18/19, 11-19-2018)
14-1008. Annual Adjustment of Impact Fee.
To account for inflation, there shall be an automatic annual
increase in the impact fee schedule reflected in this article every
January 1 based on the change in the construction cost index as
published by Engineering News Record. The fee adjustment shall be
calculated by dividing the index amount published on January 1 of
the current year by the index amount published on January 1, 2018
and multiplying the resulting ratio by each fee amount. Annual
adjustments shall be made available for public reference.

City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-1002 Rev. 11-19-2018
14-958
(a) A required impact fee may be modified, in whole or in
part, by formal vote of the Planning Board in cases when an
applicant is otherwise before the Planning Board, or by the
Planning Authority in all other cases, if the reviewing authority
finds that:
1. The developer or property owner who would otherwise be
responsible for the payment of the impact fee voluntarily
agrees to make infrastructure improvements for which the
impact fee would be collected or an equivalent
improvement approved by the reviewing authority; or
2. The developer or property owner is required, as part of a
development approval by the City or a state or federal
agency, to make or to pay for infrastructure improvements
for which the impact fee would be collected or an
equivalent improvement.
Credit amounts shall be determined based on plans, details, and
cost estimates for the proposed infrastructure improvements for
which the credit is requested. Such plans, details, and cost
estimates shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and
submitted at the time of site plan, subdivision, or building permit
application. The applicant shall pay for any third-party review of
plans, details, or cost estimates. On-site or immediately adjacent
improvements providing direct service to a site as required under
subdivision or site plan regulations shall not be considered
eligible under this section.
(b) The Planning Board may by formal vote modify the payment
of a required impact fee, in whole or in part, if it finds that
documentation is provided to demonstrate that a proposed use will
impose no or substantially-reduced demands on capital facilities
for which impact fees have been adopted. Such documentation shall
be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and include a
written analysis of the demand for capital facilities generated by
the proposed use based on industry standards and the most recent
Impact Fee Study. Documentation shall be submitted at the time of
site plan, subdivision, or building permit application. The
applicant shall pay for any third-party review of plans, details,
or cost estimates.
(Ord. No. 98-18/19, 11-19-2018)
14-1010. Reduction in Fees For Affordable Housing.

486.
(Ord. No. 98-18/19, 11-19-2018)
14-1011. Collection of Impact Fee.
The City of Portland shall not issue any certificate of occupancy
required under the Land Use Code until the applicant has paid any
impact fees required by this article.
(Ord. No. 98-18/19, 11-19-2018)
14-1012. Segregation of Impact Fees from General Revenues.
Impact fees collected pursuant to this article shall be maintained
in separate, non-lapsing impact fee accounts for each of the
facilities for which impact fees are assessed, and shall be
segregated from the City’s general revenues. These accounts shall
be dedicated for funding of the improvements for which the fee is
collected, as determined through the City’s most recent Impact Fee
Study. Funds from these accounts shall be distributed to City
departments solely for the purpose of capital projects identified
in the City of Portland’s most recent Impact Fee Study.
(Ord. No. 98-18/19, 11-19-2018)
14-1013. Use of Impact Fees.
Impact fees collected by the City pursuant to this article may be
used only for financing facility improvements which the City
Council, through the City of Portland’s most recent Impact Fee
Study, has determined are made necessary by new development. The
City Council has determined that fees imposed by schedules in this
article are reasonably related to the demands created by new
development. Impact fees collected pursuant to this article shall
be used exclusively for capital improvements, and the City of
Portland shall expend funds collected from impact fees solely for
the purposes for which they were collected.
(Ord. No. 98-18/19, 11-19-2018)
14-1014. Refund of Unused Impact Fees.
Impact fees collected pursuant to this article shall be used by the
City according to the schedules for the completion of specific
capital improvements as specified in the City of Portland’s most
recent Impact Fee Study, but in no event later than ten years after
the date upon which the impact fee was collected. Any impact fees
which are not so used and any impact fees collected which exceed
the City’s actual costs of implementing the infrastructure
improvements for which such fees were collected shall be refunded.
City of Portland Land Use
Code of Ordinances Chapter 14
Sec. 14-1002 Rev. 11-19-2018

Refunds shall be paid to the owner of record of the property for
which the impact fee was collected, determined as of the date the
refund is made.
(Ord. No. 98-18/19, 11-19-2018)
14-1015. Review and Revision.
The impact fees established in this article are based upon the best
estimates of the costs of the construction of the facilities for
which the fees are collected as determined through the City’s most
recent Impact Fee Study. The Council may, by amendments to this
article, change the amounts of the impact fees from time to time as
warranted by new information or changed circumstances.
(Ord. No. 98-18/19, 11-19-2018)

The provisions of this article shall apply to all building permit
applications submitted following the effective date of this

article shall be considered exempt. Master Development Plan
approval prior to the effective date shall not confer exempt
status.

(5) The licensee has violated any provision of this Code in
the course of the conduct of the activity or device for
which the license or licenses have been applied for, or
have been issued; or
(6) The occurrence of any event subsequent to issuance of the
license which event would have been a basis for denial of
the license shall be grounds for revocation thereof; or
(7) The applicant's or licensee's real or personal property
taxes, or final judgments due and payable to the city,

hearing.
(2) In the case of the suspension or revocation of a license,
a hearing shall be given to the licensee and a
generalized statement of the nature of the complaint
constituting the basis for the proposed action shall be
included in the notice of hearing. Unexcused failure of
licensee to appear at the hearing shall be deemed a

result in the issuance of the license being delayed more than one
hundred eighty (180) days from its approval by the Permitting and
Inspections Department.

decision appealed from. The taking of an appeal shall not stay a
decision appealed from, except that at the request of the licensee,
the Permitting and Inspections Department may stay the effective
date of a suspension, revocation or denial of a renewal license
upon a finding that the public is not likely to suffer any harm
during the pendency of the appeal. In such case, the Permitting and
Inspections Department shall make a written finding of his or her
decision in this regard and shall notify the appellant.
(b) Scope of review. On appeal, the hearing officer shall
review the decision of the Permitting and Inspections Department
and any disciplinary action taken pursuant thereto to determine

disciplinary action taken was proportionate to the violation. The
hearing officer may take additional evidence with respect to such
decision or action and if additional testimony or evidence is taken
shall determine the appeal upon all of the evidence, except as
provided in this section.
(c) Appeal to the superior court. Any person aggrieved by a

Sec. 15-10. Notices of hearing.
(a) Content. Whenever a public hearing is required, the

nature of the hearing, and the address or location of the property
involved.

least once, not more than thirty (30), nor less than seven (7) days
before the date of the hearing. Where notice to abutters is
required, all owners or occupants of property within five hundred
(500) feet of such parcel or tract shall be deemed to be abutters,
and service shall be made by ordinary mail at least seven (7) days
before the date of the hearing. In the case of abutters, the owners
and occupants of property listed in the assessor's records on the
last tax date prior thereto, shall be deemed to be the persons to
whom notice is to be given. The Permitting and Inspections
Department shall take reasonable measures to notify renters in
close proximity.
(c) Notice requirements not mandatory. Failure of any person
other than the applicant or licensee to receive a notice of the
public hearing shall not necessitate another hearing and shall not
invalidate any action taken as a result thereof, except as
otherwise expressly provided by law.
(Code 1968, § 901.10; Ord. No. 231-80, 12-2-80; Ord. No. 165-15/16, 3-7-2016;

Sec. 15-11. License not to be transferable.
(a) No license shall be transferred to any person, to any
location, or to any other vehicle or device, and no license fee
shall be refunded if the licensed activity is ceased prior to the
expiration of the license. All purported transfers not in
accordance with this section are void. A license shall be deemed
City of Portland Licenses and Permits
Code of Ordinances Chapter 15
Sec. 15-11 Rev. 8-21-2017
15-12
the subject of an attempted transfer whenever there is a sale of
the business, vehicle or device, or where there is a change in
actual ownership interest. Upon any such event, the licensee shall
immediately surrender the license to the Permitting and Inspections
Department; except that, in the case of death, bankruptcy or
receivership of any licensee, the duly appointed executor or
administrator of the deceased licensee or the duly appointed
trustee or receiver of the bankrupted licensee or licensee
receivership may retain the license and operate under the same for
the benefit of the estate with the written permission and approval
of the Permitting and Inspections Department until such time as
such operation is no longer needed to benefit the estate.
Thereafter, such personal representatives, receivers, or trustees
shall either return the license to the Permitting and Inspections
Department or transfer same to any other person, under order of the
court having jurisdiction and upon written notice to the Permitting
and Inspections Department. In the interim, between the death of
the licensee and the appointment of an executor or administrator,
or in cases where no administration of the estate of a deceased
licensee is contemplated, the widow or widower or person designated
by all of the heirs of the deceased licensee may take over the
license upon written notice to the Permitting and Inspections
Department. Duly appointed and qualified guardians and conservators
of the estate of a licensee may retain the license of their ward
during the term of office upon written notice to the Permitting and
Inspections Department.
(b) In all cases arising out of this section in which the
Permitting and Inspections Department is required to determine the
identity or composition of or ownership interests in an applicant
or licensee, or to determine whether a transfer of an ownership
interest in an applicant or licensee has taken place, he shall look
to the substance rather than the form of transactions and any
person aggrieved may appeal the Permitting and Inspections
Department's determination to the city manager.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 24-1. Purpose
The city is responsible for the health and safety of the
public and maintaining over 300 miles of sewer line comprised of
the sanitary sewer and storm sewer lines themselves, catch basins,
manholes, detention ponds, underground waste water storage
facilities, and sewer pump stations.
The city maintains a sewer system in order to convey domestic
wastewater and stormwater runoff from private and public property
for treatment at the Publicly Owned Treatment Works.
The city maintains a stormwater drainage system in order to
convey stormwater runoff away from private and public property to
minimize flooding, reduce pollution discharge to waters of the
State of Maine, and to control erosion of streams and channels.
The city council finds that funding the comprehensive
wastewater and stormwater programs to properly operate this
infrastructure should be equitably paid for by properties making
use of sewer and stormwater services provided by the city according
to costs incurred to provide those services.

designed to be occupied by one (1) or more natural persons as a
single housekeeping unit with sanitary facilities, other than a
place of public accommodation as defined hereinafter, discharging
only domestic wastewater and shall include each unit of ownership
in any condominium. If the occupant or occupants of rooms fit the
definition of a dwelling unit except for the fact that the
occupants share sanitary facilities with an occupant or occupants
of other rooms located within the same structure, the number of
units in the structure shall be deemed to be the total number of
toilets or urinals located within such structure.
Parcel of land shall mean any area of land shown on the
assessor's maps on the April first last preceding the operative
date, located within the city, which is either connected in fact to
a sewer within the city, or developed-but-unconnected to a sewer
within the city, which sewer is nevertheless accessible to the area
within the meaning of section 24-36.
Place of public accommodation shall mean any establishment
having sanitary facilities located therein which gives or offers
shelter or lodging to members of the general public, whether
transient or long term and shall include but is not limited to
hotels, motels, guest houses, hospitals, rest homes, nursing homes,
inns, fraternity houses and dormitories.
Treatment facilities shall mean all wastewater treatment
plants owned and operated by the Portland Water District or by the

(a) Applicability. There are levied upon all parcels of land
charges for cost of treatment of wastewater and stormwater and for
the operation and maintenance of the wastewater system.
(b) Billing. Bills for all charges under this article may be
sent to the record owner, or to the person requesting water
service. Bills shall be sent to each such owner or person every
month, except that persons billed quarterly or seasonally by the
Portland Water District for water service may be billed quarterly
or seasonally for all charges under this article. All payments
shall be credited against the oldest outstanding bill sent to such
owner or person. Any payments made to the Portland Water District
or its agents, which do not indicate to which account they are to
be applied, shall be applied as provided by contract between the
city and the Portland Water District.
Bills shall contain an amount for sanitary sewer user charges,
and if delinquent as provided in section 1-16 of this Code, shall
include charges for interest to be computed in the same manner as
provided for real estate taxes.
(c) Computation. The user charges shall be computed in
accordance with the following schedule, as from time to time
amended, which shall be sufficient to meet costs of the eligible
purposes for which such charges may be used. Beginning July 1,
2019, user charges under this section for both dwelling units and
commercial units shall be ten dollars and forty cents ($10.40) per
hundred cubic feet of volume for connected parcels of land. The
user charge for developed but unconnected parcels of land shall be
one dollar and seventy-one cents ($1.71) per hundred cubic feet of
volume. Each metered billing unit shall have a minimum charge of
at least one hundred (100) cubic feet per month.
(d) Purposes for which charges may be used. Charges and
assessments made under this article shall be used consistently with
33 U.S.C.A. § 1281 et seq., and applicable federal regulations for

Sec. 24-73. Industrial surcharges.
(a) Applicability. Each industrial user except those included
in the Westbrook Inter-Municipal Sewer Service Agreement Area,
shall be subject to surcharges in addition to any other treatment
charge if the wastewater discharged by such user is determined by
the Department of Public Works, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136,
to exceed any of the following concentrations:
(1) BOD of two hundred fifty (250) mg/l; or COD, where
indicated for specific wastewater and a correlation
between BOD and COD is established in such wastewater; or
TOC, where indicated for specific wastewater and a
correlation is established between TOC and BOD in such
wastewater;
(2) TSS content of three hundred (300) mg/l.
(b) Computation of surcharge for BOD. The surcharge for BOD
shall reflect the cost of removing the excess BOD and shall be
computed in accordance with the following formula:
City of Portland Sewers
Code of Ordinances Chapter 24
Sec. 24-73 Rev. 1-1-2016
24-28
Surcharge for BOD = (C1 - 250 mg.l) x Q x 8.34 x S1
Where C1 = The concentration of BOD in mg/l
Q = The total volume of wastewater contributed during the billing
period, in millions of gallons
8.34 = Conversion factor of gallons to pounds
S1 = $0.1633 for each pound of BOD in dollars
(c) Computation of surcharge for TSS. The surcharge for TSS
shall reflect the cost of removing the excess TSS and shall be
computed in accordance with the following formula:
Surcharge for TSS = (C2 - 300 mg/l) x Q x 8.34 x S2
Where C2 = The concentration of TSS in mg/l
Q = Total volume of wastewater contributed during the billing
period, in millions of gallons
8.34 = Conversion factor of gallons to pounds
S2 = $0.0817 for each pound of TSS in dollars
(d) Westbrook Inter-Municipal Sewer Service Agreement area
may be surcharged for BOD and TSS, based on the cost of treatment
at the Westbrook Gorham Regional Treatment Plant.
(e) Industrial surcharge fee. An industrial surcharge fee is
hereby established for all permitted discharges from all permitted
users at a rate of $0.0857 per hundred cubic feet of volume,
provided that the city council may, from time to time, by order,
readjust the surcharge fee according to the then prevailing cost of
administering the industrial pretreatment program and the
anticipated number of permitted users and anticipated volume to be
surcharged.
(f) Appeals. Any person aggrieved by a determination of the
Department of Public Works made pursuant to this section may appeal
such determination to the city manager, within thirty (30) days of
notification of such determination. Such person may submit
additional evidence and shall be heard orally by the manager or his
deputy. The manager may modify the Department of Public Works'
City of Portland Sewers
Code of Ordinances Chapter 24
Sec. 24-73 Rev. 1-1-2016
24-29
determination if satisfied that the determination was erroneous,
inconsistent with this chapter, or with applicable rules,
regulations or grant requirements made pursuant to 33 U.S.C.A. c.
26. All determinations of the manager shall be rendered within a
reasonable period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days from the
date of such hearing and shall be final.

2015, Effective 1-1-2016)
Sec. 24-74. Reserved.
Sec. 24-75. Volume measurements.
(a) Water volume measurements. Whenever in this article there
is reference to volume of water, and the charges of such person are
computed in whole or in part upon such volume of water, the use of
such standard shall give the Department of Public Works the right
to require any person obtaining water from sources other than the
Portland Water District to install and maintain at such person's
own expense water meters of a type approved by the Department of
Public Works for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from their other sources and to report the volume of such
water recorded by such meter to the Department of Public Works.
Following installation, such meter shall not be removed without the
written permission of the Department of Public Works.
(b) Wastewater volume. Devices for measuring the volume of
wastewater discharged by a commercial or industrial user may be
required by the Department of Public Works if these volumes cannot
be determined from the water volume records. Any person who is a
commercial or industrial user may, at his option, install devices
approved by the Department of Public Works for the metering of
wastewater and may have the charges based upon the volume of
wastewater rather than upon water volume. All metering devices for
determining the volume of wastewater shall be installed, owned and
maintained by the person to be charged. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of
the Department of Public Works and may be read by the Department of
Public Works at all reasonable times.
(c) Submetering of water volume. Any person who feels that
recorded water records are not a reliable index of his discharge
volume may install an additional water meter of a type approved by
the Department of Public Works to measure the volume of water which
can be shown not to enter the sewerage system. The person
installing such a meter shall immediately notify the Department of
City of Portland Sewers
Code of Ordinances Chapter 24
Sec. 24-75 Rev. 1-1-2016
24-30
Public Works of such installation and shall be responsible to the
Department of Public Works for reporting meter readings once every
month. Such person shall be credited with the volume charges for
the volume shown by such meter, which meter shall be accessible for
reading by the city or its agents at all reasonable times.
(d) Review. Any person subject to charges under this article
may make a written request for review of such charges by the city
manager as provided in section 1-16 of this Code. The city manager
may review and modify such charges, to the extent that justice
requires, upon affirmative proof by such person that:
(1) The volume of metered water consumed exceeds the volume
of wastewater generated by the unit;
(2) The difference between the volume of water and of
wastewater exceeds ten (10) percent of the metered water
measurement;
(3) The amount of the difference can be established to a
substantial certainty by reliable tests or is documented
by reliable sources prepared for purposes unconnected
with wastewater disposal; and
(4) Measurement by the measuring devices provided for in the
preceding subsections is impossible or impractical.

ARTICLE V. STORMWATER SERVICE CHARGES
Sec. 24-80. Purpose; Stormwater Service.
Stormwater services assist the city in meeting the regulatory
obligations imposed by national pollutant discharge elimination
system (NPDES) permits or other court orders or regulations
promulgated from the act by reducing pollution and improving water
quality within the city.
Stormwater services assist the city in protecting the public
health, safety and welfare and the environment and providing
stormwater services and regulation of the use thereof renders
and/or results in both service and benefit to individual
properties, property owners, business, citizens, and residents of
the city and to all properties, property owners, businesses,
citizens, and residents of the city concurrently and for the
environment.
The area of impervious surface on each property is the most
important factor influencing the cost of providing stormwater
services by the city or to be provided by the city in the future,
and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore
the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic
stormwater service charge.
The City of Portland presently owns and operates storm sewers,
combined sewers, and the stormwater drainage system, which have
been developed over many years. The future usefulness of those
existing services owned and operated by the city, and of additions
and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to
effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance
stormwater services in the city with the management of other water
resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have
adequate and stable funding for its stormwater service operating
needs and capital program.
Stormwater services are needed throughout the city because
many of those areas are developed. While specific service and
facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in
time, a stormwater service area encompassing all lands and water
bodies within the city is consistent with the present and future
needs of the community.
The provision of stormwater services in the city promotes an
essential regulatory purpose by influencing where stormwater runoff
City of Portland Sewers
Code of Ordinances Chapter 24
Sec. 24-80 Rev. 1-1-2016
24-32
flows and how it is managed, thereby reducing flooding, erosion and
water pollution caused by stormwater runoff.
By mitigating the impact of stormwater runoff from developed
properties, stormwater services provided by the city help minimize
damage that would subject a parcel owner to civil liability.
The city council is responsible for the protection and
preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, and the environment and finds that it is in the best
interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the
city and the community at large and the environment to provide
stormwater services accounted for in the city budget as a separate
enterprise fund dedicated solely to the provision of stormwater
services and to institute funding methods associated therewith.
In order to fully recover the cost of providing stormwater
services a stormwater service charge is the most fair and
reasonable means of apportioning the cost among developed land
throughout the city.
(Ord. 129-14/15, 1-21-2015, Effective 1-1-2016
Sec. 24-81. Definitions.
Unless the context specifically provides otherwise, the
meanings of terms used in this article shall be as follows:
Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a
stormwater service charge to developed land based on the provision
and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and
operational approved on-site stormwater system or facility or other
service or activity that reduces the cost of providing service.
Developed land shall mean property altered from its natural
state by construction or installation of more than 400 square feet
of impervious surfaces as defined in this chapter.
Exemption shall mean not applying to, or removing the
application of the stormwater service charge from, a property. No
permanent exemption shall be granted based on taxable or nontaxable
status or economic status of the property owner.
Impervious surfaces are those areas that prevent or impede the
infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural
conditions prior to development. Impervious surfaces include, but
are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas,
City of Portland Sewers
Code of Ordinances Chapter 24
Sec. 24-81 Rev. 1-1-2016
24-33
driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel surfaces,
awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces
that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater
runoff which existed prior to development.
Undeveloped land shall mean land in its unaltered natural
state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have
a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural
state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have less
than or equal to 400 square feet of impervious surfaces as defined
in this chapter consisting of limited pavement, asphalt, or
compacted dirt or gravel surfaces or structures which create an
impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or
cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner
materially different than that which would occur naturally.
(Ord. 129-14/15, 1-21-2015, Effective 1-1-2016)
Sec. 24-82. Authority and Establishment of the Stormwater
Fund.
(a) Under the authority of the Maine Constitution, Article
VIII, and Title 30-A M.R.S. § 3001, the city hereby establishes the
stormwater service charge to fund stormwater services within the
city. Such stormwater charges shall be maintained and accounted for
separately in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles as determined by the city’s finance director.
(b) Charges made under this article shall be used for the
following purposes:
To defray the current expenses of stormwater services and
a portion of the current expenses of the combined sewer system
attributable to providing stormwater service;
To pay the interest and repay the principal on any
outstanding or future indebtedness of the city for
construction of the storm drainage system and a portion of the
combined sewer systems heretofore or hereafter constructed
within the city similarly attributable to providing stormwater
service;
To reimburse the city for the cost of computation,
billing, and enforcement of such charges.
(c) The city manager will designate appropriate Department of
Public Works management and other personnel, including support as
City of Portland Sewers
Code of Ordinances Chapter 24
Sec. 24-82 Rev. 7-1-2018
24-34
needed of personnel from other city departments such as finance, to
provide stormwater services and to collect and account for the
stormwater service charge imposed hereunder.
(Ord. 129-14/15, 1-21-2015, Effective 1-1-2016)
Sec. 24-83. Exemptions.
Exemptions from stormwater charges established under this
article are not allowed, except as provided in this section.
Exemptions shall be allowed for:
(a) All roads owned or maintained by the State of Maine,
including the Maine Turnpike; and all accepted City roads and
all roads maintained by the City; all private roads and ways
serving more than two dwelling or structures, but not
driveways; all public pedestrian walkways. However, parking
lots, buildings, or other developed land within the right-ofways
shall not be exempt from storm water service charges;
(b) Undeveloped land;
(c) Railroad rights-of-way (tracks). However, railroad
stations, maintenance buildings, or other developed land
used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from storm
water service charges;

Sec. 24-84. Stormwater Service Charge.
(a) There is levied upon all developed land stormwater service
charges for the cost of providing stormwater services. All
developed land shall be charged six dollars and thirty cents
($6.30) per month per one thousand two hundred (1,200) square feet
of impervious surface area, rounded to the nearest one thousand two
hundred (1,200) square feet of impervious surface area.
City of Portland Sewers
Code of Ordinances Chapter 24
Sec. 24-84 Rev. 7-1-2018
24-35
(b) The basis for this charge is the measured amount of
impervious surface area on the developed land as determined by the
city. This measured area may be updated from time to time at the
discretion of the Department of Public Works upon evidence of
impervious surface area change or the availability of updated or
more accurate information.
(c) Fees collected hereunder to fund stormwater services can
also be supplemented by other revenues available to the city,
including but not limited to state, federal, general and special
city funds, and private grants and loans.
(Ord. 129-14/15, 1-21-2015, Effective 1-1-2016; Ord. No. 217-17/18, 7-1-2018)
Sec. 24-85. Credits
(a) Owners of developed land may apply for and receive a
voluntary stormwater service charge credit for approved stormwater
credit systems or facilities. The director of the Department of
Public Works or his/her designee shall determine such approved
stormwater systems and facilities and stormwater service charge
credit amounts based on the technical requirements, design and
performance standards contained in the city's stormwater credits
manual, to be adopted by the director of the Department of Public
Works pursuant to this ordinance, as it may be updated or amended
from time to time.
(b) It is the responsibility of the record owner to initiate
and apply in writing for stormwater service charge credits, and to
provide all necessary information with a letter requesting the
credit. The department of Public Works is not responsible for
initiating a credit application, performing engineering
calculations, or otherwise assisting in the preparation of a
request for a credit. Credits will only be applied if the
requirements outlined in the city’s stormwater credit manual are
met including but not limited to completion of on-going
maintenance, guaranteed right-of-entry for inspection, and
submittal of annual self-certification reports or other required
reports as required per ordinance and rule.
(c) Credits will be applied to the stormwater service charge
while stormwater facilities or management practices are functioning
as approved by the city. If the approved practice or facility is
not functioning as approved, or is terminated, the credit will be
cancelled. Once the credit has been cancelled, the customer must
reapply for the credit.

Code of Ordinances Chapter 24
Sec. 24-85 Rev. 1-1-2016
24-36
(d) The department of Public Works will only review
complete credit requests. If approved, the credit will be applied
to the first bill issued 30 days after the approval. Credits may
be made retroactive, one calendar year from the date of the first
billing period of the charge.
(e) A credit of up to one hundred percent (100%) of the stormwater
service charge may be approved.
(Ord. 129-14/15, 1-21-2015, Effective 1-1-2016)
Sec. 24-86. Billing.
(a) All charges under this article shall be sent to the
record owner of a given property. The record owner may request,
subject to the approval of the director of the Department of Public
Works, that the full charge be billed to the owner’s designated
tenant. The director may direct billing to the tenant of the
property if the tenant is currently billed for water and sanitary
sewer charges. The record owner shall be liable for payment even
if the stormwater service charges are billed to the tenant of the
property.
(b) Condominiums shall have the full charge for the developed
land equally divided among all condominium owners of developed
land. The condominium owners may appeal the director in writing to
adjust the fraction of the charge applied to each condominium
owner. The director will require signed confirmation from each
condominium owner of developed land that they approve the
adjustment to the fraction of the charge applied.
(c) Bills shall contain an amount for stormwater service user
charges, and if delinquent, as provided in section 1-16 of this
Code, shall include charges for interest to be computed in the same
manner as provided for real estate taxes and such delinquency may
be collected by a civil action against the owner and/or may result
in a lien being placed on the property as specified in section 24-
88.
(Ord. 129-14/15, 1-21-2015, Effective 1-1-2016)
Sec. 24-87. Right of appeal and adjustments.
(a) A record owner may request review of the amount of the
stormwater service charge imposed on such owner by written request
to the director of the Department of Public Works within 30
calendar days of the date the customer receives the service charge
bill.
City of Portland Sewers
Code of Ordinances Chapter 24
Sec. 24-87 Rev. 1-1-2016
24-37
(b) The owner must demonstrate the impervious surface area is
less than the amount used in calculating the developed land’s
stormwater service charge. Factors that will be considered include
the impervious surface area of the property.
(c) An owner must comply with all rules and procedures
adopted by the director when submitting a request for appeal or
adjustment of the stormwater service charge and must provide all
necessary information to make a determination.
(d) The director of the Department of Public Works or his/her
designee shall review the service fee and issue a determination, in
writing, within 30 calendar days.
(e) With a finding that the impervious surface area is less
than the amount used to calculate the developed land’s stormwater
service charge, the sole remedy to the owner shall be recalculation
of the stormwater service charge based on the corrected
impervious surface area. A finding that the impervious surface
area is not less than the amount used to calculate the developed
land’s stormwater service charge shall be conclusive with respect
to that property and shall remain effective unless the owner
changes the impervious surface area of the property.
(f) An owner may appeal the director of the Department of
Public Works decision to the city manager or his/her designee
within 30 days of the date of the decision. An owner may appeal a
decision of the manager to a court of competent jurisdiction
pursuant to the applicable Rules of Civil Procedure.
(Ord. 129-14/15, 1-21-2015, Effective 1-1-2016)

designee is the enforcement authority who shall administer,
implement, and enforce the provisions of this article.
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to violate or to fail
to comply with the requirements of this article or its fees.
Whenever the enforcement authority believes that a person has
violated this article, the enforcement authority may enforce this
article in accordance with 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4452.
(c) Any person who violates this article may also be subject
to fines, penalties and orders for injunctive relief and shall be
responsible for the city's attorneys' fees and costs, all in
City of Portland Sewers
Code of Ordinances Chapter 24
Sec. 24-88 Rev. 1-1-2016
24-38
accordance with 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4452. Each day such violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation. Moreover, any
person who violates this article also shall be responsible for any
and all fines, penalties, damages and costs, including, but not
limited to attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by the city for
violation of federal and state environmental laws and regulations
caused by or related to that person's violation of this section;
this responsibility shall be in addition to any penalties, fines or
injunctive relief imposed under this section.
(d) Without limiting the foregoing, failure to comply with
this article may also be enforced as a nuisance and be subject to
an abatement action, in addition to, or alternatively to, the
enforcement actions described above.
(e) Consent agreement. The enforcement authority, with the
approval of corporation counsel and the city manager, may enter
into a written consent agreement with the violator to address
timely abatement of the violation(s) of this article for the
purposes of eliminating violations of this article and of
recovering fines, costs and fees without court action.
(f) Delinquent fees. Any owner that fails to pay the
stormwater service charge when due shall be responsible for the
amount of the unpaid service charge, interest on the unpaid amount,
and attorneys' fees and other costs of collection. To the extent
permitted by law, the fee, when overdue, including interest and
penalties, is a lien on real property and may be collected in the
same manner as a sewer user lien pursuant to state law. Delinquent
amounts may also be collected by a civil action against the person.
(Ord. 129-14/15, 1-21-2015, Effective 1-1-2016)
Sec. 24-89. Limitation of liability.
This article shall not be interpreted to mean that property
subject to the charges established herein will always (or at any
time) be free from stormwater flooding or flood damage, or that
stormwater drainage systems capable of handling all storm events
can be cost-effectively constructed, operated or maintained.
Therefore the following limitations on liability, in addition to
any other limitations or immunities existing in law, are set forth:
(1) It is the express intent of the city that this article
will protect the public health, safety and welfare of
properties and persons in general. However, this ordinance
does not create any special duty or relationship with any
City of Portland Sewers
Code of Ordinances Chapter 24
Sec. 24-89 Rev. 1-1-2016
24-39
individual person or specific property either within or
outside the service area.
(2) The city shall not be held liable for flood damage or
assessing and removing pollution sources, and reserves the
right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any
action seeking monetary compensation from the city, or its
officers, agents or employees for alleged damages arising from
alleged failure or breach of duties or relationship as may now
exist or hereafter be created.
(3) The issuance of any permit, plan approval or inspection
shall not constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall
it afford the basis for any action seeking the imposition of
monetary damages against the city or its officers, employees
or agents.
(4) Operation of stormwater drainage systems located on
private property or public property not owned by the city and
for which there has been no public dedication of such systems
and facilities for operation, maintenance and/or improvements
of the system, shall be the legal responsibility of the
property owner, except as may be affected by the laws of the
State of Maine and the United States of America.
(Ord. 129-14/15, 1-21-2015, Effective 1-1-2016)
Sec. 24-90. Severability.
Each section of this ordinance is severable from all other
sections. If any part of this ordinance is deemed invalid by a
court or competent jurisdiction, remaining portions of the
ordinance shall not be affected and shall continue in full force.
Whenever this ordinance conflicts with any other ordinance of the
city, State of Maine, or federal government, the stricter standard
shall apply, except as limited by state or federal law.

Sec. 25-31. Bike Sharing Systems.
(a) A “bike sharing system” is defined as a system of
bicycles, electric bicycles, helmets, or similar bike-sharerelated
merchandise that is made available for rent for general
public use, generally for short periods of time, and may include
docks or stations for storing bicycles when not in use.
(b) Bike sharing systems require annual revocable street
occupancy permits pursuant to this section and section 25-27(a)
(8), above.
(c) The City Manager or her or his designee is hereby
authorized to develop regulations to further delineate reasonable
rules for operation of a bike sharing system, including limits on
the number of bikes (including per operator), where bikes and
other bike-share-related merchandise may be stored or parked on
public ways, requirements for insurance, indemnity and bonding,
the conduct and responsiveness of bike share operators,
requirements for data sharing and reporting, restrictions on
advertising and signage, and other relevant factors to ensure
safe and effective operation of such a system. The rules will be
submitted to the City’s Sustainability & Transportation Committee
for review and comment prior to adoption and, following adoption,
shall undergo an annual review by the Committee of the rules’
effectiveness.
(d) The City Manager may set a cap on the number of bike
sharing systems that may operate in the city at one time. If such
a limit is set, the City shall determine operators through a
competitive bidding process.
(e) In addition to the street occupancy permit fees
outlined in 25-27 above, in the event that any installation,
reinstallation, relocation, repair or maintenance of any existing
or future improvements owned by, constructed by or on behalf of
the City is made costlier by virtue of a bike sharing system, the
City of Portland Streets, Sidewalks and Other Public Places

operator of that bike sharing system shall pay to the City an
amount equal to such additional cost as reasonably determined by
the City Manager or the City Manager’s duly authorized
representatives.
(f) It shall be considered a violation of the City Code to
park, leave standing, or leave unattended a bicycle that is part
of a bike sharing system, as defined in Sect 25-31(a), on any
sidewalk, street, or public right-of-way except as authorized
under a valid street occupancy permit. Bicycles parked, left
standing, or left unattended constitute a public nuisance subject
to abatement and removal by duly designated authorities by the
City Manager. Failure to obtain a street occupancy permit as
required by this section, parking or leaving unattended a bicycle
in an unauthorized location, and any other violations of this
Section or the Rules and Regulations governing bike sharing
systems shall be subject to the fines outlined in Section 1-15 of
the City Code.

as follows:
1. A plan and a plot plan drawn, when practicable, to
a scale of forty (40) feet to one (1) inch, and to
be on one (1) or more sheets of paper not exceeding
twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-three (33) inches
in size. The plot plan shall show the north point,
the area of all lots, the length of all lot lines,
the location and ownership of all adjoining
subdivisions and adjacent acreage, passageways,
street lines, buildings, boundary monuments,
waterways, topography and natural drainage courses
with contours at not greater than six (6) foot
intervals, all angles necessary for the plotting of
the street and lots and their reproduction on the
ground, the distance to the nearest established
street line, and any buildings abutting on the
street or way, together with the stations of their
side lines.
2. A profile of the street or way drawn to a
longitudinal scale of forty (40) feet to one (1)
inch and a vertical scale of four (4) feet to one
(1) inch. The profile shall show the profile of the
side lines and center lines of the street or way
and the proposed grades thereof. Any buildings
abutting on the street or way shall be shown on the

a minimum thickness of fifteen (15) inches of road
gravel, and three (3) inches of aggregate base
gravel, both of which shall be satisfactory to the
public works authority. The roadway shall be
City of Portland Streets, Sidewalks and Other Public Places
Code of Ordinances Chapter 25
Sec. 25-48 Rev. 6-18-1973
25-16
surfaced with two (2) inches of hot bituminous
concrete properly prepared and laid in two (2)
courses of one (1) inch each, in accordance with
specifications of the public works authority.
The sidewalks shall be built of gravel six (6)
inches in depth and the driveways, including that
part crossing the sidewalk, shall be built of
gravel ten (10) inches in depth; both to be covered
by a two (2) inch top of hot bituminous concrete,
properly prepared and laid in two (2) courses of
one (1) inch each, in accordance with the standard
specifications of the public works authority.
Curbing shall be provided as required in article IV
of chapter 14.
The street or way shall be constructed by the
following method: It shall be cleared of all
stumps, roots, brush, perishable material and all
trees not intended for preservation. All loam,
loamy material and clay shall be removed from the
street or way to the depths specified by the public
works authority. The street shall then be graded to
a subgrade of not less than twenty (20) inches in
the roadway location and not less than twelve (12)
inches in the driveway areas, below and parallel to
the finished grade as shown on the plans, profiles
and cross-section of the street or way. The
subgrade shall be carefully shaped and thoroughly
compacted before the gravel is placed. When a
minimum length of three hundred (300) feet, or the
entire length of street if less than three hundred
(300) feet, has been excavated to subgrade and this
subgrade properly prepared for the gravel, the
public works authority shall be notified and after
inspection his or her approval obtained for placing
the gravel.
The gravel shall then be placed and compacted
in layers of not more than six (6) inches in the
roadway and driveway area and not more than eight
(8) inches in the sidewalk areas. Before the
roadway is paved, and the bituminous concrete laid
in the sidewalk and driveway areas, the work shall
again be inspected and approved by the public works
authority. Suitable forms or headers must be used
City of Portland Streets, Sidewalks and Other Public Places
Code of Ordinances Chapter 25
Sec. 25-48 Rev. 6-18-1973
25-17
for the construction of the bituminous top to
insure proper alignment and grade.
2. Industrial areas. Roadways shall be paved with a
high type pavement in accordance with the standard
specifications of the public works authority.
(f) Engineering work. All engineering work, including the
setting of grade stakes, necessary for the construction
of the street and sidewalks, shall be performed by the
developer at his or her expense.
(g) Sewers and drains. Any sewers and appurtenances, drains,
including house drains and catch basins, which are to be
built iii the street or sidewalks, and all underground
utilities and their respective services, shall be
constructed before any road material is placed, except
for house connections to serve lots where no construction
has begun prior to the placing of such road material. In
any event a minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of all
lots on any one (1) street within the section of the
subdivision being constructed shall have the house
connections completed within the street right-of-way
before the aggregate base course is placed thereon. If a
hardship is created by strict compliance with the above
requirements, request for a variance may be made in
writing to the public works authority who shall respond
in writing to the city council stating approval or
disapproval. Whenever it shall be deemed necessary by the
public works authority that a sanitary sewer or storm
sewer be constructed to serve the street under
consideration, such sanitary sewer or storm sewer shall
be completed before the gravel or road material is placed
thereon. The sewer shall be built by the developer in
accordance with one (1) of the following methods:
1. The developer shall cause the sanitary sewers and
storm sewers and appurtenances, including catch
basins to be built to the specifications of the
public works authority and under his or her
supervision. Such construction shall be by
competitive bids, duly advertised, and to the
satisfaction of the public works authority. When
the sewer and an easement therefor have been deeded
to the city, the city may make payment to the
developer of the cost of any catch basins plus
City of Portland Streets, Sidewalks and Other Public Places
Code of Ordinances Chapter 25
Sec. 25-48 Rev. 6-18-1973
25-18
one-third of the total remaining costs thereof, as
determined by the public works authority, the
city's engineering costs to be included in the
total cost and deducted from the city's payment.
2. The developer shall cause the sanitary sewers and
storm sewers and appurtenances, including catch
basins, to be built to the specifications of the
public works authority and under his or her
supervision, but without regard to competitive
bids. When the street has been accepted, the sewer
shall be deeded to the city as a public sewer at no
cost to the city.
3. When the public works authority requires such sewer
to be of a larger size than would be needed for the
development under consideration, the added cost for
the excess size as determined by the public works
authority may be paid by the city upon
authorization by the city council, provided the
sewer is built through competitive bidding,
properly advertised, and to the satisfaction of the
public works authority.
(h) Water main. A reasonably available water main of at least
eight (8) inches in diameter must exist for the use of
buildings, residents and occupants of the street to be
accepted and the chief of the fire department must, in
writing, certify that adequate water service for
sufficient fire protection hydrants exists. In the case
of a street or way located on the islands in Casco Bay,
no water main need be provided when the chief of the fire
department and the planning board shall certify in
writing that no water supply is reasonably available to
serve such street or way. Provided, however, that the
city council may accept a street with a water main of
less than eight (8) inches in diameter when the chief of
the fire department and the planning board, in writing,
certify that a water main of less than eight (8) inches
in diameter will furnish adequate water service for
sufficient fire protection hydrants for the street to be
accepted and any future extension or extensions of the
street. If shall be the policy of the city to cause the
installation of such hydrants as may be required for fire
protection at the same time as the installation of the
water main.

light sources.
(c) Normalizations of traffic conditions. The permittee shall
take appropriate measures to assure that during the performance of
the excavation work, traffic conditions as near normal as possible
shall be maintained at all times so as to minimize inconvenience to
the occupants of the adjoining property and to the general public.
(d) Closing of streets. When traffic conditions permit, the
traffic engineer, with the approval of the police and fire
departments of the city, may by written approval (or by verbal
approval in the case of emergency), permit the closing of streets
and alleys to all traffic for a period of time prescribed by him or
her, if in his or her opinion it is necessary. The written approval
of the traffic engineer may require that the permittee give
notification to various public agencies and to the general public.
In such cases, such written approval shall not be valid until such
notice is given. In case of emergency during nonbusiness hours, the
utility company having such emergency shall contact the police and
fire departments by phone before closing a street to traffic.
(e) Warning signs to channel traffic. Warning signs shall be
placed in accordance with the applicable section of the most
current edition of the MUTCD in advance of the construction
operation to alert traffic within a public street, and cones or
other approved devices shall be placed to channel traffic, in
accordance with the instructions of the traffic engineer, after his
or her review of the proposed traffic control measures for the
project.
(f) Special police protection for interference with school
walk route map. The permittee shall hereby be informed that the
city has or may have a "school walk route map," and that the
traffic engineer will require special police protection at
locations where the permittee, by his or her work, interferes with
these designated school walk routes or crossing locations. Copies
of school walk route maps for various locations in the city may be
procured from the traffic engineer.
(g) Interference with arterial streets. Construction
activities (unless an emergency condition exists) shall not
interfere with the normal flow of traffic on arterial streets of
the city. A list of arterial streets shall be kept at the offices
of the public works authority. The full inbound roadway lane width
shall be maintained between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.
and the full outbound roadway lane width shall be maintained

between the hours of 3:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
(h) Shifting traffic to opposite side. The permittee may
shift traffic to the opposite side of the roadway to maintain the
above required lane width. The permittee may only make such shift
with the approval of the traffic engineer following proper review
of detour plans to insure adequate safe two-way traffic flow and
proper number and placement of traffic control devices, including
flaggers and/or police officers.

Sec. 25-122. Relocation and protection of utilities.
The permittee shall not interfere with any existing facility
without the written consent of the city and the owner of the
facility. If it becomes necessary to relocate an existing facility
this shall be done by or with the written consent of its owner. No
facility owned by the city shall be moved to accommodate the
permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by the permittee.
The cost of moving privately owned facilities shall be similarly
borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the
person or utility owning the facility. The permittee shall support
and protect by timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles,
wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the
excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain
and protect them under, over, along or across the work. The
permittee shall secure approval of method of support and protection
from the owner of the facility. In case any of the pipes, conduits,
poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged, and for this purpose
pipe coating or other encasement or devices are to be considered as
part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly notify the
owner thereof. All damaged facilities shall be repaired by the
agency or person owning them and the expense of such repairs shall
be charged to the permittee. It is the intent of this section that
the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to facilities
and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such
facility damage and such assumption of liability is a contractual
obligation of the permittee. The only exception will be such
instances where damage is exclusively due to the negligence of the
owning utility. The city shall not be made a party to any action
because of this section. The permittee shall inform itself as to
the existence and location of all underground facilities and
protect the same against damage in accordance with 23 M.R.S.A. §
3360-A as may be amended from time to time.

abandoned substructure is in the way, or subsequently becomes in
the way, of an installation of the city or any other public body,
the owner of such substructure, after having been contacted by the
excavator, shall establish if the substructure is abandoned and
make the first cut or tap before allowing the substructure to be
removed by the excavator.

damages to any person injured by the performance of an excavation
work for which a street opening permit is required under this
article, nor shall the city or any official or employee thereof be
deemed to have assumed any such liability or responsibility by
reason of inspections authorized hereunder, the issuance of any

hazards/underground collapse, and shall be primary to any insurance
or self-insurance of the city. Evidence of such coverage shall be a

reconstruct or rehabilitate a street, the city or its
representative shall give written notice thereof to all abutting
property owners, to the city departments, and to all public
utilities which have or may wish to lay pipes, wires or other
facilities in or under the highway. Upon receipt of such written
notice, such person or utility shall have sixty (60) days in which
to repair, install or lay any such facility. If an extension of
time is needed by a person or utility for the repair and/or
installation of such facilities, the person or utility shall make a
written application to the city explaining fully the reasons for
requesting such an extension of time. At the expiration of the time
fixed and after such street has been constructed, reconstructed or
rehabilitated, the director has the right to deny permits to
excavate such streets for a period of five (5) years as provided in
23 M.R.S.A. § 3351 as may be amended from time to time. Any

chapter and the rules, the city shall notify the permittee and
require the appropriate corrective actions to be undertaken.
Permittee shall take corrective action within twenty-four (24)
hours after the issuance of notice if the failure could trigger
tort liability or liability for a street defect, as defined in 23
M.R.S.A. § 3651 et seq., as amended from time to time. In all other
instances, the permittee shall have a reasonable time as provided
in section 25-160 to undertake corrective action.
(b) If the permittee fails to respond within the required
time period, the city shall cause the necessary repairs to be

in such case the permittee shall be billed an amount equal to one
hundred fifty (150) percent of the whole of the expense incurred by
the city. Bills rendered in accordance with this section shall be
due and payable by the permittee immediately upon receipt. The city
shall issue no further or new permits to the permittee until full

an excavation after the permittee's guarantee period has started,
that guarantee period shall start over again upon completion of the
repairs.

When a vehicle is shoveled out by a tow operator in order to
hook it up during a snow ban or for a snow removal conducted
by or for the City, and a City employee engaged or
participating in the snow removal process determines that the
shoveling was reasonable and necessary to accomplish a hook
up, the fee shall be $25 regardless of whether the vehicle is
hooked up when the vehicle owner arrives at the scene. In
cases where the vehicle is shoveled out and hooked up the
total fee to release the vehicle shall be $30.00.
3. Storage of vehicles: $30.00 per day or part thereof. Storage
charges shall begin twenty-four hours after the vehicle is
towed.
4. The charge by the City for vehicles impounded or stored on
City property pursuant to Chapter 28 shall be $25.00 for
impoundment and storage for the first twenty-four hours from
the date and time of impoundment, and shall be $10.00 for each
day, or part thereof, thereafter.
5. Wrecker owners may charge a $30.00 release fee for vehicles
released from storage after 7:00 p.m. and prior to 7:00 a.m.
seven days a week and from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Sundays
or on official City holidays.
6. The Chief of police or his or her designee may authorize
additional charges in unusual circumstances.
7. If a vehicle must be towed after the initial tow, wrecker
owners may charge a $100.00 fee for each additional tow of the
same vehicle performed at the City's request.
8. When a vehicle and trailer or two vehicles are towed at the
same time the tow fee shall be $130.
BE IT FURTHER ORDERED, that the above provisions apply to any tow of a vehicle
without the owner's consent, including but not limited to private
lot tows requested by a lot owner or manager, and to police
requested tows of private vehicles, including but not limited to
abandoned vehicle tows, snow tows, scofflaw tows and accident scene
tows.

signal carrying a legend. The lights have the following
meanings:

indication, means the operator may cautiously enter
the intersection only to make the movement
indicated by the arrow or other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same
time.
Notwithstanding the light, the operator must yield
the right-of-way to a vehicle or pedestrian
lawfully within the intersection or crosswalk.
(2) A yellow light:
a. If steady and circular or an arrow, means the
operator must take warning that a green light is
being terminated or a red light will be exhibited
immediately; or
b. If showing rapid intermittent flashes, means the
operator may proceed only with caution.
(3) A red light:
a. If steady and circular, means the operator must
stop and remain standing until an indication to
proceed is shown.
An operator may cautiously enter the intersection
to make a right turn after stopping, unless
prohibited by an appropriate sign such as "NO RIGHT
TURN ON RED."
An operator executing a turn shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians on a crosswalk and to a
vehicle having a green signal at the intersection;
b. If a steady arrow, means the operator may not enter
the intersection to make the movement indicated by
that arrow; or
c. If showing rapid intermittent flashes, means the
operator must stop and then proceed as if at a stop
sign.
(b) Lane direction control devices. When lane direction
control devices are placed over the individual lanes, an

enforcement officer or traffic-control device, an
operator of a vehicle approaching a stop sign shall stop
and:
(1) Yield the right-of-way to a vehicle that has entered the
intersection or that is approaching so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard; and
(2) Having yielded, an operator may proceed. All other
operators approaching the intersection shall yield the
right-of-way to the vehicle so proceeding.
(e) Place of stop. A stop must be made before entering the
intersecting way as follows:
(1) Where the intersection is regulated by a traffic-control
device, at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating
where the stop is to be made or, in the absence of a sign
or marking, at the device; or
(2) Where the intersection is regulated by a stop sign,
before entering the crosswalk or, in the absence of a
crosswalk, at a marked stop line; but if there is no stop
line, at a point nearest the intersecting way where the
operator has a view of approaching traffic.
(f) Evidence. The placing of a traffic-control device in a
position approximately conforming to this chapter is
prima facie evidence that the device has been placed by
the official act or direction of lawful authority.

Sec. 28-194 Rev.6-17-10
28-68
Sec. 28-194. Impoundment of Motor Vehicles/Operating After
Suspension or Revocation
(a) Purpose. It is necessary and appropriate to take steps
to deprive drivers whose driving privileges or operator’s license
have been suspended or revoked and who pose a danger to persons and
property of their means of committing the crime of operating after
suspension. Impounding the vehicles of intoxicated, suspended or
revoked drivers serves a significant governmental and public
interest, namely the protection of the health, safety and welfare
of the public by reducing the threat intoxicated, suspended or
revoked drivers pose to life and property.
(b) Certain Vehicles as Nuisances. The following motor
vehicles are hereby declared to be nuisances and subject to
impoundment by the City:
(1) A motor vehicle operated by a person whose operator's
license or driving privileges are suspended pursuant to
Title 29-A of the Maine Revised Statutes and who has, in
the last five years, been convicted of Operating After
Suspension.
(2) A motor vehicle used to commit the crime of Criminal OUI
in violation of 29-A MRSA §2411, at a time when the
operator's license or driving privileges are under
suspension or revocation.
(3) A motor vehicle operated by a person whose license or
driving privileges have been revoked as a habitual
offender pursuant to 29-A MRSA §2551.
(c) Vehicle impoundment.
(1) Whenever a law enforcement officer has probable cause to
believe that a person is operating a vehicle in the City
of Portland: (1) while his or her operator’s license or
driving privileges are suspended or revoked and that
person has a prior conviction for Operating after
Suspension in the last five years; or (2) that the
operator has had his or her license or driving privileges
revoked as an habitual offender pursuant to 29-A M.R.S.A.
§ 2551, the officer may immediately arrest or summons the
person under State law for Operating after Suspension and
impound the vehicle under this ordinance. A vehicle so
City of Portland Traffic and Motor Vehicles
Code of Ordinances Chapter 28
Sec. 28-194 Rev.6-17-10
28-69
impounded shall be impounded for fifteen days.
(2) Whenever a law enforcement officer has probable cause to
believe that a person is operating a vehicle in the City
of Portland while his or her operator’s license or
driving privileges are suspended or revoked and that
person is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or
drugs, the officer may immediately arrest the person
under State law for Operating after Suspension and/or
Criminal OUI and impound the vehicle under this
ordinance. A vehicle so impounded shall be impounded for
fifteen days unless the vehicle is subject to forfeiture
by the State of Maine pursuant to 29-A MRSA §2421.
(3) The police department shall, within two working days of
the impoundment, send a notice by certified mail, return
receipt requested, and by regular mail, to the legal
owner of the vehicle at the address obtained from the
vehicle registration office of the Department of Motor
Vehicles, informing the owner that the vehicle has been
impounded. The notice shall inform the owner that the
owner has the right to a hearing to determine the
validity of the impoundment, or consider any mitigating
circumstances attendant to the impoundment that may lead
to the vehicle’s immediate release. The police
department must conduct the hearing within 24 hours of
the owner's request. The hearing officer's decision may
be immediately appealed to the City Manager or the
Manager’s designee, who shall hold a hearing within 48
hours of the notice of appeal. If the department fails
to send the notice required by this section, the vehicle
must be released immediately upon the owner's written
request and no impoundment fee charged.
(4) The police department shall release a vehicle to the
registered owner prior to the end of the fifteen days
impoundment under any of the following circumstances:
a. When the vehicle is a stolen vehicle;
b. When the vehicle is subject to bailment and is
driven by an unlicensed employee of the business
establishment, including a parking garage or repair
service;
c. When the legal owner of the motor vehicle is a
City of Portland Traffic and Motor Vehicles
Code of Ordinances Chapter 28
Sec. 28-194 Rev.6-17-10
28-70
bank, credit union, acceptance corporation or other
licensed financial institution that holds a
security interest in the vehicle and the vehicle is
subject to repossession;
d. When the vehicle is a rental vehicle owned by a car
rental agency and was in the possession of the
operator pursuant to a rental agreement;
An owner claiming a vehicle pursuant to this subsection shall
pay all costs associated with the impoundment; including towing,
any accrued storage fees and administrative fees.
(5) No vehicle shall be released pursuant to this section
except upon presentation of the registered owner's
current, valid driver's license and proof of current
registration and insurance or upon order of the court.
(6) Upon expiration of the fifteen-day impoundment period, no
person or entity having custody of a motor vehicle
pursuant to the provisions of this section shall release
the vehicle until the individual requesting release
presents satisfactory evidence of his right to
possession, signs a receipt therefor and pays all fees
associated with the impoundment, including all costs for
towing, storage and administrative fees.
(7) A vehicle may be released prior to the mandated
impoundment period:
a. If the employer, spouse, or parent of the operator
of the vehicle establishes by credible evidence
that significant economic or personal hardship will
result from the impoundment. In making a hardship
determination the hearing officer shall consider
public safety factors, including the operator's
criminal history and driving record.

Sec. 28-253. Action by City Traffic Engineer upon receipt of
petition or request seeking determination of preliminary
eligibility.
(a) Upon receipt of a petition from the Clerk or a written
request from a Councilor, the Traffic Engineer shall determine
whether the street is in a category identified in Sec. 28-264 as
eligible for traffic calming.
(b) If the street is in a category eligible for traffic
calming, pursuant to paragraph (a), the Traffic Engineer shall send
a written inquiry to the Chief of Police, the Chief of the Fire

asking whether there are public safety or convenience factors which
render the petitioned street inappropriate for traffic calming.
(c) The Traffic Engineer shall make a determination as to
whether the street is eligible for traffic calming. As part of the
analysis, the Traffic Engineer shall consider the speed, volume,
and accident history of the street. A street shall be deemed

designated departments conclude that traffic calming could take
place in a manner consistent with public safety and convenience.
(d) The Traffic Engineer shall notify the petitioners in

ineligible for traffic calming within forty-five (45) days of

determination. A copy of such notice shall be provided to each
Councilor residing within the district where the street is located.

street is not in a category that is eligible for traffic calming,
the determination may not be appealed.
(b) If the street is determined ineligible by the Traffic
Engineer under section 28-253(c) due to public safety or
convenience factors identified by one or more of the officials
City of Portland Traffic and Motor Vehicles
Code of Ordinances Chapter 28
Sec. 28-254 Rev.8-15-13
28-87
designated to review the petition, the petitioners may appeal the
decision to the City Manager or designee within twenty (20) days of
the date upon which the decision is mailed to the petitioners under
section 28-253(d). Any such appeal must be in writing and must
state the grounds upon which the appealing petitioners disagree
with the public safety or convenience determination. The City
Manager or designee shall hold a hearing within ten (10) business
days of receiving the written appeal and shall issue a written
decision within twenty (20) days of the hearing unless either time
period is extended by agreement. In the event the City Manager or

appealed to court.

other related public safety and convenience factors that may result
from particular traffic calming measures. The Traffic Engineer

other vehicle for hire which is operated within the City of
Portland in response to:

and liveries which operate between any of the municipalities within
the metered zone and the city, except that livery vehicles shall
City of Portland Vehicles for Hire
Code of Ordinances Chapter 30

operating authority from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety

have a written prior reservation record at the time of pick-up,
drop-off or conveyance of a passenger creates a rebuttable
presumption that the vehicle and operator are required to be
licensed as a taxicab under this Article. No livery shall

basis, except as provided herein for a Peaks Island livery, even

taxicab or livery license from the director prior to permitting the
operation of any taxicab or livery vehicles in the city. A taxicab
or livery business license shall be obtained which covers all
vehicles which will be used under the license. As provided in
Chapter 15, there shall be a fee of three hundred fifteen dollars
($315.00) per vehicle listed on the business license. Only those

this Code, licenses issued hereunder are not transferable. If a

result of a disqualifying criminal conviction of the applicant or
licensee for a class A, B or C crime, a taxicab or livery business
license shall not be issued to an immediate family member for the
period of such disqualification. “Immediate family member” means a

law) or an order of court, the applicant
must provide the director with (1) proof
of valid insurance; and (2) documentation

the failure to pay child support pursuant
to 19-A M.R.S.A. Chapter 65 (or other
applicable law) or an order of the court,

finding that the public is not likely to suffer any harm during the
pendency of the appeal. In such case, the director shall make a
written finding of his or her decision in this regard and shall
notify the appellant.
(b) Scope of review. On appeal, the hearing officer shall
review the decision of the director and any disciplinary action
taken pursuant thereto to determine whether the decision was based
upon substantial evidence and the disciplinary action taken was
proportionate to the violation and authorized hereunder. The
hearing officer may take additional evidence with respect to such
decision or action and if additional testimony or evidence is taken
shall determine the appeal upon all of the evidence, except as
provided in this section.

deficiencies. Any delays related to the filing of an incomplete
application shall not extend the deadlines established in this
ordinance or rules promulgated hereunder unless such deadlines are
waived by the department for good cause shown.
The department may determine in its sole discretion that the
lateness of a filing or an incomplete application makes it
impossible to complete the inspection and testing required or
allowed by the ordinance prior to the renewal date of the license
and may issue a written order to the owner and operator of the
facility that it must cease operation on the date on which the
current license expires and remain out of operation until the new
license is issued.

WHEREAS, the City of Portland is a home-rule unit of
government under the Maine Constitution and 30-A M.R.S.
§3001 and, as such, may exercise any power and perform any
function in order to protect health, safety and welfare of
the citizens of the City; and
WHEREAS, promoting the welfare of the City’s citizens,
its most important asset, and those who work within the
City’s borders is an endeavor that plainly meets this
criterion; and
WHEREAS, after years of inaction by the United States
Congress, it is time for municipalities and states to lift
families out of poverty and stimulate the economy by
raising the minimum wage; and
WHEREAS, Mayor Michael Brennan created a working
group, which included community, labor and business
leaders, and tasked them with reviewing the minimum wage
issue within the City of Portland; and
WHEREAS, the cost of living in Portland has increased
making life here cost, as a percentage of income, as much
as is paid by residents of Chicago, Illinois, Sacramento,
California and other major United States cities where the
minimum wage is much higher; and

WHEREAS, an estimated 20,000 workers in the State of
Maine work for minimum wage, and a substantial number of
them are among the City of Portland’s more than 65,000 wage
and salary earners; and
WHEREAS, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has
calculated that, for a single adult to support him- or
herself in Portland at the current minimum wage, he or she
would need to work over 50 hours a week; and
WHEREAS, more than 50 percent of Portland public
school students are eligible for free lunch, meaning their
families have incomes at between 100 percent and 185
percent of the Federal poverty level, which is higher than
what a single parent with one child in school would earn
with a full-time minimum wage job; and
WHEREAS, rising housing costs, including an increase
in the median home price from $125,200 in 2000 to $238,400
in 2012, are pushing low wage workers out of the City; and
WHEREAS, the Fair Market Rent in the Portland Area for
a two-bedroom apartment is $1,012, and a full-time worker
job would have to earn at least $19.46 per hour to afford
that rent;
WHEREAS, phasing in the wage increase over time will
allow businesses to adjust and result in reasonable annual
increases in expenses;
WHEREAS, based on the work of the working group (the
materials and report of which are incorporated herein by
reference) and the aforementioned facts, Mayor Brennan
proposed that the minimum wage be increased within the City
of Portland;
NOW THEREFORE, to promote the health, safety and
welfare of its citizens and pursuant to and consistent with
26 M.R.S. §664, the City Council of the City of Portland,
