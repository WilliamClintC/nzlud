only to the extent necessary for the specific reason announced to justify

discuss any business in a closed meeting, record or vote which does not
directly relate to the specific reason announced to justify the closed
meeting or vote. Public governmental bodies holding a closed meeting
shall close only an existing portion of the meeting facility necessary to
house the members of the public governmental body in the closed
session, allowing members of the public to remain to attend any
subsequent open session held by the public governmental body
following the closed session.

If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure,
as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall
separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make the non-exempt
material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies
provided herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to
the extent practicable, facilitate a separation of exempt from non-exempt
information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person requesting to
inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe
the material exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of
the exempt information and thus defeat the purpose of the exemption.

and in attendance and less than a quorum of the members of the public
governmental body participating via telephone, facsimile, Internet, or
any other voice or electronic means, the nature of the emergency of

by members of the public and at a time reasonably convenient to the
public unless for good cause such a place or time is impossible or
impractical. Every reasonable effort shall be made to grant special
access to the meeting to handicapped or disabled individuals.
B. When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24)
hours' notice, or at a place that is not reasonably accessible to the
public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the public, the
nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal
requirements shall be stated in the minutes.

for maintenance and control of all records. The custodian may

Deputy custodians shall conduct matters relating to public records and
meetings in accord with the policies enumerated herein.
B. Each public governmental body shall make available for inspection and
copying by the public of that body's public records. No person shall
remove original public records from the office of a public governmental
body or its custodian without written permission of the designated
custodian. No public governmental body shall, after August 28, 1998,
grant to any person or entity, whether by contract, license or otherwise,
the exclusive right to access and disseminate any public record unless
the granting of such right is necessary to facilitate coordination with, or
uniformity among, industry regulators having similar authority.
C. Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon
as possible, but in no event later than the end of the third (3rd) business
day following the date the request is received by the custodian of
records of a public governmental body. If records are requested in a
certain format, the public body shall provide the records in the
requested format, if such format is available. If access to the public
record is not granted immediately, the custodian shall give a detailed
explanation of the cause for further delay and the place and earliest
time and date that the record will be available for inspection. This
period for document production may exceed three (3) days for
reasonable cause.
D. If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon
request, a written statement of the grounds for such denial. Such
statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which access is
denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of
the third (3rd) business day following the date that the request for the
statement is received.
A. The remedies provided by this Section against public governmental
bodies shall be in addition to those provided by any other provision of
law. Any aggrieved person, taxpayer to, or citizen of this State may seek
judicial enforcement of the requirements of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo. Suits to enforce Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.,
shall be brought in the Circuit Court for the County in which the public
governmental body has its principal place of business. Upon service of a
summons, petition, complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim in a civil
action brought to enforce the provisions of Sections 610.010 to
610.027, RSMo., the custodian of the public record that is the subject
matter of such civil action shall not transfer custody, alter, destroy or
otherwise dispose of the public record sought to be inspected and
examined, notwithstanding the applicability of an exemption pursuant
Section
106.090
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
106.100
AO:33
to Section 610.021, RSMo., or the assertion that the requested record
is not a public record until the court directs otherwise.
B. Once a party seeking judicial enforcement of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., demonstrates to the court that the body in question is
subject to the requirements of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., and
has held a closed meeting, record or vote, the burden of persuasion
shall be on the body and its members to demonstrate compliance with
the requirements of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
C. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public
governmental body or a member of a public governmental body has
knowingly violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the public
governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in
an amount up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). If the court finds
that there is a knowing violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026,
RSMo., the court may order the payment by such body or member of all
costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully
establishing a violation. The court shall determine the amount of the
penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the
seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body
or member of a public governmental body has violated Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
D. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public
governmental body or a member of a public governmental body has
purposely violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the public
governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in
an amount up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). If the court finds
that there was a purposeful violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026,
RSMo., then the court shall order the payment by such body or member
of all costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully
establishing such a violation. The court shall determine the amount of
the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the
seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body
or member of a public governmental body has violated Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
E. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public
governmental body has violated any provision of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., a court shall void any action taken in violation of
Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., if the court finds under the facts
of the particular case that the public interest in the enforcement of the
policy of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., outweighs the public
interest in sustaining the validity of the action taken in the closed
meeting, record or vote. Suit for enforcement shall be brought within
one (1) year from which the violation is ascertainable and in no event
shall it be brought later than two (2) years after the violation. This
Subsection shall not apply to an action taken regarding the issuance of
bonds or other evidence of indebtedness of a public governmental body
Section

Section 106.110. Fees for Copying Public Records — Limitations.
if a public hearing, election or public sale has been held regarding the
bonds or evidence of indebtedness.
F. A public governmental body which is in doubt about the legality of
closing a particular meeting, record or vote may bring suit at the
expense of that public governmental body in the Circuit Court of the
County of the public governmental body's principal place of business to
ascertain the propriety of any such action, or seek a formal opinion of
the attorney general or an attorney for the governmental body.
A. Except as otherwise provided by law, each public governmental body
shall provide access to and, upon request, furnish copies of public
records subject to the following:
1. Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted
under Section 32.091, RSMo., shall not exceed ten cents ($.10) per
page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9) by fourteen (14)
inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to exceed the
average hourly rate of pay for clerical staff of the public
governmental body. Research time required for fulfilling records
requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based
on the scope of the request, the public governmental body shall
produce the copies using employees of the body that result in the
lowest amount of charges for search, research, and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the
person requesting the records may request the public
governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without
charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body
determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the public
governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest
of the requester.

course of the workweek, provided that the necessary workload is
completed to the Director of Operations' satisfaction. Hours worked
outside the normal business day and outside the normal work location

scheduling, and operations of the department affected will always be

their absence to their supervisor prior to the time they were to report
for work. Sick leave with pay shall not be granted unless such report
has been timely made. Documentation may be required of the employee
before any sick leave shall be granted or payment made. In all cases
sick leave with pay in excess of three (3) working days shall be allowed
only after presenting a written statement by a physician certifying that

in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to
communicate to drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or
unloading. A public school district has the authority pursuant to Section
304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of
a school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a
divided highway of four (4) or more lanes may pull off of the main
roadway and load or unload students without activating the mechanical
and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for
other drivers to stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert
motorists that the school bus is slowing to a stop; provided that the
passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner
which indicates that drivers should proceed with caution and, in such
case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the school bus with due
caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers
at any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of
traffic, whether or not divided by a median or barrier, in such manner
as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2) lanes of traffic;
nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle
is upon the road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is
plainly visible for at least five hundred (500) feet in each direction to
drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder and
a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three
hundred (300) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon
other highways and on all highways, only for such time as is actually
necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
E. The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need
not stop upon meeting or overtaking a school bus which is on a different
roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite direction on a highway
containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a
loading zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or
controlled access highway at a point where pedestrians are not
permitted to cross the roadway.
A. The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the rightof-
way to a vehicle which has entered the intersection from a different
highway, provided however, there is no form of traffic control at such
intersection.
B. When two (2) vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at
approximately the same time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall
yield the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on the right. This
Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from

The driver of a vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than
is reasonably safe and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such
vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the roadway. Vehicles being
driven upon any roadway outside of a business or residence district in a
caravan or motorcade, whether or not towing other vehicles, shall be so
operated, except in a funeral procession or in a duly authorized parade, so
as to allow sufficient space between each such vehicle or combination of
vehicles as to enable any other vehicle to overtake or pass such vehicles

left shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the
opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close thereto as
to constitute an immediate hazard.
D. The driver of a vehicle intending to make a left turn into an alley, private
road or driveway shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching
from the opposite direction when the making of such left turn would
create a traffic hazard.
E. The City may, on any section of road where construction or major
maintenance operations are being effected, fix a speed limit in such
areas by posting of appropriate signs and the operation of a motor
vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so posted shall be
deemed prima facie evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a
violation of Section 340.160.
A. No vehicle or combination of vehicles shall be moved or operated on
any primary or interstate highway in this State plus a distance not to
exceed ten (10) miles from such highways, having a greater weight than
twenty thousand (20,000) pounds on one (1) axle, no combination of
vehicles operated by transporters of general freight over regular routes
as defined in Section 390.020, Missouri Revised Statutes, shall be
moved or operated on any highway of this State having a greater weight
than the vehicle manufacturer's rating on a steering axle with the
maximum weight not to exceed twelve thousand (12,000) pounds on a
steering axle and no vehicle shall be moved or operated on any primary
or interstate highways of this State having a greater weight than thirtyfour
thousand (34,000) pounds on any tandem axle; the term "tandem
axle" shall mean a group of two (2) or more axles, arranged one behind
another, the distance between the extremes of which is more than forty
(40) inches and not more than ninety-six (96) inches apart and further

financial responsibility as required in this Section which conforms to
the requirements of the laws of this State. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the

vehicle which is inoperable or being stored and not in operation.

mean the ability to respond in damages for liability on account of
accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said financial
responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a
motor vehicle, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1) person in
any one (1) accident and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the
amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury
to or death of two (2) or more persons in any one (1) accident and in the

exhibit the insurance identification card on the demand of any Peace
Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or commercial vehicle
inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident
while that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the

responsibility requirements of Section 303.025, RSMo., at the time the

Supplementary Regulations
Section 405.190. Supplemental Regulations. [R.O. 2006 §400.190]
This Article outlines regulations affecting more than one (1), or all, zoning
districts and must be reviewed in every case when considering any type
of land use within the City's jurisdiction; however, these supplemental
regulations shall defer to any specific regulations within the respective
zoning district sections.
Section 405.195. Overlay Districts. [Ord. No. 2468, 5-7-2019]
A. An overlay district is a transparent zoning district that lies over an
existing zoning district and is used to implement additional
development standards or place restrictions beyond those required by
the existing or base zoning district. The overlay district generally
outlines uniform standards within the established boundary to ensure a
higher quality of development and to preserve the citizens of the City.
1. Purpose. The purpose of creating an overlay district (OD) is to set
and coordinate special development standards to a specific area
that has unique value to the City and its residents, such as a
business district or transportation corridor, and that are designed
to provide a distinctive character and atmosphere to the
designated area. Overlay districts are appropriate instruments to
implement the long-term goals and objectives of the adopted
Comprehensive Plan and are primarily intended to be used when
special circumstances justify the modification of base or existing
zoning district regulations to achieve those specific design
objectives that do not coincide with base zoning districts.
2. Establishment And Designation.
a. Overlay districts shall be established through the rezoning
process as outlined in Section 405.350 and only in conjunction
with existing, base zoning districts.
b. An overlay district may cover parts of several zoning districts
or only a portion of an existing or base zoning district.
c. The existing or base zoning district shall maintain standard
permitted land uses and development regulations. The overlay
district may further restrict development standards and/or
land uses suitable to the purpose and protection of the overlay
district.
(1) Development standards that may be regulated in an
overlay district are lot size, building height and area,
architectural design and materials, accessory buildings
and structures, landscaping and buffer yards, parking,
Section
405.190
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.195
AO:467
lighting, signage, development review procedures or any
other restrictions that meet the overlay district's purpose.
(2) Land uses shall be specifically delineated for each
application.
d. When an overlay district is established, any subsequent
application to change the existing or base zoning district shall
not be construed to be an application to eliminate the overlay
district for the property covered by the application. Any intent
to eliminate the overlay district on a given property shall be
expressly stated to be part of the application.
e. In cases where there is a conflict between the requirements of
the overlay district and the underlying existing or base zoning
district, the overlay district restrictions shall apply.
f. When an applicant seeks to vary from the development
standards of an overlay district, they shall apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a variance.
3. Relationship Of Overlay Districts To Zoning Map. Overlay districts
are adopted in the same manner as any other zoning amendment.
When an overlay district and its associated regulations are
adopted, the zoning map shall be amended to establish the
boundaries for the overlay district.
4. Adopted Overlay Districts.

the building on the effective date of this Section (May 15,
2007) without the specific approval of the Board of Aldermen
based on its determination that the proposed height does not
have a detrimental effect on surrounding property.
F. Co-Use.
1. Prior to the issuance of any permit, the applicant shall:
a. Submit a notarized statement to the City agreeing to make the
proposed antenna support structure available for use by
others, subject to reasonable technical limitations and financial
terms.
b. Furnish an inventory to the director of all known antenna
support structures and potential building sites located within
one-half (½) mile of the proposed structure site, identifying the
owner of same as well as the antenna support structure's type
and reference name or number, if applicable, and the street
location, latitude and longitude, height, type and mounting
height of existing antennas and an assessment of available
space for the placement of additional antennas, shelters and/or
cabinets. The applicant shall further demonstrate that it has
requested co-use of each existing building or antenna support
structure from the owner thereof and/or shall indicate why
such co-use is inappropriate or was otherwise not allowed.
c. Antenna support structures may be constructed or modified so
as to exceed the height limitations provided in Section

may request an extension of twenty (20) additional feet per couser,
whether actual or anticipated, up to a limit of forty (40)
additional feet. The City may also require the applicant for new
construction to exceed the applicable limitation, regardless of
Section
405.280
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.280
AO:495
whether a co-user is immediately available to share space with
the applicant.
d. In the event that a conditional use permit is requested for the
construction of a new antenna support structure, the applicant
shall notify in writing any other known potential service
providers in that area that the structure will be available for
co-use. Said notices shall issue on or before the day on which
the applicant submits to the City an application for a
conditional use permit for the structure. The notice shall allow
potential co-users thirty (30) days within which to express any
interest in co-use, during which time the applicant shall not
commit to a design for the structure which precludes co-use.
The willful and knowing failure of an applicant to agree to couse
or to negotiate in good faith with potential co-users may be
cause for either the denial of a pending application, the
revocation of an existing conditional use permit and/or the
withholding of future similar permits to the applicant.
G. Administrative Permit. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, plans
for the following administratively authorized installation shall be
reviewed and approved by the Planning and Zoning Officer and/or the
Board of Aldermen's designee. In the event of disapproval of such plans,
approval may be sought by way of conditional use permit.
1. Uses authorized by administrative permit.
a. The attachment of additional antennas to any antenna support
structure existing on the effective date of this Section (May 15,

modified to extend the height thereof.
b. The construction of a disguised support structure in the all
Residential Zoning Districts ("R-1", "R-2", "R-3", "RC-1" and
"RC-2" Zoning Districts), provided that all related equipment
shall be placed underground or concealed within the structure.
In addition, the construction of a disguised support structure in
all Commercial Districts and Industrial Districts provided that
all related equipment shall be placed underground or
concealed within the structure or placed in a cabinet if the
disguised support structure is accessory to an existing
commercial, industrial, institutional or other non-residential
use. In the event that any support structure is of a design or
type such that there is a question of whether such design or
type is effective to camouflage or conceal its presence as an
appropriately placed architecture or natural feature, the
Planning and Zoning Officer or the Board of Aldermen's
designee may disapprove such support structure.

AO:498
requirements or to support the applicant's proposed
antenna(s).
e. Whether the proposed antennas would experience or cause
signal interference with antennas on existing antenna support
structures or buildings.
f. Whether the fees, costs or other contractual terms required by
an owner to lease, modify or otherwise provide for co-use on an
existing and suitable antenna support structure or building are
reasonable. Costs exceeding that of a new antenna support
structure are presumed unreasonable.
g. Whether there are other limiting conditions that render

meet the strict requirements of the criteria of these regulations
but satisfies the general purpose and intent of said criteria
based upon the particular circumstances, the Board of
Aldermen may grant a variance from said criteria and grant a
conditional use permit, subject to such conditions as the Board
deems appropriate for the protection of the public, safety and
welfare of the residents of the City.
c. If the Board determines that the prescribed criteria hereof
effectively would preclude the applicant's reception and/or
transmission of signals and that the applicant's proposed
location and height are a matter of absolute engineering and
economic necessity in order to ensure the completion of the
applicant's network, the Board may grant a conditional use
permit subject to such conditions as the Board deems
appropriate for the protection of the public, safety and welfare
of the residents of the City

A. The planned unit development is intended to provide for developments
incorporating a single type or a variety of related uses which are
planned and developed as a unit on a parcel of land at least three (3)
acres in size. The detailed standards set forth herein are minimum
requirements, and it is the intent of this Section that the City of
Warrenton may impose conditions and safeguards in excess or in
addition to the specific minimal requirements. Satisfying the minimum
standards set forth herein does not per se indicate that an application is
entitled to an approval and notice is hereby given to that effect. The
standards for development may be modified if it is demonstrated that
said modification is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and it is
found that no detriment to the public health, safety and welfare will be
created and while safeguarding the present and/or future use and
development of areas surrounding the proposed planned unit
development.
B. The purpose of the planned unit development is to permit:
1. A maximum choice in the types of enforcement available to the
public by allowing a development that would not be possible under
the strict application of the other Sections of this Chapter.
2. Permanent preservation of common open space and recreation
areas and facilities.
3. A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation,
topographic and geologic features.
Section

that results in better development and design and the construction
of aesthetic amenities.
5. An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets, schools, public grounds and buildings and other
facilities.
6. A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort,
morals and welfare.
7. Innovations in residential, commercial and industrial development
so that growing demands of the population may be met by greater
variety in type, design and layout of buildings and by the
conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said
buildings.
8. Residential, non-residential or a combined residential/nonresidential
development.
C. After review and report by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the
Board of Aldermen may approve a PUD of less area than specified above
if it finds that the land has unique historical character, topography,
landscape features or is an isolated problem area which justifies the
application for a smaller area.
Application for a planned unit development shall be made in
accordance with subdivision regulations. The minimum lot and yard
requirements and maximum height requirements of the zoning district
in which the development is located shall apply, however, the Board of
Aldermen may increase and/or decrease any minimum requirement on
a site specific, case by case basis.
In addition to requirements of the subdivision regulations, the following
information should be submitted with the preliminary plat and/or site
plan for a planned unit development:

A. Purpose. The conditional use permit procedure is intended to provide
the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Aldermen with
discretionary review of requests to establish or construct uses or
structures which may be necessary or desirable in a zoning district, but
which may have the potential for negative or deleterious impact on the
health, safety and welfare of the public. The purpose of the review is to
determine whether the proposed location of the use or structure is
appropriate and whether it will be designed, located and operated so as
to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse impacts upon the community and
other properties in the vicinity. The Board of Aldermen may impose
conditions upon such uses and structures that are intended to avoid,
minimize or mitigate adverse impacts upon the community and other
properties in the vicinity. The Board of Aldermen may deny requests for
a conditional use permit when it is evident that a proposed use or
structure will or may cause harm to the community or injury to the
value, lawful use and reasonable enjoyment of other properties in the
vicinity.
B. Conditional Uses Authorized. The Planning and Zoning Commission
may recommend and the Board of Aldermen may authorize the
establishment of those conditional uses that are expressly permitted as
a conditional use in a particular zoning district. No conditional use shall
be authorized unless such conditional use to be granted complies with
all of the applicable provisions of this Chapter.
C. Application For Conditional Use Permit. An application for conditional
use permit containing the following information shall be filed with the
City.
1. Applicant's name and address and legal interest in the property.
2. The owner's name and address if different than the applicant.
3. Street address or common description and legal description of the
property.

6. Statement as to why the proposed use will comply with the
applicable standards in Section 405.340(G).
7. Statement identifying any potentially adverse effects and how the
proposed conditional use will be designed, arranged and operated
in order to ensure that the conditional use will not cause harm to
the community and that the value, use and reasonable enjoyment of
property in the vicinity will not be adversely affected.
8. Site plan in accordance with the requirements of Section 405.390.
9. The proposed ingress and egress to the site including adjacent
streets.

imposed to ensure compliance with the standards set forth in
Section 405.340(G) to avoid, minimize or mitigate potentially
adverse effect of the conditional use on the community and

Section
405.340
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.340
AO:515
conditions or restrictions as it may determine necessary to ensure
compliance with the standards set forth in Section 405.340(G)
to avoid, minimize or mitigate potentially adverse effect of the
conditional use on the community and properties in the vicinity.
All such conditions or restrictions shall be set out in the ordinance
approving the conditional use permit.
F. Permit Validity Time Period. Any conditional use permit authorized shall
be validated within one (1) year from the date of approval by the Board

regulations.
2. The conditional use will not increase flood or water damage hazard
to adjoining properties.
3. The conditional use will not generate noise that exceeds the sound
levels that are typical of uses permitted in the district.
4. Adequate access roads or entrance and exit drives will be designed
and provided to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic
congestion at the site.
5. Street right-of-way and pavement width in the vicinity of the
conditional use is or will be adequate for traffic reasonably
expected to be generated by the proposed use.
6. Glare of stationary or vehicular lights from the conditional use will
not adversely affect the character of the neighborhood and if such
lights will be visible from a residential district, measures to shield
or direct lights to mitigate glare are proposed.
7. The conditional use will not have any substantial adverse effect
upon the use or enjoyment of adjacent and nearby property or
conditions affecting the public health, safety and welfare.

I, 11-16-1981; Ord. No. 2087 §I, 4-2-2013]
This Chapter shall be known as the "Subdivision Regulations of the City of
Warrenton, Missouri".
Section 410.020. Purpose. [R.O. 2006 §405.020; Ord. No. 407 Art. I
§1, 11-16-1981; Ord. No. 2087 §I, 4-2-2013]
A. The subdivision of land is the first (1st) step in the process of urban
development. The arrangement of land parcels in the community for
residential, commercial, and industrial uses and for streets, alleys,
schools, parks and other public purposes will determine to a large
degree the conditions of health, safety, economy, and amenity that
prevail in the urban area. The quality of these conditions is of public
interest. These regulations and standards for the subdivision and
improvement of land for urban use are to make provision for adequate
light, air, open space, drainage, transportation, public utilities and
other needs to ensure the development and maintenance of a healthy,
attractive, and efficient community that provides for the conservation
and protection of its human and natural resources.
B. These regulations are designed, intended, and should be administered
in a manner to:
1. Implement Warrenton's Comprehensive Plan.
2. Provide neighborhood conservation and prevent the development
of slums and blight.
3. Harmoniously relate the development of the various tracts of land
to the existing community and facilitate the future development of
adjoining tracts.
4. Provide that the cost of improvements which primarily benefit the
tract of land being developed be borne by the owners or developers
of the tract, and that cost of improvements which primarily benefit
the whole community be borne by the whole community.
5. Provide the best possible design for the tract.
6. Reconcile any differences of interest.
7. Establish adequate and accurate records of land subdivision.

Except in the case of re-subdivision, this Chapter shall not apply to any
lot or lots forming a part of a subdivision recorded in the office of the
Recorder of Warren County, Missouri, prior to the effective date of this
Chapter (September, 1981). Nor is it intended by this Chapter to repeal,
annul or in any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other
laws or ordinances except those specifically repealed by, or in conflict with
this Chapter, or with private restrictions placed upon property by deed,
covenant or other private agreement, or with restrictive covenants running
with the land to which the City is a party. Where this Chapter imposes a
greater restriction upon land than is imposed or required by such existing
provisions of law, ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of this Chapter
shall control.

§I, 1-16-2007; Ord. No. 2087 §I, 4-2-2013]
A. Plat Approval. For all cases of subdividing within the scope of these
regulations, a preliminary and final/record plat of the land in question
shall be drawn and submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission
and Board of Aldermen for approval or disapproval as provided below.
B. Official Recording. No plat or other land subdivision instrument shall be
filed in the office of the County Recorder until the preliminary plat, a
site specific set of improvement/construction plans and the final/record
plat has been reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and
approved by the Board of Aldermen and signed by the Mayor as
hereinafter set forth. All approved final/record plats shall be filed in the
office of the County Recorder within sixty (60) days of date of approval
of the ordinance by the Board of Aldermen and no lots shall be sold from
any plat until recorded. Failure to record the final/record plat within
sixty (60) days of the date of said approval shall void all approvals
thereto unless an extension is requested and granted by the Board of
Aldermen.
C. Agenda. Each plat submitted for preliminary or final approval shall be
placed on the agenda of the Planning and Zoning Commission only after
fulfilling the appropriate requirements of these regulations. However, a
plat not meeting all of the requirements may be submitted providing
Section
410.050
WARRENTON CITY CODE Section
410.060
AO:534
the subdivider presents with the plat a written request for specific
exceptions and enumerates in detail the reasons therefore.
D. Filing Fee. To defray partially the costs of notification and
administration procedures, there shall be paid to the City Clerk at the
time of submission of the preliminary plat a fee of one hundred twentyfive
dollars ($125.00) up to and including the first fifty (50) lots, plus
one dollar ($1.00) for each additional lot and a fee in the same amount
at the time of submission of the final/record plat.
E. Engineering Deposits.
1. Per Section 405.400, if plans are not reviewed in-house, an
engineering deposit in the amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00) is required. Any excess over the cost shall be refunded
within ninety (90) days. Any shortage shall be billed to the
applicant. Prior to issuance of any permit the shortage must be

review fees.
F. Boundary Changes. Two (2) lots with common property lines shall be
exempted for the purpose of establishing a common boundary line from
the procedural provisions contained in this Section and Sections

Section 410.070. Urban Design Principles. [R.O. 2006 §405.070;
Ord. No. 407 Art. II §1, 11-16-1981; Ord. No. 1644 §I, 11-7-2006;
Ord. No. 2087 §I, 4-2-2013]
A. The quality of design of the urban area is dependent on the quality of
design of the individual subdivisions that compose it. Good community
design requires the coordination of the efforts of each subdivider and
developer of land within the urban area. Therefore, the design of each
subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with the principles
established by the Comprehensive Plan for land use, circulation,
community facilities, and public utility services, and in accordance with
the following general principles:
1. It is intended that the urban area shall be designed as a group of
integrated residential neighborhoods and appropriate commercial
and industrial and public facilities. Space for religious,
recreational, educational and shopping facilities to serve the
residents of the neighborhood should be provided and designed as
an integral part of each neighborhood.
2. The size of lots and blocks and other areas for residential,
commercial, industrial, and public uses should be designed to
provide adequate light, air, open space, landscaping, and off-street
parking and loading facilities.
3. The arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system should be
designed to make the most advantageous use of topography and
natural physical features. Tree masses and large individual trees
should be preserved. The system of sidewalks and roadways and
the lot layout should be designed to take advantage of the visual
qualities of the area.
4. Circulation within the urban area shall be provided in accordance
with the following design criteria:
a. Each subdivision shall provide for the continuation of all
arterial streets and highways as shown on the Major Street
Plan. Arterial streets should be located on the perimeter of the
residential neighborhood. Cost above the normal requirements
should be borne by the City.
b. Minor streets should be designed to provide access to each
parcel of land within the residential neighborhood and within
industrial areas. They should be planned so that future urban
expansion will not require the conversion of minor streets to
arterial routes.

Section 410.080. Subdivision Design Standards. [R.O. 2006
§405.080; Ord. No. 407 Art. II §2, 11-16-1981; Ord. No. 437 §1,
2-1-1983; Ord. No. 597 §1, 1-3-1989; Ord. No. 710 §1, 1-7-1992; Ord.
No. 711 §1, 1-7-1992; Ord. No. 911 §I, 12-3-1996; Ord. No. 1241 §I,

Ord. No. 2031 §I, 5-1-2012; Ord. No. 2087 §I, 4-2-2013]
c. Collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route
from other minor streets to the major street and expressway
system.
d. Ingress and egress to residential properties should be provided
only on minor streets.
e. Pedestrian ways should be separated from roadways used by
vehicular traffic. Sidewalks should be designed to provide all
residential building sites with direct access to all neighborhood
facilities, including the elementary school, parks and
playgrounds, churches, and shopping centers.
5. Minimum standards for development are contained in the Zoning
Code, the Building Code, and in these regulations. However, the
Comprehensive Plan expresses policies designed to achieve
optimum quality of development in the urban area. If only the
minimum standards are followed, as expressed by the various
ordinances regulating land development, a standardization of
development will occur. This will produce a monotonous urban
setting. Subdivision design should be of a quality to carry out the
purpose and spirit of the policies expressed in the General Plan and
in these regulations rather than be limited to the minimum
standards required herein.
A. Streets. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location
of all streets should conform to all of the elements of the
Comprehensive Plan and shall be designed in accordance with the
following provisions:
1. Major streets shall be planned to conform with the Major Street
and Comprehensive Plan.
2. Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
major street, the Board of Aldermen may recommend to require
service streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in
a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots, or
such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection
of residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic.
Section
410.070
WARRENTON CITY CODE Section
410.080
AO:538
3. The Planning and Zoning Commission and/or the Board of
Aldermen may require multiple entrances or street easement
dedications during subdivision plat review to provide for public
safety and welfare.
4. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way
or limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may recommend to require a street approximately
parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such
distances also shall be determined with due regard for the
requirements of approach grades and future grade separation
structures.
5. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is placed in the City under conditions
approved by the Board of Aldermen.
6. Where the plat to be subdivided includes only part of the tract
owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative
plan of a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided
portion shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider.
7. When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the
logical location and opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision,
with provision for adequate utility easements and
connections for such re-subdivision.
8. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred thirtyfive
(135) feet should be avoided.
9. Street right-of-way widths shall be in accordance with the Major
Street and Comprehensive Plan and, where not designated therein,
shall be not less than the following:
Major streets.
Primary with median 120 feet
Primary without median 100 feet
Secondary 80 feet
Minor streets.
Collector 60 feet
Minor 50 feet
Cul-de-sac 50 feet
10. The grades of all streets shall not exceed the following, except
where unusual topographic conditions justify, in the opinion of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, a modification of these
standards:
Section
410.080
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
410.080
AO:539
Major streets.
Primary 5 percent
Secondary 6 percent
Minor streets 7 percent
No street grade shall be less than five-tenths of one percent
(0.5%).
11. The horizontal and vertical alignment for all streets shall not be
less than the following, except in cases of unusual topographic
conditions:
a. Horizontal alignment — centerline radius
Major streets.
Primary street 500 feet minimum
Secondary street 300 feet minimum
Minor streets.

front lot easement should be dedicated for the installation of
sidewalks, public and private utilities. The Board of Aldermen may
require aerial easements and easements of greater width for the
extension of main storm and sanitary sewers and other utilities
where the Board of Aldermen deems it necessary. [Ord. No. 2367,
8-15-2017]
2. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage
channel, or stream, which drains one hundred sixty (160) acres or
more of land, there shall be provided a right-of-way for drainage

A. To insure completion of the improvements herein required, the Board of
Aldermen shall require the subdivider to file a surety bond of evidence
of an escrow account or an irrevocable letter of credit with the City
Finance Officer to ensure the actual construction of such improvements
according to the plans and specifications approved by the Board of
Aldermen within a period of time not to exceed two (2) years from the
date of approval of the final plat. Such bond or account shall be in the
amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the estimated cost of the
improvement as determined by the Public Works Director and with
surety and conditions satisfactory to the Board of Aldermen. No
building construction shall be permitted on any lot that does not comply
with the provisions of these regulations and other applicable elements
of the Comprehensive Plan and/or approved improvement/construction
plan and no municipal utility service shall be furnished to such lot.
1. Completion of construction. The construction of all subdivision
improvements shall be completed within two (2) years of signing of
the final plat by the Mayor of the City of Warrenton. The Board of
Aldermen may grant time extension for those developments
showing good cause as to why the improvements have not been
completed. In the event that an extension is requested and granted,
the escrow, surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit for those

410.110
AO:545
Section 410.115. Maintenance Escrow. [Ord. No. 2087 §I, 4-2-2013]
developments not completed shall be extended for the same period
of time.
2. Construction approval. When the Public Works Director or Building
Commissioner approves the completion of each phase of
improvement construction, ninety-five percent (95%) of the
appropriate amount of escrow will be released by the City. Prior to
release of escrow "as-built" construction plans in a digital format
(CAD.dxf/dwg) in State plane coordinates and .pdf format plus one
(1) set of paper sets shall be provided to the City. Items that are to
be "as-built" are storm systems (including detention/retention
basins), sanitary systems, water systems, pavement and required
signage.
3. Final approval. Upon completion and approval of all improvements
and receipt of all required documentation, the balance of the
escrow will be released.
4. Failure of construction of improvements. Upon the default or
failure of the subdivider to complete such improvements within
said two (2) year period or any extension thereof granted by the
Board of Aldermen, the subdivider shall be considered in default
and the City will become the owner of the escrow account or may
make demand upon the surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit.
A. Maintenance Escrow During Building Construction. Once the
infrastructure has been installed, inspected and accepted by the City
following the schedule above, the developer shall put up a new
maintenance escrow that would ensure that the infrastructure remains
in an acceptable condition during the building construction. This new
escrow shall be put in place as a condition of the full release of the
original development escrow and acceptance of the infrastructure for
maintenance purposes by the City. If fewer than three (3) months have
passed since the correction of deficiencies at the ninety-five percent
(95%) escrow release, then no additional inspections would be required
prior to establishing the maintenance escrow. With the maintenance
escrow in place, the City's maintenance responsibilities will be limited
to: snow plowing, pavement striping and payment of street lighting
bills. The administration of this new maintenance escrow shall be in a
similar manner to the development escrow.
B. The developer may choose if and how the maintenance escrow is
replaced by a successor builder or builders as long as all City
requirements are met. The City will review and approve any such
replacement escrows. This new maintenance escrow will assure the
City that it has a fund dedicated for the specific purpose of correcting
damage to the public infrastructure that occurs during the building
construction and that all stakeholders (developer, builders, banks and
City) are aware that this fund will be used to correct such damage. The
Section
410.110
WARRENTON CITY CODE Section
410.115
AO:546
escrow agreement and financial surety shall be approved by the City
Attorney. The maintenance escrow agreement and financial surety shall
not expire until ninety-five percent (95%) of the buildings have been
completed with occupancy approved. The escrow agreement shall
clearly indicate that the developer/builder will be required to post
additional financial surety should deficiencies arise that would cost
more to repair than what is held in the maintenance escrow fund.
With the construction of the final five percent (5%) of the buildings
not covered by the maintenance escrow, the builders and contractors
are not released from damage that is caused by their construction
activities. Maintenance escrows shall be set up on a per plat basis and
the amount of the maintenance escrow funds shall be as follows:
1. Streets. Five percent (5%) of the previously approved cost estimate
from the development escrow.
2. Erosion control. A new estimate shall be provided for the cost of
any grading, vegetation or erosion control that may be necessary
during the period that lots are vacant (prior to a building permit
being issued). This new cost estimate is to be approved by the City
prior to acceptance of the maintenance escrow agreement.
3. Storm sewers. Five percent (5%) of the previously approved cost
estimate from the development escrow.
4. Sanitary sewers. Five percent (5%) of the previously approved cost
estimate from the development escrow.
5. Water. Five percent (5%) of the previously approved cost estimate
from the development escrow.
6. Sidewalks. One hundred percent (100%) of the cost of the
remaining sidewalks to be installed plus five percent (5%) of the
previously approved cost estimate from the development escrow of
the sidewalks that have been installed.
7. Street lights and street signs. Five percent (5%) of the previously
approved cost estimate.
8. Additional funds may be required for special circumstances for all
items listed above.
9. Once all requirements have been satisfied and deficiencies
corrected, the builder may request release of the maintenance
escrow. The Public Works Director and/or the Building
Commissioner shall certify to the Mayor and Board of Aldermen
that all requirements have been complied with and request the
release of the funds held for the maintenance escrow agreement.

with an existing State or Federal highway shall be in accordance
with the specifications of the Missouri Highway Department, but in
no case shall the standard be less than the applicable City
specifications.
2. Whenever a subdivision contains a major street that requires a
street facility that is more costly than is required to serve the future
occupants of the subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to
pay only the portion of the cost of the major street that would equal
the cost of an improvement required to serve only the subdivision,
as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
3. All minor streets in "R-1," "R-2" and "R-3" zoning districts shall be
improved with a durable hard-surface roadway, consisting of either
(a) or (b) of the following or an approved equivalent:

paving.
c. The rolled stone aggregate as required in Subsection
(3)(a) hereof may be eliminated if the Atterburg
Limit determination test by the soils engineer
reveals that the soil is not highly plastic. A liquid
limit greater than fifty percent (50%), and a
plasticity index greater than twenty-five percent
(25%) shall be considered a highly plastic soil as
established by ASTM-D4318.
All construction methods shall be approved by the
Public Works Director or the City Engineer, prior to
paving.
4. A suitable curb and gutter shall be constructed along the outside
lines of all street pavements except as provided by Section

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purposes
Section 415.010. Statutory Authorization. [Ord. No. 1872 §I,
9-1-2009]
The legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section 79.110, RSMo.,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain
management regulations designed to protect the health, safety and general
welfare. Therefore, the Board of Aldermen of the City of Warrenton,
Missouri, ordains as follows.
Section 415.020. Findings of Fact. [Ord. No. 1872 §I, 9-1-2009]
A. Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood
hazard areas of the City of Warrenton, Missouri, are subject to
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and
impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
B. General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
1. The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain
causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and
2. The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods,
hazardous to others, inadequately elevated or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
C. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) that is the basis of this Chapter uses a standard engineering
method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of
interrelated steps.
1. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as
its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated and the
depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this
Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be
expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any
one (1) year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's
FIS and illustrative materials for Warren County, Missouri, dated
November 4, 2009, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
2. Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard
hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream
channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.

ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
415.020
AO:565
Section 415.030. Statement of Purpose. [Ord. No. 1872 §I,
9-1-2009]
3. Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
4. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood
height.
5. Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base
flood.
A. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Article I, Section
415.020(A); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as
defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to
meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of
this Chapter to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or

For the purposes of this Chapter, the following terms shall be deemed to
have the meaning indicated below:
DESIGN STORM EVENT — A storm of varying duration and intensity having
a ten percent (10%) probability of being equaled or exceeded in any given
year (a 10-year storm).
DETENTION FACILITY — A surface water runoff storage facility that is
normally dry but is designed to hold (detain) surface water temporarily
during and immediately after a runoff event.
DIFFERENTIAL RUNOFF — The difference in peak flow rate of water
anticipated to shed from a parcel of land between the existing and improved
surface condition for each rainfall event.
EROSION CONTROL CLEANUP PLAN — A plan to clean up the property or
any surrounding properties affected by erosion and stormwater runoff as a
result of land disturbance activities.
EROSION CONTROL PLAN — A plan to prevent, control and minimize the
wearing away of land surface through the action of wind or water. Such
practices, procedures or schedule of activities shall comply with sediment
and erosion control standards listed in Section 430.030.
FREEBOARD — The difference in elevation between the top of the detention
basin dam and the design surface water elevation.
LAND DISTURBANCE ACTIVITY — Clearing, grading or any related work
which results in removal of the natural site vegetation and destruction of
the root zone or otherwise results in leaving the ground surface exposed to
soil erosion through the action of wind or water.
accomplished through the requirement of special measures to mitigate
erosion both during and after construction, the detention and
controlled discharge of the differential runoff from the development,
and a well-designed stormwater conveyance system.
B. Stormwater management planning must be performed on a watershed
basis independent of legal property boundaries. Stormwater
management plans must consider and address each watershed
associated with, or impacted by, the proposed development,
construction or site improvement work. Erosion control plans, cleanup
plans, and individual lot stormwater drainage plans must clearly show
how stormwater falling on, entering, crossing and exiting the subject
area(s) will be handled.
C. All stormwater management planning shall seek to reduce the velocity
of overland flow and allow the maximum opportunity for infiltration of
stormwaters into the ground, to preserve and utilize natural streams,
channels and detention basins and, wherever possible, to include
streams and floodplains within parks or other public grounds.

RETENTION FACILITY — A surface water runoff storage facility that always
contains (retains) a substantial volume of water to serve recreational,
aesthetic, water supply or other functions. Surface water is temporarily
stored above the normal stage during and immediately after runoff events.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN — The drawings, computations, data,
proposed contours, reports, etc., that identify how stormwater runoff is to
be handled.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM — All means, natural or
manmade, used for conducting stormwater runoff to, through or from a
drainage area to the point of outlet.
STORMWATER RUNOFF — Water that results from precipitation which is
not absorbed by soil, evaporated into the atmosphere, or entrapped by
ground surface depressions and vegetation.

A. General. Sediment and erosion control shall be accomplished by
applying conservation practices that will reduce the potential for
damage from these hazards. Control practices use trapping, filtering or
diversion techniques to protect adjacent properties from land
disturbance activities.
The application of this Chapter is not limited to cases in which building
permits have been issued for construction work, but it is the intent of
this Chapter that it shall apply to all cases in which the owner of any
real estate in the City permits soil from such real estate to be eroded
onto the public way.
B. Stormwater Permit. Effective March, 2003 construction sites where the
area to be disturbed is one (1) acre or more must apply for a stormwater
discharge permit from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
Prior to beginning any grading or clearing on the subject parcel, the
owner or his/her designee shall file a copy of said permit with the
Building Commissioner.

2006 §430.040; Ord. No. 1132 §I, 7-18-2000]
sized sediment particles to settle out before the runoff is
released to downstream areas.
g. Temporary sediment basin. Performs the same function as a
sediment trap, although it has a greater volume and is located
below disturbed areas generally greater than five (5) acres.
h. Temporary slope drain. May be plastic sheets, metal or flexible
pipe, stone, gutter, fiber mats, concrete or asphalt ditches, or
half round pipe to carry runoff from one elevation to a lower
elevation without excessive erosion of the slope.
i. Check dam. May be constructed of logs or stone across a swale
or drainage ditch to reduce the water's velocity and to trap
small amounts of sediment.
j. Level spreader. Is an excavated depression to convert a
concentrated flow to a sheet flow, allowing water to be
released at less erosive levels.
k. Erosion control fabrics.
It is not the intent of this Section to stipulate any
particular means of erosion control or cleanup but to
allow the owner, developer, builder or contractor to
select the best method for any particular project,
subject to the approval of the City's Building
Commissioner.
3. Construction plans. A contoured development map must clearly
indicate the pattern of surface water runoff, both upstream and
downstream of the development. The type of sediment and erosion
control to be utilized shall be clearly indicated. The City shall have
authority to require proper controls as specified herein.
4. Cleanup plan. The cleanup plan shall include a method of cleanup
and a time schedule for the work to be done after the owner,
builder, contractor or developer has been advised by the City's
Building Commissioner or his/her authorized representative that
erosion has occurred or that excessive material has been tracked
off-site onto the public way.
A. Purpose. A development's stormwater drainage system shall be
designed to:
1. Protect natural waterways.
2. Convey upstream and on-site stormwater runoff to a natural
watercourse or to a stormwater drainage facility.
Section
430.030
WARRENTON CITY CODE Section
430.040
AO:622
3. Protect existing stormwater conveyance systems.
4. Provide protection from the design storm event and address the
major storm event so as to prevent major property damage and loss
of life.
B. Rainfall Frequency. All facilities shall be designed to carry a 10-year
storm of a duration which produces the maximum peak flow rate of
stormwater runoff without inundation or surcharging. All hydraulic
structures shall be designed to allow for a 100-year storm to pass
through the subdivision without destroying or damaging property or
inundating dwellings. Design information which substantiates both
conditions shall be provided.
Utilize MoDOT published I.D.F. curves for the 2-, 5-, 10-, 25- and
100-year frequencies.
C. Calculation Of Runoff. The method of calculating and routing
stormwater runoff shall be a generally accepted stormwater
management practice. The drainage area shall consider all on- and offsite
lands contributing to the proposed development's drainage system.
Capacity for such facilities shall be based on the maximum potential
watershed development permitted.
1. The Rational Method for calculating stormwater runoff may be
used for developments up to two hundred (200) acres. The Rational
Method may be modified per MSD standards for developments
greater than two hundred (200) acres. Other common rainfall
runoff calculation methods that may be utilized include Graphical
Peak Discharge, Tabular, and the Synthetic Unit Hydrograph.
2. The minimum percentage of imperviousness to be used in design
shall be based on the zoning district as shown in the following
table:
District
Minimum %

3. Special uses, such as schools, churches, etc., shall have the
differential runoff computed and approved by the City.
4. Special circumstances may dictate that the developed impervious
area may differ from that shown in the above table. Calculations
prepared by a registered professional engineer may be submitted
to the City for their evaluation to determine if a minimum
impervious area which differs from that shown in the above table
may be utilized. Likewise, the City may determine that the percent
of impervious area for a particular development differs from that
shown in the above table.
5. See Figure "B" at the end of this Chapter for the runoff factor to be
utilized for various impervious conditions and rainfall durations.
D. Open Channels. Open channels consist of swales, ditches or
depressions, both natural and manmade, that convey water. Channels
shall be protected from scour and erosion by providing a channel lining
adequate to sustain the velocity of the 10-year design storm. If
velocities in channels exceed five (5) feet per second during 10-year
design storms, then erosion control other than vegetation shall be
provided in channel construction. Channels shall have the hydraulic
capacity to carry the 10-year design storm runoff within the channel
bed and banks. Out-of-bank flow may be permitted on land slopes
parallel to the channel where it can be shown that no erosion damage or
serious property damage will result. Channels function as part of the
major drainage system and shall be evaluated for the 100-year design
storm to determine the impacts of runoff on adjacent property. The
channel's hydraulic capacity shall be increased where adjustments to
channel geometry provide significant protection to adjacent properties
during the 100-year event.
E. Closed Conduit Storm Sewers. Pipe sizes for closed conduit flow shall
be based on the 10-year design storm runoff and minimum allowable
velocities. The system shall provide for the cleaning of sediment and
other deposits by maintaining a minimum velocity of two (2) fps during
the 10-year storm, but in no instance shall be less than twelve (12)
inches in diameter.
1. Manning's Equation is the most common method of estimating the
capacity and flow resistance in closed conduits, although the

Section 430.050. Stormwater Detention and Retention Facility
Standards. [R.O. 2006 §430.050; Ord. No. 1132 §I, 7-18-2000; Ord.
No. 1669 §§I — II, 12-19-2006; Ord. No. 1954 §I, 3-15-2011]
Kutter, HazenWilliams, and Darcy Weisbach formulas are also
acceptable.
2. Closed conduit storm sewer systems shall convey the 10-year
design storm to a point of discharge by gravity or pressure flow. In
pressure flow conditions, the hydraulic grade line shall be
calculated to reflect losses in pipes and structures and shall not
rise to an elevation greater than the sewer structure tops during
the design storm.
3. Generally, gravity flow occurs where the capacity of pipe run
exceeds the design flow and the outfall point does not control
discharge. Storm sewer systems may be designed for pressure flow
when the hydraulic grade line is above the crown of the pipe. The
decision to design a pressure flow system may be based on
aesthetics, the need to submerge outfalls, economics, limitations
associated with reduced pipe sizes, or grade constraints in
outfalling the system.
F. Inlets. Calculations shall be submitted to demonstrate the capacity of
all inlets, such calculations must consider the cross-slope of the
pavement, depth of water at the curb face, size of opening, and the
longitudinal grade of street. Street inlets and inlets in parking areas
shall reduce the spread and depth of flow to acceptable levels during
the 10-year design storm. The acceptable level of flow for a minor
access or local access street would maintain an eight (8) foot travel lane
with a maximum one (1) inch depth. One (1) clear ten (10) foot travel
lane must be maintained for a collector street and two (2) clear ten (10)
foot travel lanes must be maintained for a major street. Any area
inundated by water ponding at an inlet during the 10-year storm event
shall be located within an easement or right-of-way. The effects of the
100-year storm event shall be analyzed to insure no property damage or
dangerous conditions result. Inlets located on continuous grades may
be designed to permit a portion of flow to by-pass the structure;
however, calculations for the downstream structure must consider the
by-pass.
A. When Detention And/Or Retention Facilities Are Required. The City
retains the right to require detention or retention storage in all cases in
which the proposed development will increase stormwater runoff (postdevelopment
runoff greater than pre-development runoff) for the
design storms given above. Therefore, every development shall have
stormwater detention or retention, except as specified herein.
1. Off-site detention facilities shall not be allowed, except that, at the
discretion of the Board of Aldermen, a variance can be granted by
Section
430.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
430.050
AO:625
the Board of Aldermen allowing off-site detention subject to
reasonable restrictions and conditions.
2. Off-site facility by City. If an off-site stormwater management
system has been either constructed or programmed or identified
for construction by the City, and the applicant has agreed to
contribute to or participate in the construction thereof.
3. It is determined that no immediate adverse effects will result to
adjacent property, and a contribution is made to the Stormwater
Management Improvements Fund (as described in Subsection (D)
of this Section).
If immediate on-site or off-site detention is not required as specified
in the above paragraph, the applicant must contribute to the
Stormwater Management Improvements Fund. The minimum
contribution shall be an amount equal to two hundred dollars
($200.00) for every cubic foot per second or any fraction thereof
of differential runoff generated during the 100-year design storm
event or one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), whichever is greater.
4. Other management techniques. Management techniques other
than detention facilities may be utilized by the development
provided the techniques proposed meet the intent of this Section
and provide a benefit to the watershed that equals or exceeds the
benefit that a detention facility would provide.
5. If drainage provisions for the proposed development were
previously approved and remain valid as part of a final plat.
6. Isolated lots of record for single-family and two-family dwelling
purposes unless the development involves changing in any way
existing drainage facilities, degrades the quality of water, adversely
affects any wetland or adversely affects any sinkhole, watercourse
or waterbody.
7. Building construction which will not increase the amount of
impervious area on the site and will not adversely impact an
existing drainage area or drainage on adjoining properties.
B. Storage Capacity. The rates (pre-developed and post-developed) of
runoff shall be determined for the 10- and 100-year rainfall frequencies.
The minimum storm duration shall be twenty (20) minutes.
1. Stormwater shall be detained on site, or on adjacent property
under agreement, and metered out at the rate of an undeveloped
site for the above frequencies and minimum duration to prevent
possible flooding and erosion downstream. Design criteria to
establish this differential runoff rate shall be as provided in Section
430.040, "Stormwater Drainage System Standards". Note that
stormwater pipes shall be sized to carry the total developed
Section
430.050
WARRENTON CITY CODE Section
430.050
AO:626
tributary upstream watershed. No reduction in pipe size shall be
permitted because of detention.
2. Detention basin volume will be based on routing each postdeveloped
runoff hydrograph through the detention facility while
satisfying the appropriate allowable release rate. The routing
computation shall be based on an application of the continuity
principle. The discharge rate shall be based on the maximum head
conditions in the detention facility.
C. General Design Features.
1. Dry bottom basins. May be constructed to temporarily detain the
stormwater runoff so that the rate at which it is released is the
same rate as before development. The following features shall be
incorporated into the design of any detention basin:
a. Freeboard. Detention storage areas shall have adequate
capacity to contain the storage volume of tributary stormwater
runoff with at least two (2) feet of freeboard above the water
surface.
b. Outlet control works. Outlet works shall be designed to limit
peak outflow rates from detention storage areas to at or below
peak flow rates that would have occurred prior to the proposed
development.
Outlet works shall not include any mechanical components
or devices and shall function without requiring attendance or
control during operation, unless specifically approved by the
City.
c. Emergency overflow/spillway. Emergency structure shall be
provided to permit the safe passage of runoff generated in
excess of the design storm event. Antivortex measures shall be
provided where warranted.
d. Maximum depth. The maximum planned depth of stormwaters
stored shall not normally exceed five (5) feet.
e. Side slopes. The maximum side slopes for grassed basins shall
not exceed one (1) foot vertical for three (3) feet horizontal.
f. Limits of ponding. In no case shall the limits of maximum
ponding be closer than thirty (30) feet horizontally from any
building and less than two (2) feet vertically below the lowest
sill elevation.
g. Interior drainage. The basin bottom should be designed to
drain expeditiously. Flows through the detention basin should
be handled by paved ditch from inflow structure to outflow
structure to minimize erosion.
Section
430.050
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
430.050
AO:627
h. Multi-purpose basins. If the detention basin is to have other
uses, the design of the basin bottom should include
underdrains to expedite drying of the bottom between runoff
events.
i. Aesthetics. Designs should result in aesthetically pleasing
configurations which will enhance public acceptability.
2. Wet bottom basins. Wet bottom basins may also be used to
temporarily detain the differential runoff from the development. In
addition to the general design features enumerated above for dry
bottom basins, the following features should also be incorporated
into the design of any wet bottom basin:
a. Normal pool depth. In order to minimize weed growth, the
normal pool depth should be four (4) feet minimum.
b. Depth for fish. If fish are to be kept in the pond, at least onequarter
(¼) of the area of the permanent pool should have a
minimum depth of ten (10) feet.
c. Facilities for emptying. In order to ease cleaning of the pond or
shoreline maintenance, the pond design should include
provisions for emptying the pond.
d. Low flow by-pass. The design of any pond may include a low
flow by-pass channel or pipeline to divert runoff that can be
accommodated by downstream drainageways.
e. Side slopes below normal pool. The side slopes below the
normal pool elevation may exceed the maximum side slope
permitted above normal pool (3:1 slope). The design shall,
however, include provisions for a safety ledge having a depth of
water not greater than three (3) feet immediately adjacent to
the shoreline.
f. Forbay. In order to minimize siltation of the pond, a forbay
should be included in the design.
3. Parking lot storage. Paved parking lots may be designed to provide
temporary detention storage of stormwater on all or a portion of
their surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as to slowly empty the
stored waters and depths of storage must be limited so as to
prevent damage to parked vehicles.
4. Other detention methods. All or a portion of the detention storage
may also be provided in underground or surface detention facilities
to include basins, tanks, or swales, etc. Emergency overflow
conditions shall be considered in all methods.
D. Stormwater Management Improvements Fund. A Stormwater
Management Improvements Fund shall be and is hereby created. Said
fund shall be reserved for funding improvements to stormwater systems

within the City in accordance with Section 430.050(A) of this Chapter
shall be deposited to said fund. Said fund shall be deposited in an
interest-bearing account.
A. Storm pipes shall be protected from excessive bearing pressures by
placing them outside the forty-five degree (45°) influence zone of
building structures unless an engineering calculation shows the pipe
material or soil condition to be adequate for the subjected land.
B. Pipes on twenty percent (20%) slopes or greater shall be anchored
securely with concrete anchors or equal to prevent the pipe from
creeping downhill.
C. Pipes or structures constructed on fill shall be stable and protected

alignment utilizing alignment radii established by the pipe
manufacturer.
E. The receiving surface where pipes discharge shall be protected from
erosion by evaluating the discharge velocity for the 10-year design
storm. The use of energy-dissipating devices may be necessary to
reduce the velocity to acceptable levels for the receiving surface.
Grouted revetment used shall be a minimum length of ten (10) times the
diameter of the discharge pipe.
F. A manhole, inlet or junction box shall be located at changes in pipe size,
grade, alignment or material.
G. The angle between influent and effluent pipes shall be not less than
ninety degrees (90°), and the drop between inverts shall be not less
than one-fourth (0.25) foot.
H. Manhole and inlet castings located in travelways shall be capable of
withstanding traffic loads and shall be constructed flush with the
finished surface.
I. All materials and appurtenances for stormwater management systems
shall conform to current standards of the American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM).

partially or fully operational soon after the clearing of the vegetation.
Silt and debris connected with early construction shall be removed
periodically from the detention area and control structure in order to
maintain close to full storage capacity.
B. The responsibility for maintenance of stormwater management
facilities in single-lot development projects shall remain with the owner,
developer and general contractor until final inspection of the
development is performed and approved. After legal occupancy of the
project, the maintenance shall be vested with the owner of the project/
property.
C. The responsibility for maintenance of stormwater management
facilities for subdivision projects shall remain with the developer until
such time as responsibility is transferred, under appropriate legal
arrangements, to the private individual owners or such other
maintenance entity as may be approved by the City.
D. If responsibility is to be transferred to the private individual owners in a
subdivision, the developer shall assure perpetual maintenance of all
open watercourses and detention systems, if any are included, through
the adoption of maintenance agreements or covenants for any facilities
that remain in private ownership. Such agreements or covenants shall
be subject to the approval of the City.
E. If the responsibility is to be transferred to the trustees in a subdivision,
the developer shall establish a suitable indenture of trust. Upon release
of escrows required for the subdivision development, the responsibility
for maintenance shall be vested in the trustee of the subdivision by
virtue of the trust indenture. The indenture of trust shall clearly
indicate resident responsibility for maintenance and shall be subject to
the approval of the City.
F. The growth of noxious weeds, the creation of conditions which support
the growth of mosquitoes and other insects, and the decrease in
available storage by accumulated sediments shall be controlled. The
cleanup of accumulated debris, flotsam and other materials after runoff
events have subsided shall be assured.
G. All such privately owned and maintained facilities shall be subject to the
periodic inspection by the City. If deficiencies are found during an

mailed to the user.
A. Commercial Service Deposits.
1. Except as provided herein, a service deposit shall be required for
every commercial account(s) established with the City. Service
deposit(s) will be based upon existing deposits for like businesses
within the City as determined by the Utility Billing Clerk, subject to
final approval of the Finance Officer. Commercial customers who
have previously maintained a satisfactory credit history with the
City, in the name of the corporate entity owning or operating the
business receiving the bill or in the name of the corporate
representative signing the application and receiving the bill, may
be exempted from payment of the required service deposit, subject
to final approval of the Finance Officer. In order for credit history to
be satisfactory, any previous accounts in the name of the corporate
entity or applicant must have a satisfactory payment history with
no late payment penalties for a period of two (2) consecutive years
within the last five (5) years. Anything in the foregoing not
Section
705.210
WARRENTON CITY CODE Section
705.240
AO:830
withstanding, the City reserves the right to require a service
deposit for the establishment of any commercial account.
2. For strip retail centers with multiple tenants, the calculation will be
based upon the number of possible tenants not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Each regular retail tenant space will
require a minimum of a one hundred dollar ($100.00) service
deposit amount with the total for each strip center not to exceed
the maximum as stated above. Restaurants and other higher usage
types of tenants will require the amount of like businesses to be
included in the calculation. If the tenants of the strip center have
not been determined at the time the service deposit is received, the
City will have the right to inform the property owner of any
adjustment in the service deposit amount which is required by a
particular type of tenant moving into the location. The property
owner will be required to submit any additional deposit within
thirty (30) days of notification by the City.
B. Residential Service Deposits.
1. Except as provided herein, all residential customers, both inside
and outside the City limits, supplied with water at meter rates shall
be required to deposit one hundred dollars ($100.00) in advance of
establishing an account. Residential customers who have
previously maintained a satisfactory credit history with the City for
a minimum of two (2) consecutive years, may, at the discretion of
the City and subject to the final approval of the Finance Officer, be
exempted from payment of the required service deposit. In order
for a credit history to be satisfactory, the previous account must
have been in the name of the applicant with no late payment
penalties incurred on any account bearing the name of the
applicant for a period of two (2) consecutive years within the last
five (5) years. In no case shall a credit history be acceptable in lieu
of the deposit unless the applicant's name appears on the account
history. Anything in the foregoing notwithstanding, the City
reserves the right to require a service deposit for the establishment
of any residential account.
2. Service deposits for residential rental properties will be
determined by the category of meter and shut-off arrangement for
each living unit at the location. Residential rental properties will be
divided into two (2) types:
a. Individual meters and shut-offs serving each living unit, and
b. Meters and/or shut-offs serving more than one (1) living unit.
3. Individual meter and shut-off serving each living unit.

unit, each tenant may establish his own billing account and
service deposit. The tenant will be required to pay a one
Section
705.240
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
705.240
AO:831
hundred dollar ($100.00) service deposit at the time the
account is established and the monthly billing will be placed
in the tenant's name. Upon vacating the premises and
disconnecting service, the deposit will be applied against the
final bill and any remaining balance refunded to the tenant.
b. When the unit is vacated, if the landlord desires to have the
service transferred into his name, a one hundred dollar
($100.00) service deposit must be in place on the landlord
account for that unit. A landlord who has multiple properties in
this category may choose to place the service deposit in a
master landlord account and have the deposit transferred
between his rental units by signed authorization as they
become vacant. The City reserves the right to require
additional service deposits from the landlord should more than
one of this category of rental units become vacant
simultaneously. Determination of the requirement for
additional service deposits will be made based upon the
average monthly billing for the vacant properties and the
payment history of the landlord. The requested additional
deposit must be submitted within thirty (30) days of
notification by the City. Any additional service deposits
required will be refunded at the landlords request upon new
tenants establishing an account.
4. Meters and/or shut-offs serving more than one (1) living unit.
Where a meter and/or shut-off serves more than one (1) living unit,
a separate billing account will be established for each unit in the
landlord's name. A service deposit of one hundred dollars ($100.00)
per living unit will be required up to a maximum of one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) per building. For purposes of determination of
service deposits, all living units under the same roof will be
considered to be within a building. For units in this category in
existence as of September 5, 2006 (date of this ordinance), the
landlord will be required to place the service deposit and establish
an account for each living unit as the units are vacated or at the
discretion of the City, upon an event of a delinquent payment for a
unit in the landlord's name within the building.
5. Residential and commercial service deposits shall be returned to
the customer:
a. Upon termination of service if all amounts due the City for
water and sewer service have been paid;
b. Upon satisfactory payments by the customer of all charges for
service for a period of two (2) years. Satisfactory payment is
defined as not being assessed a late payment penalty more
than three (3) times in a consecutive twenty-four (24) month
period.

discontinuance of service and the cost for reconnection;
3. The date on or after which service will be discontinued unless the
consumer takes appropriate action;
4. Terms under which the consumer may avoid discontinuance;

Cross-Connection Control
Section 705.280. Cross-Connection Control — General Policy. [R.O.
2006 §710.280; Ord. No. 575 §1, 10-4-1988]
A. Purpose. The purpose of this Article is:
1. To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or
pollution by containing within the consumer's internal distribution
system or private water system contaminants or pollutants which
could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water supply system.
2. To promote the elimination, containment, isolation, or control of
existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the public
or consumer's potable water system and non-potable water
systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial-process systems.
3. To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of crossconnection
control which will systematically and effectively
prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
B. Application. This Article shall apply to all premises served by the public
potable water system of the City of Warrenton, Missouri.
C. Policy. This Article will be reasonably interpreted by the Water
Purveyor. It is the Water Purveyor's intent to recognize the varying
degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the degree of
protection shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard.
The Water Purveyor shall be primarily responsible for protection of
the public potable water distribution system from contamination or
pollution due to backflow or contaminants or pollutants through the
water service connection. The cooperation of all consumers is required
to implement and maintain the program to control cross-connections.
The Water Purveyor and consumer are jointly responsible for
preventing contamination of the water system.
If, in the judgement of the Water Purveyor or his/her authorized
representative, cross-connection protection is required through either
piping modification or installation of an approved backflow prevention
device, due notice shall be given to the consumer. The consumer shall
immediately comply by providing the required protection at his/her own
expense; and failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the consumer
to provide such protection shall constitute grounds for discontinuing
water service to the premises until such protection has been provided.

cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at
sufficiently short notice to assure the cross-connections do not
exist.
4. Premises having a repeated history of cross-connections being
established or re-established.
5. Premises, which due to the nature of the enterprise therein, are
subject to recurring modification or expansion.
6. Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as
to permit entry into the public water supply, or where a crossconnection
could reasonably be expected to occur. This shall
include the handling of process waters and cooling waters.
7. Premises where materials of a toxic or hazardous nature are
handled such that if backsiphonage or backpressure should occur,
a serious health hazard may result.
C. The following types of facilities fall into one (1) or more of the
categories of premises where an approved air-gap separation or
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device is required by
the Water Purveyor and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources
to protect the public water supply and must be installed at these
facilities unless all hazardous or potentially hazardous conditions have
been eliminated or corrected by other methods to the satisfaction of the
Water Purveyor and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources:
