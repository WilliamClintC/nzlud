body shall affirmatively state in writing that disclosure would impair the public
governmental body's ability to protect the security or safety of persons or real property
and shall in the same writing state that the public interest in non-disclosure outweighs the
public interest in disclosure of the records.
Records that are voluntarily submitted by a non-public entity shall be reviewed by the
receiving agency within ninety (90) days of submission to determine if retention of the
document is necessary in furtherance of a State security interest. If retention is not
necessary, the documents shall be returned to the non-public governmental body or

not be used to limit or deny access to otherwise public records in a file, document, data file or
database containing public records. Records related to the procurement of or expenditures
relating to such computer, computer system, computer network or telecommunications
network, including the amount of monies paid by, or on behalf of, a public governmental body
for such computer, computer system, computer network or telecommunications network, shall
be open.

which reimbursement is made by a public governmental body.

electronic means shall also concurrently transmit that message to either the member's public office
computer or the custodian of records in the same format. The provisions of this Section shall only
apply to messages sent to two (2) or more members of that body so that, when counting the sender, a
majority of the body's members are copied. Any such message received by the custodian or at the
member's office computer shall be a public record subject to the exception of Section 610.021, RSMo.
Section 125.040. Notices of Meetings.
All public governmental bodies shall give notice of the time, date and place of each meeting and

Except as set forth in Subsection (D) of Section 125.040, no meeting or vote may be closed
without an affirmative public vote of the majority of a quorum of the public governmental body. The
vote of each member of the governmental body on the question of closing a public meeting or vote
and the specific reason for closing that public meeting or vote by reference to a specific Section of
this Chapter shall be announced publicly at an open meeting of the governmental body and
entered into the minutes.
Any meeting or vote closed pursuant to Section 125.020 shall be closed only to the extent
necessary for the specific reason announced to justify the closed meeting or vote. Public
governmental bodies shall not discuss any business in a closed meeting, record or vote which
does not directly relate to the specific reason announced to justify the closed meeting or vote.
Public governmental bodies holding a closed meeting shall close only an existing portion of the
meeting facility necessary to house the members of the public governmental body in the closed
session, allowing members of the public to remain to attend any subsequent open session held by
the public governmental body following the closed session.
Section 125.060. Journals of Meetings and Records of Voting.
Except as provided in Section 125.020, rules authorized pursuant to Article III of the Missouri
Constitution and as otherwise provided by law, all votes shall be recorded, and if a roll call is
taken, as to attribute each "yea" and "nay" vote, or abstinence if not voting, to the name of the
individual member of the public governmental body. Any votes taken during a closed meeting shall
be taken by roll call. All public meetings shall be open to the public and public votes and public
records shall be open to the public for inspection and duplication. All votes taken by roll call in
meetings of a public governmental body consisting of members who are all elected, shall be cast
by members of the public governmental body who are physically present and in attendance at the
meeting or who are participating via video-conferencing. When it is necessary to take votes by roll
call in a meeting of the public governmental body, due to an emergency of the public body, with a
quorum of the members of the public body physically present and in attendance and less than a
quorum of the members of the public governmental body participating via telephone, facsimile,
Internet, or any other voice or electronic means, the nature of the emergency of the public body
justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall be stated in the minutes. Where such
emergency exists, the votes taken shall be regarded as if all members were physically present
and in attendance at the meeting.
A journal or minutes of open and closed meetings shall be taken and retained by the public
governmental body including, but not limited to, a record of any vote taken at such meeting. The
minutes shall include the date, time, place, members present, members absent, and a record of

accommodate the anticipated attendance by members of the public and at a time reasonably
convenient to the public unless for good cause such a place or time is impossible or impractical.

that is not reasonably accessible to the public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the
public, the nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall
be stated in the minutes.

Section 125.080. Segregation of Exempt Material.
If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure, as well as material which is
exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make
the non-exempt material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies provided
herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a
separation of exempt from non-exempt information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person
requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe the material
exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat
the purpose of the exemption.
Section 125.090. Custodian Designated — Response to Request
for Access to Records.
The City Clerk shall be the custodian of records and will be responsible for maintenance and
control of all records. The custodian may designate deputy custodians in operating departments of
the City and such other departments or offices as the custodian may determine. Deputy
custodians shall conduct matters relating to public records and meetings in accord with the
policies enumerated herein.
Each public governmental body shall make available for inspection and copying by the public of
that body's public records. No person shall remove original public records from the office of a
public governmental body or its custodian without written permission of the designated custodian.
No public governmental body shall, after August 28, 1998, grant to any person or entity, whether
by contract, license or otherwise, the exclusive right to access and disseminate any public record
unless the granting of such right is necessary to facilitate coordination with, or uniformity among,
industry regulators having similar authority.
Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon as possible, but in no
event later than the end of the third (3rd) business day following the date the request is received
by the custodian of records of a public governmental body. If records are requested in a certain
format, the public body shall provide the records in the requested format, if such format is
available. If access to the public record is not granted immediately, the custodian shall give a
detailed explanation of the cause for further delay and the place and earliest time and date that
the record will be available for inspection. This period for document production may exceed three
(3) days for reasonable cause.
If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon request, a written statement of
the grounds for such denial. Such statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which
access is denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of the third (3rd)
business day following the date that the request for the statement is received.
Section 125.100. Fees for Copying Public Records —
Limitations.
Except as otherwise provided by law, each public governmental body shall provide access to and,
upon request, furnish copies of public records subject to the following:
Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted under Section 32.091,
RSMo., shall not exceed ten cents ($.10) per page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9) by
fourteen (14) inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to exceed the average hourly
rate of pay for clerical staff of the public governmental body. Research time required for
fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based on the

scope of the request, the public governmental body shall produce the copies using employees
of the body that result in the lowest amount of charges for search, research, and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the person requesting the records
may request the public governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge
when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial
interest of the requester.
Fees for providing access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes
or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices, and for paper copies larger than nine (9) by fourteen (14) inches shall
include only the cost of copies, staff time, which shall not exceed the average hourly rate of
pay for staff of the public governmental body required for making copies and programming, if
necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or other medium used for the duplication. Fees for
maps, blueprints or plats that require special expertise to duplicate may include the actual
rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to duplicate such maps, blueprints or
plats. If programming is required beyond the customary and usual level to comply with a
request for records or information, the fees for compliance may include the actual cost of such
programming.
Payment of such copying fees may be requested prior to the making of copies.

response to evidence developed by Law Enforcement Officers in the course of their duties.
Section 125.120. Police Department Records.
The Police Department of the City shall maintain records of all incidents reported to the Police
Department and investigations and arrests made by the Police Department. All incident reports
and arrest reports shall be open records. Notwithstanding any other provision of law other than the
provisions of Subsection (C) of this Section or Section 320.083, RSMo., investigative reports of
the Police Department are closed records until the investigation becomes inactive. If any person is
arrested and not charged with an offense against the law within thirty (30) days of the person's
arrest, the arrest report shall thereafter be a closed record except that the disposition portion of
the record may be accessed and except as provided in Section 125.140.
Except as provided in Subsections (C) and (D) of this Section, if any portion of a record or
document of a Police Department Officer or the Police Department, other than an arrest report
which would otherwise be open, contains information that is reasonably likely to pose a clear and
present danger to the safety of any victim, witness, undercover officer or other person; or
jeopardize a criminal investigation, including records which would disclose the identity of a source
wishing to remain confidential or a suspect not in custody; or which would disclose techniques,
procedures or guidelines for Police Department investigations or prosecutions, that portion of the
record shall be closed and shall be redacted from any record made available pursuant to this
Chapter.
Any person, a family member of such person within the first degree of consanguinity of such
person if deceased or incompetent, attorney for a person, or insurer of a person involved in any
incident or whose property is involved in an incident may obtain any records closed pursuant to
this Section or Section 125.140 for purposes of investigation of any civil claim or defense as
provided by this Subsection. Any individual, his/her attorney or insurer involved in an incident or
whose property is involved in an incident, upon written request, may obtain a complete unaltered
and unedited incident report concerning the incident and may obtain access to other records
closed by the Police Department pursuant to this Section. Within thirty (30) days of such request,
the Police Department shall provide the requested material or file a motion pursuant to this
Subsection with the Circuit Court having jurisdiction over the Police Department stating that the
safety of the victim, witness or other individual cannot be reasonably ensured, or that a criminal
investigation is likely to be jeopardized. Pursuant to Section 610.100(4), RSMo., if, based on such
motion, the court finds for the Police Department, the court shall either order the record closed or
order such portion of the record that should be closed to be redacted from any record made
available pursuant to this Subsection.
Any person may apply pursuant to this Subsection to the Circuit Court having jurisdiction for an
order requiring a Law Enforcement Agency to open incident reports and arrest reports being
unlawfully closed pursuant to the Section. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that the Law Enforcement Officer or Agency has knowingly violated this Section, the officer or
agency shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). If
the court finds that there is a knowing violation of this Section, the court may order payment by
such officer or agency of all costs and attorneys' fees, as provided by Section 610.027, RSMo. If
the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the Law Enforcement Officer or Agency
has purposely violated this Section, the officer or agency shall be subject to a civil penalty in an
amount up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) and the court shall order payment by such officer
or agency of all costs and attorney fees, as provided in Section 610.027, RSMo. The court shall
determine the amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the
seriousness of the offense, and whether the Law Enforcement Officer or Agency has violated this
Section previously.

so, the court shall decide the extent or duration of sentence or other disposition to be imposed

employee of a county, city, organization or agency charged with the supervision of such free
work or who benefits from its performance shall be immune from any suit by the person
placed on parole or probation or any person deriving a cause of action from him/her if such
cause of action arises from such supervision of performance, except for intentional torts or
gross negligence. The services performed by the probationer or parolee shall not be deemed
employment within the meaning of the provisions of Chapter 288, RSMo.

or termination of the probation term.

Upon a plea or a finding of guilty for a first (1st) offense of violating the provisions of an
ordinance of the City of Riverside involving alcohol- or drug-related traffic offenses, the
Court may, in addition to imposition of any penalties provided by law, order the convicted
person to reimburse the Police Department for the costs associated with such arrest.
Such costs hereby authorized shall include the reasonable cost of making the arrest,
including the cost of any chemical test made as authorized or required by law or
ordinance to determine the alcohol or drug content of the person's blood, and the costs of
processing, charging, booking and holding such person in custody.
The Chief of Police shall establish a schedule of such costs hereby authorized and shall

reduced if it determines that the costs are excessive.
Upon receipt of such additional costs authorized by this Subsection, the City Treasurer
shall retain such costs in a separate fund to be known as the "DWI/Drug Offense Cost
Reimbursement Fund". Monies within such fund shall be appropriated by the Board of
Aldermen to the Police Department in amounts equal to those costs so collected and
shall be used by such department specifically to enhance and support the enforcement
and prosecution of alcohol- and drug-related traffic laws within the City.
Fines — where held.
All fines, bonds and Court funds may be deposited to a separate account and paid over
not less frequently than monthly into the Municipal Treasury.
The Court Clerk is hereby authorized to pay out funds as authorized by the Court or by
law on warrants drawn on the City.

Section 145.010. Objective — Purpose.
[R.O. 2011 §145.010; Ord. No. 2008-40 §1, 3-4-2008]
To obtain maximum investment income through prudent and conservative investments of the
City's temporarily idle funds while maintaining sufficient fund balances to meet approved
expenditures. The City will utilize those financing alternatives and techniques which produce
positive financial advantages and security for its citizens. The primary objectives in priority order of
investment activities shall be safety, liquidity and yield.
Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments
shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall
portfolio. The objective will be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk.
Credit risk. The City of Riverside will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure
of the security issuer or backer, by:
The financial institutions, broker/dealers, intermediaries and advisors with which the
City of Riverside will do business will be pre-qualified; and
The portfolio will be diversified so that potential losses on individual securities will be
minimized.
Interest rate risk. The City of Riverside will minimize the risk that the market value of
securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general interest rates by:
The investment portfolio will be structured so that securities mature to meet cash
requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on
the open market prior to maturity; and
Investing operating funds primarily in shorter-term securities.
Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all operating
requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the
portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands

(static liquidity). Furthermore, since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the
portfolio should consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic
liquidity). A portion of the portfolio also may be placed in bank deposits or repurchase
agreements that offer same-day liquidity for short-term funds.
Yield. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate
of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk
constraints and liquidity needs. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to
the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The investments are limited to relatively
low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed.
Securities shall not be sold prior to maturity with the following exceptions:
A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of principal.
A security swap would improve the quality, yield or target duration in the portfolio.
Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold.
Section 145.020. General Policy of Investment Limitations.
[R.O. 2011 §145.020; Ord. No. 2008-40 §1, 3-4-2008]
It is the policy of the City to only invest in those instruments eligible to be purchased by a City of

with final maturities of two (2) years.)

Investment restrictions and prohibited transactions. To provide for the safety and liquidity of
the City of Riverside's funds, the investment portfolio will be subject to the following
restrictions:
Borrowing for investment purposes ("leverage") is prohibited.
Instruments known as structured notes (e.g., inverse floaters, leveraged floaters and
equity-linked securities) are not permitted. Investment in any instrument which is
commonly considered a "derivative" instrument (e.g., options, futures, swaps, caps, floors
and collars) is prohibited.
Contracting to sell securities not yet acquired in order to purchase other securities for
purposes of speculating on developments or trends in the market is prohibited.
Collateralization. Collateralization will be required on two (2) types of investments: certificates
of deposit and repurchase agreements. The market value (including accrued interest) of the
collateral should be at least one hundred percent (100%).
For certificates of deposit, the market value of collateral must be at least one hundred
percent (100%) or greater of the amount of certificates of deposits plus demand deposits
with the depository, less the amount, if any, which is insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Unions Share Insurance Fund.
All securities, which serve as collateral against the deposits of a depository institution,
must be safekept at a non-affiliated custodial facility. Depository institutions pledging
collateral against deposits must, in conjunction with the custodial agent, furnish the
necessary custodial receipts within five (5) business days from the settlement date.
The City of Riverside, Missouri, shall have a depositary contract and pledge agreement
with each safekeeping bank that will comply with the Financial Institutions, Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA). This will ensure that the City of
Riverside's security interest in collateral pledged to secure deposits is enforceable
against the receiver of a failed financial institution.
The Finance Office shall maintain a list of the securities designated by the Board of
Aldermen as acceptable collateral of the deposit of City funds. The listing is not intended
to serve as, and should not be considered as, a listing of legally authorized investment
instruments. The City of Riverside reserves the right to refuse to accept as collateral any
security or securities on this list, or to request the submission of an alternate acceptable
security or securities, if, in the sole discretion of the Finance Officer, he/she determines
that such action will provide greater security for the deposit of City funds.
Repurchase agreements. The securities for which repurchase agreements will be transacted
will be limited to U.S. Treasury and government agency securities that are eligible to be
delivered via the Federal Reserve's Fedwire book entry system. Securities will be delivered to
the City of Riverside's designated custodial agent. Funds and securities will be transferred on
a delivery vs. payment basis.

[R.O. 2011 §145.030; Ord. No. 2008-40 §1, 3-4-2008]
Diversification.

concentration of assets in specific maturity, specific issuer or specific class of securities.

with anticipated cash flow requirements. Investments in bankers' acceptances and
commercial paper shall mature and become payable not more than one hundred eighty (180)
days from the date of purchase. All other investments shall mature and become payable not
more than two (2) years from the date of purchase. However, no more than twenty percent
(20%) of the portfolio should have a maturity greater than one (1) year from the date of

ongoing obligations.

control structure that will be reviewed annually with the City of Riverside's independent auditor.
The internal control structure shall be designed to ensure that the assets of the City of Riverside
are protected from loss, theft or misuse and to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives
are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that:
The cost of control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived, and
The valuation of costs and benefits require estimates and judgments by management.

standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Finance Officers
acting in accordance with written procedures and this investment policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal liability for an individual security's credit risk or market price
changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion to the Governing
Body and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in accordance with the terms of this
policy. Investment shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing,
which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own
affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as
well as the probably income to be derived.

Methods. The Finance Officer shall prepare an investment report at least quarterly, including a
management summary that provides an analysis of the status of the current investment portfolio
and transactions made over the last quarter. This management summary will be prepared in a
manner that will allow the City of Riverside, Missouri, to ascertain whether investment activities
during the reporting period have conformed to the investment policy. The report shall be provided
to the Governing Body of the City of Riverside, Missouri, on a quarterly basis unless otherwise
required. The report will include the following:
Listing of individual securities held at the end of the reporting period; and
Realized and unrealized gains or losses resulting from appreciation or depreciation by listing
the cost and market value of securities over one (1) year duration (in accordance with
Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 31 requirements and only required
annually); and
Average weighted yield to maturity of portfolio on investments as compared to applicable
bench marks; and
Listing of investment by maturity date; and
Percentage of the total portfolio which each type of investment represents.
Performance Standards. The investment portfolio will be managed in accordance with the
parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio should obtain a market average rate of return
during a market/economic environment of stable interest rates. A series of appropriate bench
marks may be established against which portfolio performance shall be compared on a regular
basis. Commercial paper and bankers' acceptances must be reviewed monthly to determine if the
rating level has changed. The commercial paper and bankers' acceptances should be reviewed
for possible sale if the securities are downgraded below the minimum acceptable rating levels.
Marking To Market. The market value of the portfolio shall be calculated at least quarterly and a
statement of the market value of the portfolio shall be issued at least annually to the Governing
Body of the City of Riverside, Missouri. This will ensure that review of the investment portfolio, in
terms of value and price volatility, has been performed.

trained for dogfighting.
Any dog that has bitten a human being without provocation on public or private property other
than the property of the owner.
Any dog that, while on the owner's property, has bitten without provocation a human being
other than the owner or a member of the owner's family who normally resides at the place
where the dog is kept.
Any dog that, when unprovoked, chases or approaches a person upon the streets, sidewalks,
or any public grounds or private property other than the property of the owner, in a menacing
fashion or apparent attitude of attack, regardless of whether or not a person is injured by such
dog.
Any dog with a known propensity, tendency or disposition to attack unprovoked, to cause
injury, or to otherwise threaten the safety of human beings, domestic animals, dogs or cats.
If the circumstances surrounding the classification as a dangerous dog under any of the definitions
listed in Subsection (A) of this Section are in dispute, then the owner has the option of submitting,
within five (5) working days, a written request to the Chief of Police for a hearing and possible
appeal as follows:
A hearing board, consisting of the Chief of Police and two (2) other people designated by him
shall be convened within ten (10) working days after receipt of a bona fide written request.
Pending the outcome of such a hearing, the dog must be confined in such a manner so as not
to be a threat to any person. The confinement may be on the owner's premises or with a
licensed veterinarian.
The hearing board shall determine whether to declare the animal to be a dangerous dog
based upon evidence and testimony presented at the time of the hearing by the owner, in
addition to witnesses, Animal Control personnel, police or any other person possessing
information pertinent to such determination.
The hearing board shall issue written findings within five (5) days after the hearing. The owner
or possessor of the animal found to be dangerous shall be required to maintain the animal as
provided in this Section.
Exemptions to dangerous dog classification:

willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner or keeper of the dog;
was teasing, tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the dog; has in the past been observed or
reported to have teased, tormented, abused or assaulted the dog; or was committing or
attempting to commit a crime.
With the exception of Subsection (A) of this Section, an Animal Control Officer may, because
of extenuating circumstances, determine from the investigation of an incident, that an animal
is not dangerous. However, the owner, being responsible for the dog, may be warned of the
animal's tendencies and to take appropriate action to prevent subsequent incidents. This,
however, does not exempt the owner from being cited for other animal control ordinance
violations.
Dogs owned by governmental or law enforcement agencies when being used in the services
of those agencies are exempt from being classified as dangerous.

Any dangerous dog that bites or scratches a human being and any dog whose behavior
immediately prior to or during an incident resulting in the biting or scratching of a human being
that is determined to be dangerous, shall be impounded for a ten (10) day rabies quarantine
at the Municipal Animal Shelter or a veterinarian clinic within or near to the City limits of the
City. Any dog impounded shall not be released to its owner or keeper until the license and
spay/neuter requirements of this Article are complied with and the owner/keeper has paid all
fines and/or costs associated therewith.
Any dangerous dog shall wear at all times a bright orange collar with a large brightly colored
metal tag attached to the collar so the dog can readily be identified as a dangerous dog.
The owner or keeper shall notify the Animal Control Unit immediately if a dangerous dog is
loose, unconfined, or missing, has attacked another animal or has attacked a human being.
The owner or keeper shall notify the Animal Control unit within twenty-four (24) hours if a
dangerous dog has died or has been sold or given away. If the dog has been sold or given
away, the owner or keeper shall provide the Animal Control Unit with the name, address and
telephone number of the new owner. The new owner, if the dog is kept within the City limits of
the City, must comply with the requirements of this Section.
While on the owner's property, a dangerous dog must be securely confined indoors or in a
securely enclosed and locked pen or structure, suitable for preventing the entry of young
children and designed to prevent the animal from escaping. Such pen or structure must have
minimum dimensions of five (5) feet by ten (10) feet and must have secure sides and a
secure top. If it has no bottom secured to the sides, the sides must be embedded into the
ground no less than twelve (12) inches. The enclosure must also provide protection from the
elements for the dog. The enclosure, when occupied by a dangerous dog, shall not be
occupied by any other animal. If the dangerous dog is a female with a litter of puppies under
three (3) months of age, the puppies may occupy the same enclosure as the mother.
No dangerous dog may be kept on a porch, patio or in any part of a house or structure that
would allow the dog to exit such building on its own volition.
The owner or keeper shall display a sign on his premises that there is a dangerous dog on the
property. This sign shall be visible and capable of being read from the public highway or
thoroughfare from which the property is entered. In addition, a similar sign is required to be
posted on the kennel or pen or fenced yard of such animal.
A dangerous dog may be off the owner's premises if it is muzzled and restrained by a
substantial chain or leash not exceeding six (6) feet in length and under the control of a
responsible person. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will not cause injury to the
dog or interfere with its vision or respiration but must prevent it from biting any person or
animal.

or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such offense.
It is no defense to a prosecution for conspiring to commit an offense that a person, who knows

committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he or she conspired;
If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him/her only if
he/she advises those with whom he/she has conspired of his/her abandonment or he/she
informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his/her
participation in it.
A person shall not be charged, convicted or sentenced on the basis of the same course of conduct

A person enters or remains in or upon premises when he or she is not licensed or privileged to do

lawful order not to enter or remain, personally communicated to him or her by the owner of such
premises or by other authorized person. A license or privilege to enter or remain in a building
which is only partly open to the public is not a license or privilege to enter or remain in that part of

steam or water utility, the effect of which tampering is either:

In any prosecution under Subsection (A)(4), proof that a meter or any other property of a utility has
been tampered with, and the person or persons accused received the use or direct benefit of the
electric, gas, steam or water service with one (1) or more of the effects described in Subsection
(A)(4), shall be sufficient to support an inference which the trial court may submit to the trier of fact
from which the trier of fact may conclude that there has been a violation of such Subsection by the
person or persons who use or receive the direct benefit of the electric, gas, steam or water
service.

disability.

Venue shall lie in the County where the personal property was originally rented or leased.

City specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional agreements or other rights
to use the Right-of-Way for any purpose and to any other person, including itself, as it deems
appropriate, subject to all applicable laws. The granting of any agreement, license, or franchise
shall not be deemed to create any property interest of any kind in favor of the ROW user. All
franchises and agreements shall be approved by ordinance of the Board of Aldermen on a nondiscriminatory
basis provided that the applicant is in compliance with all applicable requirements.
Licenses may be approved by the Administrator on a non-discriminatory basis provided that the
applicant is in compliance with all applicable requirements. Such franchises, licenses, and
agreements shall be deemed to incorporate the terms of this Chapter and other applicable laws of

City may require compensation for use of the Right-of-Way or other public property as may be
reasonably required by the Board of Aldermen, subject to applicable law.

be issued unless or until such applicant has a valid franchise, license, or Right-of-Way use
agreement with the City.
No Warranty. The City makes no express or implied representation or warranty regarding its rights
to authorize the installation or construction of facilities on any particular segment of Right-of-Way

excavation, or other ROW work performed prior to obtaining the location of all facilities that have
been properly identified prior to such work. The ROW user shall not make or attempt to make
repairs, relocation, or replacement of damaged or disturbed facilities without the approval of the
owner of the facilities.

provider that buys or leases excess capacity or other services for resale from a ROW user, shall
be subject to the terms and conditions of this Chapter, including the requirement to first register
with the City and obtain any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration, franchise
agreement, or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including,

complies with all applicable Federal, State, and local requirements.

by this Chapter and any ROW use agreement, franchise, license or other authorization, and all
rights hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, provided that said forfeiture
shall not take effect until the City shall carry out the following proceedings: Before the City
declares the forfeiture or revocation of a Right-of-Way use agreement, franchise, license or other
authorization, it shall first serve a written notice upon the person setting forth in detail the neglect
or failure complained of, and the person shall have thirty (30) days thereafter, or such other
reasonable period established by the Governing Body, in which to cure the default by complying
with the conditions of the ROW use agreement, franchise, license or other authorization or
requirement and fully remedying any default or violation. If at the end of such period the City
determines that the conditions have not been complied with and that the person did not
reasonably and in the public interest require more than thirty (30) days to cure the default, the City
shall take action by an affirmative vote of the Board of Aldermen present at the meeting and voting
to terminate the ROW use agreement, franchise, license or other authorization, setting out the
grounds upon which said agreement or other authorization is to be forfeited or revoked. Nothing
herein shall prevent the City from invoking any other remedy or from declaring immediate
forfeiture where the default is incapable of being cured by the ROW user, including where such
defaults or violations have repeatedly occurred.

performance of its obligations or compliance with the City's ordinances in the past, or the
existence of any outstanding violations or deficiencies. The City may deny or condition any
ROW use agreement or franchise where the proposed use would interfere with the public use
of the rights-of-way or otherwise conflict with the legitimate public interests of the City or as
otherwise provided by law. Applications for ROW use agreements or franchises may be
approved, denied, or approved with conditions consistent with requirements of applicable law
or other applicable requirements as may be necessary to fulfill the requirements and
objectives of this Chapter.
Section 250.160. Registration.
[R.O. 2011 §250.170; Ord. No. 2000-92 §2(2.3), 12-5-2000; Ord. No. 1578, 2-6-2018[1]]
Any existing ROW user must register within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the ordinance
from which this Chapter derives. Prior to providing service (including sale or transfer of product or
service) within the City or acquiring or using excess capacity through facilities in the City, all
reseller service providers much register with the City. Prior to providing service within the City,
transmitting communications through facilities in the City, or constructing in the rights-of-way
entities not required to obtain a franchise, license, or rights-of-way use agreement due to
superseding Federal or State law, shall nevertheless be required to register with the City.
Any person, who is not a ROW user prior to the effective date of the ordinance and who wishes to
become a ROW user, must first obtain a franchise, license, or rights-of-way use agreement, or
other authorization from the City.
A ROW user is authorized, subject to other applicable requirements, to sell or transfer use of
excess capacity to reseller service providers or other entities, provided that such entity either: (1)
has no right to and does not physically access the facilities while in the ROW, or (2) has a
separate franchise or ROW use agreement or other written agreement or consent authorizing the
same with the City. In the event of such sale or transfer to a reseller service provider, the ROW
user shall notify the City of the same prior to such action so that the City can review compliance
regarding doing business in the City. This notice shall not relieve the reseller service provider from
its own obligation to register, pay taxes, and obtain any necessary authorization from the City.
The ROW user shall be responsible for all costs incurred by the City due to the failure to provide
any information to the City required for registration.
Any reseller service provider that buys or leases excess capacity or other services for resale from
a ROW user, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Chapter, including the
requirement to first register with the City and obtain any necessary permit, license, certification,
grant, registration, franchise agreement or any other authorization required by any appropriate
governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, PSC or the FCC. If a person through
such lease or purchase owns facilities in the rights-of-way or has the right to physically access or
maintain any facilities in the rights-of-way, then such person no longer meets the definition of a
reseller service provider and is required to first obtain a franchise, license, or rights-of-way use
agreement as required herein.

A permittee shall perform all work in full accord with any and all applicable engineering codes
adopted or approved by the parties and in accordance with applicable Statutes of the State, and
the rules and regulations of the commission or any other local, State or Federal agency having
jurisdiction over the parties. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
codes and established rules and regulations and shall be responsible for all work in the rights-ofway
pursuant to its permit, regardless by whom the work is done by. Every permit issued shall be
deemed to incorporate the requirements and terms of this Chapter, and all applicable ordinances,
to the extent permitted by law
Except in cases of an emergency or with the approval of the Administrator, no rights-of-way work
may be done when conditions are unreasonable for such work.
A permittee shall not disrupt the right-of-way such that the natural free and clear passage of water
through the gutters or other waterways is interfered with. Private vehicles may not be parked
within or next to the permit area.
If work is being done for the ROW user by another person, subcontractor or otherwise, the person
doing the work and ROW user shall be liable and responsibility for all damages, obligations, and
warranties herein described, including ensuring that the excavation by said person is performed
consistent with its permit and applicable law (including that the contract shall be properly licensed
under the State of Missouri and local ordinances) and shall be responsibility for promptly
correcting acts by said person.
The permittee shall not at any one (1) time excavate or encumber more of the rights-of-way than
shall be reasonably necessary to enable the permittee to complete the project in the most
expeditious manner.
The permittee shall, in the performance of any work required for the installation, repair,
maintenance, relocation and/or removal of any of its facilities, limit all excavations to those that are
necessary for efficient operation.
The permittee shall not permit such an excavation to remain open longer than is necessary to
complete the repair or installation.
Non-emergency work on arterial and collector streets may not be performed between the hours of
7:00 A.M. to 8:30 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M., in order to minimize disruption of traffic flow.
The permittee shall perform work on the rights-of-way at such times that will allow the least
interference with the normal flow of traffic and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. At no time
shall traffic be restricted to less than two (2) lanes on arterial streets.
The ROW user excavating in the rights-of-way shall cause the excavation to be done with the
least possible injury to the pavement, sidewalk, curbing, parkway, or other surface and shall place
the materials from the excavation where they will cause the least possible inconvenience to the
public and permit the uninterrupted passage of water along the gutters.
Before new excavation or construction is commenced and until sodding, planting, concreting,
paving, or other final surfacing is in place, which will avoid washing or spreading of dirt and mud
onto other property, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streets, and the rights-of-way, the ROW user shall
erect and maintain approved temporary erosion control measures to prevent such washing or
spreading of materials. At the end of each day and as required throughout the day during the
course of excavating or construction, dirt and mud on the sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streets, and
the rights-of-way resulting from work must be removed.
Upon completion of the ROW work involving installation of new facilities, the ROW user shall
supply the City copies of as-built and detailed maps showing the exact location of facilities
installed in the ROW.

The Administrator may limit the number or size of conduits or other facilities that may be installed
by each ROW user based on the reasonable needs to ensure that no one (1) ROW user may
unreasonably consume a disproportionate amount of the available rights-of-way to deter
competition or deprive the public or others of the reasonable use of the rights-of-way.
The Administrator may impose other reasonable conditions regarding the timing, safety
precautions, space, or specific implementation of the specific work proposed.
Section 250.230. Joint Applications.
[R.O. 2011 §250.270; Ord. No. 2000-92 §2(4.5), 12-5-2000]

to the public ways.
Section 250.240. Supplementary Applications.
[R.O. 2011 §250.280; Ord. No. 2000-92 §2(4.6), 12-5-2000; Ord. No. 1578, 2-6-2018]
An excavation permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No
permittee may do any work outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein.
Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the permit must be
obstructed or excavated or installed within or is otherwise necessary must before working in the
greater area:
Make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required thereby; and
Be granted a new permit or permit extension.
An excavation permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No construction permittee
may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue working
after the end date. If a construction permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it
must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs and receive the new permit or an
extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. This
supplementary application must be done before the permit end date.
Section 250.250. Denial of Permit.
[R.O. 2011 §250.290; Ord. No. 2000-92 §2(4.7), 12-5-2000; Ord. No. 1578, 2-6-2018]
The Administrator has discretion to deny a permit to protect the public health, safety, and welfare,
to prevent interference with the safety and convenience or ordinary travel over the rights-of-way,
or when necessary to protect the rights-of-way and its users. In exercising this discretion, the
Administrator shall be guided by the safety and convenience of anticipated travel of the public over
the rights-of-way and the public benefits offered by the ROW user and may consider one (1) or
more of the following factors in denial of the permit:
The applicant fails to provide all necessary information requested by the City for managing
the public right-of-way;
The applicant has failed to return the right-of-way to its previous condition under a previous
permit;
The Administrator has provided the applicant with a reasonable, competitively neutral and
non-discriminatory justification for requiring an alternative method for performing the work

identified in the permit application or a reasonable alternative route that will result in neither
additional installation expense up to ten percent (10%) to the applicant nor a declination of
service quality;
The Administrator determines that denial is necessary to protect the public health and safety,
provided that such does not extend to those items under the jurisdiction of the Missouri Public
Service Commission, such denial shall not interfere with a public utility's right of eminent
domain of private property, and such denials shall only be imposed on a competitively neutral
and non-discriminatory basis;
The area is environmentally sensitive as defined by State Statute or Federal law or is historic
district as defined by City ordinance;
Such other lawful reasons.
Section 250.260. Work Done Without a Permit.

are not open, the Police Department of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an
emergency. The person may proceed to take whatever reasonable actions are necessary to
directly respond to the emergency. On the first (1st) business day after the occurrence of the
emergency, the person shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith
and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this Chapter
for the actions it took in response to the emergency. If the Administrator becomes aware of an
emergency regarding a person's facilities, the Administrator may attempt to contact the local
representative of each person affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the
Administrator may take but is not required to take whatever action it deems necessary to respond
to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the person whose facilities occasioned the
emergency or were involved in the emergency.
Non-Emergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having
obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates or installs within a public way must
subsequently and immediately obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said permit, deposit
with the Administrator the fees necessary to correct any damage to the public way and comply
with all of the requirements of this Chapter; provided however, taking such subsequent actions
shall in no way limit such person's liability for any failure to comply with this Chapter or restrict the
City's exercise of any and all additional remedies and actions available to the City for any failure to
comply with the requirements of this Chapter.
Minor Work Exception. The Administrator may, upon submission of a written detailed explanation
of the specific nature of the minor work to be performed, determine that a construction permit is
not required in connection with minor work. The Administrator will consider the following in making
such a determination:
No excavating of the street pavement will occur.
Not more than one (1) excavating of the public way will occur.
The work is being performed on facilities already in place in the public ways.
No conduit or other similar facilities are to be installed.
The work is performed in connection with service to existing customers.

right. The City reserves its rights, as provided herein, to revoke any rights-of-way permits, without
refund of the permit fee, in accordance with this Chapter or in the event of a substantial breach of
the terms and conditions of any law or the rights-of-way permit. A substantial breach shall include,

The failure to complete the work by the date specified in the permit, unless a permit extension
is obtained or unless the failure to complete the work is due to reasons beyond the
permittee's control;

applicable national safety codes, industry construction standards, or local safety codes that
are no more stringent than national safety codes, upon inspection and notification by the City
of the faulty condition;

If a rights-of-way permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the City for the City's
reasonable costs, including administrative costs, restoration costs, and the costs of collection and

All facilities of the ROW-user shall be placed so that they do not interfere with the use of rights-ofway
and public lands, either existing or proposed. The City, through its the Administrator, shall
have the right to consult and review the location, design, and nature of the facility prior to
installation. The City may, in its discretion, designate certain locations or facilities in the rights-ofway
to be excluded from use by the ROW user, including, but not limited to, ornamental or similar
specially-designed street lights or other facilities or locations which, in the reasonable judgment of
the Administrator, do not have electrical service adequate or appropriate for the provider's
facilities, or cannot safely bear the weight or wind loading thereof, or any other facility or location
that in the reasonable judgment of the Administrator is incompatible with the proposed facilities, or
would be rendered unsafe or unstable by the installation.
The ROW-user shall not interfere with the facilities of other ROW users without their permission. If
and when the City requires or negotiates to have a ROW user cease using its existing poles and
to relocate its facilities underground, all other ROW users using the same poles shall also relocate
their facilities underground at the same time. The cost of such relocations shall be borne in
accordance with this Chapter and the applicable tariff governing that ROW user.
All facilities and other appurtenances laid, constructed, and maintained by the permittee shall be
laid, constructed and maintained in accordance with acceptable engineering practice and in full
accord with any and all applicable engineering codes adopted or approved by the parties and in
accordance with applicable Statutes of the State, as well as the rules and regulations of the
commission or any other local, State, or Federal agency jurisdiction over the parties.
The ROW user shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures
necessary to provide accurate and complete on-site information regarding the nature and location
of its facilities within the rights-of-way, both underground and overhead, when requested by the
City or its authorized agent for a public improvement. Such location and identification shall be at
the sole expense of the ROW user without any expense to the City, its employees, agents or
authorized contractors.
It shall be the responsibility of the ROW user to take adequate measures to protect and defend its
facilities in the rights-of-way from harm and damage.
Limited Space. The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional
equipment within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests

of potential ROW users. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by
considerations of the public interest, public health and safety, the public's priority needs for the
particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of the year with respect to
essential utilities, the protection of existing equipment in the right-of-way, and future City plans for
public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public
interest. The design and location of all equipment and facilities shall be subject to the review and
approval of the City. To ensure that the right-of-way remains accessible for public uses, to mimize
visual obtrusiveness of equipment and facilities, and allow for adequate City maintenance of the
right-of-way, a new utility pole and any new ground-mounted equipment associated with the new
utility pole shall not be installed within one hundred fifty (150) feet of another utility pole or other
ground-mounted equipment on the same side of the right-of-way. Should a ROW user seek to
replace a utility pole, said replacement utility pole shall be sited within ten (10) feet of the currently
existing utility pole and shall not be subject to the spacing requirements set forth in this
Subsection. The spacing requirement set forth in this Subsection may be waived or altered by the
City upon the ROW user establishing good cause as to why said spacing requirement shall be
waived or altered.

Use Of Existing Facilities Required; Exceptions. All new facilities or structures shall collocate on
existing poles or within existing conduit, trenches or other facilities to minimize unnecessary use of
right-of-way space, reduce potential existing or future interference and obstructions and to reduce
the cost to the public or others therefrom, and to maximize the public's ability to use and license
appropriate private or public uses of the public rights-of-way in the public interest (except where
preempted by law or where good cause is established as determined by the City applying these
objectives.) Where existing poles or facilities are available, or exist at or near the proposed use,
unless otherwise approved, the applicant must either use such facilities or file a written request
verified by the applicant for exception specifying the specific reasons why such facilities are not
available or feasible to be used and addressing the objectives hereof.
ROW users may be required prior to any excavation or installation within the rights-of-way, to
provide sufficient notification and joint installation opportunities on a shared cost basis to potential
users of the rights-of-way as may be provided for by separate City policy. Such notifications and
adopted policies shall be designed to maximize collocation ROW users, to minimize the
disturbance of the rights-of-way and to maximize usable capacity.

The permittee shall employ a testing laboratory, as approved by the Administrator, which shall
verify the proper backfilling on any street cut. The permittee shall pay all costs associated with
such testing. This provision shall be waived when flowable fill is used as backfill or with the
permission of the Administrator.
If an excavation cannot be backfilled immediately and must be left unattended, the permittee
shall securely and adequately cover any street cuts, or protect any unfilled grassed area
excavation. The permittee has sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, safety
fencing and/or lights as required, from the time of the opening of the excavation until the

feet of the new street cut that has previously been excavated, including the paving and its
aggregate foundations.
All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, public improvement, or

replacement of the damage, and if necessary, to require the permittee to do the additional
necessary work. Notice of the unsatisfactory restoration and the deficiencies found will be
provided to the permittee and a reasonable time not to exceed ten (10) calendar days will be
provided to allow for the deficiencies to be corrected. Upon determination by the Administrator
that such repair or replacement is a public safety matter, all such repair or replacement shall
be corrected within twenty-four (24) hours' notice from the City, or the Administrator may
direct the City to make such repair or replacement and bill the ROW user for the City's costs.
Failure To Restore. If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner and to the
condition required by the Administrator, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration
the City may, at its option, serve written notice upon the permittee and its surety that, unless within
five (5) days after serving of such notice, a satisfactory arrangement can be made for the proper
restoration of the rights-of-way, the City shall immediately serve notice of failure to comply upon
the surety and the permittee, and the surety shall have the rights to take over and complete the
work; provided, however, that if the surety does not commence performance within ten (10) days
from the date of notice, the City may take over the work and prosecute same to completion, by
contract or otherwise at the expense of the permittee, and the permittee and its surety shall be
liable to the City for any and all excess cost assumed by the City by reason of such prosecution
and completion.
Guarantee Of Restoration.
In restoring the rights-of-way, the permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for four
(4) years following its completion. During the four (4) years the permittee shall, upon
notification from the Administrator, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using
any method as required by the Administrator. Said work shall be completed within a
reasonable time, not to exceed fifteen (15) calendar days, of the receipt of notice from the
Administrator. In the event the permittee is required to perform new restoration pursuant to
the foregoing guarantee, the Administrator shall have the authority to extend the guarantee
period for such new restoration for up to an additional four (4) years from the date of the new
restoration, if the Administrator determines any overt action by the permittee not to comply
with the conditions of the rights-of-way permit and any restoration requirements.

Article X. Small Wireless Facilities
Section 250.1000. Intent, Preemption, And Sunset.
[Ord. No. 1637, 12-18-2018]
Purpose. Consistent with the requirements of the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act,
Section 67.5110 et seq., RSMo., and in anticipation of a continued increased demand for the
placement of small wireless facilities of the type regulated by the Uniform Small Wireless Facility
Deployment Act and this Article, both within the public rights-of-way and in other locations within
the jurisdiction of the City, the Board of Aldermen of the City of Riverside, Missouri, has found it to
be in the best interests of the public health, safety, and general welfare of the City to adopt the
regulations set forth in this Article in order to establish generally applicable standards for the
permitting, location, construction, deployment, regulation, operation, maintenance, repair,
concealment and removal of small wireless facilities both within the public rights-of-way and in
other locations within the jurisdiction of the City.
Intent. Sections 250.1000 through 250.1005 of the Municipal Code of the City of Riverside,
Missouri, is intended to encourage and streamline the deployment of small wireless facilities, as
herein defined, to help ensure that robust and dependable wireless radio-based communication
services and networks are available throughout the City of Riverside while also protecting the
health, safety, and welfare of the public and the limited public resource that is the public right-ofway.
Specifically, the article is intended to:
Facilitate orderly construction and maintenance of facilities in the right-of-way, reduce the
damage to the facilities of rights-of-way users, and minimize disruption of service to the
citizens of the City;
Manage the right-of-way to allow efficient location of small wireless facilities and maximize
services to the citizens of the City;
Allow for the maximum utilization of the rights-of-way to meet the demands due to technical
innovations.
Encourage responsible construction and maintenance practices in the City rights-of-way.
Ensure that regulation of small wireless facilities does not have the effect of prohibiting the
provision of personal wireless services, and does not unreasonably discriminate among
functionally equivalent providers of such service;
Prevent interference with the facilities, maintenance, and operations of the City's utilities and
of other utilities lawfully located both within the public rights-of-way and in other locations
within the City; and

of competent jurisdiction to be unauthorized, such provision shall be automatically interpreted and
applied as required by law.
Sunset. This Article shall expire on January 1, 2021, except that for small wireless facilities
already permitted or co-located on authority poles prior to such date, the rate set forth in Section

Section 250.1002. General Requirements.
[Ord. No. 1637, 12-18-2018]
Height Restrictions.
Each new, replacement, or modified utility pole installed in the right-of-way shall not exceed
the greater of ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole in place as of August
28, 2018, located within five hundred (500) feet of the new pole in the same right-of-way or
fifty (50) feet above ground level at the site of the proposed installation, replacement, or
modification.
New small wireless facilities in the right-of-way shall not exceed more than ten (10) feet above
an existing utility pole in place as of August 28, 2018.
Any new, modified, or replacement utility pole that exceeds these height limits shall be subject
to a conditional use permit under the City's zoning regulations.
Concealment Requirements. The reasonable, objective, cost-effective standards outlined in this
Subsection seek to ensure that all small wireless facilities deployed in the City are deployed in a
manner that preserves the visual appearance of the surrounding area and the legal use of the
right-of-way. Any of the requirements set forth in this Subsection may be waived or altered by the
Director upon an applicant establishing good cause as to why the concealment requirements
should not apply.
Small Wireless Facility Antenna. All antennas mounted as part of the deployment of a small
wireless facility shall be mounted to the top of the utility pole or wireless support structure and
aligned with the center line of the utility pole or wireless support structure, unless otherwise
agreed to by the Director based on the specific context and characteristics of the utility pole or

No person shall stop or suddenly decrease the speed of or turn a vehicle from a direct course or
move right or left upon a roadway unless and until such movement can be made with reasonable
safety and then only after the giving of an appropriate signal in the manner provided herein.
An operator or driver when stopping, or when checking the speed of the operator's vehicle if
the movement of other vehicles may reasonably be affected by such checking of speed, shall
extend such operator's arm at an angle below horizontal so that the same may be seen in the
rear of the vehicle.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the right shall extend such operator's arm
at an angle above horizontal so that the same may be seen in front of and in the rear of the
vehicle and shall slow down and approach the intersecting highway as near as practicable to
the right side of the highway along which such operator is proceeding before turning.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the left shall extend such operator's arm
in a horizontal position so that the same may be seen in the rear of the vehicle and shall slow
down and approach the intersecting highway so that the left side of the vehicle shall be as
near as practicable to the centerline of the highway along which the operator is proceeding
before turning.
The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by a signal
light or signal device in good mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would
not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by
such light or device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand
and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds
twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to
the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen
(14) feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles. The provisions of this
Subsection shall not apply to any trailer which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand
signals of the operator or of the signaling device upon the vehicle pulling such trailer; provided
further, that the provisions of this Section as far as mechanical devices on vehicles so
constructed that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of such

shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus
resumes motion or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State Law:

crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from
the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right side of the
front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri school children
who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading
or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to
drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district has the
authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or
more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to
stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a
stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers
should proceed with caution and, in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the
school bus with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at
any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided
by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2)
lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the
road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred
(500) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder
and a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in
each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such
time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or
overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite
direction on a highway containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading
zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or controlled access highway at a point where
pedestrians are not permitted to cross the roadway.
Section 340.210. Right-of-Way at Intersection — Signs at
Intersections.
The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to a vehicle which
has entered the intersection from a different highway, provided however, there is no form of traffic
control at such intersection.
When two (2) vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on
the right. This Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from opposite
directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is attempting to or is making a left turn.
The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close
thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
The driver of a vehicle intending to make a left turn into an alley, private road or driveway shall
yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction when the making of
such left turn would create a traffic hazard.

time on any day.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section to the contrary, the maximum gross vehicle limit and
axle weight limit for any vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with an idle reduction
technology may be increased by a quantity necessary to compensate for the additional weight of
the idle reduction system as provided for in 23 U.S.C. Section 127, as amended. In no case shall
the additional weight increase allowed by this Subsection be greater than five hundred fifty (550)
pounds. Upon request by an appropriate Law Enforcement Officer, the vehicle operator shall

operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained
financial responsibility unless such person has financial responsibility which covers the person's
operation of the other's vehicle. However, no owner or non-resident shall be in violation of this

person in any one (1) accident and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the amount of fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of two (2) or more persons in
any one (1) accident and in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to
or destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.
Proof of financial responsibility may be shown by any of the following:
A current insurance identification card issued by a motor vehicle insurer or by the Director of
Revenue of the State of Missouri for self-insurance. A motor vehicle liability insurance policy,
a motor vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the name and address of
the insurer, the name and address of the named insured, the policy number, the effective

evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance. If
the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator for displaying invalid
evidence of insurance, the officer shall confiscate the evidence for presentation in court. Any person

(2) steps: preliminary development plan review and final development plan review. In many
cases, land will also need to be platted or replatted in order to carry out a development plan.
The platting process is a separate process, but may run concurrently with the development
plan review process.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
Preliminary development plan.
A preliminary development plan is a generalized land use plan for the entire area
proposed to be included within the development. The purpose of the preliminary
development plan is to allow early review of a proposed development before
substantial technical planning work has been undertaken.
During preliminary development plan review, the preliminary development plan
application is reviewed with respect to such issues as overall scale; density,
including the number, type and location of dwelling units and other uses; impacts on
surrounding areas; open space and environmental issues; and the adequacy of
facilities and services. The result of this review is the establishment of the basic
parameters for the development. Approval of the preliminary development plan shall
not constitute complete acceptance of the development, but shall be considered
acceptance of the overall general planning concepts for the development and
permission to prepare and submit a final development plan.
Final development plan. During the final development plan review, the applicant must
provide detailed plans for carrying out the type of project approved conceptually during
the preliminary development plan review. The applicant must submit the detailed and
technical information necessary to demonstrate that all applicable standards,
requirements and conditions have been met.
Minor development plan.
Post-application conference. After submitting a minor development plan application, the
applicant shall have a post-application conference as specified in Section 400.180(B),
Post-Application Conference. Prior to or as part of the post-application conference, the
applicant shall submit a sketch plan showing their ideas and intentions for the proposed
development. The sketch plan shall show all existing and proposed buildings, utilities,
public infrastructure and other features pertinent to the development.

The strict application of the subject provisions will constitute unnecessary hardship to the
applicant.
The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property
owners or residents.
The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals or
general welfare of the community.
The granting of the variance will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of the
ordinance from which the variance is sought and will not be in conflict with any existing
laws or ordinances.
Conditions for approval (flood hazard and levee critical area regulations). In addition to the
conditions for approval stated above, the applicant shall also address the following conditions,
if the requested variance pertains to the regulations established for the flood hazard and
levee critical area. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided
the following conditions have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the onehalf
(½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
The granting of the variance will not preclude a structure's continued designation as a
historic structure as listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory
of Historic Places or local inventory of historic places and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
The variance shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result.
The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
The granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Review criteria (flood hazard and levee critical area regulations). In reviewing variance
applications pertaining to the regulations established for the flood hazard and levee critical
area, the reviewing bodies shall consider the following review criteria:
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others.
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
The susceptibility of a proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner.
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable.
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the
proposed use.
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.
The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Master Plan and Floodplain
Management Program for that area.

The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles.
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site.
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems and streets and bridges.
Restrictions. In granting a variance, the Board may impose such restrictions, conditions and
safeguards upon the premises benefited by the variance as may be necessary to reduce or
minimize any potentially injurious effect of such variance upon other property in the
neighborhood and to carry out the general purpose and intent of these regulations. The Board
may set the effective date for the variance as subsequent to completion of such conditions,
safeguards and restrictions. The Board may require the variance to be recorded with the
County Recorder of Deeds to be effective.
Performance bond. The Board may require a performance bond to guarantee the installation
of improvements, such as parking lot surfaces, landscaping, etc. The amount of the bond
shall be based on a general estimate of cost for the improvements as determined and shall be
enforceable by or payable to the City in the sum equal to the cost of constructing the required
improvements.
Time limit. In lieu of the performance bond, the Board may specify a time limit for completion
of such required improvements and in the event the improvements are not completed within
the specified time, the Board may, at a regularly scheduled meeting and after notice to
applicant, revoke the variance.
Notification (flood hazard and levee critical area regulations). If a variance to the regulations
pertaining to the flood hazard and levee critical area is granted, the Director of Community
Development or their designees shall notify the applicant in writing that:
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage.
Such construction below the base flood level increases the risk to life and property.

The Planned Development District shall not be used to circumvent the requirements of the
applicable zoning district prior to rezoning to "PD". While a limited number of the requirements
of the existing zoning district may be modified, the proposed "PD" District as a whole shall
meet development standards no less stringent than the existing zoning district.
Permitted Uses/Classifications. Planned developments shall be classified based upon the types of
uses permitted within the development. There shall be four (4) types of planned developments:
Residential. Planned developments which consist of one (1) or more dwelling types.
Public/semi-public. Planned developments which consist of one (1) or more non-residential uses
of a religious, public or semi-public, cultural or recreational character.
Commercial or industrial. Planned developments which consist of one (1) or more commercial or
industrial uses.
Mixed use. Planned developments which consist of one (1) or more residential, public/semi-public
and/or commercial or industrial uses.
Zoning Property To A Planned District. A tract of land may be zoned to "PD" only upon approval of
a preliminary development plan. A preliminary development plan shall be submitted and reviewed
in accordance with the provisions outlined in Section 400.250 Development Plan Applications.
Building In A Planned District. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for any building in a
Planned District, a final development plan shall be submitted and approved in accordance with the
provisions outlined in Section 400.250 Development Plan Applications.
Development Standards. Development within a "PD" District shall be in accordance with the
following standards:
Comprehensive master plan. The proposed preliminary development plan must substantially
conform to the approved Comprehensive Master Plan for the City, including land use, density
of development, major street location, parks and open space land, storm water management,
sanitary sewer and water distribution.
Landscaping and screening. Planned developments shall provide for adequate landscaping
and effective screening for off-street parking areas and for areas where non-residential use or
high density residential use may be detrimental to lower density areas. Required yards shall
be maintained with grass, trees and shrubbery. The conceptual landscape plan submitted in
conjunction with preliminary plat approval shall depict the ability to meet the minimum
landscape requirements of the site plan review ordinance.
Open space. Thirty percent (30%) of the net land area must be devoted to open space. "Open
space" means land area of the site not covered by buildings, parking or maneuvering areas,
but includes canopied recreational and pedestrian areas and private yards, if any.
A planned development shall provide common areas reserved for recreational or scenic
purposes which shall be equal in area to the total amount of area by which each lot was
reduced below the minimum lot size required in the zoning district in which the
development is located.
Ownership and control of common areas and open space shall be by the homeowners'
association, condominium association or similar organization with authority to collect
funds from its members for improvement and maintenance of the common areas.
Design. The site design must respect and enhance the physical and natural qualities of the
site and retain the positive qualities of the existing environment. It should utilize existing
topographic features and improvements, where feasible, and shall be located to complement
and conform to the site topography, rather than change the site to accommodate a
preconceived site design.

Utilitarian areas. Areas which shall be visually de-emphasized in design of the site are
utilitarian areas such as loading docks, mechanical equipment, storage areas and trash
enclosures. These areas should be located away from high exposure areas of the building
and site, i.e., along street frontages or other highly visible portions of the site. When such
utilitarian areas are visible from adjacent property or public rights-of-way, screening shall be
provided.
Net density. The net density within a "PD" District shall be computed by dividing the total
number of proposed dwelling units within the development by the gross development
acreage, less dedicated public right-of-way.
Minimum size. A "PD" District shall contain a minimum of ten (10) contiguous acres of land,
except that the minimum size limitation may be waived through the approval process for sites
which are difficult to develop due to extreme topographic conditions, excessive floodplain
coverage or other environmental conditions, to provide for the preservation of said natural
features.
Fire access. All developments shall be designed as required by the fire codes to facilitate
entry of emergency vehicles onto the site without negotiating tight turns or requiring backing
of said vehicles. All fire protection systems must be in place and in compliance with all
adopted fire codes.
Minimum floor area. The minimum floor area, finished for living purposes, shall be determined
by the type of dwelling type proposed. The minimum floor area for each type of residential unit
within the "PD" District shall be:
Dwelling Type Minimum Floor Area
Detached single-family 900 square feet ground floor/1,500 square feet total
Patio home 800 square feet ground floor/1,200 square feet total
2 units attached 1,100 square feet
3 units attached 1,000 square feet
4 units attached 1,000 square feet average of all units/850 square feet
minimum
More than 4 units attached 1,000 square feet average of all units/750 square feet
minimum
Failure To Begin Development. If no substantial construction has begun or no use established in
the planned development within a twelve (12) month period from the date of approval of the final
development plan or been initiated in subsequent phases of the development within twelve (12)
months of the approved phasing schedules, the proposed development shall be republished for
public hearing and reconsideration of the approved "PD" zoning district and preliminary
development plan.
Change Of Ownership. Should property in a Planned Development District change ownership after
approval of the final development plan, the new owner shall be responsible for compliance with all
restrictions or conditions which are applicable to the approved development plan and will be
required either to complete the plan as approved or make formal application for a new
development plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 400.250 Development Plan
Applications.

and environmental resources, such as:
Floodplains and drainage ways.
Bodies of water.
Prominent ridges and rock ledges.
Existing tree cover including tree masses, windrows and significant individual trees.
Cut and fill. Excessive cut and fill are unacceptable. The site plan should preserve the natural
topography of the site.
Storm drainage facilities. Drainage facilities shall be so constructed as to protect those that
will reside in the multi-family development, as well as the property owners adjacent to the
multi-family development. Such facilities shall be of such capacity to ensure rapid drainage
and prevent the accumulation of stagnant pools of water in or adjacent to the development
and shall comply with all applicable City standards.
Building separation. All buildings shall be separated by a minimum distance of fifteen (15)
feet.
Lot coverage. Each site shall be designed to reflect unique site characteristics and strong
neighborhood environments without overcrowding the site.
Access. All multi-family residential developments must have direct vehicular access to
collector, arterial or higher classification streets.
Open space. Open space shall be provided to meet active and passive use requirements of
the neighborhood. At least ten percent (10%) of the total site area shall be set aside as
common open space. The common open space area shall be suitable for active or passive
recreational use. Common open space areas should be centrally placed within the
neighborhood. Common open space may include pools, tennis courts and tot lots. Common
open space may not be counted toward nor located in required zoning district setbacks.
Building clustering. Unusable and unassigned open space surrounding buildings should be
reduced by clustering buildings. Buildings should be clustered around a central common area
and not have the primary orientation directed toward the parking area.
Building orientation.
Individual buildings. Individual buildings should be oriented in a way that establishes
neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods.
Reduction of unusable open space. Unusable open space should be reduced through
building orientation, the use of low walls, fencing, landscaping and entry design.

Vehicular circulation and parking.
Street layout. The layout of the streets should provide for an interconnected street
network, which allows for the safe operation of vehicles within the development and
surrounding neighborhood. Excessively wide streets encourage high speed traffic and
should be avoided.
Parking area layout. Double-loaded parking areas along private streets or drives are
generally not acceptable. Parking areas should be clustered and separated from the
street.
Parking enclosures. Parking enclosures should be designed and sited so as to
complement the primary structures and to provide visual relief from extensive pavement
areas.
Pedestrian circulation.
Pedestrian safety. Pedestrian circulation systems (sidewalks, walkways and paths) shall
be located and designed to provide physical separation from vehicles along all public and
private streets and within any parking area.
Pedestrian access. Pedestrian access should be designed to provide reasonable
linkages of dwelling units to neighborhood facilities, such as recreation, services, mail
and parking.
Landscaping details. Pedestrian systems should incorporate landscaping details to
increase the visual interest and character of the neighborhood.
Landscaping. Landscaping should be designed in sufficient form, quantity and location to
reduce, to the greatest extent possible, negative impacts affecting the site and adjacent
properties and to increase the sense of neighborhood scale, character and identity. All
landscape and buffer areas must conform to the requirements of Section 400.530
Landscaping and Buffering.
Architectural design. The architecture of multi-family housing is a key element in determining
the character of a neighborhood. The architecture should create a strong feeling of identity
through design principles of scale, harmony, rhythm and balance.
Elongated sites with rectangular, double-loaded building footprints should be avoided.
These designs typically lack interest and fail to create a strong sense of neighborhood.
The architectural design of each unit or building should impart a feeling of neighborhood
scale. Units should be designed with vertical and horizontal offsets to break up roof lines,
define private outdoor areas, allow greater views and admit light and air to unit interiors.
Large, blank wall surfaces should be avoided. Windows and projecting wall surfaces
should be used to break up larger wall surfaces and establish visual interest.
The same level of architectural design and quality of materials should be applied to all
sides of the building. The side and rear elevations, garages, carports and all accessory
structures should maintain the same level of design, aesthetic quality and architectural
compatibility.
Screening from the street of all outdoor refuse areas, ground-mounted mechanical
equipment, utilities and banks of meters shall be provided. The screening of these items
is to be architecturally compatible with major building components and should include
landscaping.
Single-Family Attached. Single-family attached development shall be subject to the standards of
the underlying zoning district, as modified by the following standards.

[Ord. No. 1577, 2-6-2018]
Applicability.
District Height Limitations. The requirements set forth in this Article shall govern the
location of towers and antennas that are installed in all zoning districts. The height
limitations applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antennas.
Public Property And Rights-Of-Way. Antennas, towers, and associated equipment
located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the governing authority,
including rights-of-way, shall comply with the requirements of this Article, in addition to
the requirement that a license, lease, or agreement authorizing such antenna or tower
must have been approved by the governing authority.
Amateur Radio Receive-Only Antennas. This Article shall not govern any tower or the
installation of any antenna that is under seventy (70) feet in height and is owned and
operated by a Federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for
receive-only antennas.
Pre-Existing Towers And Antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been
properly issued prior to the effective date of this Article shall not be required to meet the
requirements of this Section. Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to as "preexisting
towers" or "pre-existing antennas."
Preemption. Notwithstanding any ordinance to the contrary, the procedures set forth in
this Article shall be applicable to all Wireless Communications Facilities existing or
installed, built, or modified after the effective date of this Article to the fullest extent
permitted by law. No provision of this Article shall apply to any circumstance in which
such application shall be unlawful under superseding Federal or State law and
furthermore, if any Section, Subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
Article is now or in the future superseded or preempted by State or Federal law or found
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unauthorized, such provision shall be
automatically interpreted and applied as required by law.
General Guidelines And Requirements.
Purpose — Goals. The purpose of this Article is to establish general guidelines for the
siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this Article are to:
Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas and minimize the total
number of towers throughout the community.
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in
areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal.
Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes
the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas.
Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such
services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently.
Principal Or Accessory Use. Towers may be either a principal or incidental use in all
commercial and industrial zoning districts, subject to any applicable requirement relating
to yard or setback. An incidental use subject to a leasehold interest of a person other
than the lot owner may be approved for a Tower only if the leasehold area separately
meets all requirements for a separate subdivided lot, including dedicated access,
parking, setbacks, and lot size, applicable to a primary use in the district in which the use
is proposed as if it was a separate subdivided lot. No other district shall allow Towers

unless required by law. All other wireless facilities other than Towers, may be a principal
or incidental use in all districts subject to the requirements herein.
Inventory Of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to
the Director of Community Development or their designees an inventory of its existing
towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within onequarter
(1/4) mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location,
height and design of each tower.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
Aesthetics — Lighting. The guidelines set forth in this Article shall govern the location of
all towers, and the installation of all antennas governed by the Article, provided, however,
that the Planning Commission may waive these requirements if it determines that the
goals of this Article are better served thereby or if the requirements are not technically
feasible as demonstrated by the applicant with substantial evidence.
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable
standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual
obtrusiveness.
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent
possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend
the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment. Metal equipment
buildings are prohibited.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and
supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is
identical to or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to
make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
Towers, antennae, and small wireless facilities shall not be artificially lighted, unless
required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the Director
of Community Development or their designees may review the available lighting
alternatives and approve the design.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
Federal Requirements. All towers must meet current standards and regulations of the
FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the Federal Government with the authority to
regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the
owners of the towers and antennas shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the
effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance
schedule is mandated by the controlling Federal agency. Failure to bring towers and
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute
grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
Building Codes — Safety Standards. All requirements of this Article of the Code shall
apply to the construction, modification and maintenance of each Tower and are
reincorporated herein as building code requirements to the extent permitted by law. To
ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is
maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and
the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries
Association, as amended from time to time. Any structural modification or alteration to an
existing tower or antenna will require a structural analysis by a licensed professional
engineer as part of the application for the same, unless waived by the Director of
Community Development. If, upon inspection, the inspector concludes that a tower fails
to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or
property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have

to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the City may remove
such tower at the owner's expense.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
Setbacks And Separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall
apply to all towers and antennas, provided however, that the City may reduce the
standard setbacks and separation requirements if the goals of this Section would be
better served thereby.
Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower plus twenty (20)
feet from any residential structure.
Towers, guys and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district
setback requirements.
Security Fencing. All towers and antennas shall be protected from unauthorized access
by appropriate security measures. A description of the proposed security measures shall
be provided as part of any application to install, build or modify towers or antennas.
Additional measures may be required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit
or administrative permit as deemed necessary by the Director of Community Developer
or their designees and the Board of Aldermen in the case of a special use permit.
Towers, antennas, and any appurtenances shall be safely maintained and fenced or
otherwise secured to prevent unauthorized access or climbing. Barbed, electrified, or
razor wire is prohibited.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding
towers, provided, however, that the City may waive such requirements if the goals of this
Section would be better served thereby.
Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively
screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential areas; standard
buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four (4) feet wide on the residential
side of the compound.
Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to
the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded
lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer.
Administrative Approvals.
General.
The Director of Community Development or their designees may administratively
approve the uses listed in this Section, provided that all such uses shall comply with
Section 400.440(G)(2), General Guidelines and Requirements, and all other
applicable ordinances.

Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional buildings or other
supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or antenna, in any "I"
Zoning District, provided, however, that such tower shall be set back from any
existing off-site residence a distance equal to the height of the tower plus twenty (20)
feet.
Installing an antenna on an existing structure, which does not already have an
existing antenna, (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower or other
freestanding non-residential structure), so long as such addition does not add more
than twenty (20) feet to the height of the existing structure. The term "existing
structure" as used in this Article and as it relates to the regulation of
telecommunications facilities in general shall mean any structure capable of
supporting antennas and small wireless facilities (other than a tower) in full
conformance with the design and other requirements of this Article and the city's
Uniform Development Ordinance and is: (1) exiting prior to the date of all applicable
permit applications seeking City authorization for installation of facilities thereon, and
(2) not built or installed in anticipation of such specific installation or erected as a
means to evade approvals applicable to a non-existing structure.
Installing an antenna on an existing tower of any height, including a pre-existing
tower and further including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting
equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as the addition of said
antenna adds no more than twenty (20) feet to the height of said existing tower.
Small wireless facilities may be approved in any district and location otherwise
permitted for wireless facilities under the following process and requirements.
A small wireless facility may be approved administratively by submission of an
application including showing specifications, dimensions, photos, or drawings of
completed installation, and property owner consent ("Owner Consent"). Owner
Consent shall minimally include: (1) written consent by all fee simple owners of
the underlying real estate (or where located in street right-of-way, the right-ofway
owner thereof), including when the proposed location is also in a utility
easement, and (2) written consent of the owner of the structure on which such
facility is to be placed. The applicant is responsible also to obtain and include
the written consent of any other real property interest owner that is required to
lawfully use that location for the proposed use. A fully complying small wireless
facility may be exempted from the general requirements of this Article relating to
parking/access, setback, and screening set forth in this Article unless
determined by the Director of Community Development as applicable to the
specific location. Provided the applications are complete and address the
requirements of this Article, the Director of Community Development shall
endeavor to expedite these approvals and may combine multiple
applications/locations at one (1) time in a single approval if they determine that
the applications are materially similar.
In addition to all other applicable requirements, when a small wireless facility is
located on a utility pole, street light, or similar structure over or directly adjacent
to public or private streets, sidewalks, or other pedestrian or vehicle ways: (1)
the height of all portions of the small wireless facility shall be located at least
eight (8) feet above ground level; (2) no ground equipment shall be permitted;
and (3) no portions of the small wireless facility shall extend horizontally from
the surface of the pole or structure more than sixteen (16) inches. Location,

placement, and orientation of the small wireless facility shall, to the extent
feasible, minimize the obstruction or visibility from the closest adjacent
properties unless otherwise required by the City for safety reasons.
The Director of Community Development may for good cause shown by the
applicant increase any one (1) or more of the maximum specifications qualifying
as a "Small Wireless Facility" stated in the applicable definition by up to fifty
percent (50%) if the carrier demonstrates that it: (1) does not in any location
nationally use equipment capable of meeting the specifications and the purpose
of the equipment, and (2) cannot feasibly meet the requirements. The Board of
Aldermen may further waive one (1) or more of the requirements to qualify for
small wireless facility approval upon good cause shown by the applicant
including as required by applicable law and provided a showing that the waiver
is the minimum necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Section. The
burden of proof for any waiver shall be wholly on the applicant and must be
shown by clear and convincing evidence. The Director of Community
Development may also, upon good cause shown, allow an existing structure to
be replaced with a structure of materially the same height and appearance
[including a width generally not greater than ten percent (10%) wider], if the
purposes of this Code are otherwise fully satisfied, including that the
replacement structure fits in with the built environment.

Editor’s Note: Former Subsection (C), Off-Street Parking Schedule B, was repealed by Ord. No.
1671, 7-16-2019. See now Subsection (D).
Off-Street Parking Schedule B. Any developer may propose an alternative parking schedule for
uses having widely varying parking demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a
single off-street parking standard. The developer shall submit a parking study that provides
justification for the number of off-street parking spaces proposed. The Director of Community
Development shall review this study and any other traffic engineering and planning data that are
relevant to the establishment of an appropriate off-street parking standard for the proposed use. A
parking study shall include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the
Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) and data collected for uses or combinations of uses that are the
same or comparable to the proposed use. Comparability shall be determined by density, scale,
bulk, area, type of activity and location. The study shall document the source of data used to
develop the recommendations. After reviewing the parking study, the Director shall establish a
minimum off-street parking standard for the proposed use.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
Computing Off-Street Parking And Loading Requirements.
Multiple uses. Lots containing more than one (1) use shall provide parking and loading in an
amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses.
Fractions. When measurements of the number of required spaces result in fractions, the
required parking spaces shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
Area. Unless otherwise noted in the provisions, all square footage-based parking and loading
standards shall be computed on the basis of gross floor area.
Employees, students and occupant-based standards. For the purpose of computing parking
requirements based on the number of employees, students, residents or occupants,
calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the
maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated capacity that is applicable and that results in
the greater number of spaces.
Unlisted uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in an
off-street parking schedule, the Director of Community Development or their designees shall
apply the off-street parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to
the use proposed in the application or require a parking study in accordance with Schedule B.

Driveway spacing.
Arterial streets. Direct access to an arterial street shall be permitted only when the
subject property has no other reasonable access to the street system and only if the
Planning and Zoning Commission, with the recommendation of the City Engineer,
determines that the proposed access point onto the arterial street can be accommodated
safely. When direct access to an arterial street is approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, with the recommendation of the City Engineer, pursuant to the
requirements of this Section, the following standards shall apply.
Spacing from signalized intersections. All driveways providing access to arterial
streets shall be constructed so that the point of tangency of the curb return radius
closest to a signalized or stop sign-controlled intersection is at least two hundred fifty
(250) feet from the perpendicular curb face of the intersecting street. In the event
that this standard cannot be met because of an unusually narrow or shallow lot size,
the Planning and Zoning Commission, with the recommendation of the City
Engineer, may reduce the spacing so long as the reduction does not result in an
unsafe traffic condition.
Spacing from other (non-signalized) access points. All driveways providing access to
arterial streets shall be constructed so that the point of tangency of the curb return
radius closest to all non-signalized street or driveway intersections is at least two
hundred (200) feet from the perpendicular curb face of the intersecting street or
driveway. In the event that this standard cannot be met because of an unusually

recommendation of the City Engineer, may reduce the spacing, provided the
reduction does not result in an unsafe traffic condition.
Waivers. Waivers for these access standards may be approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission with the recommendation of the City Engineer, if the City Engineer
determines that the requested waiver will not create a serious detriment to the safety or
operation of traffic on the street or roadway based on the intensity of the uses permitted
within the zoning district. The Planning and Zoning Commission, with the
recommendation of the City Engineer, may require that the applicant for a waiver submit
a traffic analysis if it is determined that such an analysis is necessary in order to render a
competent decision on the requested waiver.
Driveways per parcel.
Unless otherwise specifically restricted, one (1) driveway opening shall be allowed per
two hundred (200) feet of continuous street frontage. At least one (1) driveway shall be
permitted for any lot.
Parcels with two hundred (200) feet of frontage or less may apply for a secondary
driveway if shared with an adjoining parcel, provided that the required minimum spacing
is maintained. In such cases, only one (1) shared driveway will be permitted.
Driveway width.
One-way drives. The width of the driveway shall not exceed fourteen (14) feet.
Two-way drives. The width of the driveway shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet.
Right-of-way work permit. No construction, grading, excavation, repair or reconstruction of

Standards.
[R.O. 2011 §400.520; Ord. No. 2006-170 §1, 12-19-2006]
The regulations of Article IV Zoning Districts establish many property development standards that
apply within individual zoning districts. The rules governing exemptions, computations and
measurements related to zoning district property development standards are established in this
Section.
Lot size.
Reduction of public purpose. When an existing lot is reduced because of conveyance to
a Federal, State or local government for a public purpose and the remaining area is at

least seventy-five percent (75%) of the required minimum lot size for the district that it is
located, then that remaining lot shall be deemed to comply with the minimum lot size
standards of this Chapter.
Utilities. Utilities (major or minor) using land or an unoccupied building requiring less than
one thousand (1,000) square feet of site area are exempt from the minimum lot size
standards of all zoning districts.
Single-family dwelling exemptions. The minimum lot size standards of this Chapter shall
not be interpreted as prohibiting the construction of a single-family dwelling unit, in
accordance with all other applicable regulations, on a lot that was legally platted or
recorded before the adoption of this Chapter.
Residential densities. The zoning district regulations of this Chapter express maximum
residential densities in terms of lot area requirements per dwelling unit. The maximum number
of dwelling units allowed on a lot shall be determined by dividing the subject lot's total lot area
by the applicable lot area (per dwelling unit) requirement of the district. The number of
dwelling units permitted in a mixed-use building (one containing residential and nonresidential
uses) shall not be affected by virtue of the building's mixed-use status. As with
non-mixed-use projects, the maximum number of dwelling units allowed shall be calculated by
dividing the subject lot's total lot area by the applicable lot area requirement of the district.
Setbacks.
Features allowed within setbacks. The following features may be located within any
setback:
Trees, shrubbery, gardens or other landscape features.
Fences and walls, subject to Section 400.560 Fences.
Gates and guard houses.
Non-enclosed off-street parking and loading areas (driveways) and sidewalks.
Signs, subject to Article VIII Signs.
Steps to the principal entrance, walks and balustrades.
Bay windows, architectural features, cantilevered floors, chimneys and other
ornamental features of buildings that do not project more than two (2) feet into the
required setbacks.
Fire escapes that do not extend into a setback by more than thirty percent (30%) of
the required setback dimension.
Utility lines, wires and associated structures, such as power poles.
Side or rear setback exemptions in the "I" District. No side or rear setback shall be
required in the "I" District on any lot that adjoins a railway right-of-way or that has a rear
railway track connection, provided that sufficient access for fire-fighting equipment is
available. Such access shall be approved by the Fire Chief before issuance of any
permit.
Setback averaging. If the existing front setbacks of lots within the same block, with the
same zoning classification and fronting on the same side of the street, are less than the
required front setback of the underlying zoning district, applicants shall be allowed to use
the "average" front setback of the underlying zoning district, applicant shall be allowed to
use the "average" front setback on that block. In such cases, the "average setback" shall

be the mean (average) setback of all lots on the same side of the street within the same
block as the subject property. In no event shall lots with different zoning classifications or
undeveloped lots be included in the calculation. This provision shall not be interpreted as
requiring a greater front setback than imposed by the underlying zoning district and it
shall not be interpreted as allowing setbacks to be reduced to a level that results in rightof-
way widths dropping below established minimums.
Setback reduced for public purpose. When an existing setback is reduced because of
conveyance to a Federal, State or local government for a public purpose and the
remaining setback is at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the required minimum
setback for the district that it is located, then that remaining setback shall be deemed to
satisfy the minimum setback standards of this Chapter.
Height.
Fences or walls. In the case of fences or walls, height shall be measured on the side with
the least vertical exposure above finished grade to the top of the fence or wall.
Exemptions from height standards. The following structures and features shall be exempt
from the height requirements of this Chapter:
Chimneys, smokestacks or flues.
Cooling towers and ventilators.
Elevators bulkheads and stairway enclosures.
Grain elevators and silos.
Flagpoles, radio and television receiving antennas and support structures, provided
that they shall not exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the maximum height
permitted within the zoning district that they are located, measured from average
finished grade at the base of the support structure or building that it is located.
Communication towers.
Utility poles, water towers and support structures.
Belfries, spires and steeples.
Monuments and ornamental towers.
Section 400.530. Landscaping and Buffering.

Purpose And Intent. The purpose of this Section is to establish minimum standards for the
preservation, installation and continued maintenance of trees, landscaping and buffering. The
regulations are intended to preserve and protect existing vegetation and trees, to promote water
conservation, to enhance the value and appearance of properties by more effectively buffering
incompatible land uses, to reduce air and noise pollution; to maintain and improve environmental
conditions, to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, and to improve the aesthetic appearance
of all development.
Applicability And Exemptions. The standards of this Section shall apply to all new development
and expansions and modifications to existing development except:
Agriculture uses and developments.

Single-family homes.
Improvements or repairs to existing development that do not result in an increase in floor
area.
Considerations For Alternative Designs. It is recognized that development constraints and site
conditions can differ greatly from one location to another. Accordingly, the Director of Community
Development may approve landscape plans that vary from strict compliance with the provisions of
this Section if it is determined that the submitted plan conforms to the purpose and intent of this
Section.
General Requirements. All open areas on any building site not occupied by buildings, parking,
access roads and loading shall be suitably graded with a slope not to exceed 3:1 to allow for
mowing and drainage and shall be maintained in lawn, trees, shrubs or other appropriate ground
covers.
Pervious/Green Space Landscaping. Building sites shall include a minimum of one (1) shade tree
(two and one-half (2 1/2) inch caliper) or evergreen tree (eight (8) feet in height) for each two
thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of pervious/green space area. Substitutions are allowed
for pervious area calculations only based upon the following:
One (1) shade tree (two and one-half (2 1/2) inch caliper) or evergreen tree (eight (8) feet in
height) = twenty (20) shrubs three (3) feet in height or two (2) ornamental trees six (6) feet in
height.
Street Trees. Along the property's frontage with any public or private street shall be planted one
(1) shade tree (two and one-half (2 1/2) inch caliper) or evergreen tree (eight (8) feet in height) for
every forty (40) feet of street frontage. Street trees should be planted on private property, not in
the street right-of-way.
Common Area — Side And Rear Boundaries. If the property's side or rear boundary abuts a
common area such as lakes and canals, one (1) shade tree (two and one-half (2 1/2) inch caliper)
or evergreen tree (eight (8) feet in height) shall be planted for every fifty (50) feet of common area
frontage. Substitutions are allowed for common area calculations only based upon the following:
One (1) shade tree (two and one-half (2 1/2) inch caliper) or evergreen tree (eight (8) feet in
height) = twenty (20) shrubs three (3) feet in height or two (2) ornamental trees six (6) feet in
height.
Parking Lot Landscaping: These standards shall apply to the interior of all off-street parking areas
containing more than ten (10) off-street parking spaces. These standards shall not apply to
vehicle/equipment storage lots, vehicle and equipment sales lots or multilevel parking structures.
Landscape islands should be added at the ends of all parking rows and should be bermed
and planted with either sod or landscaping. Landscape islands may be designed and planted
to serve as a dual-purpose landscape area and stormwater treatment facility.

Building Foundation. Forty percent (40%) of the building foundation should be landscaped with
ground covers, shrubs and ornamental trees. Emphasis shall be placed on those building sides
that face a public street or right-of-way.
Land Use Buffers. Buffers and screening such as berms, decorative walls or fences, or rows of
trees or shrubs, shall be utilized to ensure development occurs in a manner that is sensitive to the
surrounding environment. Where any higher-intensity use abuts a less-intense development,
buffers and/or screening shall be provided with sufficient plant material and/or open space to
reduce the impact of a high-intensity use on an adjacent lower-intensity use. Buffers and/or
screening shall be especially important where any commercial, industrial or multifamily
development abuts a single- or two-family residential development or zoning district.
Screening Of Utilitarian Areas. Utilitarian site features, such as dumpsters, mechanical equipment,
permitted outdoor storage and service and loading areas, shall be located to minimize their
appearance from public streets and rights-of-way. Such features shall also be effectively screened
from the view of roadways and adjacent sites by berms, decorative walls or fences, and/or plant
material.
Dumpsters located in "R-2" and more-intensive districts shall be completely screened from
view on all sides by a fence or wall with a minimum height of six (6) feet or one (1) foot taller
than the dumpster, whichever is greater. The fence or wall shall provide complete visual
screening of the dumpster and be compatible in material and color with the principal structure
on the lot. If the dumpster is located such that it is visible from a public street, landscaping is
encouraged around the enclosure to improve aesthetics.
Rooftop equipment shall be properly screened from public view by architectural treatments
that are compatible to the design and overall appearance of the building.
Landscape Material Standards. The following standards shall be considered the minimum required
planting standards for all trees and landscape material:
Plant Quality. Plants installed to satisfy the requirements of this Section shall conform to or
exceed the plant quality standards of the most recent edition of American Standard for
Nursery Stock published by the American Association of Nurserymen. Plants shall be nursery
quality and indigenous or adapted to the local area. All plants shall be alive and in good
health.
Artificial Plants. No artificial plants or vegetation shall be used to meet any standards of this
Section.
Species Mix. When six (6) or more trees are required to be planted to meet the standards of
this Section, a mix of species shall be provided to promote diversity.
Use Of Existing Plant Material. Vegetation, trees and plant material that exists on a site prior to its
development may be used to satisfy the landscaping standards of this Section, provided that it
meets the size, variety and locational requirements of this Section. However, no credits shall be
permitted for the following types of trees:
Trees that are not properly protected from damage during the construction process.
Trees that are dead, dying, diseased or infested with harmful insects.
Installation, Maintenance And Replacement.

Purpose. The purpose of this Article is to:
Protect and provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of the City.

Ensure regulations are in place to allow for the orderly division of land and to establish
reasonable standards of design for subdivisions.
Ensure adequate and efficient public facilities, including transportation networks, water
services, sewer services, drainage, schools, parks, recreation facilities and other public
facilities, are provided.
Protect and conserve the value of land throughout the City and the value of buildings and
improvements upon the land and to minimize the conflicts among the uses of land and
buildings.
Preserve the natural beauty and topography of the City and to ensure appropriate
development with regard to these natural features.
Policy.
It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City to consider the subdivision of land and the
subsequent development of the subdivided plat as subject to the control of the City pursuant
to the Comprehensive Master Plan for the orderly, planned, efficient, physical and economical
development of the City. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used
safely for development purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or other
menace and land shall not be subdivided until available public facilities and improvements
exist and proper provision has been made for drainage, water, sewage disposal and capital
improvements, such as schools, parks, recreation facilities, transportation facilities and
improvements.
The subdivision of land is a privilege conferred upon the developer by the laws of the State of
Missouri and through these regulations. It is the developer who is seeking to acquire the
advantages of lot subdivision and upon them rests the duty of compliance with this Chapter,
the Comprehensive Master Plan, capital budget and program of the City and any reasonable
conditions laid down by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Aldermen so
as to promote the safety and general welfare of the future plot owners in the subdivision and
the community at large.
No land shall be subdivided within the incorporated area of the City until the subdivider or
their agent has submitted the appropriate plats to the Board of Aldermen for their review and
approval and until the approved plat is filed with the County Recorder of Deeds. No building
permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any parcel or plot of land which was
created by subdivision after the effective date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of
this Article and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private improvements
shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with these regulations.
Saving Provision. The regulations of this Article shall not be construed as abating any action now
pending under or by virtue of prior existing subdivision regulations or as discontinuing, abating,
modifying or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue or as affecting the liability of any
person, firm or corporation or as waiving any right of the City under any Section or provision
existing at the time of adoption of this Chapter or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by
any person, firm or corporation by lawful action of the City, except as shall be expressly provided
for in this Article.

subdivision, provided all lots have frontage on an existing street and do not require any new
streets or the extension of City facilities or the creation of any public improvements.
A division of land into no more than three (3) lots.
An adjustment in boundaries between adjoining platted lots.
An adjustment of building lines.
A resurvey to combine two (2) or more lots or portion of lots into one (1) lot.
Major subdivision. A plat including four (4) or more lots or that requires new streets, the
extension of City facilities or the creation of any public improvements shall be considered a
major subdivision.
Reclassification of minor subdivision. The development of successive minor subdivisions by
the same owner or developer or by a person in privity with the owner or developer, so as to
circumvent the requirements of these regulations with respect to major subdivisions shall be
prevented. Whenever a minor subdivision is developed from the same general tract of land as
a previously developed minor subdivision or where successive minor subdivisions are
developed so as to constitute a major subdivision within the meaning of these regulations, the
entire development shall be treated as a major subdivision.
Variances To Public Improvements.
General. In cases in which there is an unwarranted hardship in carrying out the literal
provisions of Article X Infrastructure Improvements the subdivider may request a variance
from the regulations. Such a request shall be to vary from the design criteria of Article X
Infrastructure Improvements only; all other variance requests shall follow the procedure
established in Section 400.280 Variance Applications.
Submittal. At the time when a preliminary plat is submitted, the subdivider may submit a
petition for a variance from the regulations of Article X Infrastructure Improvements. The
petition shall fully state the grounds for the application and address the review criteria outlined
below.
Review and recommendation. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the petition
for a variance in conjunction with the preliminary plat and make a recommendation to the
Board of Aldermen.
Review and action. The Board of Aldermen shall review the petition for a variance in
conjunction with the preliminary plat and take action to approve, approve with conditions or
deny the petition.
Review criteria. In reviewing all petitions for a variance, the reviewing bodies shall consider
the following review criteria:
The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific
property involved cause an extraordinary hardship to the owner, as distinguished from a
mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations of Article X Infrastructure
Improvements are carried out.
The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to the property
for which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to other property.
The granting of the variance will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
this Chapter and the Comprehensive Master Plan.

Block Design. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be appropriate for the locality and
the type of development planned and shall be in accordance with the following regulations:
Connectivity. Intersection streets shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic
adequately and to meet existing streets in the neighborhood.
Width. In residential subdivisions, blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers
of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions may be permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets,
railroads or waterways. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall have such width
as may be considered most suitable for the prospective use.
Length. In residential subdivisions, blocks shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) feet nor be
less than four hundred (400) feet in length; except that these requirements may be altered to
accommodate necessary changes in topography or other conditions justifying a departure
from the standards. Whenever practicable, blocks along major arterials and collector streets
shall not be less than one thousand (1,000) feet in length. Blocks in plats of business or
industrial land uses may vary in length to most appropriately accommodate the prospective
use.
Easements. In long blocks, the reviewing bodies may require the reservation of an easement
through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities and pedestrian traffic.
Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than twenty (20) feet wide, may be required by the
reviewing bodies through the center of blocks more than eight hundred (800) feet long where
deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, recreational facilities, shopping
centers, transportation or other community facilities.
Lot Design And Improvements.
Lot arrangement. The arrangement of lots shall be suited for the planned use of the land,
zoning requirements and need for convenient access, control and safety of street traffic and
the limitations and opportunities of the terrain.
Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the zoning
district. Corner lots for residential use shall be at least twenty-five percent (25%) larger than
the minimum lot size for the district it is located in order to permit appropriate building setback
from and orientation to both streets. Residential lots fronting or backing on major streets shall
be platted with extra depth to permit increased distances between the buildings and street.
Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial or industrial
purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required
for the type of use and development planned.
Double frontage and reversed frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall
be avoided, except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from
through traffic or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
Flag lots. Flag lots shall be prohibited.
Access to lots. In residential subdivisions, lots shall not, in general, derive access from a
major or secondary street. Where driveway access from a major or secondary street may be
necessary for several adjoining lots, the reviewing bodies may require that such lots be
served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazards on such street.
Where possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring
vehicles to back onto major or secondary streets.
Flood Hazard Areas. Subdivisions proposed within flood hazards areas shall assure that:
The proposal is consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.

Section 400.770. Additional Requirements.
[R.O. 2011 §400.770; Ord. No. 2006-170 §1, 12-19-2006]
Self-Imposed Restrictions. If the owner places restrictions on any of the land contained in the
subdivision greater than those required by this Chapter, such restrictions or reference thereto may
be required to be indicated on the plat or the Board of Aldermen may require that restrictive
covenants be recorded with the County Recorder of Deeds in a form to be approved by the City
Attorney. Such indication or recording of these greater restrictions shall in no way impart any
liability to the City or its officials for any purposes.
Railroads And Limited Access Highways. If railroad right-of-way or limited access highways are so
located as to affect a residential subdivision, a buffer strip at least twenty-five (25) feet in depth, in
addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district, shall be provided adjacent to the
railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall
be designated on the plat "This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon
is prohibited".
Plats Straddling Municipal Boundaries. In general, lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross
municipal boundary lines. However, whenever access to the subdivision is required across land
within another municipality, the Board of Aldermen may request an opinion from the City Attorney
that access is legally established and also from the Director of Community Development or their
designees to assure that the access road is adequately improved or that a performance bond has
been duly executed and is sufficient to assure construction of the access road.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
Character Of The Land. Land which the Planning and Zoning Commission or Board of Aldermen
find to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep
slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements or other
features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of inhabitants
of the land and surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods
are formulated by the developer and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and
Board of Aldermen, upon recommendation of the Director of Community Development, to solve
the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for such uses
as shall not involve such a danger.

[R.O. 2011 §400.780; Ord. No. 2006-170 §1, 12-19-2006]
General.
If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for commercial or industrial purposes,
the layout of the subdivision with respect to such land shall make such provisions as the
Planning and Zoning Commission may require.
A non-residential subdivision shall also be subject to all the requirements of these regulations,
as well as such additional standards required by the Planning and Zoning Commission and
shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in the Comprehensive
Master Plan.

Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these regulations which are appropriate
to the planning of all subdivisions, the developer shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Planning and Zoning Commission that the street, parcel and block pattern is specifically adapted
to the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles
and standards shall be observed:
Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to the types of industrial
development anticipated.
Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the type and volume of
traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to street, curb, gutter and
sidewalk design and construction.
Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to the installation of public
utilities, including water, sewer and storm water drainage and parking.
Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from potential nuisance from
the proposed non-residential subdivision, including the provision of extra depth in parcels
backing up on existing or potential residential development and provisions for a permanently
landscaped buffer strip when necessary.
Streets carrying non-residential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended
to the boundaries of adjacent existing or potential residential areas.
Section 400.790. Assurance for Completion of Public
Improvements.
[R.O. 2011 §400.790; Ord. No. 2006-170 §1, 12-19-2006]
Improvements And Performance Bond.
Completion of improvements. Before the plat is signed, all subdividers may be required to
complete, to the satisfaction of the City, all the street, sanitary, water, storm water and other
improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in these regulations,
specified in the final plat and as approved by the Board of Aldermen and to dedicate same to
the City free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public
improvements thus dedicated.
Performance bond.
The City shall require either that the applicant complete and dedicate all public
improvements prior to the signing of the plat or, that as an alternative, the applicant post
a bond at the time of submitting an application for a final plat in an amount estimated by
the City as sufficient to secure to the City the satisfactory construction, installation and
dedication of the incomplete portion of required improvements. Once established, the
bond amount may not be reduced.
Such performance bond shall comply with the requirements of Section 89.410, RSMo.,
as amended, and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form, sufficiency and
manner of execution as set forth in these regulations. The period within which required
improvements must be completed shall be specified by the Board of Aldermen in the
ordinance approving the final plat and shall be incorporated in the bond and shall not in
any event exceed two (2) years from the date the final plat is approved.

Such bond shall be approved by the Board of Aldermen as to amount and with surety
and conditions satisfactory to the Board of Aldermen. The Board of Aldermen may, upon
proof of difficulty, grant an extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a
maximum period of one (1) additional year. The Board of Aldermen may at any time
during the period of such bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond,
but the original amount of the bond may not be reduced.
Temporary improvement. The developer shall build and pay for all costs of temporary
improvements required by the City and shall maintain same for the period specified by the
City. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, the developer shall file
with the City a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities. The bond shall ensure that the
temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed.
Costs of improvement. All required improvements shall be made by the developer, at their
expense, without reimbursement by the City or any improvement district therein.
Governmental units. Governmental units to which these bonds and contract provisions apply
may file, in lieu of said contract or bond, a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or
agencies authorized to act in their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this
Chapter.
Failure to complete improvements. In those cases where a performance bond has been
posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms of such
performance bond, the Board of Aldermen may thereupon declare said bond to be in default
and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building
development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
Acceptance of dedication offers — maintenance bond. Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, easements, parks and improvements shall rest with the Board of
Aldermen. No such dedication of streets, easements, parks or improvements shall be
accepted by the City unless the dedicator or the contractor who shall have constructed said
street, easement, park or improvement shall furnish and maintain a bond for a period of two
(2) years which is deemed by the City to be reasonably sufficient to secure the City against
defects in workmanship and materials related to the dedicated work and to ensure that such
dedicator or contractor will remedy any such defects occurring within such period.
Inspection Of Improvements.
General procedure and fees. The City shall provide for inspection of required improvements
during construction and ensure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay an
inspection fee as established by the City. The inspection fee shall be paid at the time of
application. The final plat shall not be signed unless the inspection fee has been paid. If the
Director of Community Development or their designees finds, upon inspection, that any of the
required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the City's construction
standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for completing said
improvements. Wherever the cost of improvements is covered by a performance bond, the
applicant and the bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing said
improvements according to specifications.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
Release or reduction of performance bond.
Certificate of satisfactory completion. The Board of Aldermen will not accept dedication of
required improvements, nor release nor reduce a performance bond, until the Director of

dedication of public improvements, but only to the ratio that the public improvements
dedicated bear to the total public improvements for the plat. In no event shall a
performance bond be reduced below twenty-five percent (25%) of the principal amount.
Escrow Deposits For Lot Improvements. Whenever any lot improvements required by this Chapter
cannot be completed due to the season of the year, the Director of Community Development or
their designees may issue an occupancy permit, provided there is no danger to health, safety or
general welfare and a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the Director for the

occupancy permit. In the event that the improvements have not been properly completed at the
end of the time period, the Director of Community Development or their designees shall give two
(2) weeks' written notice to the developer requiring them to complete the improvements. If the

Development or their designees, the Board of Aldermen may authorize the City to proceed to
contract out the work for the completion of the necessary improvements in a sum not to exceed
the amount of the escrow deposit. Prior to obtaining the occupancy permit for which the escrow
monies are being deposited, the developer shall obtain and file with the City a notarized statement
from the purchaser of the premises authorizing the City to complete the improvements at the end
of the nine (9) month period in the event that the improvements have not been duly installed by
the developer.

conditions, the provision of any or all such improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite
in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare or which are inappropriate
because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Board of Aldermen to defer the construction of any
improvement required herein because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate
lack of connecting facilities or for other reasons, the developer shall pay his/her share of the
costs of the future improvements to the City prior to signing of the final plat or the developer
may post a bond ensuring completion of said improvements upon demand of the City.

[R.O. 2011 §400.810; Ord. No. 2006-170 §1, 12-19-2006]
Vacation Of Undeveloped Subdivision. When no lots on a plat of a subdivision have been sold, the
subdivider may request the vacation of the plat or any part of any plat prior to the time that the
improvements covered by the bond are installed and when such plat is vacated, all fiscal sureties
shall be returned to the subdivider. Such request shall be made by a written instrument, to which a
copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same to be vacated. Such an instrument shall be
approved by the Board of Aldermen in like manner as a final plat. The Board of Aldermen may
reject any such instrument which abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its public uses,
improvements, streets or alleys. Such instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved
and recorded or filed in like manner as final plats and being duly recorded or filed shall operate to
destroy the force and effect of the recording of the plats so vacated and to divest all public rights in
the streets, alleys and public grounds and all dedications laid out or described in such plat.
Vacation Of Partially Developed Subdivision. When lots have been sold, the subdivider may
request the vacation of the undeveloped portion of the plat or a segment of the undeveloped
portion of the plat. Such request shall be made by a written instrument, to which a copy of the plat

Streets — General Requirements.
Grading and improvement plan. Streets, including right-of-way, shall be graded and improved
and conform to the City of Riverside construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the Director of Community Development or their
designees in accordance with the required construction plans.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
Topography and arrangement.
All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed street network.
Except for courts and cul-de-sacs, streets shall generally connect with streets already
dedicated in adjoining or adjacent developments or provide for future connections to
adjoining lands or shall be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest development.
The arrangement of major streets in the development shall comply with KCAPWA
standards and the Comprehensive Master Plan. Streets shall be properly related to
population densities, existing and proposed land use patterns and special traffic
generators, such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and shopping
centers.
Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. A combination of steep grades
and curves shall be avoided. All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many
building sites as possible at or above the grades of the streets.
Local streets shall be planned in order to conform as much as possible to the topography,
to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems and to
require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access
to property.
In commercial and industrial developments, the streets and other accessways shall be
planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities and the
provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas and walks and parking areas so
as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including
pedestrian.
Level of service. The developer shall make provisions so that arterial and collector streets
impacted by a development maintain a level of service C or better, when the development is
at full occupancy. The developer may be required to submit a traffic impact analysis (TIA) if
the proposed development is anticipated to have a material impact on the transportation
network within the City. If a TIA shows that a proposed development creates the need for
additional off-site right-of-way or other improvements, the developer may be required to
provide right-of-way or improvements proportional to the demand created prior to
development approval.
Classification. All streets shall be classified as an arterial, collector, residential collector or
local street. Street classification shall be based on the Comprehensive Master Plan and the
projected traffic demands.
Access. There shall be an adequate number of points of ingress to and egress from the
development to ensure sound traffic engineering design, smooth traffic flow into and out of all
portions of the development and the public's safety. In determining whether the development
provides for an adequate number of points of ingress and egress, all relevant factors shall be
considered including, but not limited to, the following:
Residential development. Generally, one (1) point of ingress to and egress from the
development should be required for each one hundred (100) dwelling units in the

development. Each required point of ingress to and egress from the development shall
be located so as to best serve the traffic generated by the development.
Non-residential development. The adequacy of the number of points of ingress to and
egress from non-residential developments shall be determined based on the proposed
uses and proposed site layout.
General factors.
Traffic accumulation. The level of traffic using each point of ingress to and egress
from the development should not exceed the level of traffic that the street is
designed to accommodate.
Access for emergency vehicles. The points of ingress to and egress from the
development should be adequate to ensure that emergency vehicles can gain
access to all proposed uses within the development, whenever necessary.
Intersection with streets abutting the development. The impact of injecting traffic
from the proposed development into the existing street network shall be mitigated by
location, design and control measures consistent with the standards of traffic
engineering.
Street names. To ensure the naming of streets shall be consistent with the City addressing
grid system, the street names shall appear on the plat. Proposed street names shall be
sufficiently different in sound and spelling from other street names in the City so as not to
cause confusion. Streets that are in alignment with already existing and named streets shall
bear the names of the existing streets.
Street signs. The developer shall pay to the City the cost of purchasing and installing street
signs at all intersections within or abutting the development. The term "street sign", as used
herein, shall include all traffic control signs, street name signs and any other street signage
that is to be owned and maintained by the City after installation. All street signs associated
with the development shall be installed before any certificates of occupancy shall be issued
for the development.
Street lights. The developer shall be responsible for the purchase and installation of street
lights within the development. Street lights shall be installed in accordance with KCAPWA
design and specification standards. A street lighting plan shall be submitted to the City for
review and approval prior to the installation of any street lights.
Culs-de-sac/temporary dead-ends.
Culs-de-sac may be permitted where topography or other conditions justify their use and
provisions are made for adequate traffic circulation. Culs-de-sac should not be longer
than eight hundred (800) feet measured from the center line of the cul-de-sac to the
center line of the connecting street. Exceptions may be made where topography or other
conditions justify a longer length. A turnaround shall be provided at the closed end, with a
radius of at least forty-eight (48) feet to the back of the curb and a right-of-way radius of
not less than fifty-nine (59) feet in accordance with standards of the 2018 International
Fire Code.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
If the property adjacent to the development is undeveloped and a street must temporarily
be a dead-end street, the right-of-way and road improvement shall be extended to the
property line. A temporary turnaround shall be constructed with a minimum radius of
thirty-five (35) feet. The temporary turnaround shall be constructed of asphaltic concrete
with a minimum depth of eight (8) inches. When a temporary turnaround is required, a
notation shall be added on the plat indicting that land outside the normal street right-of3/

(20) feet and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving a collector street shall be
at least twenty-five (25) feet. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a
block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practices to
permit safe vehicular movement.
Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade, whenever possible. In hilly or rolling
areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having a
maximum two percent (2%) rate for a distance of sixty (60) feet measured from the
nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street.
Sight distance triangle. Minimum sight distance shall be provided at each intersection by
not erecting, placing or planting an item in such a manner as to materially impede vision
between a height of two (2) and eight (8) feet above curb grade within the triangular area
formed by imaginary lines that being at the intersection and follow street pavement edges
for twenty-five (25) feet and are connected by a line drawn across the lot.
The cross-slope on all streets, including intersections, shall be three percent (3%) or less.
Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the developer, as determined by the City, shall be
constructed at the full expense of the developer without reimbursement from the City.
Streets — Dedication And Reservations.
Half streets. Dedication of half streets will not be approved except in the public interest.
Where an existing half street is adjacent to a new development, the other half of the street
shall be improved and dedicated by the developer.
Widening and realignment of existing streets. Where a development borders on an existing
narrow street or when the Comprehensive Master Plan indicate plans for realignment or
widening of a street that would require use of some of the land in the development, the

Section 400.860. Storm Water Management.
[R.O. 2011 §400.860; Ord. No. 2006-170 §1, 12-19-2006]
General Requirements.
Unless otherwise specified within these regulations, an adequate drainage system, including
pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges and other approved methods for
proper drainage of all water, shall be provided for each development. The storm water
management system shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the standards of
KCAPWA, unless otherwise noted in this Section.
Storm water systems shall be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system.
Unless otherwise specified by the City, storm sewers shall be designed by the Rational

point and catch basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage
patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block. Where applicable, an overland flow
escape route must be identified and calculations must be provided to verify that no principal
structures will be flooded when larger return period storms exceed the capacity of the
proposed storm water system.
Nature Of Storm Water Facilities.
Location. The developer may be required by the City to construct facilities to convey any
spring or surface water that may exist either previously to or as a result of the development.
Such drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way, where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements.
Accessibility to public storm sewers. Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the developer
shall install storm sewer facilities or if no outlets are within a reasonable distance, adequate
provision shall be made for the disposal of storm water, subject to the specifications of the
City. If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually, the developer shall
make arrangements for future storm water disposal by a public utility system. Provision for
such connection shall be incorporated by inclusion in the performance bond required for
platting. An agreement by the Board of Aldermen for the maintenance of said storm sewers is
required or an agreement for such maintenance by a property owners' association is required.
Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each
case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage
area, whether inside or outside the development. The developer shall determine the
necessary size of the facility, assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed
development permitted by this Chapter. Such determination shall be verified and approved by
the City.
Effect on downstream drainage areas. The developer shall determine the effect of the
development on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the development.
Such determination shall be verified and approved by the City. Drainage studies, together with
such other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed improvements.
Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development will overload an
existing downstream drainage facility, the City may withhold approval of the development until
provision has been made for the expansion of the existing downstream drainage facility. No
development shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an adequate
downstream drainage watercourse or facility.
Areas of poor drainage. When development is proposed for an area that is subject to flooding,
the City may approve such application provided that the developer fills the affected area to an
elevation sufficient to place the elevation of streets and lots at a minimum of twenty-four (24)
inches above the elevation of the 100-year floodplain. A copy of the required floodplain fill
permit shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a building permit, along with computations
showing that the elevation requirements have been met. The development shall provide for
an overflow zone along the bank of any stream or watercourse in a width that shall be
sufficient to contain or move the water in times of high water. No fill shall be placed in the
overflow zone nor shall any structure be erected or placed in the overflow zone. The
boundaries of the overflow zone shall be subject to approval by the City. Development of
areas of extremely poor drainage is discouraged and the City may deny development in such
areas.
Floodplain areas. The City may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety or welfare of
the present and future population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water,
drainage and sanitary facilities, prohibit the development of any portion of the property that
lies within the floodplain of any stream or drainage course. These floodplain areas shall be
preserved from any and all destruction or damage resulting from clearing, grading or dumping

Best management practices (BMP). The storm water management system shall follow BMP
requirements of the City. The City may deny any development applications that do not
incorporate such practices.
Dedication Of Drainage Easements.
General requirements. When a development is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way
conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse and of such width and construction
as will be adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, drainage should be maintained by an
open channel with landscape banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of
flow.
Drainage easements.
Where topography or other conditions are such that it is impractical to include drainage
facilities within street right-of-way, perpetual, unobstructed easements at least fifteen (15)
feet in width for drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road
lines and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Drainage easements shall extend from the road to a natural watercourse or to other
drainage facilities.
When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land outside the
development, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the plat.
The developer shall dedicate, either in fee simple title or by a drainage or conservation
easement, land on both sides of existing watercourses to a distance to be determined by
the City.
Low-lying land along watercourses subject to flooding or overflowing during storm
periods, whether or not included in areas for dedication, shall be preserved and retained
in their natural state as drainageways.
Section 400.870. Utilities and Easements.
[R.O. 2011 §400.870; Ord. No. 2006-170 §1, 12-19-2006]
Location. All utility facilities including, but not limited to, gas, electric, telephone and cable shall be
located underground throughout the development. Whenever existing utility facilities are located
above ground, except where existing on public roads and right-of-way, they shall be removed and
placed underground. All utility facilities existing and proposed throughout the development shall be
shown on the plat.
Easements.
An easement at least ten (10) feet wide shall be provided for utilities along each side or rear
line of a lot. The width of the easement shall also account for unusual topography or for
easements needed for multiple utilities to ensure the proper placement and maintenance of
utility lines.
Except where prohibited by topography, utility easements shall be located on lot lines in the
rights-of-way of streets or in separate utility easements. The City may require all easements
for drainage or sewer to be selectively cleared of undergrowth, trees and other obstructions
by the developer.
Utility easements shall connect with easements established in adjoining properties.

[R.O. 2011 §400.880; Ord. No. 2006-170 §1, 12-19-2006]
All areas to be reserved for or dedicated to public use, such as schools, recreation and open
space uses or other public use, shall be suitably incorporated into the preliminary plat in order that
it may be determined if and in what manner such areas will be dedicated to or acquired by the
appropriate agency. After proper determination of its necessity by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, Board of Aldermen and the appropriate City department or other public agency
involved in the acquisition and use of each site and a determination has been made to acquire the
site by purchase or dedication, the site shall be suitably incorporated into the final plat.
Referral To Public Body. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall refer the preliminary plat to
the public body concerned with acquisition for its consideration and report. The Planning and
Zoning Commission may propose alternate areas for such acquisition and shall allow the public
body or agency thirty (30) days for reply. The agency's recommendation shall include a map
showing the boundaries and area of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time required
to complete the acquisition.
Notice To Property Owner. Upon receipt of an affirmative report, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall notify the property owner and shall designate on the preliminary and final plats
that area proposed to be acquired by the public body.
Duration Of Land Reservation. The acquisition of land reserved by a public agency on the final
plat shall be initiated within twelve (12) months of notification, in writing, from the owner that they
intend to develop the land. Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by a sketch plan of the
proposed development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the part of the public
agency to initiate acquisition within the prescribed twelve (12) months shall result in the removal of
the "reserved" designation from the property involved and the freeing of the property for
development in accordance with said regulations.

[Ord. No. 1385 §1, 3-3-2015[1]]
Editor's Note: Section 1 of this ordinance repealed former Section 400.900, Flood Hazard Prevention,
as adopted and amended by R.O. 2011 §400.900; Ord. No. 2006-170 §1, 12-19-2006.
Section 400.901. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, and
Purposes.
[Ord. No. 1385 §1, 3-3-2015]
Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section 79.110, RSMo.,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the Board of
Aldermen of the City of Riverside, Missouri, ordains as follows.
Findings Of Fact.
Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of
Riverside, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in
flood heights and velocities; and
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of
a series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Division 1 is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur
on the particular streams subject to this Division 1. It is in the general order of a flood
which could be expected to have a one-percent chance of occurrence in any one (1) year
as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for
Platte County dated April 2, 2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering
analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the
regulatory flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights
more than one (1) foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted
that would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but
still subject to inundation by the base flood.

Statement Of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Division 1 to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section 400.901.B(1); to establish or
maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the
requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Division 1 to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding
or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.
Section 400.902. General Provisions.
[Ord. No. 1385 §1, 3-3-2015]
Lands To Which Division Applies. This Division 1 shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of
the City of Riverside, Missouri, identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones,
on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) for Platte County on map panels 29165C0384D,
29165C0391D, 29165C0392D, 29165C0394D, 29165C0403D, and 29165C0411D dated April 2,
2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this Division 1, no
development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit,
granted by the Board of Aldermen or its duly designated representative under such safeguards
and restrictions as the Board of Aldermen or the designated representative may reasonably
impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the
community, and as specifically noted in § 400.904.
Floodplain Administrator. The Community Development Director is hereby designated as the
Floodplain Administrator under this Division 1.
Compliance. No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall
be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this Division 1 and other applicable regulations.
Abrogation And Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Division 1 to repeal, abrogate, or
impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Division 1
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Division 1 shall prevail. All other Sections of the
Municipal Code inconsistent with this Division 1 are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Division 1 shall be held
to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body, and shall
not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this Division 1 is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions, or the flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This Division 1 does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This Division 1 shall not
create a liability on the part of the City of Riverside, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood
damages that may result from reliance on this Division 1 or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.

No permit for floodplain development shall be granted for new construction, substantial
improvements, and other improvements, including the placement of manufactured homes,
within any numbered or unnumbered A zones and AE zones, unless the conditions of this
section are satisfied.
All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation of the 100-
year flood; however, the base flood elevation is not provided. Development within
unnumbered A zones is subject to all provisions of this Division 1. If Flood Insurance Study
data is not available, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or other sources.
Until a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, including fill, shall be permitted within any numbered A zone or AE zone on the
FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the
community.
All new construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvements, prefabricated
structures, placement of manufactured homes, and other developments shall require:
Design or adequate anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy;

Storage, material, and equipment.
The storage or processing of materials within the special flood hazard area that are in
time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by
floods, if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if readily removable from the area within
the time available after a flood warning.
Non-conforming use. A structure, or the use of a structure or premises that was lawful before
the passage or amendment of this Division 1, but which is not in conformity with the
provisions of this Division 1, may be continued subject to the following conditions:
If such structure, use, or utility service is discontinued for thirty-six (36) consecutive
months, any future use of the building shall conform to this Division 1.
If any non-conforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall
not be reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty percent (50%) of the predamaged
market value of the structure. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to
comply with existing State or local health, sanitary, building, safety codes, regulations or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places,
the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon
determination.
Accessory structures. Structures used solely for parking and limited storage purposes, not
attached to any other structure on the site, of limited investment value, and not larger than
four hundred (400) square feet, may be constructed at grade and wet floodproofed, provided
there is no human habitation or occupancy of the structure; the structure is of single-wall
design; a variance has been granted from the standard floodplain management requirements
of this Division 1; and a floodplain development permit has been issued.

Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes,
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that
below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this Subsection are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in Section
400.903(C)(9).
Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements that fully enclosed areas
below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area
other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings
may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided
that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
Manufactured Homes.
All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and numbered A zones and AE
zones, on the community's FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and
practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured
homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.
Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors.
Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered or
numbered A zones and AE zones, on the community's FIRM on sites outside of a
manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in
an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred
substantial damage as the result of a flood be elevated on a permanent foundation such that
the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A
zones and AE zones, on the community's FIRM, that are not subject to the provisions of
Section 400.904(C)(2) of this Division 1, be elevated so that either:
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at one (1) foot above the base flood level;
or
The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation
elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in
height above grade and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 400.902(A) are
areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall
apply:
The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the
area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any
point.
The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
If Subsection (D)(2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 400.904.
In unnumbered A zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or other sources as
set forth in Section 400.904(A)(2).
Recreational Vehicles.

Floodplain Management Variance Criteria. In passing upon such applications for variances, the
Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other Sections of this Division 1, and the following criteria:
The danger to life and property due to flood damage;
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner;
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems; streets; and bridges.
Conditions For Approving Floodplain Management Variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items in Subsection (E)
(2) through (6) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the onehalf
(1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or
local inventory of historic places upon determination, provided the proposed activity will not
preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;

A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and such construction
below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this Division 1.
Conditions For Approving Variances For Accessory Structures.
Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a
case-by-case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet
the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Sections
400.905(D) and (E) of this Division 1.
In order to minimize flood damages during the one-hundred-year flood and the threat to public
health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for
accessory structures that are constructed at grade and wet floodproofed:
Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes
in flood-prone areas only.
For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior
building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior
finishes, flooring, etc.) below highest adjacent grade must be built with flood-resistant
materials in accordance with § 400.904(A)(4)(b) of this Division 1.
The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure in accordance with § 400.904(A)(4)(a) of this Division
1. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific floodrelated
forces, including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact
forces.
Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above highest
adjacent grade or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight,
floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in
accordance with § 400.904(A)(4)(d) of this Division 1.
The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to
the one-hundred-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters in accordance with the NFIP regulations.
Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.
No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency
shall be paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official
that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below highest adjacent grade will
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive
dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and such

Adoption Of Kansas City Metro American Public Works Association's Erosion And Sediment
Control Manual.
Adoption. The Kansas City Metro American Public Works Association's Erosion and Sediment
Control Manual (the "Erosion and Sediment Control Manual") is hereby enacted and made a
part of this Chapter by reference except as to portions hereinafter specifically deleted,
clarified or amended.
Adopted standards. The term "adopted standards" shall include the Erosion and Sediment
Control Manual.
Conflicts. If any conflict should exist between the Erosion and Sediment Control Manual and
the City Municipal Code, the provisions of the Code shall control.
Surety.
All applications for a land disturbance permit shall include such escrow, bond, insurance,
affidavits, easements, etc., as described below and as required for particular sites. The
applicant shall deposit with the City a sum equal to that which is required for assurance of the
completion of said project. The Director of Community Development or their designees may
adopt procedures, fees and schedules relating to the payment and release of such bonds.
Said escrow funds shall guarantee the restoration, maintenance and/or rehabilitation of said
site if the project does not proceed in accordance with the plans as approved by the City. Said
escrow can be approved by the Director or their designees and the City Attorney and drawn
upon by order of the Director or their designees if the requirements of the permit or of this
Section are not satisfied. In drawing upon such funds, the Director may use such funds to
restore the site to a stable or finished condition or to otherwise remedy any violations,
including any costs of inspections and enforcement.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
In lieu of cash escrow, a bond or surety for not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00)
may be provided for each grading site, subject to all the terms and conditions of this Chapter
and to the approval of the City Attorney. The amount of the bond escrow or indemnity shall
partially be based on the City's previous experience with the owner, contractor or builders.
Any portion of the deposit not expended or retained by the City hereunder shall be refunded
when the disturbance is completed and soil conditions are stabilized to the satisfaction of the
City.
Standards — Safety Precaution. A permit shall be issued and shall remain in force only upon
compliance with the following requirements:
Surface waters — damage. Adequate provision shall be made to prevent any surface waters
from damaging the cut face of an excavation or the sloping surface of a hill.
Retaining walls — cribbing. Retaining walls or cribbing shall be required whenever deemed
necessary by the Department of Public Works to prevent the surface of any excavation or fill
from exceeding at any point the maximum allowable slopes as set forth herein.
Drainage. All drainage provisions shall be of such design to carry surface waters to the
nearest practical storm drain or natural watercourse as approved by the Department of Public
Works as a suitable place to deposit and receive such waters. Where possible, water shall be
dispersed by convex surfaces to dissipate water energy and velocity and disperse volume
over a greater surface area before being carried to a storm drain or watercourse.
Protection of streets and property. No excavation shall be made so close to the property line
to endanger any adjoining public or private street without supporting and protecting such
public or private street or property from settling, cracking or other damage.

to roll, flow or wash upon or over the premises of another without the express written consent
of the owner of such premises so affected; or upon or over any public street, walk, place or
way; nor so close to the top of a bank of a channel as to create the possibility of bank failure
and sliding.
Materials. Materials for fills shall consist of material obtained from excavation of banks,
borrow pits or other approved source. Material shall be free of vegetable matter and
deleterious material and shall not contain large rocks or lumps. Materials for roadways are not
covered by this Section as per exceptions in Section 400.260(2) Exemptions.
Minimum standards. Minimum standards of excavations and fills shall be as follows:
No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in slope than three (3) horizontal to
one (1) vertical.
No fill shall be made which creates an exposed embankment face steeper in slope than
three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical. The embanked end of the fill shall be uniformly
compacted as provided below and stable under the proposed conditions.
Minimum standards — land disturbance. Unless modified as may be permitted in this
Subsection or by provisions of Subsection (C)(9) below, minimum standards for land
disturbance shall be as follows:
No land disturbance shall occur within fifty (50) feet of any creek, stream, water runoff
channels or ravines or in other areas determined by the Director of Community
Development or their designees to be highly sensitive or subject to erosion or flooding,
except as necessary for construction pursuant to an approved final development plan,
special use permit or plat specifically authorizing the modification of this standard and
necessitating exception to this minimum standard.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]

for excavation or fill, except as necessary for construction pursuant to an approved final
development plan, special use permit or plat specifically authorizing the modification of
this standard and necessitating exception to this minimum standard.
No land disturbance shall occur on any property or lot line or within the area of building
setback required by this Chapter, except as necessary for construction pursuant to an
approved final development plan, special use permit or plat specifically authorizing the
modification of this standard and necessitating exception to this minimum standard.
No land disturbance shall occur which shall cause a nuisance to any adjoining property
owner or which shall violate any Federal, State or local law or regulation. The
Department of Public Works, in conjunction with the Department of Community
Development, shall establish regulations for the granting of permits so as to enforce this
Chapter and ensure that any grading is completed with minimum erosion, aesthetic
degradation or other negative impact on the site or surrounding areas or the community.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
The Department of Public Works, in conjunction with the Department of Community
Development, shall establish such other minimum standards as may be necessary to

All grading shall comply with the restrictions and prohibitions set forth in this Section
pertaining to the site or development. No land disturbance permit shall be issued on any
site where there is an existing uncured violation of any provision of this Chapter or other
development regulations of the City of Riverside.
Modifications. Any party seeking a permit may request a modification of any of the
minimum standards set forth in this Section by filing a written request with the
Department of Public Works specifically identifying:
Unique or unusual characteristic(s) of the site, not generally applicable, that
eliminate the need for full application of the standard, or
The precise mitigation proposed that would fully rectify the harms addressed by the
minimum standard to be modified.
The Department of Public Works may make such modification upon
a determination that such facts exist qualifying for such
modification; provided that no modification shall be permitted that
shall circumvent any other applicable regulation or the intent of
these minimum standards to eliminate the detrimental impact of
grading addressed by each such standard.
Compaction. All fills intended to support buildings or structures, sewers and conduits shall be
compacted to a minimum of ninety percent (90%) compaction as determined by Modified
Proctor, ASTM D-1775. Compaction of fills for these uses must be certified by a registered
professional engineer at the owner's expense. Frequency of compaction tests is to be
determined by the Department of Public Works. Compaction of other fills shall be required
where necessary as a safety measure to aid in preventing the saturation, slipping or erosion
of the fill. The requirements of the Department of Public Works for the compaction of fills shall
include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
Areas to be graded by cutting or filling shall be rough graded to within two-tenths (.2) of a
foot of accepted elevation after allowance has been made for thickness of topsoil, paved
areas and other installations.
The natural ground surface shall be prepared by removing topsoil and vegetation and by
compacting the fill upon a series of terraces. Hillside or slope fills shall require plowing or
scarification of original ground.
Grading of slopes will require silt fencing at intermediate levels to slow surface water,
prevent rutting and decrease erosion.
Grading sites will require silting basins to prevent mud from washing onto adjacent
properties.
If fill material moisture content is below the requirement for compacting to maximum
practical density, water in the proper amount shall be added. If moisture content is too
great, fill material shall be aerated by blading or other satisfactory methods to reduce
moisture content.
Frozen materials or soft, mucky, friable, easily compressible materials shall not be
incorporated in fills intended to support buildings, structures, sewers or conduits or in the
embanked ends of fills. In heavy rain, interrupted work shall not be resumed until
moisture content is satisfactory. Fill material shall not be placed, spread or rolled while
the ground is frozen or thawing.
The maximum uncompacted thickness of layers of the fill to be compacted shall not
exceed eight (8) inches.

in an amount necessary to complete finished grading only.
Removal of timber, rubbish, etc. Timber, logs, trees, brush, vegetable matters and rubbish of
any description shall be removed and disposed of so as to leave the disturbed area with a
neat and finished appearance. Tree stumps, masonry and other obstructions shall be
removed to the following depths:
Paved areas. Two (2) feet below subgrade.
Lawn areas. Two (2) feet below finished grade.
Solid rock, shale or similar materials shall be removed to a depth of fifteen (15)
inches below subgrade for paved area and two (2) feet below finish grade for
lawn area except where it is impractical because of rock outcropping.
Use Of Streets During Grading.
Notice. At least five (5) working days prior to the use of any street in the City by trucks or
hauling or grading equipment engaged in grading operations in the City which requires the
use of the streets of the City, the contractor in charge shall make a written report to the
Department of Public Works specifying the kind and description of trucks or hauling or grading
equipment and the loaded and unloaded weight of trucks and hauling equipment and the
number of each and the length of time they will be required to use the streets of the City. The
contractor shall furnish the Department of Public Works with all other information required to
estimate or determine the amount of wear and tear or damage, if any, that may be caused to
streets by such usage. Before construction actually commences or while the work on the
streets is in progress, the Department of Public Works may require any contractor or
subcontractor to post surety bond or insurance with the City to guarantee the City for
compensation for any damage to streets, curbs, sidewalks, trees, landscaping or other public
facilities.
Routes. The Department of Public Works shall, at least two (2) working days before the
commencement of work and usage of the streets of the City, notify the contractor of the route
or routes to be used by such trucks and equipment. The contractor shall be charged with the
duty of seeing that the trucks or equipment use only the route or routes designated by the
Department of Public Works. In the event of any emergency requiring a change in route or
routes or if the Department of Public Works finds or determines that any route or routes so
designated are not safe or that excessive damage is being caused to any street or streets in
the City by such usage or if they find the welfare of the City so requires, they may, upon one
(1) days' notice to the contractor in writing, designate an alternate route or routes and it shall
thereupon be the duty of the contractor to see that the trucks or equipment use only the
alternate route or routes so designated by the Department of Public Works.
Conditions Of Streets.
Photographs. It shall be the duty of the Department of Public Works, immediately prior to the
time of designating the route or routes or alternate route or routes as provided herein, to
examine the condition of the streets to be used and to take photographs of the streets
showing the condition of the pavement, curbs, sidewalks and other physical features, which
shall be dated and a memorandum made of the location shown by each photograph. Within
five (5) days after termination of the use of the streets as herein provided, the Department of
Public Works shall have additional photographs made and proper descriptive matter included
therewith.

Inspection. In addition to the taking of photographs before and after construction, the
Department of Public Works shall cause a thorough inspection to be made of the condition of
the pavement of the streets designated and used under the permit, as well as the curbs and
sidewalks, and shall make written reports of their findings, including with their report after
termination of the work their estimate of the cost of restoring the street to its original condition
as well as any curbs or sidewalks.
Damage to Streets, Curbs And Sidewalks. At the time the Department of Public Works designates
the route or routes to be used as provided above, they shall notify the contractor that the City will
hold the contractor liable for unusual wear and tear or damage to the streets, curbs and sidewalks
resulting from such usage and that acceptance of the route or routes by the contractor shall
constitute an agreement on their part to pay the reasonable cost of restoring the streets, curbs and
sidewalks in question to their original condition. Within thirty (30) days after termination of the
contractor's usage of said route or routes under the land disturbance permit, the contractor shall
pay to the City an amount sufficient to reimburse the City for the expense of restoring the streets,
sidewalks and curbs to their original condition.
Construction Dirt, Debris And Noise.
Barriers at construction site. After new excavation or construction is commenced on any lot or
tract of land in the City and until sodding, planting, concreting, paving or other final surfacing
is in place which will avoid washing or spreading of dirt and mud onto other property,
sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streets and the space between sidewalks and curbs, the owner of
the property or the contractor or builder in charge of work shall erect and maintain temporary
walls or other approved barriers to prevent such washing or spreading of mud or dirt. At the
end of each day and as required throughout the day during the course of excavating or
construction, dirt and mud on the sidewalks, curbs, gutters and streets and the space
between sidewalk and street, resulting from work, must be removed.
Removing mud from vehicle wheels. The owners, contractors, subcontractors and builders,
jointly and severally, shall provide their personnel with shovels or other equipment as
necessary to remove dirt from the wheels of all vehicles leaving any grading site where mud
has accumulated on the wheels, before such vehicles enter any public or private street of the
City. It shall be unlawful for any owner, contractor or subcontractor or builder to permit any
vehicles to leave such place with mud on the wheels which is liable to be dispersed over any
public or private street of the City and it shall be unlawful for any driver of a vehicle to enter
upon the public or private streets of the City without having removed or had mud removed
from the wheels prior to such entry. Each occurrence in which the mud is not removed shall
be a separate offense.
Spilling materials on streets. The owners, contractors, subcontractors and builders, jointly and
severally, who may load dirt, mud or other materials on any vehicle at any grading site in the
City, during construction or otherwise, shall so load the same that no portion thereof shall be
spilled or be liable to be spilled on the streets of the City. It shall be unlawful for any such
person to permit any vehicle to enter upon the streets of the City loaded in violation of this
provision and it shall be unlawful for any driver to operate a vehicle on the streets of the City
which is loaded in such manner that it spills or is liable to spill mud, dirt or other materials on
the streets.
Boards over sidewalks. Boards, tracks or other protection must be laid over sidewalks, curbs
and gutters to avoid dirt and mud accumulating therein, as completely as possible and to
prevent breakage or damage to such installations, of whatever material constructed. Damage
to walks, curbs and gutters will be repaired by the contractor or the Department of Public
Works may cause to have them repaired at the contractor's expense.
Waste material. During the course of construction or excavation, owners, contractors and
builders are required to clean up all paper, refuse, sticks, lumber and other building waste and

scattered over adjacent public or private property.
Planting ground. Vacant property and improved property, after grading and construction is
completed, shall be sodded, planted, concreted, paved or otherwise surfaced to avoid
washing or spreading of dirt and mud onto other property, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streets
and the space between sidewalks and curbs prior to issuing an occupancy permit.
Grading. Grading, including operation or idling of equipment, shall be accomplished only
between the hours of 7:00 A.M. and sunset on weekdays and 8:00 A.M. and sunset on
Saturdays and Sundays, unless in the case of an emergency or a limited extension of hours is
specifically granted by the Department of Public Works.
Noise. The applicant shall take appropriate measures to reduce noise to the fullest extent
practical in the performance of the grading work.
Correction Of Deficiencies.
All violations shall be corrected within the time limit specified in the issuance of a written
notice to correct. Action to correct violations which require immediate action shall be taken
upon verbal notification of the contractor by the City. All persons failing to comply with such
notice shall be deemed in violation of this Chapter.
Any usage of the applicant's surety shall be followed by a written explanation by the Director
of Community Development or their designees describing the condition corrected and the
funds required to complete the corrective action.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
Nothing in this Section shall prevent prosecution of violations of this Chapter in the absence
of, or in addition to, the issuance of a notice of violation.
Right-Of-Way Permit.
Permit required. No person shall make or cause to be made any excavation in any public
place, street, roadway, parkway, walkway, alley, right-of-way or easement ("public area")
without first obtaining a permit from the Department of Public Works except in case of public
work done by the employees of the City or by any contractor under contract with the City.
Each separate and distinct excavation shall require a separate permit. This Subsection shall
apply to all persons and to all private, public and municipal corporations.
Emergency work. In cases where public health or safety is in danger or whatever excavations
must be made on an emergency basis to eliminate hazards to persons or to prevent
interruptions in the utility services or to restore such services after an interruption has
developed and the City is not open, the provisions of this Subsection relating to issuances of
a permit prior to excavation shall not apply. In such case the person making the excavation
shall notify the Police Department of the City that the emergency work is being commenced
and the location thereof and the work may precede immediately. Final surfacing or temporary
patches by the contractor shall not be placed until such time as the City has inspected and
approved the backfill and issued a permit therefore. Application for a permit shall be made on
the first (1st) day the City public works office is open after the emergency work is
commenced.
Application and permit fee. Application for a permit as required above shall be made on a

require a separate permit. The fee for each permit shall be as stated in Section 400.1110
Schedule of Fees.
Posting insurance. Before any permit is issued, the applicant shall furnish proof of adequate
insurance and protection to the City against all claims for damages arising from the
prosecution of the work as provided in Subsection (I)(5) of this Section.
Deposit. The application for a permit shall, in lieu of or in conjunction with the surety required
by Subsection (B) of this Section, include a cash deposit to insure the applicant will backfill
the excavation, repair the pavement and restore the site in compliance with this Section.
The approximate cost of granular backfill, repaving operations and general site
restoration to be performed by applicant desiring to make an excavation will be estimated
by the Department of Public Works at the time the application for a permit is submitted
and the cost so estimated shall be deposited with the City. The amount of the deposit
shall be reasonably sufficient to secure the City against any damage or expense which
may result from the applicant's failure to comply with the provisions of this Section. The
amount of such deposit shall be based upon the location, purpose and extent of the work.
However, the minimum amount of deposit shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). The
maximum deposit shall not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), except where
unusual circumstances exist.
Utility companies, contractors performing excavations under contract for utility companies
or other governmental agencies are not required to provide a cash deposit.
Each permit shall have a separate cash deposit to guarantee backfilling, paving and site
restoration in accordance with this Section.
The applicant is responsible for maintenance of the excavation for one hundred eighty
(180) days. Settlement of the excavation or cracking, breaking or rutting of the surface
shall be prima facie evidence of improper backfill, which shall be replaced by the
applicant or by the City with the cost paid out of the deposit.
If the work is completed satisfactorily, the deposit shall be refunded to the applicant within
fifteen (15) days of the final inspection by the Department of Public Works. The
contractor is responsible for notifying the Department of Public Works of final completion
of work. The final inspection will not be performed until the one hundred eighty (180) day
maintenance period is over.
In the event the applicant fails to complete or correct the work required by this Section,
the City may correct or complete said work; and the cost to the City shall be paid out of
the deposit. In the event that such deposit is insufficient to pay for the City's cost or if no
deposit was retained, the applicant shall pay the excess cost to the City within thirty (30)
days. Failure to pay said costs shall constitute cause to deny future applications for
grading or excavation until any default is fully cured.
Failure of the applicant to call for the final inspection within one (1) year of the issuance
date of the permit shall result in the deposit being forfeited by the applicant and said
deposit shall be paid to the City Treasury as general revenue.
Liability insurance or bond. Every applicant for an excavation permit shall register with the
City proof that the applicant is maintaining liability insurance in the sum of one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for bodily injury to each person, three hundred thousand
dollars ($300,000.00) for bodily injury to all persons in one (1) occurrence arising out of or on
account of excavation work on account of or in consequence of any neglect in safeguarding
the work. Such insured shall be carried in a firm or corporation which has been licensed or
permitted to carry on such business in the State and shall be kept and maintained
continuously in force and effect so long as the excavation work shall be in process. A verified

the policy is in full force and effect and that such insurance will not be altered, amended,
terminated or ended without notice having been given to the City. In lieu of the insurance as
herein provided, the applicant may deposit a corporate or other surety bond in the penal sum
of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) conditioned that they will pay any judgment
recovered by any person injured or any property damage incurred on account of the
excavation work or on account of or in consequence of any neglect in safeguarding the work.
In the event the insurance policy provided for herein lapses and is not immediately renewed
or any bond terminates in any manner whatsoever and a substitute in lieu thereof is not
deposited, the permit for such excavation shall be revoked immediately.
Manner of making excavations.
In the making of excavations in any street or public space, the excavated materials from
the trenches shall be placed where they will cause the least possible inconvenience to
the public. If the excavated material is waste material, it shall be immediately removed
from the site.
The width of excavation shall be no greater than is necessary for doing the work and
sheathing and bracing shall be used, as necessary, to keep the sides of the trench
vertical and to prevent caving. Excavations shall be made in accordance with City,
County, State and Federal regulations.
Adequate provision for proper drainage of the area surrounding the work shall be
maintained at all times.
At no time shall the maximum length of an open trench be permitted to exceed five
hundred (500) feet.
No trench or pit shall be permitted to remain open without work actually in progress at
each specific location for a period in excess of three (3) full working days, Saturdays,
Sundays and legal holidays excepted.
Excavations shall be covered or fenced when work is not in progress. Excavations in
roadways shall be backfilled or covered with steel plates at the end of the workday to
allow traffic to safely cross over the excavation.
When a roadway is partially blocked by the excavation work, the applicant shall provide a
flag person to direct traffic safely through the excavation site. Roadways shall not be
closed except upon approval by the Department of Public Works after an approved
detour has been established and properly signed and after the Police and appropriate
Fire Department have been notified.
Manner of backfilling, repaving and site restoration.
Excavations made in or under the street, walk or driveway pavement shall be backfilled
with granular material thoroughly tamped into place and the pavement surface restored.
In such locations, excavated materials shall be removed from the site of the work as the
excavation is made and no such materials shall be allowed to accumulate on the site.
Substitution may be made for granular backfill or pavement restoration only with the
specific approval of the Department of Public Works in each instance.
Approved granular backfill material shall be composed of one (1) inch minus crushed
stone or gravel and sand, free from clay lumps and trash and conforming to industry
standards for sieve analysis.

The granular backfilling material shall be at the excavation site at the time of the
inspection by the Department of Public Works so they can determine compliance with
aggregate specifications. Granular backfill shall be placed in horizontal layers not greater
than six (6) inches thick before compaction and shall be densified by mechanical tamping
or inundating and vibration or jetting. Each layer of fill material shall be compacted to
ensure the desired compaction and density which shall be not less than ninety-five
percent (95%) standard compaction. During placement, care shall be taken to avoid
undue segregation of coarse and fine particles.
Asphaltic concrete pavement, macadam pavement or bituminous pavement shall be
restored as follows:
Excavation edges shall be cut straight to a minimum depth of two (2) inches and
squared with a concrete saw. The edge shall be primed and an asphaltic concrete,
as approved by the Department of Public Works, shall be placed on the compacted
backfill. The depth of asphaltic concrete shall be eight (8) inches placed in layers not
greater than three (3) inches nor less than one (1) inch. Each layer shall be
thoroughly compacted and the surface shall be smooth and free of ruts matching the
existing pavement to support traffic without rutting or settling.
Concrete pavement shall be restored as follows:
Excavation edges shall be straight, cut full depth and squared with a concrete saw or
replaced to a joint. A six (6) sack Portland cement concrete shall be placed on the
compacted backfill. The concrete thickness shall be seven (7) inch minimum. The
concrete surface shall be finished to match the surrounding finishes. The concrete
shall be protected from traffic for seven (7) days.
Curbs shall be restored as follows:
The existing remaining curb shall be cut straight with a concrete saw or removed to a
joint. The new curb shall match (asphaltic concrete or Portland cement concrete),
shape and style of the existing curbs. Concrete curbs shall be reconstructed with six
(6) sack Portland cement concrete.
Excavations in parkways outside of the paved area may be backfilled with earth and all
grassed areas returned to their original condition by sodding or seeding as directed by
the City. Earth backfill is to be placed and compacted in the same manner as described
in this Section for granular fills or thoroughly jetted to obtain maximum settlement and
shall be maintained by the applicant until the areas has been stabilized in the original
condition. As soon as the excavation has been backfilled, all excess excavated materials
shall be removed from the area and disposed of.
All work shall be guaranteed from defects for a period of one (1) year after the inspection.
Inspection of backfill material and pavement replacement. Backfill material must be approved
by a City Inspector. In the event backfill material is not approved by the City, all such backfill
must be removed and replaced under a City Inspector's supervision. Pavement shall be
replaced only upon inspection by the City.
Interference with traffic and driveways — restoration of surfaces. All excavations regulated by
this Section shall be made in such manner as not to inconvenience or interfere with the public
use or travel upon the streets, sidewalks or other public places when possible. When such
use is unavoidably obstructed, the person making such excavation shall exercise all
reasonable dispatch in prosecuting the work so that the public use will not be obstructed
beyond a reasonable time. All sidewalks, crosswalks, curbs, gutters, streets or public places
disturbed, interfered with or injured in making such excavation shall be restored, replaced and
repaired to as good condition as they were before such excavation was made.

ARTICLE XII. Non-Conformities
Section 400.940. General Provisions.
[R.O. 2011 §400.940; Ord. No. 2006-170 §1, 12-19-2006]
Purpose. The purpose of this Article is to establish regulations that govern uses, structures, lots
and other current circumstances that existed legally prior to the effective date or amendment of
this Chapter, but that do not conform to all of the applicable requirements of this Chapter. Such
instances shall be considered legal non-conformities.
Policy. It is the general policy of the City to allow legal non-conformities to continue to exist, but to
bring as many aspects of such situation into conformance with this Chapter as is reasonably
practicable. It is the intent of the City to recognize the interests of the property owner in continuing
to use the property, but to prohibit the expansion of the non-conformity and to prohibit reestablishment
of abandoned uses and to prohibit re-establishment of buildings and structures that
have been substantially destroyed.
Authority To Continue. Legal non-conformities shall be allowed to continue in accordance with the
regulations of this Article.
Determination Of Legal Non-Conforming Status. The burden of establishing that a non-conformity
legally exists is to the property owner and not the City.
Repair And Maintenance. Repairs and normal maintenance required to keep non-conforming
structures in a safe condition shall be permitted, provided that no alterations shall be made except
those allowed by this Article or required by law.
Change Of Tenancy Or Ownership. Changes of tenancy, ownership or management of an existing
non-conformity shall be permitted, provided there is no change in the nature or character, extent or
intensity of such non-conformity.
Section 400.950. Legal Non-Conforming Uses.
[R.O. 2011 §400.950; Ord. No. 2006-170 §1, 12-19-2006]

Expansion. A legal non-conforming use shall not be expanded or enlarged to occupy a
greater area of land or floor area than was occupied prior to the effective date or amendment
of this Chapter and no additional accessory use, building or structure shall be established on
the site of a legal non-conforming use. This provision notwithstanding, uses may be extended
throughout any part of a building or other structure that was legally and manifestly designed
or arranged for such use prior to the effective date or amendment of this Chapter.
Relocation. A legal non-conforming use shall not be moved in whole or part to any other
portion of such parcel or to another lot unless the use will be in conformance with the
regulations of the zoning district into which it is moved.
Change of use. A legal non-conforming use may be changed to a new use, provided the new
use shall be of the same general character or of a character less intensive (and thus more
closely conforming) than the existing legal non-conforming use. The Director of Community
Development shall make the initial determination of whether a proposed use is of the same
general character or of a character less intensive than the existing use with an appeal to the
Board of Zoning Adjustment. A legal non-conforming use may not thereafter be changed back
to a less conforming use than it was changed from.
[Ord. No. 1671, 7-16-2019]
Discontinuance and abandonment. If a legal non-conforming use ceases for any reason for a
period of six (6) consecutive months, it shall not thereafter be resumed and the subsequent
use of the land shall conform to the regulations of the zoning district that such land is located.
Residential uses. Any structure that is devoted to a legal non-conforming residential use,
provided there are not more than four (4) dwelling units, may be reconstructed to its former
condition, dimensions and location on the lot, provided the destruction was caused by an
accident or act of nature and the reconstruction does not increase the degree of nonconformity
that existed prior to the destruction. Reconstruction must commence within one (1)
year of destruction. If such reconstruction does not commence within the stated time frame,
the non-conformity shall be considered abandoned and the subsequent use of the land shall
conform to the regulations of the zoning district that such land is located.
Sale of used motor vehicles. Any person or firm who obtained a special use permit prior to the
effective date of this Chapter to allow the sale of used motor vehicles in the "C-1" District may
continue to operate the business as a legal non-conforming use. However the special use
permit shall be revoked if any of the following occur:
The special use permit expires.
The person or firm is in violation of this Chapter or any condition of the special use permit
approval.
The permit holder becomes deceased provided that the executor or administrator of the
estate of a deceased permit holder may continue the business under the order of an
appropriate court for not longer than six (6) months after the death of the permit holder.

Expansion. A legal non-conforming structure shall not be expanded, enlarged or extended.
Relocation. A legal non-conforming structure shall not be moved in whole or part to any other
portion of such parcel or to another lot unless the movement or relocation will bring the

destruction, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall conform with all
regulations of the zoning district that it is located.
When such damage or destruction is fifty percent (50%) or less, the legal non-conforming
structure may be restored, provided a building permit is obtained within six (6) months

[R.O. 2011 §515.100; Ord. No. 2001-35 §§1 — 2, 4-3-2001]
Unless the building or structure is demolished, secured or repaired by a contractor pursuant to an
order issued by the City, and such contractor files a mechanic's lien against the property where the
dangerous building is located, whenever the City shall have caused the work to be done as
provided by Section 515.090, the City Administrator or his/her representative shall certify the costs
of the work to the Finance Director who shall cause a special tax bill therefor and for the costs
associated with the processing of the order to include publication, court reporter, certified mail, and
the Inspector's time, which shall be likewise certified by the City Administrator or his/her
representative, to be issued against the lot, tract or parcel of land upon which the building or
structure is located. The special tax bill from the date of its issuance shall be deemed a personal
debt against the property owner and in addition shall be a lien on the lot, tract or parcel of land
until paid and shall be registered in the office of the Director of Finance of the City. The tax bill
shall be collected by the City Collector or other official collecting taxes.
If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in Section 515.120, at the written
request of the taxpayer delivered to the City Clerk of the City, a tax bill for repair or demolition of a
building or structure may be paid in ten (10) equal annual installments, which installments with
interest thereon to date on the unpaid balance shall be due annually on the anniversary of the
date of issuance of the bill. Interest shall be paid at the maximum rate per annum allowable by law

entire remaining balance of the tax bill shall immediately become due and payable.
If request for ten (10) annual payments is not made prior to the time the City Administrator or
his/her representative shall certify the cost of the work to the City Clerk or the Finance Director,
the tax bill shall be payable in sixty (60) days from its date of issuance with interest thereon at the
maximum rate per annum allowable by law.
Tax bills issued under Section 515.100 shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the bill, the
doing of the work and the liability of the property for the damages stated in the bill and shall be
collected if default should occur by suit brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by the City
Counselor on behalf of the City. Judgment in any such suit shall be special and against the
property owner and against the property and shall be satisfied by sale of the property or so much
thereof as is necessary to satisfy the judgment and the costs of the sale or by any other means
available under law or equity.

Section 515.120. Insurance Proceeds From Damage or Loss.
[R.O. 2011 §515.120; Ord. No. 2001-35 §§1 — 2, 4-3-2001]
If there are proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a covered claim payment made for
damage or loss to a building or other structure caused by or arising out of any fire, explosion, or
other casualty loss, and if the covered claim payment is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the face
value of the policy covering a building or other structure, then the following procedure shall apply:
The insurer shall withhold from the covered claim payment up to twenty-five percent (25%) of
the covered claim payment and shall pay that amount to the City to deposit into an interestbearing
account. Any named mortgagee on the insurance policy shall maintain priority over
any obligation under this Section. If a special tax bill or assessment is issued by the City for
the expenses of demolition of such building as a dangerous building, the monies held by the
City shall be applied toward payment of special tax bill or assessment. If there is any excess,
it shall be paid by the City to the insured or as the terms of the policy, including any
endorsement thereto, provide.
The City shall release the proceeds and any interest which has accrued on such proceeds
received under Subsection (A) hereof to the insured or as the terms of the policy and
endorsements thereto provide within thirty (30) days after receipt of such insurance monies,
unless the City has instituted legal proceedings under the provisions of Sections 515.090 and
515.100. If the City has proceeded under the provisions of Sections 515.090 and 515.100, all

Chapter 520. Blight Removal and Reinvestment Program
Section 520.010. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 1263 §1, 11-5-2013]
The purpose of this legislative enactment is to establish the Blight Removal and Reinvestment
Program ("Program") to partner with private property owners to remove blighted structures (both
residential and commercial) and encourage reinvestment in the property.
Section 520.020. Findings of Fact.
[Ord. No. 1263 §1, 11-5-2013]
The Board of Aldermen hereby finds as follows:
The elimination of blight and improving the image of the City was a common concern heard
during the master planning process. Participants expressed "a well-founded fear that rundown
buildings are keeping the City from progressing as rapidly as it should." (Plan, page 13).
One of the goals identified in the Master Plan states: "Goal: to improve the appearance,
safety and economic viability of the City through the systematic removal of blight and the
construction of beautiful buildings, streetscapes, and public spaces" (page 61).
Blighted buildings can negatively impact surrounding property values.
There are within the City properties which have become derelict, unused, abandoned or unfit
for human habitation or other use by reasons of age, obsolescence, prolonged vacancy,
dilapidation, deterioration, lack of maintenance and care or general neglect.
Blighted properties individually and collectively constitute a blight and nuisance in City
neighborhoods, create fire and health hazards, and are sometimes a haven for immoral and
criminal purposes.
It is in the best interests of the City for the furtherance of the health, safety, and welfare of its
residents, and to otherwise further the objectives of the economic development within the City
to establish and implement the Program.
Section 520.030. Program Funding.
[Ord. No. 1263 §1, 11-5-2013]
The Program will provide up to a fifty-percent matching grant, up to a maximum of eight thousand
dollars ($8,000.00) per structure, to eligible property owners for the purpose of assisting property
owners with demolition costs to eliminate blight and encourage reinvestment in the property.

interference with the reception of off-the-air signals of a subscriber.
Picture and sound quality. The system shall be capable of producing a picture on each
subscriber's television screen in black and white or color, depending upon whether color is
being telecast and provided the subscriber's television set is capable of producing a color
picture, that is materially undistorted and materially free from ghost images other than those
resulting from ingress which can normally be expected from off-the-air signals, without
material degradation of color fidelity. The system shall produce sound that is materially
distorted on any properly functioning receiver of a subscriber.
FCC technical standards. Should the FCC promulgate technical standards which exceed the
performance guidelines contained in the Cable Communications Code, an operator shall
operate its system so that it meets or exceeds FCC standards.
Equipment For Hearing-Impaired Persons. An operator shall inform subscribers, upon request,
where they may obtain equipment which facilitates the reception of cable service by hearingimpaired
individuals, where such properly encoded programming exists. If that equipment is not
available from other sources, an operator shall make that equipment available for subscribers for
reasonable installation and rental charges.
Performance Standards.
Compliance with technical standards. All cable communications systems shall be designed
and installed to operate according to the technical standards and all applicable rules and
regulations of the FCC, including all future amendments or standards required by the FCC.

Q.
Line Extension Policy. An operator shall construct and extend its system pursuant to the following
requirements:
Existing subdivision or other developed area. An operator shall construct and extend its
system and make cable service available to every residential dwelling unit in any existing
subdivision or other developed area within the City which is unserved by any operator when
there is a minimum occupied density of thirty-five (35) residential dwelling units per street mile
or twenty (20) residential dwelling units per cable mile, as measured from the existing system.
Developing subdivision or other area. An operator shall extend its system and make cable
service available to every residential dwelling unit in any platted phase of a developing
subdivision or other area which is unserved by any operator when there is a minimum
occupied density of thirty-five (35) residential dwelling units per street mile or twenty (20)
residential dwelling units per cable mile, according to the overall system extension design
necessary to make service available to the platted phase, as measured from the existing
system.
Non-residential areas. An operator shall extend its system and make cable service available
to every non-residential building when the potential subscriber or subscribers at that nonresidential
building agree to pay for the labor costs incurred and material used in making the
extension.
Isolated residents. An operator shall extend its system and make cable service available at
the regular connection charge, regardless of the density requirements in this Section, to any
isolated resident requesting connection if the connection to the isolated resident requires no
more than a standard two hundred (200) foot drop line.
Extensions from other systems. If there is an area within the City which is unserved by any
operator, and that area does not meet the density requirements contained in the Cable
Communications Code, an operator shall extend cable service to the residents of that area
from other cable communications systems operated by the operator, if the extension is
technically and economically feasible. In that case, requirements in a franchise agreement for
public, educational, and government channels (if any) shall be waived by the City.
Furthermore, requirements relating to the physical and technical characteristics and
capabilities of the extension shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of the franchise
granted by the jurisdiction from which the service is imported.
Assistance by City. In all cases, an operator may request the aid of the City, at operator's
expense, to obtain information from the City to determine density levels in unserved areas,
the number of residents committed to subscribe to the service once available, the boundaries
between residential areas, or any other assistance which may facilitate extension and
provision of cable service. When the City is unable to provide assistance for any reason, such
services shall be obtained by the operator at its own expense.
Density per cable mile. For the purposes of the Cable Communications Code, density per
cable mile shall be computed by dividing the number of residential dwelling units in an area by
the length, in miles or fractions of miles, of the total amount of aerial or underground cable
necessary to make service available to the residential dwelling units in that area in
accordance with the design parameters of the cable communications system being
constructed. The cable length shall be measured from the nearest point of access to the
existing system, provided that such access is technically feasible, and located within the
streets, other public property, or private easements or rights-of-way the operator is entitled to
use. The total cable length shall exclude the length of the drop necessary to service individual
subscriber premises.
Low Density Service. For the purpose of providing cable service to residents on an accelerated
basis, the City, through its franchise administrator, and an operator may mutually agree to any
3/4/2020 City of Riverside, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/RI3419?guid=29055003,29027457,29027549,29027567,29027648,29027669,29027672,29027774,29027933,290280… 613/666
R.
other alternative methods of extending cable service into areas of the City where the minimum
occupied density is less than the requirements of the Cable Communications Code.
Interconnection. Provided there is no decrease in the technical quality of service provided to
subscribers in the City and such interconnection has no effect on the City's rights under the Cable
Communications Code or any franchise agreement, a system may be interconnected with other
cable communications systems of the operator or other operators.

and authority granted to an operator for use of the City's streets and other public property, an
operator shall pay to the City an amount equal to five percent (5%) of its gross revenues. This
amount represents compensation for the use of the streets and other public property by an
operator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an operator is providing additional services over the
system in the City, and another person is providing those additional services over the system in
the City using public property and is the dominant provider of those additional services in the City,
then with respect to those additional services the operator shall pay a franchise fee in an amount
equal to the franchise fee paid by dominant provider with respect to those additional services.
Payment Of Fee. Except as otherwise provided, payment of annual franchise fees shall be in lieu
of all pole attachment charges imposed by the City in connection with the operation of the system.
Taxes Of General Applicability. Imposition of a franchise fee does not prohibit the City from
imposing on operators, as part of a group of businesses or activities, any tax, fee or assessment
of general applicability (including any such tax, fee or assessment imposed on both utilities and
operators or their services, but not including a tax, fee or assessment which is unduly
discriminatory against operators or subscribers).
Payment Time And Method. Franchise fee payments shall be made quarterly as follows: for the
quarter ending December thirty-first (31st), the payment shall be made by the following January

following April thirtieth (30th); for the quarter ending June thirtieth (30th), the payment shall be
made by the following July thirty-first (31st); and for the quarter ending September thirtieth (30th),
the payment shall be made by the following October thirty-first (31st). Each payment shall be
accompanied by a statement of gross revenues received for the quarter in connection with the
operation of the system in the City, and a report showing the computation of the fees in a form
prescribed by the franchise administrator.
Acceptance Of Payment Not Accord Or Release. No acceptance of any payment shall be
construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of
payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums
payable under the provisions of the Cable Communications Code or a separate franchise
agreement. All amounts paid by an operator shall be subject to audit by the City.
Late Payment. In the event that any franchise fee payment is not made on or before the applicable
due date, an operator shall pay interest, computed from the due date, at the annual rate equal to
the prime rate in effect on the due date plus two (2) percentage points. The prime rate will be the
commercial prime interest rate charged by the Bank of New York, or its successor.
Early Termination Of Franchise. In the event a franchise is terminated for any reason before its
normal termination date, an operator shall immediately submit to the City a financial statement
prepared in accordance with the terms of this Section showing the operator's gross revenues for
the time elapsed since the last period for which the operator has paid franchise fees to the City. An
operator shall pay the required franchise fees to the City not later than thirty (30) days following

imposition of a franchise fee, each operator will pay to the City an amount equal to the
franchise fee for and in consideration of any right to use public property.

and payment to the City. An operator's records shall be reviewed during normal business hours at a

by the City, unless the operator's notice shows that the corrective action cannot be completed
within thirty (30) days with the exercise of all due speed and diligence and such notice contains a
proposed timetable for completion of the corrective action, in which case the City shall authorize a
reasonable extension of time where extension can result in correction of the deficiency; provided

writing, a hearing before the Board. If the franchise administrator determines that a violation has
occurred, operator shall have fourteen (14) days from the date of decision to begin correction of

fails to notify the City of the corrective action to be taken within the fourteen (14) day period as
required, or fails to correct the violation within thirty (30) days of the date of the decision, the City
shall then have the option of charging operator with a penalty in the amount of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) per twenty-four (24) hour day for every day the violation remains uncorrected,
from the date the operator receives a written notice from the franchise administrator that the

and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangement to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records
that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by State and Federal law.
The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to
conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.

own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral
request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of
clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this Section. A person who is the
operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial
activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this Chapter.
If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this Chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance
with this Chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety
and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of
a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

(BMPs) for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination
of stormwater, the storm drainage system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drainage system
or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to
prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a
valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the
extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this Section. These BMPs shall
