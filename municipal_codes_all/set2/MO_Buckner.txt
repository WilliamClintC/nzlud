justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall be stated in the minutes. Where such
emergency exists, the votes taken shall be regarded as if all members were physically present
and in attendance at the meeting.
A journal or minutes of open and closed meetings shall be taken and retained by the public

herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a
separation of exempt from non-exempt information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person
requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe the material
exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat
the purpose of the exemption.

Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon as possible, but in no
event later than the end of the third business day following the date the request is received by the
custodian of records of a public governmental body. If records are requested in a certain format,
the public body shall provide the records in the requested format, if such format is available. If
access to the public record is not granted immediately, the custodian shall give a detailed
explanation of the cause for further delay and the place and earliest time and date that the record
will be available for inspection. This period for document production may exceed three (3) days for
reasonable cause.
If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon request, a written statement of
the grounds for such denial. Such statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which
access is denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of the third business

Section 120.100. Fees for Copying Public Records —
Limitations.

Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted under Section 32.091,

inches by fourteen (14) inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to exceed the
average hourly rate of pay for clerical staff of the public governmental body. Research time
required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.
Based on the scope of the request, the public governmental body shall produce the copies
using employees of the body that result in the lowest amount of charges for search, research
and duplication time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the person
requesting the records may request the public governmental body to provide an estimate of
the cost to the person requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without charge or
at a reduced charge when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction
of the fee is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
Fees for providing access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes
or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices and for paper copies larger than nine (9) inches by fourteen (14)
inches shall include only the cost of copies, staff time, which shall not exceed the average
hourly rate of pay for staff of the public governmental body required for making copies and
programming, if necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or other medium used for the
duplication. Fees for maps, blueprints or plats that require special expertise to duplicate may
include the actual rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to duplicate such
maps, blueprints or plats. If programming is required beyond the customary and usual level to
comply with a request for records or information, the fees for compliance may include the
actual cost of such programming.
Payment of such copying fees may be requested prior to the making of copies.

Pursuant to authority to regulate or prohibit the keeping or running at large of any animal or fowl,

appropriate in the circumstances of the case. Complaints under Subsection may only be lodged by

committing the offense, a person performs any act which is a substantial step towards the
commission of the offense. A "substantial step" is conduct which is strongly corroborative of the
firmness of the actor's purpose to complete the commission of the offense.

be.
Section 210.030. Conspiracy.

that a person with whom he or she conspires to commit an offense has conspired with another
person or persons to commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other person or
persons.
If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he or she can be found guilty of only one
offense so long as such multiple offenses are the object of the same agreement.

an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or
her or by a person with whom he or she conspired.
Exceptions.

after conspiring to commit the offense, he/she prevented the accomplishment of the
objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his/her
criminal purpose.

Domestic Violence and Abuse.
[R.O. 2003 §210.025; Ord. No. 517 §§I-II, 8-4-1994]
When a Buckner Police Officer has probable cause to believe a person has committed a
violation of law amounting to abuse or assault, as defined in Section 455.010, RSMo., against
a family or household member, the officer may arrest the offending party whether or not the
violation occurred in the presence of the arresting officer. When the officer declines to make
an arrest pursuant to this Subsection, the officer shall make a written report of the incident
completely describing the offending person, giving the victim's name, date, time, address,
reason why no arrest was made, and any other pertinent information. Any Buckner Police
Officer subsequently called to the same address within a twelve-hour period, who shall find
probable cause to believe the same offender has again committed a violation as stated in this
Subsection against the same or any other family or household member, shall arrest the
offending party for this subsequent offense. The primary report of non-arrest in the preceding
twelve-hour period may be considered as evidence of the defendant's intent in the violation
for which arrest occurred. The refusal of the victim to sign an official complaint against the
violator shall not prevent an arrest under this Section.
When a Buckner Police Officer has probable cause to believe that a person, against whom a
protective order has been entered and who has notice of such order entered, has committed
an act of abuse in violation of such order, the officer shall arrest the offending personrespondent
whether or not the violation occurred in the presence of the arresting officer.
Refusal of the victim to sign an official complaint against the violator shall not prevent an
arrest under this Section.
When making an arrest, a Police Officer is not required to arrest both parties involved in
domestic violence or an assault even if both parties claim to have been assaulted. The
arresting officer shall attempt to identify and shall arrest the party believed to be the primary
physical aggressor. The term "primary physical aggressor" is defined as the most significant,
rather than the first, aggressor. The Police Officer shall consider any or all of the following in
determining the primary physical aggressor:
The intent of the law to protect victims of domestic violence from continuing abuse.
The comparative extent of injuries inflicted or serious threats creating fear of physical
injury.
The history of domestic violence between the persons involved.
When complaints are received from two (2) or more opposing parties, the Police Officer shall
evaluate each complaint separately to determine whether to make an arrest.

Tampers with, or causes to be tampered with, any meter or other property of an electric, gas,
steam or water utility, the effect of which tampering is either:

been tampered with, and the person or persons accused received the use or direct benefit of the
electric, gas, steam or water service with one (1) or more of the effects described in Subsection
(A)(4), shall be sufficient to support an inference which the trial court may submit to the trier of fact
from which the trier of fact may conclude that there has been a violation of such Subsection by the
person or persons who use or receive the direct benefit of the electric, gas, steam or water
service.

Section 210.1180. Stealing Leased or Rented Personal Property

property;

Returns the property to the lessor at the end of the lease term, plus any agreed upon
extensions, but does not pay the lease charges agreed upon in the written instrument, with
the intent to wrongfully deprive the lessor of the agreed upon charges.
The provisions of this Section shall apply to all forms of leasing and rental agreements including,
but not limited to, contracts which provide the consumer options to buy the leased or rented
personal property, lease-purchase agreements and rent-to-own contracts. For the purpose of
determining if a violation of this Section has occurred, leasing contracts which provide options to
buy the merchandise are owned by the owner of the property until such time as the owner
endorses the sale and transfer of ownership of the leased property to the lessee.
Evidence that a lessee used a false, fictitious, or not current name, address, or place of
employment in obtaining the property or that a lessee fails or refuses to return the property or pay
the lease charges to the lessor within seven (7) days after written demand for the return has been
sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address the person set forth in the lease
agreement, or in the absence of the address, to the person's last known place of residence, shall
be evidence of intent to violate the provisions of this Section, except that if a motor vehicle has not
been returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease or rental agreement,
such failure to return the motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of the intent of the offense of
stealing leased or rented property. Where the leased or rented property is a motor vehicle, if the
motor vehicle has not been returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease
or rental agreement, the lessor may notify the local law enforcement agency of the failure of the
lessee to return such motor vehicle, and the local law enforcement agency shall cause such motor
vehicle to be put into any appropriate State and local computer system listing stolen motor
vehicles. Any Law Enforcement Officer which stops such a motor vehicle may seize the motor
vehicle and notify the lessor that he/she may recover such motor vehicle after it is photographed
and its vehicle identification number is recorded for evidentiary purposes. Where the leased or
rented property is not a motor vehicle, if such property has not been returned within the seven-day
period prescribed in this Subsection, the owner of the property shall report the failure to return the
property to the local law enforcement agency, and such law enforcement agency may within five
(5) days notify the person who leased or rented the property that such person is in violation of this
Section, and that failure to immediately return the property may subject such person to arrest for
the violation.

which are the subject matter of the prosecution if the summons or warrant contains information of
the ten-day period during which the instrument may be paid and that payment of the instrument
within such ten-day period will result in dismissal of the charges. The requirement of notice shall
also be satisfied for written communications which are tendered to the defendant and which the
defendant refuses to accept.

any crime or offense or attempt to entice others to do so.
As used herein, the expression "linger" means remaining outdoors in any location in which the

activities with the purpose of possessing, buying, selling or distributing any deadly weapon,
controlled substance, illegal intoxicant or for committing or attempting to commit any crime or
offense or enticing others to do so.
Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm or immediate
concern as set forth in Subsection (A) of this Section is warranted is whether a person takes flight
upon the appearance of a Law Enforcement Officer, refuses to provide identity or endeavors to
conceal himself, herself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it
impracticable, a Law Enforcement Officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this
Section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern by requesting
that the person provide identity, explain his or her presence and conduct and demonstrate that he
or she is unarmed. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this Section if the Law
Enforcement Officer did not comply with this procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation
given by the person is true and, if believed by the officer at the time, would have dispelled the
alarm or immediate concern which gave rise to the initial intervention by law enforcement.
Any person found guilty of unlawful lingering hereunder shall be punished as set out in this Code.

forthwith take said minor to the Buckner Police Station to be held pending the placement to their
lawful parent or guardian and to instruct said parent or guardian to produce said minor before the

of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be
necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises, except that, in the case of a
rental, the landlord may, where it is reasonable to do so, condition permission for a
modification on the renter's agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition
that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted;
A refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services when
such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and
enjoy a dwelling; or

The public use and common use portions of such dwellings are readily accessible to and
usable by persons with a disability;
All the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises within such dwellings
are sufficiently wide to allow passage by persons with a disability in wheelchairs; and

Section 240.080. Use Of The Right-Of-Way.
[Ord. No. 1017, 8-1-2018]
The ROW-user's use of the right-of-way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City's use or
occupation of the right-of-way. The City may reserve sufficient space within the right-of-way for
future public improvements. Without limitation of its rights, the City expressly reserves the right to
exercise its governmental powers now and hereafter vested in or granted to the City.

Association (APWA) standards.
The ROW-user shall consider any request made by the City concerning placement of facilities in
private easements in order to limit or eliminate future street improvement relocation expenses or

addition, the ROW-user shall, in doing work in connection with its facilities, avoid, so far as may be
practicable, disrupting or interfering with the lawful use of the right-of-way or other public lands of
the City.
All facilities of the ROW-user shall be placed so that they do not interfere with the use of right-ofway
and public lands. The City, through its Public Works Director, shall have the right to consult
and review the location, design and nature of the facility prior to its being installed. The designer is
responsible for complying with the stipulations noted in this Chapter.
Whenever reasonably possible, all newly constructed facilities shall be located underground and
concealed. The ROW-user shall comply with all requirements of the City relating to underground
facilities. This requirement may be waived by the Public Works Director at his/her discretion for
safety concerns, or some other good cause under the condition that does not cause discrimination
among ROW-users. If this requirement is waived, the facilities shall be located as directed by the
Public Works Director, including, but not limited to, requirements regarding location and height.
The ROW-user shall not interfere with the facilities of the other ROW-users without their
permission. If and when the City requires or negotiates to have a service provider cease using its
existing poles and to relocate its facilities underground, all other service providers using the same
poles shall also relocate their facilities underground at the same time.
The Public Works Director may assign specific corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular
segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is currently or, pursuant to
current technology, the Public Works Director expects will someday be located within the right-ofway.
All right-of-way permits issued by Public Works Director shall indicate the proper corridor for
the ROW-user's facilities. Any ROW-user whose facilities are currently in the right-of-way in a
position at a variance with the designated corridors shall, no later than at the time of next
reconstruction or excavation of the area where its facilities are located, move the facilities to its
assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by Public Works
Director for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life
of the facilities, public safety, user service needs and hardship to the ROW-user.
If, in the preparation and planning of a right-of-way project, the Public Works Director deems it
appropriate for a conduit to be constructed along, across or under the right-of-way, the Public
Works Director shall contact all appropriate ROW-users for their input on the planning and design
of such conduit. If a ROW-user desires to construct, maintain or operate facilities along such rightof-
way, the Public Works Director may require the ROW-user to use such conduit, and to
contribute to the expense of such conduit, provided, however, the ROW-user use of the conduit is
reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.
All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, other public improvements or
improvements of any kind damaged or removed by the ROW-user shall be fully repaired or
replaced promptly by the ROW-user at its sole expense and to the reasonable satisfaction of the
City. Upon determination by the Public Works Director that such repair or replacement is a public
safety matter, all such repair or replacement shall be commenced within twenty-four (24) hours of
notice from the City, or the Public Works Director may direct the City to make such repair or
replacement and bill the ROW-user for the City cost. The Public Works Director has the authority
to inspect the repair or replacement of the damage, and if necessary, to require the ROW-user to
do any necessary additional work.
All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use,
maintenance, and dismantling of a ROW-user's facilities in the right-of-way shall be in accordance
with applicable Federal, State and local law and regulations, including those promulgated by
national trade associations commonly associated with the service provided by the ROW-user. It is
understood that the standards established in this paragraph are minimum standards and the
requirements established or referenced in this Chapter may be in addition to or stricter than such
minimum standards. A ROW-user shall not construct or reconstruct any of its facilities located
upon, over, under or within the City right-of-way without first having submitted, in writing, a

regulations, unless such plans are based directly on nationally recognized codes, which are
appropriately cited, and attested to on the plans by the signature of an authorized official of the
organization applying for the permit.
The ROW-user shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures
necessary to provide accurate and complete on-site information regarding the nature and
horizontal and vertical location of its facilities located within the right-of-way, both underground and
overhead, when requested by the City or its authorized agent for a public improvement. Such
location and identification shall be at the sole expense of the ROW-user without any expense to
the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors.
The City shall have the authority to prohibit the use or occupancy of a specific portion of the rightof-
way by a ROW-user due to public health, safety or welfare considerations.
At no location shall any flush or ground surface-mounted fixtures be located more than five (5) feet
from a property line that abuts other private property unless agreed upon by the City.
Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Aldermen, the following shall govern: No flush or
above ground boxes or similar elements larger, wider, taller, or more numerous than existing
service provider installation unless agreed upon by the City through an alternative arrangement;
provided, however, no above ground box or similar element shall be larger than ten (10) inches
wide by ten (10) inches deep by twenty-eight (28) inches high in the right-of-way. Further, that
above ground boxes no larger than thirty-four (34) inches wide by thirty-four (34) inches high by
sixteen (16) inches deep may be allowed in public utility easements located at the side or rear
property lines of any lot so long as the box is located no closer to the street than within five (5) feet
of a building setback line (either platted or required by the zoning regulations); and provided,
further, that in approving a right-of-way permit, the City Clerk shall require that the box be located
in a public utility easement located in the rear yard whenever possible or, when not possible and
with the approval of the City, on public property that is within five (5) feet from a property line that
abuts private property.
Section 240.090. Facility Relocation.
[Ord. No. 1017, 8-1-2018]
The ROW-user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located in the right-of-way
as directed by the City for a public improvement or when reasonably required by the City by
reason of public health, safety and welfare. Such removal, relocation, or adjustment shall be
performed by the ROW-user at the ROW-user's expense without expense to the City, its
employees, agents, or authorized contractors and shall be specifically subject to rules, regulations
and schedules of the City pertaining to such. The ROW-user shall proceed with relocations at due
diligence upon notice by the City to begin relocation.
The ROW-user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located in a private
easement, as directed by the City, for a public improvement, at City expense, by moving such
facilities to areas within the expanded right-of-way or within remaining private easements or
remaining portions of such easements not condemned by nor disclaimed to the City to avoid
conflict with City construction and improvements. The ROW-user shall disclaim those parts of its
easements which lie within the expanded right-of-way. Should the City, in the future, elect to
require the ROW-user to again relocate its facilities to other areas within the expanded right-ofway,
the cost of any such future relocation shall be borne by the City.

ordinary right-of-way permit fee shall be waived.

Any excavation left open overnight on any thoroughfare or collector type street shall be securely
covered. The ROW-user assumes the sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, plates,
safety fencing and/or lights as required from the time of opening of the excavation until the
excavation is surfaced and opened for travel.
The Public Works Director, upon the review and approval of a plan and details for trimming trees
in the right-of-way, may grant permission by permit to any ROW-user to trim trees upon and
overhanging the right-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact
with the facilities of the ROW-user.
In the event the ROW-user severely disturbs or damages the root structure of any tree in the rightof-
way to the detriment of the health and safety of the tree, the ROW-user will be required to
remove and replace the tree at the ROW-user's cost. Further, in review of the ROW-user's plan,
the Public Works Director may require the ROW-user to directionally bore around any tree in the
right-of-way.
Upon the appropriate request of any person having satisfied City procedure and ordinances, the
ROW-user shall remove, raise, or lower its facilities temporarily to permit the moving of houses or
other structures. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering shall be paid by the
person requesting the same, and the ROW-user may require such payment in advance. The
ROW-user must be given not less than fifteen (15) days' written notice from the person detailing
the time and location of the moving operations, and not less than twenty-four (24) hours' advance

Section 240.110. Right-Of-Way Vacation.
[Ord. No. 1017, 8-1-2018]
If the City vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of the service provider, and if the
vacation does not require the relocation of the service provider's facilities, the City shall reserve, to
and for itself and all service providers having facilities in the vacated right-of-way, an easement for
the right to install, maintain and operate any facilities in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon
such vacated right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining or
repairing the same.
If the vacation requires the relocation of facilities; and
If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the service provider, the service provider must pay
the relocation costs.
If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the City, the service provider must pay the
relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the City and the service provider.

interest of public safety to do so. At such time, the City may take ownership and responsibility
of such vacated facilities left in place;
Provide information satisfactory to the City that the ROW-user's obligations for its facilities in
the right-of-way have been lawfully assumed by another authorized ROW-user; or
Submit to the City a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership of its facilities to the
City. If the ROW-user proceeds under this Section, the City may, at its option, purchase the
equipment, require the ROW-user, at its own expense, to remove it, or require the ROW-user
to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonable anticipated costs
to be incurred to remove the facilities.
Facilities of a ROW-user who fails to comply with this Section, and whose facilities remain unused
for two (2) years, shall be deemed to be abandoned after the City has made a good faith effort to
contact the ROW-user, unless the City receives confirmation that the ROW-user intends to use the
facilities. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies
or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, (a) abating the nuisance, (b) taking
possession and ownership of the facility and restoring it to a usable function, or (c) requiring the
removal of the facility by the ROW-user.
Section 240.130. Permit Requirement.
[Ord. No. 1017, 8-1-2018]
Except as otherwise provided, no ROW-user may excavate any right-of-way or conduct any repair,
construction, or reconstruction of facilities located within the right-of-way without first having
obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit. Failure to obtain the appropriate right-of-way permit
shall result in the assessment of a penalty equal to the amount of the permit fee.
There are two (2) exemptions to this provision:
Contractors working on the construction or reconstruction of public improvements; and
ROW-users performing routine service operations which do not require excavation in the
right-of-way and do not disrupt traffic for more than four (4) hours.
No person owning or occupying any land abutting on a public right-of-way shall construct,
maintain, or permit in or on the portion of the public right-of-way to which such land is adjacent,
any fixed structure, material or object without having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit.
A right-of-way permit is required for emergency situations. If due to an emergency it is necessary
for the ROW-user to immediately perform work in the right-of-way, and it is impractical for the
ROW-user to first get the appropriate permit, the work may be performed, and the required permit
shall be obtained as soon as possible during the next City working day.
No permittee may excavate the right-of-way beyond the date or dates specified in the right-of-way
permit unless the permittee:
Makes a supplementary application for another right-of-way permit before the expiration of the
initial permit; and
A new right-of-way permit or permit extension is granted.
Right-of-way permits issued shall be conspicuously displayed by the permittee at all times at the
indicated work site and shall be available for inspection by the Public Works Director, other City
employees and the public.

Maintenance Bond Requirement.
[Ord. No. 1017, 8-1-2018]

may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that it is self-insured and as such grantee has the
ability to provide coverage in an amount not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per
occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) in aggregate, to protect the City from and
against all claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury, bodily injury,
death or property damage occasioned by grantee, or alleged to so have been caused or occurred.
The permittee shall at all times during the term of the permit and for two (2) years thereafter,

whichever is greater, for a term consistent with the term of the permit plus two (2) additional years,
conditioned upon the permittee's faithful performance of the provisions, terms and conditions
conferred by this Chapter. An annual bond in an amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00)
automatically renewed yearly during this period shall satisfy the requirement of this Section. In the
event the City shall exercise its right to revoke the permit as granted herein, then the City shall be
entitled to recover under the terms of said bond the full amount of any loss occasioned.

The permittee shall not make any cut, excavation or grading of right-of-way other than excavations
necessary for emergency repairs without first securing a right-of-way permit.

manner.
The permittee shall, in the performance of any work required for the installation, repair,
maintenance, relocation and/or removal of any of its facilities, limit all excavations to those
excavations that are necessary for efficient operation.

complete the repair or installation.
The permittee shall notify the City no less than three (3) working days in advance of any
construction, reconstruction, repair, location or relocation of facilities which would require any
street closure or which reduces traffic flow to less than two (2) lanes of moving traffic for more than
four (4) hours. Except in the event of an emergency as reasonably determined by the permittee,
no such closure shall take place without notice and prior authorization from the City.
Non-emergency work on arterial and collector streets may not be accomplished during the hours

The work to be done under the right-of-way permit and the repair and restoration of the right-ofway
as required herein must be completed within the dates as specified in the permit. However, in
the event of circumstances beyond the control of the permittee or when work was prohibited by
unseasonable or unreasonable conditions, the Public Works Director may extend the date for
completion of the project upon receipt of a supplementary application for a permit extension.
All earth, materials, sidewalks, curbs, paving, crossing, utilities, public improvement or
improvements of any kind damaged or removed by the permittee shall be fully repaired or
replaced promptly by the permittee at its sole expense and the reasonable satisfaction of the City.
The Public Works Director has the authority to inspect the repair or replacement of the damage
and, if necessary, to require the permittee to do the additional necessary work. Notice of the
unsatisfactory restoration and the deficiencies found will be provided to the permittee and a
reasonable time not to exceed fifteen (15) days will be provided to allow for the deficiencies to be
corrected.
After any excavation, the permittee shall, at its expense, restore all portions of the right-of-way to
the same condition or better condition than it was prior, to the excavation thereof.

otherwise, at the expense of the permittee, and the permittee and its surety shall be liable to the
City for any and all excess cost assumed by the City by reason of such prosecution and
completion.
The permittee responsible for the excavation who leaves any debris in the right-of-way shall be
responsible for providing safety protection in accordance with the latest Edition of the Manual of
Uniform Traffic Control Devices and any applicable Federal or State requirement.
If an excavation cannot be back-filled immediately and left unattended, the permittee shall
securely and adequately cover the unfilled excavation. The permittee has sole responsibility for

opening of the excavation until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel.
In restoring the right-of-way, the permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for twenty-four
(24) months following its completion. During the twenty-four (24) months, the permittee shall, upon
notification from the Public Works Director, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary,
using any method as required by the Public Works Director. Said work shall be completed within a
reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days, of the receipt of notice from the Public
Works Director (not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting Force Majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable). In
the event the permittee is required to perform new restoration pursuant to the foregoing
guarantee, the Public Works Director shall have the authority to extend the guarantee period for
such new restoration for up to an additional twenty-four (24) months from the date of the new
restoration, if the Public Works Director determines any overt action by the permittee not to
comply with the conditions of the right-of-way permit and any restoration requirements.
The twenty-four (24) month guarantee period shall be applicable to failure of the pavement surface
as well as failure below the pavement surface.
Payment of an excavation fee shall not relieve the permittee of the obligation to complete the
necessary right-of-way restoration.

Section 240.230. Denial Of Permit.
[Ord. No. 1017, 8-1-2018]
The City Clerk may deny a permit or prohibit the use or occupancy of a specific portion of the
right-of-way to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety
and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way, or when necessary to protect the right-ofway

right-of-way;
The degree of compliance of the applicant with the terms and conditions of its franchise
ordinance, this Chapter, and other applicable ordinances and regulations;
The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the
use of that part of the right-of-way;
The balancing of costs of disruption to the public and damage to the right-of-way, against the

Section 240.240. Revocation Of Permit.
[Ord. No. 1017, 8-1-2018]
Permittees hold right-of-way permits issued pursuant to this Chapter as a privilege and not as a
right. The City reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without
refund of the permit fee, in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any law
or the right-of-way permit. A substantial breach shall, include, but not be limited to, the following:
The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the
perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the City or its citizens;
Any material misrepresentation of any fact in the permit application;
The failure to maintain the required bond or insurance;
The failure to complete the work in a timely manner;
The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to this Chapter;
Repeated traffic control violations; or
Failure to repair facilities damaged in the right-of-way.
If the City Clerk determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of any law or
condition placed on the right-of-way permit, the City Clerk shall make a written demand upon the
permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that the continued violation may be
cause for revocation of the permit, or legal action, if applicable. Further, a substantial breach as
stated above, will allow the City Clerk, in his/her discretion, to place additional or revised
conditions on the right-of-way permit, specifically related to the manner in which the breach is
cured by the permittee. Within five (5) calendar days of receiving notification of the breach,
permittee shall contact the City Clerk with a plan, acceptable to the City Clerk, for correction of the
breach. Permittee's failure to contact the City Clerk, permittee's failure to submit an acceptable
plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall be cause for
immediate revocation of the right-of-way permit.
If a right-of-way permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the City for the City's
reasonable costs, including administrative costs, restoration costs and the costs of collection and
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and
suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage

competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of the ROW-user, any agent, officer,
director, or their respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while
installing, repairing or maintaining facilities in a public right-of-way. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to prevent the City, or any agent from participating in the defense of any litigation by their
own counsel at their own expense. Such participation shall not under any circumstances relieve
the ROW-user from its duty to defend against liability or its duty to pay and judgment entered
against the City, or its agents.
If a ROW-user and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability
shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this State without, however,
waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under State or Federal law. This
Section is solely for the benefit of the City and ROW-user and does not create or grant any
rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity.

shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
Green indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the
same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow,
may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
Steady yellow indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in Section 315.070, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian
shall then start to cross the roadway.
Steady red indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except as provided in Subsection
(A)(3)(b) below.

intersection in obedience to a red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a
right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as
directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the State Highways and

pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this Section shall be applicable except as to those provisions
which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

appropriate symbols are in place, such signals shall indicate as follows:
WALK: Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the
signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
WAIT or DON'T WALK: No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such
signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his/her crossing on the walk signal
shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone while the wait signal is showing.
Section 315.080. Flashing Signals.
Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal, it shall
require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes,
drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a
limit line when marked or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to
proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent
flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with
caution.
This Section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles
approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules as set forth in Section
335.090 of this Title.
Section 315.090. Lane Direction Control Signals.

Upon a roadway which is divided into three (3) lanes, a vehicle shall not be driven in the
center lane except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway ahead is
clearly visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in preparation
for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to traffic moving in
the direction the vehicle is proceeding and is signposted to give notice of such allocation.
Upon all highways any vehicle proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic thereon

The driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass
to the left thereof at a safe distance and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway
until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle; and
Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the driver of an overtaken
vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking vehicle and shall not increase the
speed of such driver's vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle.
Passing To The Right Of Another Vehicle.
The driver of a motor vehicle may overtake and pass to the right of another vehicle only under
the following conditions:
When the vehicle overtaken is making or about to make a left turn;
Upon a City street with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for two (2) or more
lanes of vehicles in each direction;
Upon a one-way street.
The driver of a motor vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle upon the right only
under the foregoing conditions when such movement may be made in safety. In no event
shall such movement be made by driving off the paved or main traveled portion of the
roadway. The provisions of this Subsection shall not relieve the driver of a slow-moving
vehicle from the duty to drive as closely as practicable to the right-hand edge of the roadway.
Except when a roadway has been divided into three (3) traffic lanes, no vehicle shall be driven to
the left side of the center line of a highway or public road in overtaking and passing another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction unless such left side is clearly visible and is free of
oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be
completely made without interfering with the safe operation of any vehicle approaching from the
opposite direction or any vehicle overtaken.
No vehicle shall at any time be driven to the left side of the roadway under the following
conditions:
When approaching the crest of a grade or upon a curve of the highway where the driver's
view is obstructed within such distance as to create a hazard in the event another vehicle

safety and then only after the giving of an appropriate signal in the manner provided herein.
An operator or driver when stopping, or when checking the speed of the operator's vehicle if
the movement of other vehicles may reasonably be affected by such checking of speed, shall
extend such operator's arm at an angle below horizontal so that the same may be seen in the
rear of the vehicle.

An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the left shall extend such operator's arm
in a horizontal position so that the same may be seen in the rear of the vehicle and shall slow
down and approach the intersecting highway so that the left side of the vehicle shall be as
near as practicable to the center line of the highway along which the operator is proceeding

The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by a signal
light or signal device in good mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would
not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by
such light or device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand
and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds
twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to
the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen
(14) feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles. The provisions of this
Subsection shall not apply to any trailer which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand
signals of the operator or of the signaling device upon the vehicle pulling such trailer;
provided, further, that the provisions of this Section as far as mechanical devices on vehicles
so constructed that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of
such vehicle as above provided shall only be applicable to new vehicles registered within this
State after the first day of January 1954.
Section 340.200. Stopping for School Bus.

school bus which has stopped on the highway for the purpose of receiving or discharging any
school children and whose driver has in the manner prescribed by law given the signal to stop
shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus
resumes motion or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State Law:
Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading." Each school bus subject to the provisions of Sections
304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device
approved by the State Board of Education which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.
Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school system which has a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted
entirely in front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels, and which is used
for the transportation of school children shall be equipped with a crossing control arm. The
crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from
the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right side of the
front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri school children
who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.

drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district has the
authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or
more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to
stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a
stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers
should proceed with caution and, in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the
school bus with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at
any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided
by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2)
lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the
road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred
(500) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder
and a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in
each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such
time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or
overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite
direction on a highway containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading
zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or controlled access highway at a point where
pedestrians are not permitted to cross the roadway.
Section 340.210. Right-of-Way at Intersection — Signs at
Intersections.
The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to a vehicle which
has entered the intersection from a different highway, provided however, there is no form of traffic
control at such intersection.
When two (2) vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on
the right. This Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from opposite
directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is attempting to or is making a left turn.
The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close
thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
The driver of a vehicle intending to make a left turn into an alley, private road or driveway shall
yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction when the making of
such left turn would create a traffic hazard.
The driver of a vehicle about to enter or cross a highway from an alley, building or any private road
or driveway shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching on the highway to be entered.
The City may, on any section of road where construction or major maintenance operations are
being effected, fix a speed limit in such areas by posting of appropriate signs, and the operation of
a motor vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so posted shall be deemed prima facie
evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a violation of Section 340.160.

operate the vehicle, or authorize any other person to operate the vehicle registered, or maintain
registration of a motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle upon the streets
or the alleys of this City unless the owner maintains the financial responsibility as required in this
Section which conforms to the requirements of the laws of this State. No non-resident shall
operate or permit another person to operate in this State a motor vehicle registered to such nonresident
unless the non-resident maintains the financial responsibility which conforms to the
requirements of the laws of the non-resident's State of residence. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained
financial responsibility unless such person has financial responsibility which covers the person's
operation of the other's vehicle. However, no owner or non-resident shall be in violation of this
Subsection if he/she fails to maintain financial responsibility on a motor vehicle which is inoperable
or being stored and not in operation.
For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall mean the ability to respond in
damages for liability on account of accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said
financial responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, in the
amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1)
person in any one (1) accident and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the amount of fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of two (2) or more persons in
any one (1) accident and in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to
or destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.

dates of the policy and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five (5) digits
of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if the insurance policy covers five (5) or
more motor vehicles shall be satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance
identification card; or

that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the officer's or inspector's duties.

the time the Peace Officer wrote the citation.

Penalty — Confiscation of False Evidence.
No person shall display evidence of insurance to a Law Enforcement Officer knowing there is no valid
liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle as required pursuant to this Article or knowing the
evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance. If
the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator for displaying invalid
evidence of insurance, the Officer shall confiscate the evidence for presentation in court. Any person
convicted of violating this Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.

Insurance Card.

Crime Inquiry And Inspection Report. Upon the towing of any abandoned property pursuant to
Section 385.030 or under authority of a Law Enforcement Officer or local governmental agency
pursuant to Section 217.040, the City Police Department, where it authorized such towing or was
properly notified by another governmental agency of such towing, shall promptly make an inquiry
with the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and any statewide Missouri law enforcement
computer system to determine if the abandoned property has been reported as stolen and shall
enter the information pertaining to the towed property into the statewide law enforcement
computer system. If the abandoned property is not claimed within ten (10) working days of the
towing, the tower who has online access to the Department of Revenue's records shall make an
inquiry to determine the abandoned property owner and lienholder, if any, of record. In the event
that the records of the Department of Revenue fail to disclose the name of the owner or any
lienholder of record, the tower shall comply with the requirements of Subsection (3) of Section
304.156, RSMo. If the tower does not have online access, the City Police Department shall submit
a crime inquiry and inspection report to the Missouri Director of Revenue. The City Police
Department shall also provide one (1) copy of the report to the storage facility and one (1) copy to
the towing company. A towing company that does not have online access to the Department's
records and that is in possession of abandoned property after ten (10) working days shall report
such fact to the City Police Department. The crime inquiry and inspection report shall be designed
by the Director of Revenue and shall include the following:

The date, place and reason for the towing of the abandoned property;

enforcement computer system, and any other similar system which has titling and registration
information to determine if the abandoned property had been stolen. This information shall be
entered only by the City Police Department;
The signature and printed name of the Law Enforcement Officer authorizing the tow;
The name of the towing company, the signature and printed name of the towing operator, and
an indicator disclosing whether the tower has online access to the Department's records; and

interest of record, may reclaim it from the towing company upon proof of ownership or valid
security interest of record and payment of all reasonable charges for the towing and storage of the

Notice To Owner/Tow Lien Claim. Any towing company which comes into possession of
abandoned property pursuant to this Chapter and who claims a lien for recovering, towing or
storing abandoned property shall give notice to the title owner and to all persons claiming a lien
thereon, as disclosed by the records of the Missouri Department of Revenue or of a corresponding
agency in any other State. The towing company shall notify the owner and any lienholder within
ten (10) business days of the date of mailing indicated on the notice sent by the Missouri
Department of Revenue pursuant to Section 304.156, RSMo., by certified mail, return receipt

towing company that the records of the Department of Revenue fail to disclose the name of the
owner or any lienholder of record, the towing company shall attempt to locate documents or other
evidence of ownership on or within the abandoned property itself. The towing company must
certify that a physical search of the abandoned property disclosed no ownership documents were
found and a good faith effort has been made. For purposes of this Section, "good faith effort"
means that the following checks have been performed by the company to establish the prior State
of registration and title:
Check of the abandoned property for any type of license plates, license plate record,
temporary permit, inspection sticker, decal or other evidence which may indicate a State of
possible registration and title;
Check the law enforcement report for a license plate number or registration number if the
abandoned property was towed at the request of a law enforcement agency;
Check the tow ticket/report of the tow truck operator to see if a license plate was on the
abandoned property at the beginning of the tow, if a private tow; and
If there is no address of the owner on the impound report, check the law enforcement report
to see if an out-of-state address is indicated on the driver license information.

Section 385.050. Maximum Charges.
A towing company may only assess reasonable storage charges for abandoned property towed
without the consent of the owner. Reasonable storage charges shall not exceed the charges for
vehicles which have been towed with the consent of the owner on a negotiated basis. Storage
charges may be assessed only for the time in which the towing company complies with the
procedural requirements of this Chapter.
The Board of Aldermen may from time to time establish maximum reasonable towing, storage and
other charges which can be imposed by towing and storage companies operating within the City,
and which are consistent with this Chapter and with Sections 304.155 to 304.158, RSMo. Any
violation of said established maximum charges shall be deemed a violation of this Section of the
Code and shall be punishable pursuant to Section 100.220.
A towing company may impose a charge of not more than one-half (1/2) of the regular towing
charge for the towing of abandoned property at the request of the owner of private real property or
that owner's agent pursuant to this Chapter if the owner of the abandoned property or the owner's
agent returns to the abandoned property before it is removed from the private real property. The
regular towing charge may only be imposed after the abandoned property has been removed from
the property and is in transit.

Section 400.010. Citation.
[R.O. 2003 §400.010; Ord. No. 392 Art. I §1, 11-5-1981]
This Chapter in pursuance of the authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri in
Chapter 89, RSMo., shall be a part of the comprehensive plan for the City of Buckner and shall be
known as the "Zoning Code" and may be cited as such.

The objective of the Zoning Code is to establish standards and policies concerning development
of land which may be used in helping to achieve the goals of the Buckner Comprehensive Plan.
Goals for development are generally expressed through programs and policies on such matters
as: land use, taxation, capital improvements, urban redevelopment, public services and other
issues which require public decisions.
It is intended that the standards and policies established in the Zoning Code reflect a sense of
value toward the physical environment, including the value of appearance and congenial
arrangement for the conduct of trade, industry, agriculture, residence and other uses of land

shall be made with reasonable consideration to the character of the district, its peculiar suitability
to its location and its relationship to surrounding uses.
Notwithstanding any other provision of Chapter 400 known as the "Zoning Code" which might be
interpreted to permit same, it is hereby declared that no prison, jail, detention facility or holding
facility for prisoners shall be constructed within the City limits of the City of Buckner unless the
issue is put before a vote of the citizens of the City of Buckner and receives a favorable vote of

which is needed to allow the City of Buckner Police Department to detain or hold arrested
individuals for a period of time, no longer than twenty-four (24) hours.

[R.O. 2003 §400.390; Ord. No. 392 Art. VI §4, 11-5-1981; Ord. No. 658 §1, 4-4-2002]
The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
Powers Relative To Interpretations. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an
error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by any administrative official
in the interpretation and enforcement of this Chapter.
Powers Relative To Special Exceptions. To hear and decide, upon appeal, applications for a
special exception to the terms of this Chapter under the following circumstances and
conditions:
To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot in
single ownership as shown of record.
To interpret the provisions of this Chapter where the street layout actually on the ground
varies from the street layout as shown on the map fixing the several districts, which map
is on file in the City offices and made a part of this Chapter by reference.
Powers Relative To Non-Use Variances.
A variance that does not have the effect of allowing a use that the underlying zoning
district prohibits may be granted by the Board of Adjustment, where:
By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of
property at the time of the original adoption of this Chapter, November 5, 1981; or
By reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary or
exceptional situations or conditions of a specific piece of property which condition is
not generally prevalent in the area, the strict application of this Chapter would result
in peculiar exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional undue hardship upon the
owner of such property.
The Board of Adjustment is hereby empowered to authorize upon an appeal in specific
cases a variance from the terms of the zoning ordinances of the City in accordance with
the criteria, conditions and other provisions of this Chapter, as will not be contrary to the
public interest, so that the spirit of the ordinance will be observed and substantial justice
will be done.
The Board of Adjustment may establish such requirements relative to such property as
would carry out the purpose and intent of this Chapter.
Powers Relative To Use Variances. A variance that would have the effect of allowing a use
that the underlying zoning district prohibits may be granted by the Board of Adjustment upon
an affirmative finding that all of the following conditions have been met:
Purpose. Recognizing that certain uses may be desirable when located in the community,
but that these uses may be incompatible with other uses permitted in the particular
zoning district, however, when such use is found to be in the interest of the public health,
safety, morals and general welfare of the community, may be permitted, except as
otherwise specified, in any zoning district from which they are prohibited.
The Board of Adjustment may, within the specifications herein provided, permit such
buildings, structures or uses where requested, provided that the public safety, morals and
general welfare will not be adversely affected, and that necessary safeguards will be
provided for the protection of surrounding property, persons and neighborhood values. In

this regard, the Board of Adjustment may impose reasonable conditions on the approval
of a use variance.
Any use not specifically otherwise addressed in this Code shall be subject to the
requirements of this Section so that a use variance is required before such use begins.
Unless otherwise specified in the particular variance, a use variance shall be allowed to
continue, unless specified otherwise as a condition of its authorization, as long as all
conditions placed on it are met; however, if that particular use ceases to exist for a period
of six (6) months, it will forfeit its use variance and will not be allowed to exist again
unless a new application is made and a new use variance approved.
In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all
technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other Sections of
this Chapter, and the following:
Criteria.
The danger to life and property due to the approval of the development;
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
The necessity to the facility on the particular location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan;
The safety of access to the property for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
Hardship to the applicant if the application is denied; and
The costs of providing governmental services, including maintenance and repair of
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets
and bridges.
Conditions.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures. As the lot size increases beyond
the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of
structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State inventory of
historic places or local inventory of historic places upon determination, provided the
proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;

A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased or
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based
on a case-by-case analysis of the buildings unique circumstances. Variances
granted shall meet the above conditions as well as those criteria set forth in
Subsection (A)(5)(a) of this Section.
The Board of Adjustment may, in conformance with the provisions of this Chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer
from whom the appeal is taken. In considering all appeals from rulings made under this

upon other factors relating to the public health, safety, comfort, morals and general
welfare of the people of the City of Buckner. It is further provided that in exercising its

to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such administrative
office or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which the Board of
Adjustment is required to pass or to effect any variation in this Chapter.

An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from
whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall have
been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would in his opinion
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court of
record on application or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause
shown.
The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public
notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a
reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. At

The Board of Adjustment shall not rehear an appeal once decided unless it is shown by the
appellant that all pertinent facts of the case were not brought before the Board of Adjustment at
the public hearing, and that for some reason he was prevented from presenting such facts, or that
the facts of the case have materially changed since the public hearing.

any neighborhood organization as defined in Section 32.105, RSMo., representing such person, or any
officer, department, board or bureau of the City of Buckner may present to the Circuit Court of Jackson
County a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying
the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after
the filing of the decision in the office of the Board of Adjustment. Upon the presentation of such
petition, the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the Board of Adjustment to review such
decision of the Board of Adjustment and shall prescribe therein the time within which a return thereto
must be made and served upon the realtor's attorney, but shall not be less than ten (10) days and may
be extended by the court. The allowance of the writ shall not stay proceedings upon the decision
appealed from, but the court may, on application, on notice to the Board and on due cause shown,
grant a restraining order. The Board of Adjustment shall not be required to return the original papers
acted upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions
thereof as may be called for by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth other facts as may be
pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be verified. If, upon
the hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the
matter, it may take additional evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and
report the same to the court with his finding of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part
of the proceedings upon which a determination of the court shall be made. The court may reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review. Costs shall not be allowed
against the Board unless it shall appear to the court that it acted with gross negligence or in bad faith
or with malice in making the decision appealed from.

[R.O. 2003 §400.420; Ord. No. 392 Art. VII §1, 11-5-1981]
This Chapter shall be enforced by a Building Inspector appointed by the City of Buckner. It shall be
a violation of this Chapter for any person to change or permit the change in the use of land or
buildings or structures or to erect, alter, move or improve any building or structure until a building
permit or certificate of occupancy has been obtained under the following conditions:
Building Permits. Whenever any structure or building is to be improved in an amount
exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), or erected, moved, or structurally altered, a building
permit shall be obtained from the City Clerk upon approval of the Building Inspector. The City
Clerk shall require every applicant for a building permit to furnish the following information:
A plot plan, drawn to scale, showing the exact size, shape, and dimensions of the lot to
be built upon, the exact size and location on the lot of all existing buildings and
structures, and the exact size and location on the lot of the structure or building proposed
to be repaired, altered, erected or moved, and the size, arrangement, number of parking
stalls, movement of vehicles and ingress and egress drives for all off-street parking and
loading facilities.
A declaration of the existing and intended use of each existing and proposed building or
structure on the lot and the number of families and housekeeping units which each
existing and proposed building is designed to accommodate.
Additional information relating to the proposed improvement needed to determine
compliance with these regulations.
A survey prepared by a land surveyor or engineer registered in the State of Missouri of
the boundaries and elevation of the lot on which the improvement is proposed to be
located.
Certificate Of Occupancy. No change shall be made in the use of any land or building or
structure after November 5, 1981, until a certificate of occupancy is obtained from the Building
Inspector certifying that all of the provisions of this Chapter are complied with. Whenever a
building permit is issued for the erection of a new building or structure, an occupancy permit
shall not be required, except where the use of the building or structure is changed from that
for which the permit is issued or where the intended use is not clearly stated on the building
permit.
Section 400.450. Procedure for Authorizing Uses Permitted on
Review.
[R.O. 2003 §400.430; Ord. No. 392 Art. VII §2, 11-5-1981]
The uses listed under the various districts herein as "Uses Permitted on Review" are so classified
because they more intensely dominate the area in which they are located than do other uses
permitted in the district; however, the nature of such uses makes it desirable that they be
permitted to locate therein. The following procedure is established to integrate properly the uses
permitted on review with the other land uses located in the district. These uses shall be reviewed
and authorized or rejected under the following procedure:
An application shall be filed with the City Planning Commission for review. Said application
shall show the location and intended use of the site, the names of all the property owners and
existing land uses within one hundred eighty-five (185) feet, and any other material pertinent
to the request which the City Planning Commission may require.
The City Planning Commission shall hold one (1) or more public hearings thereon.

After the Planning Commission of the City of Buckner adopts a City Plan which includes at least a
Major Street Plan or progresses in its City Planning to the making and adoption of a Major Street
Plan, and files a certified copy of the Major Street Plan in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of

Article VI. Erosion and Sediment Control and Grading
Section 405.350. Findings; Purpose.
[R.O. 2003 §405.350; Ord. No. 734 §3, 7-7-2005]
Soil is most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water during the construction process. Eroded soil
endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat
for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches
and the dredging of lakes. Clearing and grading during construction causes the loss of native
vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat and a healthy living environment for the
citizens of Buckner.
The purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to
the environment and promote the public welfare by effectively minimizing soil erosion and
sedimentation during land development, building, landscaping or any other type of land
disturbance in the City of Buckner. Further, it provides builders, developers and property owners
with soil erosion and sedimentation control standards and regulations.
Facilitation of the regulations and standards contained herein shall accomplish the following:
Establish standards for soil erosion and sediment control.
Minimize soil erosion and sedimentation during land development, building, landscaping or
other land-disturbing activities.
Minimize pollution of streams, ponds and lakes.
Encourage management of natural resources.

[R.O. 2003 §415.010; Ord. No. 659 §1, 4-4-2002; Ord. No. 970, 7-16-2015]
The Legislature of the State of Missouri has, in Section 79.110, RSMo., delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health,
safety and general welfare. Therefore, the Board of Aldermen of the City of Buckner, Missouri, ordains
as follows.
Section 415.020. Findings of Fact.
[R.O. 2003 §415.020; Ord. No. 659 §1, 4-4-2002; Ord. No. 749 §1, 8-3-2006; Ord. No. 970, 7-16-2015]
Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of
Buckner, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood
heights and velocities; and
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a
series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on
the particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could
be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on
the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Jackson County dated
January 20, 2017, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
[Ord. No. 992, 12-1-2016]
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis
of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more
than one (1) foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that
would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still
subject to inundation by the base flood.
Section 415.030. Statement of Purpose.
[R.O. 2003 §415.030; Ord. No. 659 §1, 4-4-2002; Ord. No. 970, 7-16-2015]
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to
minimize those losses described in Article I, Section 415.020(A); to establish or maintain the

60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding or
cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.

[R.O. 2003 §415.160; Ord. No. 659 §1, 4-4-2002; Ord. No. 970, 7-16-2015]
In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A Zones and AE Zones where base flood
elevation data have been provided, as set forth in Article IV, Section 415.140(B), the following
provisions are required:
Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to one (1) foot above base flood elevation.
Nonresidential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base
flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall certify that the standards of this Subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in Article III, Section 415.120(A)(9).
Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas
below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings
may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided
that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and numbered A Zones and AE
Zones on the community's FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices that
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be
elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered or numbered A
Zones and AE Zones on the community's FIRM on sites outside of a manufactured home park or
subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood are
required to be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured
home is elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation and be securely attached to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured
home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A Zones and AE Zones on the
community's FIRM, that are not subject to the provisions of Subsection (B) of this Section, are
required to be elevated so that either:
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at one (1) foot above the base flood level; or
The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation
elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height
above grade and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement.

[R.O. 2003 §415.190; Ord. No. 659 §1, 4-4-2002; Ord. No. 970, 7-16-2015]
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article II, Section 415.040, are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the
area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any
point.
The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development, within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
If Subsection (A)(2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article IV.
In unnumbered A Zones, the community shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State or other sources as
set forth in Article IV, Section 415.140(B).

[R.O. 2003 §415.250; Ord. No. 659 §1, 4-4-2002; Ord. No. 970, 7-16-2015]
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing Subsections (B) through (F)
below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, the State inventory of historic places or local inventory of
historic places upon determination, provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's
continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

Section 415.240. Conditions for Approving Variances for
Accessory Structures.
[R.O. 2003 §415.260; Ord. No. 659 §1, 4-4-2002; Ord. No. 970, 7-16-2015; Ord. No. 992, 12-1-2016]
Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case by
case analysis of the buil¬ding's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following
conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Article V, Sections 415.220 and
415.230 of this Chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the one-hundred-year flood and the threat to public
health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory
structures that are constructed at grade and wet-floodproofed.
Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in
Zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exteri¬or and interior building
components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes,
flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in
accordance with Article IV, Section 415.140(D)(2) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure in accordance with Article IV, Section 415.140(D)(1) of this
Chapter. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific
flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact
forces.
Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood
elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed
enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with
Article IV, Section 415.140(D)(4) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening
requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the onehundred-
year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters in accordance with Article IV, Section 415.150(A)(3) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway
encroachment provisions of Article IV, Section 415.170(A)(2) of this Chapter. No variances
may be issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway, if any increase in
flood levels would result during the one-hundred-year flood.
Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.
No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be
paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official
that: (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in

Article IV. Local Zoning Authority Over Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities
Section 425.220. Conditions to Local Zoning Requirements.
[R.O. 2003 §425.220; Ord. No. 557, 4-10-1997]
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires local government zoning decisions about wireless
telecommunications facilities to satisfy the following five (5) conditions:
Local zoning requirements may not unreasonably discriminate among wireless
telecommunications providers that compete against one another.
Local zoning requirements may not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of
wireless telecommunications service.
A local government must act on a request for permission to place or construct wireless
telecommunications facilities within a reasonable period of time.
Any City or Zoning Board decision denying permission to install or construct wireless
telecommunications facilities must be in writing and must be based on evidence in a written
record before the Council or Board.
As long as wireless telecommunications facilities meet standards to be set by the FCC, a
local government may not base any decision denying a request to construct such facilities on
the ground that radio frequency emissions from the facilities will be harmful to the
environment or health of residents.
Section 425.230. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 1248 §1, 9-20-2012]
Statement Of Purpose. The general purpose of this Chapter is to regulate the placement,
construction and modification of telecommunications towers, support structures, and antennas in
order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while at the same time not
unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications
marketplace in the City of Buckner. Specifically, this Chapter is intended to:
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and
systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of Buckner;
Minimize adverse visual impacts of wireless communications facilities through careful design,
siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques;
Maximize the use of existing and new support structures so as to minimize the need to
construct new or additional facilities;
Maximize the co-location of facilities on any new support structures and facilitate the fewest
and least visible new support structures capable of achieving these objectives;

Ensure that any new support structure is located in an area compatible with the neighborhood
or surrounding community to the extent possible; and
Ensure that regulation of wireless communications facilities does not have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and does not unreasonably
discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service.
Applicability. Notwithstanding any ordinance to the contrary, the procedures set forth in this section
shall be applicable to all wireless communications facilities existing or installed, built or modified
after the effective date of this Chapter to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Section 425.260. General Requirements.
[Ord. No. 1248 §1, 9-20-2012]
The requirements set forth in this Chapter shall be applicable to all wireless communications
facilities within the City installed, built or modified after the effective date of this Chapter to the full
extent permitted by law.
Principal Or Incidental Use. Wireless communications facilities may be either a principal use
in all zoning districts or an incidental use to institutional or nonresidential uses, subject to any
applicable requirement relating to yard or setback. An incidental use subject to a leasehold
interest of a person other than the lot owner may be approved for a tower only if the leasehold
area separately meets all requirements for a separate subdivided lot, including dedicated
access, parking, and lot size, applicable to a primary use in the district in which the use is
proposed.
Building Codes, Safety Standards And Zoning Compliance. Wireless communications
facilities shall be constructed and maintained in compliance with all standards contained in
applicable State and local building codes. A certified engineer's structural report shall be
required with each application, unless waived upon application to the Director stating why
such report is unnecessary to the specific application and a determination in the discretion of
the Director approving such statement. In addition to any other approvals required by this
Chapter, no wireless communication facility or portion thereof shall be erected, replaced, or
expanded prior to receipt of a certificate of zoning compliance and the issuance of a building
permit. For all sites located within a Historic Preservation District, a certificate of
appropriateness shall also be required.
Regulatory Compliance. All wireless communications facilities shall meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC and any other local, State or Federal agency with
the authority to regulate wireless communications facilities, and including all required
licenses, permits and taxes applicable to such structure and/or modification. Should such
standards or regulations be amended, then the owner shall bring such devices and structure
into compliance with the revised standards or regulations within the time period mandated by
the controlling agency. No approval for any placement, construction or modification of any
wireless communications facilities permitted by this Chapter shall be granted for any applicant
having an uncured violation of this Chapter, any zoning regulation regarding the lot on which
the structure is proposed, or any other governmental regulatory, licensing, or tax requirement
applicable to such antenna or structures within the City.
Security. All wireless communications facilities shall be protected from unauthorized access
by appropriate security measures. A description of proposed security measures shall be
provided as part of any application to install, build or modify wireless communications
facilities. Additional measures may be required as a condition of the issuance of a building

permit or administrative permit as deemed necessary by the Director or by the Board of
Aldermen in the case of a conditional use permit.
Lighting. Antennas and support structures shall not be lighted unless required by the FAA or
other State or Federal agency with authority to regulate, in which case a description of the
required lighting scheme will be made a part of the application to install, build or modify the
antennas or support structure. Lighting may also be approved as a consistent component of a
disguised support structure. Equipment cabinets and shelters may have lighting only as
approved by the Director or Board of Aldermen on the approved site plan.
Advertising. Except for a disguised support structure in the form of an otherwise lawfully
permitted sign, the placement of advertising on wireless communications facilities is
prohibited other than identification signage of not greater than one (1) square foot on ground
equipment.
Design.
Color. Subject to the requirements of the FAA or any applicable State or Federal agency,
towers and attachments shall be painted a neutral color consistent with the natural or
built environment of the site. Unpainted galvanized steel support structures are not
permitted.
Ground Equipment. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall have an exterior finish
compatible with the natural or built environment of the site and shall also comply with any
design guidelines as may be applicable to the particular zoning district in which the
facility is located. All equipment shall be either placed underground, contained in a single
shelter or cabinet, or wholly concealed within a building or approved walled compounds.
Antenna Design. Antennas attached to a disguised support structure or tower shall be
contained within the disguised support structure or within or mounted flush on the surface
of the tower to which they are mounted. Antennas attached to an existing building or
structure shall be of a color identical to the surface to which they are mounted. All
antennas shall be designed to be disguised and maximally concealed on or within the
support structure. Exposed antennas on "crow's nest" or other visible platforms or
extensions are prohibited.
Height. Support structures shall be no taller than necessary and shall not exceed the
height limitation of any airport overlay zone as may be adopted by the City or other
regulatory agency. Support structures may exceed underlying zoning district height
restrictions for buildings and structures only where shown to be necessary, provided that
no reasonable alternative exists. District height restrictions shall be considered by the
City in determining the appropriateness of the design and location of the application
under the applicable standards for approval.
Monopole Design. All towers shall be of a monopole design. Lattice, guyed towers or
other non-monopole tower designs shall not be permitted.
Compound Walls/Landscaping. All towers shall be surrounded by a minimum of six-foothigh
decorative wall constructed of brick, stone or comparable masonry materials and a
landscape strip of not less than ten (10) feet in width and planted with materials, which
will provide a visual barrier to a minimum height of six (6) feet. The landscape strip shall
be exterior to any security wall. In lieu of the required wall and landscape strip, an
alternative means of screening may be approved by the Director, or by the Board of
Aldermen in the case of a conditional use permit, upon demonstration by the applicant
that an equivalent degree of visual screening will be achieved. Landscaping or other
improvements may be required for disguised support structures if needed to implement
an approved disguise.

Setbacks. All towers, support structures, and related structures, fences and walls shall be
separated from the property line of any adjacent property zoned for a residential use at
least a distance equal to the height of the support structure, and shall be separated from
all other adjacent property lines at least a distance equal to one-half (1/2) of the height of
the support structure.
Storage. Vehicle or outdoor storage on any support structure site is prohibited, unless
otherwise permitted by the zoning.
Parking. On-site parking for periodic maintenance and service shall be provided at all
antenna or support structure locations consistent with the underlying zoning district and
the type of antenna or support structure approval granted.
Shared Use.
Existing Support Structures. Prior to the issuance of any permit to alter or modify any
support structure existing on the effective date of this Chapter, the owner shall provide to
the City a written and notarized agreement committing to make such support structure
available for use by others subject to reasonable technical limitations and reasonable
financial terms. Technical limitations regarding disguised support structures shall include
limitations as are necessary to maintain the requirements of a disguised support
structure. The willful and knowing failure of a structure owner to agree to shared use or to
negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be unlawful and shall, among other
remedies of the City, be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same owner to
install, build, or modify wireless communications facilities within the City.
Support Structure Inventories. Prior to the issuance of any permit to install, build or
modify any support structure, such applicant shall furnish the Director an inventory of: (1)
all support structures owned or controlled by such applicant and by the proposed
antenna user (if the proposed antenna user is different from the Applicant); and (2) all
towers owned by any person located within one and one-half (1 1/2) miles of the
proposed structure. The inventory shall include the structure or antenna reference name
or number, the street location, latitude and longitude, structure type, height, type and
mounting height of existing antennas and an assessment of available ground space for
the placement of additional equipment shelters.
Shared Use Required For New Support Structures. Any new support structure approved
at a height of sixty (60) feet AGL (above ground level) or higher shall be designed and
constructed to accommodate at least one additional user unless a larger number is
indicated by the response to the notification provisions herein. A written agreement
committing to shared use as required by Subsection (A)(8)(a) and a report describing the
support structure's ability to support co-locations shall be submitted by the applicant. The
willful and knowing failure of the owner of a support structure built for shared use to
negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be unlawful and shall be a violation of
this Chapter and, among other remedies of the City, shall be cause for the withholding of
future permits to the same owner or applicant to install, build or modify wireless
communications facilities within the City. The Director may waive this requirement for
disguised support structures if the applicant submits a written request demonstrating that
compliance cannot be achieved without violating one or more of the definitional
requirements of a disguised support structure.
Notice Of Support Structure Applications. Prior to any application for the construction of a
new support structure, a copy of the application or a summary containing the height,
design, location and type and frequency of antennas shall be delivered by certified mail
to all known potential tower users within City, including but not limited to all companies
providing wireless Internet and commercial mobile radio services in the City, and such
other potential users, if any, if identified on a schedule maintained by the Director. Proof
of such delivery shall be documented by the applicant with the application to the City. The

Director may establish a form required to be used for such notifications and establish
other procedures consistent with and as may facilitate compliance with this Chapter. The
Director shall, before deciding on the application or forwarding it to the Planning and
Zoning Commission or Board of Aldermen for review, allow all persons receiving notice at
least fifteen (15) calendar days to respond to the City and the applicant and request that
the party receiving notice be permitted to share the proposed tower or locate within one
(1) mile of such area. The failure of the receiving party to use this process or respond to
any such notice shall be considered cause for denying requests by such party for new
support structures.
Appeal Of Shared Use Violations. Any party seeking shared use of a support structure
subject to this provision shall, after responding to notice of an application, negotiate with
the applicant for such use. The applicant may on a legitimate and reasonable business
basis choose between multiple requests for shared use on the same support structure,
and may reject any request where legitimate technical obstacles cannot be reasonably
overcome or where the party requesting shared use will not agree to reasonable financial
terms. Any party believing that the applicant has breached its duty to negotiate in good
faith for shared use shall immediately notify the applicant and the Director in writing. The
Director may reject the application upon a finding that shared use has been improperly
denied. A notice of breach of duty shall explain the precise basis for the claim and shall
be accompanied by payment of an administrative review fee deposit of two thousand five
hundred dollars ($2,500.00) to the City to be used to offset the cost of review. After the
applicant's receipt of the notice, the applicant shall have ten (10) calendar days to
provide a written submission to the Director responding to the alleged violation of the
shared use requirement. If deemed necessary by the Director, he/she may engage, at the
cost of the party alleging the violation, a neutral, qualified technical consultant to provide
an opinion on feasibility or costs of the shared use request. If the Director receives a
notice alleging a violation of the shared use requirement, the time for a decision on an
administrative permit is automatically extended for up to thirty (30) days until the Director
has determined that the applicant has complied. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
create a cause of action for relief against the City or entitlement to any relief, process or
enforcement other than review by the City as provided herein. An application for a new
support structure shall not be deemed complete for acceptance until all information
necessary for a decision on compliance has been provided by the applicant.

Section 425.280. Authorization by Administrative Permit.
[Ord. No. 1248 §1, 9-20-2012]
The placement of wireless communications facilities is permitted in all zoning districts by
administrative permit approved by the Director only as follows:
The attachment of additional or replacement antennas, equipment, cabinets or shelters to any
nonconforming support structure existing on the effective date of this Chapter or subsequently
approved in accordance with these regulations and not satisfying the requirements for such
attachment pursuant to Section 425.270 as a permitted use as long the applicant provides
documentation from which the Director has reasonably determined that the application will
bring the support structure (including ground equipment and site) into conformance with this
Chapter to the maximum extent feasible and further provided that the proposal does not
increase the height of the support structure or increase any exterior equipment compound
area. A "nonconforming support structure" shall be any support structure or associated site or
equipment that does not comply with all of the requirements of this Chapter, including but not
limited to the general requirements herein and the requirements of the underlying zoning
district.
The one-time replacement of any tower existing on the effective date of this Chapter or
subsequently approved in accordance with these regulations so long as the purpose of the
replacement is to accommodate shared use of the site or to eliminate a safety hazard and the
new structure otherwise complies with this Chapter. The new tower shall be of the same type
as the original except that a guyed or self-supporting (lattice) tower shall be replaced by a
monopole. The height of the new monopole tower may exceed that of the original by not more
than ten feet (10'). Subsequent replacements shall require the approval of a conditional use
permit.
The construction of a disguised support structure, provided that all related equipment shall be
placed underground or concealed within the structure or associated buildings consistent with
the disguise when the structure is located in any district other than a district authorizing
industrial uses as a permitted use. Equipment may be placed in an appropriately concealed
cabinet if the disguised support structure is incidental to an industrial, commercial, institutional

standards for approval are satisfied. An application shall not be deemed complete until
satisfaction of all application requirements and submission of all requested information as
provided herein.
The Director shall issue a decision on the permit within the time provided in Section 425.250
or the application shall be deemed approved unless the time period for review and action is
extended by writing of the Director or Board of Aldermen for reasonable cause. The Director
may deny the application or approve the application as submitted or with such modifications
as are, in his/her judgment, reasonably necessary to protect the safety or general welfare of
the citizens consistent with and to effectuate the purposes of this Chapter. The Director may

Applications. Applications for conditional use permits shall be filed on such forms required by
the Director and processed subject to the requirements of and in the manner and time frame
as established for conditional use permits in the Zoning Code and, in addition to such other
requirements, shall be accompanied by a deposit of two thousand five hundred dollars
($2,500.00), or such other deposit amount as may be established by the Board of Aldermen.
The deposit shall be used to cover administrative costs and any telecommunications or other
consulting fees or costs that the City may incur in review of the application. Any amount not
used by the City shall be refunded to the applicant upon request after a final decision. The
Director may require such studies or other information as may be reasonably necessary for
review of the application based on the requirements of this Chapter. The applicant shall be
responsible for such additional reasonable costs as the City may incur and shall be required,
on request of the Director, to post a deposit for such costs and to submit information as may
be deemed necessary to complete such studies or review. No application shall be deemed
complete until receipt of all required information and fees. In addition, upon request by the
Director, an applicant shall deposit with the City such additional amounts reasonably
necessary to reimburse the City for such anticipated costs and fees for legal, engineering or
other contractual or other consultant services determined by the City to be needed in review
or action on the application. No application for a conditional use permit under this section
shall be deemed complete until the applicant has paid all fees and deposits required under
this Chapter. Any amount not used by the City shall be refunded to the applicant upon written
request after a final decision.
Additional Minimum Requirements. No conditional use permit shall be issued unless the
applicant has clearly demonstrated by substantial evidence that placement of wireless
communications facilities pursuant to Sections 425.270, Permitted Uses, or 425.280,
Administrative Permit, of this Chapter is not technologically or economically feasible. The City
may consider current or emerging industry standards and practices, among other information,
in determining feasibility.
Decision And Findings Required. A decision by the Board of Aldermen shall be accompanied
by substantial evidence supporting the decision, which shall be made a part of the written
record of the meeting at which a final decision on the application is rendered. Evidence shall
be under oath and may be submitted with the application or thereafter, or presented during
the public hearing by the Applicant or others.
Findings Required.
In addition to the determinations or limitations specified herein for the consideration of
conditional use permits, no conditional use permit shall be approved by the Board of
Aldermen unless findings in the affirmative are made that the following conditions exist:
No existing towers, structures or buildings within the necessary geographic area for
the applicant's tower meet the applicant's necessary engineering requirements
considering:
Height;
Structural strength;
Resulting signal interference;
Feasibility of retrofitting;
Feasibility of redesigning the applicant's network; or
Other limiting conditions that render towers, structures or buildings within the
applicant's required geographic area unsuitable.

That the design of the wireless communications facilities, including ground layout,
maximally reduces visual degradation and otherwise complies with provisions and
intent of this Chapter. New towers shall be of a monopole design.
That the proposal minimizes the number and/or height and visibility of wireless
communications facilities or support structures that will be required in the area.
Where alternate technology or design exists or is reasonably available that would
satisfy the general need for the proposal, this factor is ordinarily not satisfied.
That the applicant has not previously failed to take advantage of reasonably
available shared use opportunities or procedures provided by this Chapter or
otherwise.
That no land owned by any agency of the Federal or State government, or by any
political subdivision of the State, is available for locating the wireless
communications facility.
If any one (1), but not more than one (1), of the previous five conditions [Subsection A(4)
(a)(1) through (5)] is not satisfied, approval may be granted only on a finding of unique
circumstances otherwise necessitating approval to satisfy the purposes of this Chapter.
Additional Height Limitations. No tower shall be approved at a height exceeding one hundred fifty
(150) feet AGL unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that such height is required for the
proper function of the applicant's system or that of a public safety communications system of a
governmental entity sharing the tower. Such showing must also be supported by the opinion of a
telecommunications consultant hired by the City at the expense of the applicant. The opinion of
the consultant shall include a statement that no available alternatives exist to exceeding the height
limit including but not limited to the use of two or more support structures, and the reason why
such alternatives are not viable.
Historic Preservation. A conditional use permit shall not be issued for any wireless
communications facility that the Board of Aldermen determines would create a significant negative
visual impact or otherwise have a significant negative impact on the historical character and
quality of any property within a Historic Preservation District or such District as a whole.
RF Engineer Certification Required; Additional Studies. The City may require, at the expense of
the applicant, any additional studies or the hiring of an external consultant, including technical and
legal services, to review exhibits and/or other requirements in accordance with this Section.
Applications for a new tower shall be considered only after a letter, certified by a radio frequency
engineer under oath, stating that the planned telecommunication equipment cannot be
accommodated on an existing or already approved support structure that is capable of shared use
and providing facts (including: all alternatives considered; and precise cost estimates where cost
is a basis for the determination) clearly demonstrating one or more of the following conditions:
Planned telecommunications equipment would exceed the structural capacity of an existing or
approved support structure, and the support structure cannot be reinforced to accommodate
planned telecommunication equipment at a reasonable cost;
Planned telecommunications equipment will cause radio frequency interference with other
existing or planned telecommunications equipment for that support structure and the
interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;
Existing or approved support structures do not have space on which the planned
telecommunications equipment can be placed so it can function effectively and at least in
parity with other similar telecommunications equipment in place or approved by the City or
other area jurisdictions; or

4. Other reasons that make it impractical and not feasible to place the telecommunications
equipment planned by the applicant on an existing or approved support structure.
Section 425.300. Obsolete Non-Complying Support Structures.
[Ord. No. 1248 §1, 9-20-2012]
Any upper portion of a support structure which is not occupied by active antennas for a period of
twelve (12) months, and any entire support structure which is not so occupied for a period of six (6)
months, shall be removed at the owner's expense. Removal of upper portions of a support structure
manufactured as a single unit shall not be required. Failure to comply with this provision shall
constitute a nuisance that may be remedied by the City at the support structure or property owner's
expense. Any applicant for a new support structure not built as a disguised part of another existing or
permitted structure shall place a bond or other security with the City prior to any final approval for the
purpose of removing any support structure as required herein and to compensate the City for
performing proper maintenance of such support structures to ensure such structures do not become
unsafe or otherwise fail to be maintained in compliance with this Chapter. The bond or security shall be
in the form approved by the Director, and in the amount of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), or
such other amount as is determined by the Director to satisfy the requirements hereof with regard to
the specific support structure to which it would apply.
Section 425.310. Commercial Operation of Unlawful Wireless
Communications Facilities.
[Ord. No. 1248 §1, 9-20-2012]
Notwithstanding any right that may exist for a governmental entity to operate or construct wireless
communications facilities, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect or operate for any private
commercial purpose any wireless communications facilities in violation of any provision of this Chapter,
regardless of whether such wireless communications facilities are located on land owned by a
governmental entity.
Section 425.320. Violations and Penalties.
[Ord. No. 1248 §1, 9-20-2012]
Except as may otherwise be provided by law, any person violating this Chapter shall be subject to a
fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or 90 days in jail or both. Each day the violation
continues shall constitute a separate offense.

must bear a professional seal, with original signature and date, certifying professional
responsibility for every aspect of the project. Referenced serial drawings do not require a seal.
The professional seal must be provided by a architectural engineer registered in the State of
Missouri. The professional seal on a document certifies that the architect/engineer has exercised
his/her direction, guidance and judgment on all issues pertaining to health, safety and general
welfare of the public and accepts legal responsibility for all matters embodies in the document.

such contractor files a mechanic's lien against the property where the dangerous building is
located. The contractor may enforce this lien as provided in Sections 429.010 to 429.360,
RSMo. Except as provided in Section 505.090, at the request of the taxpayer the tax bill may
be paid in installments over a period of not more than ten (10) years. The tax bill from the
date of its issuance shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owner and shall
also be a lien on the property until paid. Said tax bill or assessment shall bear interest at a

Section 505.090. Insurance Proceeds — How Handled.
If there are proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a covered claim payment made for
damage or loss to a building or other structure caused by or arising out of any fire, explosion or
other casualty loss, the following procedure is established for the payment of up to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the insurance proceeds as set forth in this Subsection. This Subsection shall
apply only to a covered claim payment that is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the face value of
the policy covering a building or other structure:
The insurer shall withhold from the covered claim payment up to twenty-five percent (25%) of
the covered claim payment and shall pay such monies to the City to deposit into an interestbearing
account. Any named mortgagee on the insurance policy shall maintain priority over
any obligation under this Chapter.
The City shall release the proceeds and any interest that has accrued on such proceeds
received under Subsection (A)(1) to the insured or as the terms of the policy and
endorsements thereto provide within thirty (30) days after receipt of such insurance monies,
unless the City has instituted legal proceedings under the provisions of Subsection (6) of
Section 505.080. If the City has proceeded under the provisions of Subsection (6) of Section
505.080, all monies in excess of that necessary to comply with the provisions of Subsection
(6) of Section 505.080 for the removal, securing, repair and clean up of the building or
structure and the lot on which it is located, less salvage value, shall be paid to the insured.
If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in Subsection (A) of this Section, at
the request of the taxpayer the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not more than
ten (10) years. The tax bill from the date of its issuance shall be a lien on the property and a
personal debt against the property owner(s) until paid.
This Section shall apply to fire, explosion or other casualty loss claims arising on all buildings and
structures.
This Section does not make the City a party to any insurance contract, and the insurer is not liable
to any party for any amount in excess of the proceeds otherwise payable under its insurance
policy.
The Building Commissioner may certify that in lieu of payment of all or part of the covered claim
payment under Subsection (A) that it has obtained satisfactory proof that the insured has removed
or will remove the debris and repair, rebuild or otherwise make the premises safe and secure. In
this event, the Building Commissioner shall issue a certificate within thirty (30) days after receipt of
proof to permit covered claim payment to the insured without the deduction pursuant to
Subsection (A) of this Section. It shall be the obligation of the insured or other person making the
claim to provide the insurance company with the written certificate provided for in this Subsection.

in accordance with EPA guidelines and performed by certified renovators or individuals
trained in accordance with said guidelines in target housing or child-occupied facilities.
Renovation-Specific Pamphlet. Before December 22, 2008, renovators or firms performing
renovations in States and Indian Tribal areas without an authorized program may provide owners
and occupants with either of the following EPA pamphlets: "Protect Your Family From Lead in Your
Home" or "Renovate Right: Important Lead Hazard Information for Families, Child Care Providers
and Schools." After that date, "Renovate Right: Important Lead Hazard Information for Families,
Child Care Providers and Schools" must be used exclusively.
Pre-Renovation Education Rule. With the exception of the requirement to use the pamphlet

Renovations in target housing or child-occupied facilities in which a written determination has
been made by an inspector or risk assessor (certified pursuant to either Federal regulations or
a State or Tribal certification program authorized that the components affected by the
renovation are free of paint or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of
1.0 milligrams/per square centimeter (mg/cm ) or 0.5% by weight, where the firm performing
the renovation has obtained a copy of the determination.
Renovations in target housing or child-occupied facilities in which a certified renovator, using
an EPA-recognized test kit and following the kit manufacturer's instructions, has tested each
component affected by the renovation and determined that the components are free of paint
or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of 1.0 mg/cm or 0.5% by
weight. If the components make up an integrated whole, such as the individual stair treads
and risers of a single staircase, the renovator is required to test only one of the individual
components, unless the individual components appear to have been repainted or refinished
separately.
Renovations in target housing or child-occupied facilities in which a certified renovator has
collected a paint chip sample from each painted component affected by the renovation and a
laboratory recognized by EPA pursuant to Section 405(b) of TSCA as being capable of
performing analyses for lead compounds in paint chip samples has determined that the
samples are free of paint or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of
1.0 mg/cm or 0.5% by weight. If the components make up an integrated whole, such as the
individual stair treads and risers of a single staircase, the renovator is required to test only
one of the individual components, unless the individual components appear to have been
repainted or refinished separately.
The information distribution requirements do not apply to emergency renovations, which are
renovation activities that were not planned but result from a sudden, unexpected event (such as
non-routine failures of equipment) that, if not immediately attended to, presents a safety or public
health hazard, or threatens equipment and/or property with significant damage. Interim controls
performed in response to an elevated blood lead level in a resident child are also emergency
renovations. Emergency renovations other than interim controls are also exempt from the warning
sign, containment, waste handling, training, and certification requirements to the extent necessary
to respond to the emergency. Emergency renovations are not exempt from the cleaning
requirements which must be performed by certified renovators or individuals trained in accordance
with the cleaning verification requirements which must be performed by certified renovators, and
the recordkeeping requirements.

Section 510.070. Work Practice Standards.
[Ord. No. 1310 §1, 5-2-2013]
Standards For Renovation Activities. Renovations must be performed by certified firms using
certified renovators as directed. The responsibilities of certified firms are set forth and the
responsibilities of certified renovators are set forth.
Occupant Protection. Firms must post signs clearly defining the work area and warning
occupants and other persons not involved in renovation activities to remain outside of the
work area. To the extent practicable, these signs must be in the primary language of the
occupants. These signs must be posted before beginning the renovation and must remain in
place and readable until the renovation and the post-renovation cleaning verification have
been completed. If warning signs have been posted in accordance with 24 CFR 35.1345(b)(2)
or 29 CFR 1926.62(m), additional signs are not required by this Section.
Containing The Work Area. Before beginning the renovation, the firm must isolate the work
area so that no dust or debris leaves the work area while the renovation is being performed.
In addition, the firm must maintain the integrity of the containment by ensuring that any plastic
or other impermeable materials are not torn or displaced, and taking any other steps
necessary to ensure that no dust or debris leaves the work area while the renovation is being
performed. The firm must also ensure that containment is installed in such a manner that it
does not interfere with occupant and worker egress in an emergency.
Interior Renovations. The firm must:
Remove all objects from the work area, including furniture, rugs, and window
coverings, or cover them with plastic sheeting or other impermeable material with all
seams and edges taped or otherwise sealed.
Close and cover all ducts opening in the work area with taped-down plastic sheeting
or other impermeable material.
Close windows and doors in the work area. Doors must be covered with plastic
sheeting or other impermeable material. Doors used as an entrance to the work area
must be covered with plastic sheeting or other impermeable material in a manner
that allows workers to pass through while confining dust and debris to the work area.
Cover the floor surface, including installed carpet, with taped-down plastic sheeting
or other impermeable material in the work area six (6) feet beyond the perimeter of

surfaces undergoing renovation or a sufficient distance to contain the dust,
whichever is greater. Floor containment measures may stop at the edge of the
vertical barrier when using a vertical containment system consisting of impermeable
barriers that extend from the floor to the ceiling and are tightly sealed at joints with
the floor, ceiling and walls.
Use precautions to ensure that all personnel, tools, and other items, including the
exteriors of containers of waste, are free of dust and debris before leaving the work
area.
Exterior Renovations. The firm must:
Close all doors and windows within twenty (20) feet of the renovation. On multi-story
buildings, close all doors and windows within 20 feet of the renovation on the same
floor as the renovation, and close all doors and windows on all floors below that are
the same horizontal distance from the renovation.
Ensure that doors within the work area that will be used while the job is being
performed are covered with plastic sheeting or other impermeable material in a
manner that allows workers to pass through while confining dust and debris to the
work area.
Cover the ground with plastic sheeting or other disposable impermeable material
extending ten (10) feet beyond the perimeter of surfaces undergoing renovation or a
sufficient distance to collect falling paint debris, whichever is greater, unless the
property line prevents ten (10) feet of such ground covering. Ground containment
measures may stop at the edge of the vertical barrier when using a vertical
containment system.
If the renovation will affect surfaces within ten (10) feet of the property line, the
renovation firm must erect vertical containment or equivalent extra precautions in
containing the work area to ensure that dust and debris from the renovation does not
contaminate adjacent buildings or migrate to adjacent properties. Vertical
containment or equivalent extra precautions in containing the work area may also be
necessary in other situations in order to prevent contamination of other buildings,
other areas of the property, or adjacent buildings or properties.
Prohibited And Restricted Practices. The work practices listed below are prohibited or
restricted during a renovation as follows:
Open-flame burning or torching of painted surfaces is prohibited.
The use of machines designed to remove paint or other surface coatings through highspeed
operation such as sanding, grinding, power planing, needle gun, abrasive blasting,
or sandblasting, is prohibited on painted surfaces unless such machines have shrouds or
containment systems and are equipped with a HEPA vacuum attachment to collect dust
and debris at the point of generation. Machines must be operated so that no visible dust
or release of air occurs outside the shroud or containment system.
Operating a heat gun on painted surfaces is permitted only at temperatures below one
thousand one hundred degrees Fahrenheit (1,100º F.).
Waste From Renovations.
Waste from renovation activities must be contained to prevent releases of dust and
debris before the waste is removed from the work area for storage or disposal. If a chute
is used to remove waste from the work area, it must be covered.

At the conclusion of each workday and at the conclusion of the renovation, waste that
has been collected from renovation activities must be stored under containment, in an
enclosure, or behind a barrier that prevents release of dust and debris out of the work
area and prevents access to dust and debris.
When the firm transports waste from renovation activities, the firm must contain the
waste to prevent release of dust and debris.
Cleaning The Work Area. After the renovation has been completed, the firm must clean the
work area until no dust, debris or residue remains.
Interior And Exterior Renovations. The firm must:
Collect all paint chips and debris and, without dispersing any of it, seal this material
in a heavy-duty bag.
Remove the protective sheeting. Mist the sheeting before folding it, fold the dirty side
inward, and either tape shut to seal or seal in heavy-duty bags. Sheeting used to
isolate contaminated rooms from non-contaminated rooms must remain in place until
after the cleaning and removal of other sheeting. Dispose of the sheeting as waste.
Additional cleaning for interior renovations. The firm must clean all objects and surfaces
in the work area and within two (2) feet of the work area in the following manner, cleaning
from higher to lower:
Walls. Clean walls starting at the ceiling and working down to the floor by either
vacuuming with a HEPA vacuum or wiping with a damp cloth.
Remaining Surfaces. Thoroughly vacuum all remaining surfaces and objects in the
work area, including furniture and fixtures, with a HEPA vacuum. The HEPA vacuum
must be equipped with a beater bar when vacuuming carpets and rugs.
Wipe all remaining surfaces and objects in the work area, except for carpeted or
upholstered surfaces, with a damp cloth. Mop uncarpeted floors thoroughly, using a
mopping method that keeps the wash water separate from the rinse water, such as
the two-bucket mopping method, or using a wet mopping system.
Standards For Post-Renovation Cleaning Verification.
Interiors.
A certified renovator must perform a visual inspection to determine whether dust, debris
or residue is still present. If dust, debris or residue is present, these conditions must be
removed by recleaning and another visual inspection must be performed.
After a successful visual inspection, a certified renovator must:
Verify that each windowsill in the work area has been adequately cleaned, using the
following procedure:
Wipe the windowsill with a wet disposable cleaning cloth that is damp to the
touch. If the cloth matches or is lighter than the cleaning verification card, the
windowsill has been adequately cleaned.
If the cloth does not match and is darker than the cleaning verification card, reclean
the windowsill as directed in Subsection (A)(5)(b)(2) and (A)(5)(b)(3) of
this Section, then either use a new cloth or fold the used cloth in such a way that
an unused surface is exposed, and wipe the surface again. If the cloth matches
or is lighter than the cleaning verification card, that windowsill has been
adequately cleaned.

If the cloth does not match and is darker than the cleaning verification card, wait
for one (1) hour or until the surface has dried completely, whichever is longer.
After waiting for the windowsill to dry, wipe the windowsill with a dry disposable
cleaning cloth. After this wipe, the windowsill has been adequately cleaned.
Wipe uncarpeted floors and countertops within the work area with a wet disposable
cleaning cloth. Floors must be wiped using an application device with a long handle
and a head to which the cloth is attached. The cloth must remain damp at all times
while it is being used to wipe the surface for post-renovation cleaning verification. If
the surface within the work area is greater than 40 square feet, the surface within the
work area must be divided into roughly equal sections that are each less than forty
(40) square feet. Wipe each such section separately with a new wet disposable
cleaning cloth. If the cloth used to wipe each section of the surface within the work
area matches the cleaning verification card, the surface has been adequately
cleaned.
If the cloth used to wipe a particular surface section does not match the cleaning
verification card, re-clean that section of the surface as directed in Subsection
(A)(5)(B)(2) and (A)(5)(B)(3) of this Section, then use a new wet disposable
cleaning cloth to wipe that section again. If the cloth matches the cleaning
verification card, that section of the surface has been adequately cleaned.
If the cloth used to wipe a particular surface section does not match the cleaning
verification card after the surface has been re-cleaned, wait for one (1) hour or
until the entire surface within the work area has dried completely, whichever is
longer.
After waiting for the entire surface within the work area to dry, wipe each section
of the surface that has not yet achieved post-renovation cleaning verification
with a dry disposable cleaning cloth. After this wipe, that section of the surface
has been adequately cleaned.
When the work area passes the post-renovation cleaning verification, remove the
warning signs.
Exteriors. A certified renovator must perform a visual inspection to determine whether dust,
debris or residue is still present on surfaces in and below the work area, including windowsills
and the ground. If dust, debris or residue is present, these conditions must be eliminated and
another visual inspection must be performed. When the area passes the visual inspection,
remove the warning signs.
Optional Dust Clearance Testing. Cleaning verification need not be performed if the contract
between the renovation firm and the person contracting for the renovation or another Federal,
State, Territorial, Tribal, or local law or regulation requires:
The renovation firm to perform dust clearance sampling at the conclusion of a renovation
covered by this Chapter.
The dust clearance samples are required to be collected by a certified inspector, risk assessor
or dust sampling technician.
The renovation firm is required to re-clean the work area until the dust clearance sample
results are below the clearance standards or any applicable State, Territorial, Tribal, or local
standard.
Activities Conducted After Post-Renovation Cleaning Verification. Activities that do not disturb
paint, such as applying paint to walls that have already been prepared, are not regulated by this

the first test kit that meets both the negative response and positive response criteria in Subsection
(C) of this Section.
No other test kits will be recognized until they are tested through EPA's Environmental Technology
Verification Program or other equivalent EPA-approved testing program.
Effective September 1, 2008, to initiate the testing process, a test kit manufacturer must
submit a sufficient number of kits, along with the instructions for using the kits, to EPA. The
test kit manufacturer should first visit the following website for information on where to apply:
http://www.epa.gov/etv/howtoapply.html.
After the kit has been tested through the Environmental Technology Verification Program or
other equivalent approved EPA testing program, EPA will review the report to determine
whether the required criteria have been met.
Before September 1, 2010, test kits must meet only the negative response criteria in
Subsection (C)(1) of this Section. The recognition of kits that meet only this criteria will last
until EPA publicizes its recognition of the first test kits that meets both of the criteria in
Subsection (C) of this Section.
After September 1, 2010, test kits must meet both of the criteria in Subsection (C) of this
Section.
If the report demonstrates that the kit meets the required criteria, EPA will issue a notice of
recognition to the kit manufacturer, provide them with the report, and post the information on
EPA's website.
If the report demonstrates that the kit does not meet the required criteria, EPA will notify the
kit manufacturer and provide them with the report.
Response Criteria.
Negative Response Criteria. For paint containing lead at or above the regulated level, 1.0
mg/cm or one-half percent (0.5%) by weight, a demonstrated probability (with ninety-fivepercent
confidence) of a negative response less than or equal to five percent (5%) of the time.
Positive Response Criteria. For paint containing lead below the regulated level, 1.0 mg/cm or
one-half percent (0.5%) by weight, a demonstrated probability (with ninety-five-percent
confidence) of a positive response less than or equal to ten percent (10%) of the time.
Section 510.110. Firm Certification.
[Ord. No. 1310 §1, 5-2-2013]
Initial Certification.
Firms that perform renovations for compensation must apply to EPA for certification to
perform renovations or dust sampling. To apply, a firm must submit to EPA a completed
"Application for Firms," signed by an authorized agent of the firm, and pay at least the correct
amount of fees. If a firm pays more than the correct amount of fees, EPA will reimburse the
firm for the excess amount.
After EPA receives a firm's application, EPA will take one of the following actions within 90
days of the date the application is received:
EPA will approve a firm's application if EPA determines that it is complete and that the
environmental compliance history of the firm, its principals, or its key employees does not

the form and includes at least the correct amount of fees. When EPA approves a firm's
application, EPA will issue the firm a certificate with an expiration date not more than five
(5) years from the date the application is approved. EPA certification allows the firm to
perform renovations covered by this Section in any State or Indian Tribal area that does
not have a renovation program that is authorized under Section 510.120 of this Chapter.
EPA will request a firm to supplement its application if EPA determines that the
application is incomplete. If EPA requests a firm to supplement its application, the firm
must submit the requested information or pay the additional fees within 30 days of the
date of the request.
EPA will not approve a firm's application if the firm does not supplement its application in
accordance with Subsection (A)(2)(b) of this Section or if EPA determines that the
environmental compliance history of the firm, its principals, or its key employees
demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to maintain compliance with environmental
statutes or regulations. EPA will send the firm a letter giving the reason for not approving
the application. EPA will not refund the application fees. A firm may reapply for
certification at any time by filing a new, complete application that includes the correct
amount of fees.
Recertification. To maintain its certification, a firm must be recertified by EPA every five (5) years.
Timely And Complete Application. To be recertified, a firm must submit a complete application
for recertification. A complete application for recertification includes a completed "Application
for Firms" which contains all of the information requested by the form and is signed by an
authorized agent of the firm, noting on the form that it is submitted as a recertification. A
complete application must also include at least the correct amount of fees. If a firm pays more
than the correct amount of fees, EPA will reimburse the firm for the excess amount.
An application for recertification is timely if it is postmarked ninety (90) days or more
before the date the firm's current certification expires. If the firm's application is complete
and timely, the firm's current certification will remain in effect until its expiration date or
until EPA has made a final decision to approve or disapprove the recertification
application, whichever is later.
If the firm submits a complete recertification application less than ninety (90) days before
its current certification expires, and EPA does not approve the application before the
expiration date, the firm's current certification will expire and the firm will not be able to
conduct renovations until EPA approves its recertification application.
If the firm fails to obtain recertification before the firm's current certification expires, the
firm must not perform renovations or dust sampling until it is certified anew pursuant to
Subsection (A) of this Section.
EPA Action On An Application. After EPA receives a firm's application for recertification, EPA
will review the application and take one of the following actions within ninety (90) days of
receipt:
EPA will approve a firm's application if EPA determines that it is timely and complete and
that the environmental compliance history of the firm, its principals, or its key employees
does not show an unwillingness or inability to maintain compliance with environmental
statutes or regulations. When EPA approves a firm's application for recertification, EPA
will issue the firm a new certificate with an expiration date five (5) years from the date
that the firm's current certification expires. EPA certification allows the firm to perform
renovations or dust sampling covered by this Section in any State or Indian Tribal area
that does not have a renovation program that is authorized under Section 510.120 of this
Chapter.

Surcharge For Wastewaters Of Excessive Strength.
Non-domestic users are subject to a surcharge for wastewaters of excessive strength if the
user's wastewater contains pollutant concentration greater than 400 mg/l COD or greater than
250 mg/l suspended solids. When, in the opinion of the Public Works Superintendent, the
strength of a non-domestic discharge is best characterized by a BOD concentration, the
Superintendent may substitute BOD or COD for the purpose of surcharge. The BOD

surcharge will be based on strengths greater than 225 mg/l. The non-domestic wastewater
strength shall be determined by the pollutant concentrations as established by the Standard
Wastewater Identification Table. This table shall be approved by the Board of Aldermen and
filed with the City Clerk.
The surcharge shall be computed by using the summation of the following formulas for COD
(or BOD) and suspended solids.
S(COD) = 0.0000625 x Va x $0.1292 x (COD-400 mg/l)
S(BOD) = 0.0000625 x Va x $0.3231 x (BOD-225 mg/l)
S(TTS) = 0.0000625 x Va x $0.1139 x (TSS-250 mg/l)
S(Total) = S(COD) or S(BOD) + S(TSS)
The symbols and letters used in the previous formulas shall mean:
BOD: Biochemical oxygen demand in mg/l as defined in Section
700.190(D).
COD: Chemical oxygen demand in mg/l as defined in Section 700.190(D).
S(BOD): Amount of surcharge based on BOD.
S(COD): Amount of surcharge based on COD.
S(TTS): Amount of surcharge based on suspended solids.
S(Total): Total surcharge.
TSS: Suspended solids in mg/l as defined in Section 700.190(D).
Va: Monthly volume of wastewater in cubic feet.
0.0000625: Factor for converting milligrams per liter to pounds per cubic feet.
Justification for adjustments to surcharges shall be studied and reported in the form of an
analytical report generated by a laboratory acceptable to the City and submitted to the Public
Works Superintendent. Sampling and analysis shall be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of Section 700.190(D). The cost of sampling and analysis and special sampling
devices used to determine adjustments shall be borne by the user. All surcharge adjustments
shall be reviewed annually by the Superintendent.
If the wastewater from an establishment is subject to surcharge, components of the discharge
shall be reviewed by the Public Works Superintendent in accordance with Section
700.190(D). The owner of any non-domestic establishment may, if so desired, treat the
wastes from such establishment so as to reduce either the excess suspended solids or COD,
or both to normal levels before discharging such wastes into the public sanitary sewer for a
reduction or elimination of the surcharge.
No statement shall be construed as preventing the City from sampling and analyzing any
user's wastewater and surcharging more or less than the listed or adjusted value.
Payment Of Surcharge.
Any surcharge resulting from wastewaters of excessive strength as defined in Section
700.190(D) shall be shown on the sanitary sewer bill as a separate item. The amount of
the surcharge shall be payable at the same time as the sewer service charge.
Surcharge revenue collected shall be deposited with the City Clerk, and shall be used to
pay the cost of operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment system.

Authority Of Superintendent.
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public
sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in
Subsection (G) above, and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life to constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent
may:
Reject the wastes;
Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not
covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of Section 700.190.
If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and
installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the
Superintendent and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Superintendent,
they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive
amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes,
they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his
expense.
When required by the Superintendent the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer
carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary
meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Superintendent. The
manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to
be safe and accessible at all times.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which
reference is made in this Article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
"Standard Methods of the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American
Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and
to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved
will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and
suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls where
pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.)

Where a public sanitary or combined sewer is not available under the provisions of Section
700.240, the building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal system complying
with the provisions of this Section.
Before commencement of construction of a private sewage disposal system, the owner shall first
obtain a written permit signed by the Superintendent. The application for such permit shall be
made on a form furnished by the City which the applicant shall supplement by any plans,
specifications, and other information as are deemed necessary by the Superintendent. A permit
and inspection fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) shall be paid to the City at the time the
application is filed.
A permit for a private sewage disposal system shall not become effective until the installation is
completed to the satisfaction of the Superintendent. He shall be allowed to inspect the work at any
stage of construction and, in any event, the applicant for the permit shall notify the Superintendent
when the work is ready for final inspection, and before any underground portions are covered. The
inspection shall be made within twenty-four (24) hours of the receipt of notice by the
Superintendent.
The type, capacities, location, and layout of a private sewage disposal system shall comply with all
recommendations of the Department of Public Health of the State of Missouri. No permit shall be
issued for any private sewage disposal system employing subsurface soil absorption facilities
where the area of the lot is less than five thousand (5,000) square feet (square meters). No septic
tank or cesspool shall be permitted to discharge to any natural outlet.
At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private sewage
disposal system, as provided in Section 700.240 above, a direct connection shall be made to the
public sewer in compliance with this Chapter, and any septic tanks, cesspools, and similar private
sewage disposal facilities shall be abandoned and filled with suitable material.
The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal facilities in a sanitary manner
at all times, at no expense to the City.
