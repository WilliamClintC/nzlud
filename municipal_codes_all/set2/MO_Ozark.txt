A. Initial Recognition. The City will not voluntarily recognize an
organization, association, employee group, union or professional group
("union") as a representative for City employees covered by this Article,
without a secret ballot election. The City recognizes the importance of a
secret ballot election in order to insure that employees have the
opportunity to vote and determine, by secret ballot, whether they desire
to be represented by a union or not to be represented by a union.
B. In order to request an election to select a union, a City employee must
first submit to the City Administrator or designee the following
information:
1. A description of the bargaining unit requesting representation. The
description will include the general classifications of employees
sought to be included and excluded and the approximate number of
employees in the proposed bargaining unit; and
2. The name of the union seeking recognition as the representative
and the name, address, e-mail address and telephone numbers of
the union's contact person; and
3. A petition requesting an election by secret ballot signed by at least
thirty percent (30%) of the City employees in the proposed
bargaining unit. No signature can be older than six (6) months from
the date the petition is submitted to the City Administrator or
designee. The petition will be submitted in a sealed envelope
separate from the other required information and labeled
"Petition".
C. Once the City Administrator or designee receives such a request, he or
she will post notice of receipt of the request in the same location that
notices for meetings of the Board of Aldermen are posted.
D. The City Administrator or designee and the contact person for the union
seeking recognition will identify a person mutually acceptable to both
the City and the union to review the petition. The person will not be an
agent or representative of either the City or the union or have a
personal interest in the results of the election. The City Administrator
or designee will provide the designated person a list of names of City
employees meeting the definition of the proposed bargaining unit. The
envelope labeled "Petition" will remain sealed until the designated
person opens it to verify that signatures from at least thirty percent
(30%) of the employees in the proposed bargaining unit were obtained.
The designated person will not disclose the petition, which employees
signed the petition, or the total number of employees who signed the
petition to any person unless required by law. The designated person
will notify the City Administrator or designee whether thirty percent
(30%) of the signatures were obtained, but will not provide additional
information unless required by law.
E. The City Administrator or designee, and the person designated to
review the petition, will have thirty (30) business days to verify that the

Section 115.372. Determining Representative Status of the Labor
Organization. [Ord. No. 13-024 §1, 7-1-2013]
required information is present and to examine the description of the
proposed bargaining unit. The City Administrator or designee will
notify the contact person for the union seeking recognition of any
missing information, so that the problem can be corrected immediately.
F. If the information is complete, the City Administrator or designee will
submit to the Board of Aldermen a written recommendation on the
appropriateness of the bargaining unit description and a list of the
employees who would belong to the unit, if formed. If the City
Administrator or designee determines that the description is
appropriate and the Board of Aldermen agrees, the Board will set a date
for the election to take place.
G. If the City Administrator or designee determines that the proposed
bargaining unit is not appropriate, the Board of Aldermen will set a date
and time for a public hearing on the issue before the Board, unless the
City and the union agree that a hearing is not necessary to resolve the
dispute. If a hearing is held, the contact person for the union seeking
recognition will receive notice of the hearing. The City Administrator or
designee and the union seeking recognition will have an opportunity to
present witnesses, evidence and arguments at the hearing. The Board
of Aldermen will make a determination as to the appropriateness of the
description of the proposed bargaining unit within ten (10) business
days of the hearing. The decision of the Board of Aldermen will be final.
H. If the description of the proposed bargaining unit is not approved by the
Board of Aldermen, the Board shall issue a written decision which
explains the reason or reasons it found that the proposed bargaining
unit was not appropriate. The petitioner may thereafter submit a
revised description of the proposed bargaining unit. The City
Administrator or designee will provide the designated person a list of
names of City employees meeting the revised definition of the proposed
bargaining unit so that the designated person can determine if
signatures from at least thirty percent (30%) of the City employees in
the revised proposed bargaining unit were obtained. If so, the City
Administrator or designee will submit to the Board of Aldermen a
written recommendation on the appropriateness of the proposed
bargaining unit, as described above. If the appropriate number of
signatures were not obtained, the petitioner may resubmit the request
for an election as described above.
A. The Board of Aldermen will approve the ballot language for the election
for representation by a union, after receiving recommendations from
the City Administrator or designee and any union that will appear on
the ballot. All ballots will include an option where a City employee may
vote not to be represented by a union.
Section
115.371
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
115.372
AO:61
B. The City Administrator or designee will provide notice of the election in
writing, electronically or otherwise, to all City employees in the
proposed bargaining unit. In addition, the City Administrator or
designee will post notice of the election at all locations where notices of
meetings of the Board of Aldermen are posted no less than ten (10)
business days prior to the election. The notice will state:
1. The date, hours and place of the election.
2. The copy of this Section any policies or regulations regarding the
election of a bargaining representative.
3. A description of the proposed bargaining unit.
4. A sample ballot with "sample" clearly marked on its face.
C. The election will be held in one (1) or more polling places reasonably
convenient to the City employees voting and at times when the
employees in the proposed bargaining unit may vote without leaving
their assigned duties. The election will be conducted by secret ballot.
The City Administrator or designee will appoint one (1) or more City
employees or other persons who do not belong to the proposed
bargaining unit, or to any union listed on the ballot, to check the names
off of a list of all City employees in the proposed bargaining unit,
distribute and collect the ballots.
D. The City Administrator and each union seeking recognition will select
observers so there is one (1) observer representing the City and one (1)
observer from the union at each polling place during the election. Any
observer may challenge any employee's eligibility to vote. Each
challenged ballot shall be folded and placed in a sealed envelope with
the name of the voter plainly written on the outside. A challenged ballot
or ballots will not be considered unless the vote could affect the results
of the election. Before the other ballots are counted, the City
Administrator or designee and the representative of the union will
confer to determine if the challenge to each challenged ballot can be
resolved. After the non-challenged ballots are counted, if the remaining
challenged ballots will affect the results of the election, the challenged
ballots will be presented to the Board of Aldermen for a determination.
E. Ballots will not be tallied until after the posted time for closing the polls,
unless all eligible voters have cast their ballots. The ballots will be
tallied by the City Administrator or designee in the presence of
designated observers from the City and the union listed on the ballot.
Tallied ballots will be placed in a sealed envelope and saved until all
objections are resolved, the time for filing objections to the conduct of
the election or conduct affecting the results of the election has passed
and the Board of Aldermen votes to certify the election results. The
preliminary results will be recorded in writing on a form prepared for
that purpose and signed by the observers present when the ballots were
tallied. The election results will remain tentative until the Board of
Aldermen votes to certify the results.
Section
115.372
OZARK CITY CODE Section
115.372
AO:62
F. Within ten (10) business days after the votes are tallied, any City
employee in the proposed bargaining unit may file with the Board of
Aldermen objections to the conduct of the election or conduct affecting
the results of the election, which shall contain a statement of the
reasons for the objection. A copy of the objections will be provided to all
members of the Board of Aldermen, as well as the contact person(s) for
the union seeking to represent the proposed bargaining unit. The City
Administrator or designee will investigate all claims.
G. Unless the City and persons objecting to or challenging the ballots
agree otherwise, the Board of Aldermen will hold a public hearing on:
1. All objections to the conduct of the election; and/or
2. All objections to conduct affecting the results of the election; and/
or
3. All unresolved challenged ballots, if the challenged ballots will
affect the result of the election.
If a hearing is held, the contact person for the union seeking
recognition and the person(s) filing the objection or challenging
the ballots will receive notice of the hearing. The City, through
the City Administrator or designee, the representative of the
union and the City employee who filed the objections, if that
person is not affiliated with the City or the union, shall have an
opportunity to present witnesses, evidence and argument at the
hearing. The Board of Aldermen will make a decision within ten
(10) business days of the hearing. The decision of the Board of
Aldermen will be final.
H. The final results of the election will be presented to the Board of
Aldermen for certification after the time for filing objections has
expired or the Board has made a decision on all objections and, if
necessary, challenged ballots.
I. A union will become the bargaining representative if it receives a
majority of the valid votes cast in the election, after the Board of
Aldermen has voted to certify the election.
J. A null election will occur when an equal number of votes are cast for no
representation by the union, and for representation by the union or
when there are two (2) or more unions on the ballot which receive the
same number of votes. When this occurs, the Board of Aldermen will
declare the election a nullity and set a date for a rerun election. If the
second (2nd) election results in another nullity, the Board will dismiss
the petition and the bargaining unit will not be formed.
K. Once a final decision is made regarding the representation of a
bargaining unit, a petition requesting another election will not be
accepted by the Board of Aldermen, City Administrator or designee for
a minimum of one (1) year after the date of the last election in the unit.

AO:63
Section 115.373. Collective Bargaining. [Ord. No. 13-024 §1,
7-1-2013]
L. All actual expenses of the election will be divided between the City and
the union seeking to represent the City employees in the proposed
bargaining unit. "Actual expenses" include the costs incurred in
running the election, such as printing costs for notices and ballots, the
cost of renting any necessary machinery, the costs incurred in providing
poll workers other than observers and the costs incurred in providing
necessary security at the election, as determined to be necessary by the
City. The City may require the union to pay the City the union's
proportional share prior to incurring the election expenses.
A. If a majority of the members of the bargaining unit vote to be
represented by a union, for purposes of collective bargaining, the City,
through a bargaining committee composed of the City Administrator, a
legal representative for the City and such other persons whose
presence during bargaining as a representative of the City is deemed by
the City Administrator to be necessary or helpful to the bargaining
committee, will meet with the union to bargain over wages and other
terms and conditions of employment.
B. The City Administrator, as Chief Budget Officer for the City, shall
designate the spokesperson for the City's bargaining committee and
said committee shall be authorized to participate in negotiations with
the union. The City's bargaining committee is empowered to reach a
tentative agreement with the union, within the parameters established
by the Board of Aldermen. Individual members of the Board of
Aldermen shall not negotiate privately with representatives of any
union or employee bargaining unit. The City further recognizes that
effective negotiations may require input from other members of the City
or outside resources. Accordingly, the bargaining committee is
authorized to consult with other City employees, the heads of other
departments of the City and outside consultants.
C. Negotiation meetings will be scheduled at times convenient to the
bargaining committee and the union. The negotiation meetings will be
scheduled at times that will not interfere with the work duties of the
members of the bargaining committee and will be scheduled at times
which are least disruptive to the normal business of the bargaining
committee and the employee bargaining unit. Each side will be
responsible for compensating the members of their bargaining
committee for time spent in negotiations. Unless otherwise approved by
the bargaining committee, negotiations will be held in City buildings.
D. Any tentative agreement will be reduced to writing and initialed by the
bargaining committee for the City and the union. Agreements will be
tentative until approved by a majority vote of the whole Board of
Aldermen, ratified by the members of the bargaining unit, and signed
by authorized representatives of the Board of Aldermen and the union
in accordance with law.
Section
115.372
OZARK CITY CODE Section
115.373
AO:64
E. The results of the negotiations shall be reduced to a written document
and presented to the Board of Aldermen in the form of a written
collective bargaining agreement for the Board of Aldermen's adoption,
modification or rejection, consistent with State law. Notwithstanding,
the obligation to collectively bargain in good faith does not require
either party to agree to proposal or to make a concession. The
ordinances of the City and/or City policy will govern in the absence of:
1. A collective bargaining agreement which has been approved by the
Board of Aldermen and ratified by the members of the bargaining
unit; or
2. When the collective bargaining agreement expires by its terms; or
3. When the collective bargaining agreement does not address an
issue.
F. The City will negotiate wages, salary and other conditions of
employment as required by law. The Board of Aldermen will not
approve an agreement that could cause the City to violate any State or
Federal law, negatively affect the City's financial position, or disrupt or
weaken the operation of other departments or functions of the City.
G. Once a collective bargaining agreement receives final approval by the
Board of Aldermen and the union, the agreement is considered
inclusive and complete. The City may refuse to negotiate any item that
is addressed in the existing policy or agreement, or that was discussed
during negotiations for the existing agreement, during the term of the
agreement.
H. The certified union shall ratify the tentative agreement before it is
presented to the Board of Aldermen for ratification. The union is
responsible for obtaining consent to the tentative agreement from the
bargaining unit and will notify the City's bargaining committee in
writing of the decision.
I. Before presenting the proposed collective bargaining agreement to the
Board of Aldermen, the City Administrator or designee shall examine
the agreement thoroughly and prepare a written estimate of the cost to
the City under the agreement and the estimated effect the agreement
will have on the City's future budget. Once a written tentative
agreement has been presented to the Board of Aldermen, the Board
may adopt the agreement or reject the agreement in whole or in part. In
the event the Board of Aldermen rejects all or a part of the tentative
agreement, the City's bargaining committee will meet with the union to
negotiate over any issues which were rejected by the Board. The
decision of the Board of Aldermen shall be final.
J. Once an agreement is entered into, it will be posted on the City's
website and otherwise distributed to employees and the community as
determined by the City Administrator or designee.

Section 115.374. Employee Walkouts, Strikes and Other
Disruptions Prohibited. [Ord. No. 13-024 §1, 7-1-2013]
A. The City is committed to peacefully resolving labor issues, but will not
hesitate to act if City operations are disrupted. No employee covered by
this Section shall engage in any strike, walkout, work slowdown,
stoppage or interruption of work, work-to-rule, boycott, sympathy
strike, refusal to cross any picket line, sit-down, sick-out or any other
similar activity or practice that disrupts the operation of any
department of the City where bargaining unit employees work or any
other operations of the City. This prohibition includes sympathy strikes
or other disruptive actions taken in support of a different bargaining
unit in the City or elsewhere.
B. In the event of a disruption, the City Administrator or designee is
authorized to contact an attorney to seek court intervention,
compensation or any other recourse in accordance with law. Any
employee participating in disruptive acts will be deemed to have
engaged in a serious violation of City policy, will be considered
excessively and unreasonably absent from duties, and may be
terminated from employment or otherwise disciplined. Employees will
not be disciplined for actions protected by law.
C. All City employees are prohibited from using paid or unpaid leave for
any work stoppage, strike or other disruption of work for the City,
unless leave is required by law. The City reserves the right to revoke
previously approved vacation leave, personal leave or other optional
leaves.
D. The City Administrator or designee is directed to develop an emergency
plan to be used in the event of a prohibited strike, work stoppage or
other disruption to City operations. The City Administrator or designee
may reassign employees as necessary to maintain City operations and
may hire replacement employees in accordance with law.

Section 120.080. Segregation of Exempt Material.
If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure,
as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall
separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make the non-exempt
material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies
provided herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to
the extent practicable, facilitate a separation of exempt from non-exempt
information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person requesting to
inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe
the material exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of
the exempt information and thus defeat the purpose of the exemption.

with a quorum of the members of the public body physically present
and in attendance and less than a quorum of the members of the public
governmental body participating via telephone, facsimile, Internet, or
any other voice or electronic means, the nature of the emergency of
the public body justifying that departure from the normal requirements
shall be stated in the minutes. Where such emergency exists, the votes
taken shall be regarded as if all members were physically present and
in attendance at the meeting.
B. A journal or minutes of open and closed meetings shall be taken and
retained by the public governmental body including, but not limited to,
a record of any vote taken at such meeting. The minutes shall include
the date, time, place, members present, members absent, and a record
of votes taken. When a roll call vote is taken, the minutes shall attribute
each "yea" and "nay" vote, or abstinence if not voting, to the name of
the individual member of the public governmental body.
A. Each meeting shall be held at a place reasonably accessible to the
public and of sufficient size to accommodate the anticipated attendance
by members of the public and at a time reasonably convenient to the
public unless for good cause such a place or time is impossible or
impractical. Every reasonable effort shall be made to grant special
access to the meeting to handicapped or disabled individuals.
B. When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24)
hours' notice, or at a place that is not reasonably accessible to the
public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the public, the
nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal
requirements shall be stated in the minutes.
A. The City Clerk shall be the custodian of records and will be responsible
for maintenance and control of all records. The City Administrator may

designate deputy custodians in operating departments of the City and
such other departments or offices as the City Administrator may
determine. Deputy custodians shall conduct matters relating to public
records and meetings in accord with the policies enumerated herein.
B. Except as otherwise provided by law, the City shall provide access to
and, upon written request, furnish copies of the City's public records
subject to the provisions of the Code of Ordinances relating to copying
fees. No person shall remove original public records from the City Hall
or from the office of the custodian of records without written
permission of the custodian. No public governmental body shall grant
to any person or entity, whether by contract, license or otherwise, the
exclusive right to access and disseminate any public record unless the
granting of such right is necessary to facilitate coordination with or
uniformity among industry regulators having similar authority.
C. The custodian of records may require persons seeking access to public
records to submit such request in writing and/or on a form designated
by the custodian for such purpose. Such written request shall be
sufficiently particular to reasonably apprize the custodian of the
records sought.
D. Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon
as possible, but in no event later than the end of the third (3rd) business
day following the date the request is received by the custodian of
records. If records are requested in a certain format, the public body
shall provide the records in the requested format, if such format is
available. If access to the public record is not granted immediately, the
custodian shall give a detailed explanation of the cause for further delay
and the place and earliest time and date that the record will be
available for inspection. This period for document production may
exceed three (3) days for reasonable cause.
E. If a request for access is denied, the custodian of records shall provide,
upon request, a written statement of the grounds for such denial. Such
statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which access is
denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of
the third (3rd) business day following the date that the request for the
statement is received.
F. Any member of a public governmental body who transmits any message
relating to public business by electronic means shall also concurrently
transmit that message to either the member's public office computer or
the custodian of records in the same format. The provisions of this
Subsection shall only apply to messages sent to other members of that
body so that, when counting the sender, a majority of the body's
members are copied. Any such message received by the custodian or at
the member's office computer shall be a public record, subject,
however, to the exceptions for closed records as provided by law.

Section 120.100. Violations — Remedies, Procedure, Penalty —
Validity of Actions by Governing Bodies in Violation —
Governmental Bodies May Seek Interpretation of Law.
A. The remedies provided by this Section against public governmental
bodies shall be in addition to those provided by any other provision of
law. Any aggrieved person, taxpayer to, or citizen of this State may seek
judicial enforcement of the requirements of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo. Suits to enforce Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.,
shall be brought in the Circuit Court for the County in which the public
governmental body has its principal place of business. Upon service of a
summons, petition, complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim in a civil
action brought to enforce the provisions of Sections 610.010 to
610.027, RSMo., the custodian of the public record that is the subject
matter of such civil action shall not transfer custody, alter, destroy or
otherwise dispose of the public record sought to be inspected and
examined, notwithstanding the applicability of an exemption pursuant
to Section 610.021, RSMo., or the assertion that the requested record is
not a public record until the court directs otherwise.
B. Once a party seeking judicial enforcement of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., demonstrates to the court that the body in question is
subject to the requirements of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., and
has held a closed meeting, record or vote, the burden of persuasion
shall be on the body and its members to demonstrate compliance with
the requirements of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
C. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public
governmental body or a member of a public governmental body has
knowingly violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the public
governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in
an amount up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). If the court finds
that there is a knowing violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026,
RSMo., the court may order the payment by such body or member of all
costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully
establishing a violation. The court shall determine the amount of the
penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the
seriousness of the offense, and whether the public governmental body
or member of a public governmental body has violated Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
D. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public
governmental body or a member of a public governmental body has
purposely violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the public
governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil penalty in
an amount up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). If the court finds
that there was a purposeful violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026,
RSMo., then the court shall order the payment by such body or member
of all costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party successfully
establishing such a violation. The court shall determine the amount of
the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the

or member of a public governmental body has violated Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
E. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public
governmental body has violated any provision of Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., a court shall void any action taken in violation of
Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., if the court finds under the facts
of the particular case that the public interest in the enforcement of the
policy of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., outweighs the public
interest in sustaining the validity of the action taken in the closed
meeting, record or vote. Suit for enforcement shall be brought within
one (1) year from which the violation is ascertainable and in no event
shall it be brought later than two (2) years after the violation. This
Subsection shall not apply to an action taken regarding the issuance of
bonds or other evidence of indebtedness of a public governmental body
if a public hearing, election or public sale has been held regarding the
bonds or evidence of indebtedness.
F. A public governmental body which is in doubt about the legality of
closing a particular meeting, record or vote may bring suit at the
expense of that public governmental body in the Circuit Court of the
County of the public governmental body's principal place of business to
ascertain the propriety of any such action, or seek a formal opinion of
the Attorney General or an attorney for the governmental body.
A. Except as otherwise provided by law, each public governmental body
shall provide access to and, upon request, furnish copies of public
records subject to the following:
1. Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted
under Section 32.091, RSMo., shall not exceed ten cents ($.10) per
page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9) by fourteen (14)
inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to exceed the
average hourly rate of pay for clerical staff of the public
governmental body. Research time required for fulfilling records
requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based
on the scope of the request, the public governmental body shall
produce the copies using employees of the body that result in the
lowest amount of charges for search, research and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the
person requesting the records may request the public
governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without
charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body
determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the public

of the requester.
2. Fees for providing access to public records maintained on
computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films,
pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices, and for paper copies larger than nine (9) by
fourteen (14) inches shall include only the cost of copies, staff time,
which shall not exceed the average hourly rate of pay for staff of
the public governmental body required for making copies and
programming, if necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or other
medium used for the duplication. Fees for maps, blueprints or plats
that require special expertise to duplicate may include the actual
rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to
duplicate such maps, blueprints or plats. If programming is
required beyond the customary and usual level to comply with a
request for records or information, the fees for compliance may
include the actual cost of such programming.

Section 140.030. General Guidelines. [Ord. No. 12-015 §1,
3-19-2012]
A. The City Administrator shall have the discretion to direct payment of an
invoice so long as the transaction was approved in compliance with
Section 140.030. Any other invoice shall require review and approval by
the Board of Aldermen prior to payment.
B. At each regularly scheduled Board of Aldermen meeting, the City
Administrator shall provide a copy of all invoices which have been
received since the previous regular Board of Aldermen meeting.
A. General Guidelines.
1. Buying preferences. It is the desire of the City to purchase from
City of Ozark, Missouri, and/or American vendors whenever
possible. When all other factors are equal, preference shall be
provided to City of Ozark vendors first (1st), Missouri vendors
second (2nd) and American vendors third (3rd). To be considered a
City of Ozark vendor, the person or entity must have a physical
place of business located in the City and a City business
registration. To be considered a Missouri vendor, the person or
entity must have a physical place of business in the State and
authority to conduct business in the State. To be considered an
American vendor, the person or entity must have a physical place of
business in the country and authority to conduct business in the
country.
2. Recycled products. The City shall purchase recycled-content
products in preference to those made from virgin materials when
cost, quality, variety, quantity, delivery time and any other defined
specifications are comparable to products made from virgin
materials.
3. Planning. Small orders and last-minute purchases should be
minimized, thereby increasing the capability of each department to
purchase its goods and services in larger quantities in order to
obtain the maximum discounts possible.
4. Buying proper quality. It is the duty of the requisitioning
department to secure the best quality for the purpose intended.
"Quality buying" is the buying of goods or services that will meet or
exceed the requirements for which they are intended.
5. Sales tax. The City is generally exempt from paying local and State
sales taxes and Federal excise taxes. The Finance Department can
provide the necessary exemption documents to any vendor upon
request.
Section
140.020
OZARK CITY CODE Section
140.030
AO:128
6. Endorsements. It is the policy of the City not to endorse or in any
way permit an employee's name, position or the City's name to be
used and advertised as supporting a product or vendor.
7. Personal purchases. Purchases for employees' personal use by the
City are prohibited. City employees are also prohibited from using
the City's name or the employee's position to obtain special
consideration in personal purchases.
8. Lowest responsible bidder. Contracts for purchases shall be
awarded to the lowest and best bidder. In determining the "lowest
responsible bidder", in addition to price, the City will consider,
when applicable, the following:
a. The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the
contract or provide the service required.
b. Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the
service promptly or within the time specified without delay or
interference.
c. The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and
efficiency of the bidder.
d. The quality of performance of previous contracts or services.

applicable laws.
f. The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the
bidder to perform the contract or provide the service.
g. The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or
contractual services to the particular use required.
h. The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and
service for the use of the subject of the contract.
i. The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid.
j. Any other pertinent factor.
B. Purchasing Procedures For Materials And Supplies. Purchases for all
dollar amounts listed below shall require the requisition and approval
of a purchase order.
1. Purchases with material value below one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) within total budget may be made by an authorized
purchaser without a quotation.
2. Purchases with material value from one thousand dollars one cent
($1,000.01) to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) within total budget
and not available through an existing purchasing contract or a
cooperative purchasing agreement may be made by an authorized
Section
140.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
140.030
AO:129
purchaser. Prior to placing an order, the authorized purchaser
should obtain the lowest cost through quotations whenever
reasonably possible. Any requisition must be signed by the
authorized purchaser and submitted, along with a record of the
quotations, to the Finance Department for issuance of a purchase
order.
3. Purchases with material value from five thousand dollars one cent
($5,000.01) to twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) within total
budget and not available through an existing purchasing contract
or a cooperative purchasing agreement may be ordered by the
authorized purchaser with the approval of the Director of the
Department or the City Administrator. Such purchase must have at
least three (3) quotations. Any requisition must be signed by the
authorized purchaser, the Director of the Department or the City
Administrator and submitted, along with a record of the quotations,
to the Finance Department for issuance of a purchase order.
4. Purchases with material value greater than twenty thousand
dollars one cent ($20,000.01) within total budget and not available
through an existing purchasing contract or a cooperative
purchasing agreement may be ordered by the Department Director
with the approval of the City Administrator and/or Director of
Finance. For any such purchase, a formal written bid must be
advertised once a week on the same day for two (2) consecutive
weeks in a written and/or electronic publication of general
circulation. Any purchase request having a value greater than
twenty thousand dollars one cent ($20,000.01) that is outside the
total budget may be ordered only after formal written bid,
advertised once a week on the same day for two (2) consecutive
weeks in a written and/or electronic publication of general
circulation and formal approval by a majority of the Board of
Aldermen. Purchases with material value greater than twenty
thousand dollars one cent ($20,000.01) within total budget and
available through an existing purchasing contract or a cooperative
purchasing agreement may be ordered by the Department Director
with the approval of the City Administrator and/or Director of
Finance.
5. The City Administrator shall have the authority to approve
purchases of less than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) which
require the transfer of funds from one budgetary line item to
another within the same department and/or fund as long as the
expenditure is within the total budget.
6. Multiple or repeat orders. Multiple or repeat orders from the same
vendor during any consecutive five (5) business days cannot be
used to avoid the requisite approvals for the total purchase amount.
7. Special circumstances. On purchases of less than twenty thousand
dollars ($20,000.00), if less than three (3) quotations are received
Section
140.030
OZARK CITY CODE Section
140.030
AO:130
and the quotations all exceed the amount budgeted for the
purchase, departments should either request new quotations for
the desired goods or services or obtain approval from the City
Administrator to proceed based on the initial quotation(s) on the
grounds that special circumstances exist such that requests for
new quotations would not generate a different result. Such special
circumstances should be explained by the Department Director in
a written memorandum accompanying the purchase order.
8. Exempt purchases. The following purchases, by their very nature,
are exempt from the normal purchasing guidelines and require the
special procurement practices set forth below:
a. Fuel purchases;
b. Cooperative purchase agreements;
c. Term-and-supply and annual contracts;
d. Professional services;
e. Emergency purchases;
f. Sole-source and monopoly purchases.
C. Change Orders.
1. Construction change orders approved by City Administrator. The
City Administrator is authorized to approve change orders so long
as the amount of the change order does not cause the project to
exceed the total budget amount, the approved project cost or the
available bond proceeds, whichever is greater.
2. Construction change orders approved by the Board of Aldermen. In
the event a construction change order contains costs in an amount
that exceeds the authorization of the City Administrator, the
change order must go to the Board of Aldermen for approval. In the
event change orders on a single contract accumulate to an amount
in excess of the City Administrator's authorization, all subsequent
change orders, regardless of amount, must go to the Board of
Aldermen for approval.
3. Changes to purchase orders. Change orders to purchase orders are
only allowed if the change is in the cost of the item being
purchased. No change orders are allowed for changes in quantity
or scope of the original purchase order. Changes in quantity or
scope are to be purchased with separate purchase order numbers
unless the City Administrator or his/her designee authorizes the
amendment of an existing purchase order. When the cost of an item
changes the approval requirements, a new purchase order will be
requested following the appropriate purchase procedures.
Section
140.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
140.030
AO:131
D. Fuel Purchases. Bulk fuel purchases for vehicles may be made without
approval of a purchase order, provided that three (3) quotes are
obtained and the lowest cost vendor is selected. To the extent vehicles
cannot be fueled through the City's bulk-purchasing program,
purchases may be made at any commercial service station, although
price shopping is still encouraged. Documentation of the purchase shall
be submitted.
E. Cooperative Agreements.
1. The City may contract directly with other governmental entities
(political subdivisions or municipalities, County, State or Federal)
for the purchase of items or the providing or receipt of services. If
such contract occurs, each such contract must be, in writing, and
signed by the City Administrator prior to the acquisition of the
products or provision or receipt of services. The City may also
participate in, sponsor, conduct or administer a cooperativepurchasing
agreement whereby items are procured in accordance
with a contract established by another governmental entity
provided that such contract was established in accordance with the
laws and regulations applicable to the establishing governmental
entity. [Ord. No. 15-042 §1, 9-21-2015]
2. The City Clerk shall make available to Department Directors and
authorized purchasers a list of cooperative-purchasing programs in
which the City will participate. The City Clerk shall be responsible
for notifying the Departments of current approved cooperativepurchasing
agreements and any limitation or special requirements
for their use.
3. The City Administrator will review and approve all cooperativepurchasing
agreements with other governmental agencies with
material value under twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) prior to
their use. The Board of Aldermen shall review and approve
cooperative-purchasing agreements with material value of twenty
thousand dollars ($20,000.00) or more. Competitive-bidding
procedures do not apply to such purchases made through approved
cooperative-purchasing agreements.
4. "Acceptable cooperative-purchasing agreements" are agreements
which contain the same terms, conditions, specifications and
pricing for the respective item that the department would bid and
purchase on their own.
5. Additional Board of Aldermen approval shall not be required for the
purchase of any budgeted items from approved "acceptable
cooperative-purchasing agreements".
F. Term-And-Supply And Annual Contracts Open Purchase Orders.
1. Term-and-supply contracts and annual contracts shall be bid
through each department following the same procedures
Section
140.030
OZARK CITY CODE Section
140.030
AO:132
established by this policy for other purchases based upon the
estimated material value of a contract. The department requesting
the service shall prepare a recommendation of award for the Board
of Aldermen approval for all term-and-supply and annual contracts
with material value of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) or
more based upon the annual value of the contract. All multiple-year
contracts should contain a clause explaining that the obligation
of the City to pay for goods and/or services under the contract is
limited to payment from available revenues and shall constitute a
current expense of the City and shall not in any way be construed
to be a debt of the City in contravention of any applicable
constitutional or statutory limitations or requirements concerning
the creation of indebtedness by the City nor shall anything
contained in the contract constitute a pledge of the general tax
revenues, funds or monies of the City and all provisions of the
contract shall be construed so as to give effect to such intent.
2. Once such a contract is approved, specific purchases within budget
should be made on an "as-needed" basis without further bidding
while the contract remains open, unless and until the City
terminates the contract. Any department that believes such a
contract is no longer competitive should provide such information
to the City Clerk.
G. Professional Services Contracts.
1. Contracts for professional services provided by legal counsel,
financial advisors, physicians, certified public accountants,
engineers, architects, land surveyors, brokers, consultants and
other specialized or technical services shall be obtained through
the special procurement procedures set forth in this Section.
2. Requests for qualifications for professional services shall be
submitted to the City Administrator, Administrative Projects
Director or other appropriate Department Director as assigned by
the City Administrator for review and approval prior to distribution.
When an RFQ for professional services is approved, a number of
qualified professionals will be invited to submit a proposal setting
forth their interest, qualifications and description of proposed
services. The selection committee will then proceed with the
necessary stages of the selection process including, but not limited
to, development of a selection committee, grading of proposals
based upon fair and equitable grading criteria, ranking of
interviews based upon fair and equitable criteria and negotiation of
a contract with the professionals deemed to best meet the City's
needs.
3. Unless otherwise required by State Statute and upon approval of
the City Administrator, professional services contracts under
twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) annually may be exempt from
the request for qualifications process.
Section
140.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
140.030
AO:133
4. Professional services contracts for twenty thousand dollars
($20,000.00) or more annually must be approved by the Board of
Aldermen.
H. Emergency Purchases. In case of an emergency which requires
immediate purchase of supplies or services, the City Administrator may
authorize such purchase or secure such services needed without
complying with the procedures as set out above. Department directors
faced with an emergency purchase need shall notify the City
Administrator as soon as possible. When possible (if purchase is greater
than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00)) in such an emergency, the
City Administrator shall seek approval from the Board of Aldermen at a
special or regular meeting prior to the purchase. If a timely special or
regular meeting of the Board of Aldermen is not possible, a full report of
such an emergency purchase shall be made by the City Administrator to
the Board of Aldermen as soon as possible.
I. Sole-Source And Monopoly Purchases.
1. The City Administrator or a Department Director may authorize a
sole-source purchase, at any monetary purchasing level set forth in
Section 140.030(B) above and accordingly waive competitivepurchasing
procedures, when such a request is presented in
writing by the requesting authorized purchaser with the
requisition, documenting that only a single feasible procurement
source exists. A single feasible sole source exists when:
a. Supplies or services are proprietary and only available from a
single manufacturer or a single distributor; or
b. It is determined that only one (1) distributor services the
region; or
c. When supplies or services are available at a significant
discount from a single distributor for a limited period of time;
or
d. When a project with specific circumstances requires
specialized consultant or technical services with a unique
combination of abilities or expertise.
2. In the event the amount of a sole-source purchase will exceed
twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00), it must also be approved in
advance by the City Administrator and must be approved by the
Board of Aldermen.
J. Lease Of Real Property.
1. The City may lease real property that it owns for fair market value,
if authorized by the Board of Aldermen when such property is
currently underutilized, in order to maximize the economic return
Section
140.030
OZARK CITY CODE Section
140.030
AO:134
Section 140.040. Supplement to City Purchasing and Sales Policy.
[Ord. No. 12-015 §1, 3-19-2012]
of the property to the City until such time as such property shall be
required for public usage.
2. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Administrator or designated
representative from negotiating a higher rent for a lessee of any
real property that is shown to have a unique value to such lessee
due to its configuration, accessibility or size, subject to approval
from the Board of Aldermen.
K. Sale Of Real Property.
1. The City may sell unneeded real property for fair market value with
the approval of the Board of Aldermen.
2. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Administrator or designated
representative from negotiating a higher price for sale or trade to a
buyer for any real property that is shown to have a unique value to
such buyer due to its configuration, accessibility or size, subject to
approval from the Board of Aldermen.
L. Disposal Of Surplus Goods. The City should promptly dispose of all
surplus property to the economic advantage of the City. Competitive
bidding on surplus, obsolete or unusable goods is required through
sealed bids, auction, open market sales or other available means. The
disposal of all such goods requires the approval of the City
Administrator; additional approval by the Board of Aldermen is
required for goods in excess of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) in
total material value. Trade-in opportunities should be pursued when
available to reduce the City's purchasing costs. Competitive bidding
shall only apply to a trade-in to the extent it applies to the new
purchase. Approvals of a trade-in shall be handled in conjunction with
the approval of the new purchase as dictated by the purchase price. The
City Administrator is hereby authorized to dispose of any surplus
property by transfer to any governmental agency within the State of
Missouri regardless of the value of the surplus property.
M. Purchasing Policy Supplements. In the event a specific procurement
procedure is required to be in writing when the City is purchasing an
item which is funded in whole or in part by grant funds, (i.e., CDBG),
the City Administrator shall have the authority to supplement this
Section to incorporate the special requirements of that procurement.
N. Policy Clarification. The City Administrator may clarify the provisions of
this Section in furtherance of the stated goals of this Section by written
statement, provided the City Administrator cannot alter in any way the
extent to which Board of Aldermen action is required hereunder.
A. Purchase Orders.
Section
140.030
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
140.040
AO:135
1. After approval of a requisition, the City purchase order form will be
completed by the Accounts Payable Clerk. In order to insure
expeditious processing of purchase orders, it is important that the
requisition be completed accurately by the requisitioning
department. When applicable, a copy of the Board of Aldermen
approval action, the City Administrator's approval action, the
Department Director's approval action and bid or quotation
documents shall be attached to the requisition.
2. The issuance of purchase orders or direct purchases by
unauthorized individuals or any other unauthorized purchase
(including, but not limited to, personal expenses) will not be
recognized by the City and payment for these obligations will not
be approved. Purchase orders in excess of five thousand dollars
($5,000.00) must be signed by the Department Director or the City
Administrator.
3. The purchase order will consist of three (3) copies; one (1) copy will
remain in the Finance Department (attached to the requisition) and
two (2) copies will be returned to the requisitioning department.
4. Purchase orders are classified as either "original" or "confirming"
based on whether or not the vendor has previously been notified of
the City's intent to make the purchase of goods or services.
B. Construction Contracts.
1. Construction contracts supervised by City personnel shall be bid
through the City Clerk in accordance with the procedures
established for other purchases according to the applicable price
range and specifications shall be prepared by the appropriate
department and submitted to the City Clerk for posting as
prescribed by State Statute.
2. Bid specifications and requirements for construction contracts
supervised by outside consulting services shall be prepared in
coordination with the Public Works Department. A bid package
shall be reviewed by the Public Works Department and approved by
the Department Director or designated representative. The
consultant, as determined by the Public Works Department and the
Department Director or designated representative, shall distribute
the bid package to the City Clerk for posting and distribution to
interested bidders. The City Clerk shall receive, record and
tabulate the bids and shall certify that bids were opened in
compliance with all purchasing policy requirements. The final
award of the bid shall be communicated to the successful bidder by
the City Clerk.
3. All required performance and/or bid bonds must be obtained and
documented prior to the award of the contract.
C. Product Testing/Demonstrations.
Section
140.040
OZARK CITY CODE Section
140.040
AO:136
1. Product demonstrations may be held as deemed appropriate by a
department director without prior approval of the Finance
Department.
2. Prior to taking into the City's possession any item for testing or
evaluation, departments shall contact the City Administrator for
approval. The department shall notify the vendor in writing that the
City has taken the item into possession for test purposes only and if
a purchasing decision is made, that decision will be communicated
directly to the vendor at the end of the test period. In no event shall
the retention of a test item by the City be evidence of intent to
purchase said item.
D. General Instructions For Bid Specifications.
1. General specifications.
a. Keep specifications as simple as possible while maintaining the
exactness required insuring bidders provide the quality goods
or services as required by specifications.
b. Whenever possible, identify the equipment or material
required with some name brand or known standard
specifications already on the market.
c. Specifications should promote competition. Justification must
be provided to the City Administrator for restrictive
specifications.
d. Flexibility in the specifications is desirable in instances where
new terminologies are being sought. Specifications should be
specific enough to guarantee the quality required but
sufficiently flexible to allow vendors to be creative in their
proposals.
e. Specifications should be written with clear, simple language.
f. Bid specifications and requirements shall be prepared by the
Department Director. The bid packet should be submitted to
the City Clerk with all specifications, date of opening, award
dates, requirements for potential bidders and names and
addresses or known interested bidders to receive bid notices.
The City Clerk shall be responsible for posting notice of bids,
opening and recording of bids received and reporting to the
City Administrator and the Board of Aldermen the bids
received as well as the staff's recommendation as to the award
of the bid.
2. Types of specifications. There are several ways of structuring
specifications to protect the integrity of the purchasing process and
to insure that the needs of the City are met. Different methods of
structuring specifications include:
Section
140.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
140.040
AO:137
a. Qualified products or acceptable brands list. These lists are
developed only where it is not possible to write specifications
adequate to identify the quality and performance required of
the goods or services to be purchased. Acceptable brands lists
are also used when tests that would be necessary to determine
compliance with technical specifications are lengthy, costly or
require complicated technical equipment.
b. Specifications by brand or trade name. Brand or trade names
should be used where brand name products have been found to
be superior to others for the purpose intended.
c. Specifications by blueprint or dimension sheet. Specifications
of construction projects for everything from buildings and
streets to custom-built cabinets, furniture, machines or other
equipment should be written to reference the blueprints or
dimension sheets prepared by the engineer or architect.
d. Specifications by chemical analysis or physical properties.
Specifications which include the chemical analysis or physical
properties of the goods, when clearly requested, place
responsibility on the supplier to provide exactly those items
requested.
e. Specifications by performance, purpose or use. Specifications
which include a set of performance criteria for the goods or
services required will provide flexibility for vendors to design
products or programs specifically aimed at meeting such
criteria.
f. Specification by identification with industry standards.
Specifications will often refer to industry-wide standards or to
standards set by other public jurisdictions.
g. Specifications by samples. Whenever appropriate, a sample is
always a good way to make requirements perfectly clear.
3. Delivery and performance guidelines. A contract or purchase order
that is complete in all respects and that is accepted by the parties
concerned still must produce the intended results or objectives
before it can be considered a successful or completed purchase,
The terms and conditions must clearly define the delivery and
performance requirements of the services, supplies or equipment.
a. Follow-up and expediting. Follow-up normally applies to the
monitoring of the delivery schedules to assure compliance.
Expediting, in the purest sense, involves an attempt to improve
or to reduce the contractually stipulated delivery time for
various reasons and the vendor is not legally obligated to
comply. The primary objectives of the follow-up function are:
(1) To assure full compliance by the vendor; and
Section
140.040
OZARK CITY CODE Section
140.040
AO:138
(2) To develop documentation for future evaluation of the
vendor's performance;
If delivery problems develop, there are certain
techniques that may be used to help solve them:
a. Contact the salesman for assistance;
b. Initiate collect phone calls; letters may also be
used;
c. Visit the vendor's plant. This might help solve
the problem and will assist in verifying any
reason for the delay;
d. Cancel the contract for non-performance.
Prior to the cancellation, authorization from the
Director of Finance or City Administrator must be
obtained.
4. Delinquent deliveries. When follow-up efforts have failed and the
deliveries have become delinquent, one (1) of two (2) actions must
be taken:
a. Authorize additional time for delivery; or
b. Cancel and order from other sources.
Prior to cancellation, authorization from the Director
of Finance or City Administrator must be obtained. In
all cases, the reasons for delinquent deliveries should
be documented. This information may be needed in
evaluating future bids submitted by that particular
vendor.
5. Partial deliveries. Some purchase orders may list several items. If
these items can be used separately, partial payments can and
should be authorized. However, if the separate items are part of a
system, then partial deliveries should not be authorized.
6. Substitution. To meet the contractual delivery schedule, it may be
appropriate in some situations to consider substitute items. The
specifications may cover such a possibility.
Whenever substitutions are necessary due to shortcomings of the
vendor, it is the responsibility of the purchaser to seek and obtain
an adjustment for lower prices on the substituted items.
7. Non-performance. Should the vendor fail to meet any requirements
of the specifications, the vendor can be cited for non-performance.
Recourse could include:
a. The City may exercise its rights under a liquidated-damages
clause or under the terms of a performance bond.
Section
140.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
140.040
AO:139
b. The City may obtain the needed items from another source and
charge delinquent vendor the excess difference in cost.
c. The City may terminate the contract for default if it is in the
best interest of the City and items can be obtained under more
favorable conditions from other sources.
Any such action should be approved by the Finance
Director or the City Administrator.
8. Inspection and testing guidelines. Goods and materials should be
checked at the time of receipt to detect any damage or defects.
Inspection and testing may be performed at origin or destination.
a. Reports, rejection and return authorization. Whenever an
inspection is performed, all reports to properly support claims
or actions must be thoroughly documented. A copy of the
inspection report will normally be used to substantiate
payment for the goods and verification of receipt. In the event
of rejection, for whatever purpose, certain steps must be taken
to inform and protect the rights of the vendor as well as the
City. Reasons for rejection must be listed and these reasons
should reference specific requirements of the contract.
b. Damage during shipment. It is important that all damage be
completely described on the receiving report. Any evidence of
concealed damage should be noted at this time. The carrier
should be notified immediately and a joint inspection should be
scheduled with the carrier's representative. When it is
apparent that the extent of the damage causes the goods to be
worthless, they should not be accepted.
c. Latent defects. Latent defects may be the result of damages in
transit or of failure of the manufacturer to conform to
specifications. If specific liability for the defect cannot be
determined between the carrier, the vendor or the
manufacturer, the City may have to file a claim against all
parties seeking their cooperation in resolving the situation.
9. Invoices. Vendors are to be instructed to send all original invoices
to the City of Ozark, Accounts Payable Department, P.O. Box 295,
Ozark, Missouri 65721-0295.
10. Purchases supported by grant funds. Departments shall review all
requirements for grant funds used in the procurement of items to
insure the bidding process required as a condition to receiving said
grant funds is complied with during the procurement of the item.

respecting the proposed redevelopment or urban renewal plan.
9. Following the hearing, the Board of Aldermen may approve a
redevelopment or urban renewal plan if it finds that the plan is
feasible and in conformity with the comprehensive plan for the
development of the City as a whole. A redevelopment or urban
renewal plan which has not been approved by the Board of
Aldermen when recommended by the authority may be
recommended again to it with any modifications deemed advisable.

time by the authority, provided that, if modified after the lease or
sale of real property in the land clearance or urban renewal project
area, the modification must be consented to by the redeveloper of
the real property or his/her successor or their successors in
interest affected by the proposed modification. Where the proposed
modification will substantially change the redevelopment or urban
renewal plan as previously approved by the Board of Aldermen, the
modification must similarly be approved by the Board of Aldermen.
B. As an alternative to the procedures prescribed in Subdivisions (2) and
(5) of Subsection (A), the authority may find an area to be a blighted,
insanitary or undeveloped area in need of redevelopment or
rehabilitation and simultaneously prepare a plan or adopt a plan
presented to the authority and the authority may simultaneously
recommend its finding of a blighted, insanitary or undeveloped area
and the approval of a plan to the Board of Aldermen and the Board of
Aldermen may make its finding that the area is blighted, insanitary or
undeveloped and approve the plan simultaneously. Simultaneously with
such recommendation of a finding of a blighted or insanitary or
undeveloped industrial area and recommendation of a plan to the Board
of Aldermen for approval, the authority shall submit the finding of a
blighted or insanitary or undeveloped area and the plan to the City
Planner for review and recommendation as to the conformity of the plan
to the comprehensive plan for the development of the City as a whole.
The City Planner shall submit his/her written recommendations with
respect to the finding of a blighted or insanitary or undeveloped
industrial area and the plan to the authority and the Board of Aldermen
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the findings and the plan for
review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the City Planner or if
no recommendations are received within the thirty (30) days, then
without the recommendation, the Board of Aldermen may
simultaneously approve the finding of a blighted or insanitary or
undeveloped area and approve the plan in the manner prescribed in
Subdivisions (8) and (9) of Subsection (A).

A. The authority may sell, lease, exchange or otherwise transfer real
property or any interest therein in a land clearance project area to any
redeveloper for residential, recreational, commercial, industrial or
other uses or for public use in accordance with the redevelopment plan,
subject to such covenants, conditions and restrictions as may be
deemed to be in the public interest or to carry out the purposes of this
Chapter; provided that such sale, lease, exchange or other transfer and
any agreement relating thereto may be made only after or subject to the
approval of the redevelopment plan by the Board of Aldermen. Such
real property shall be sold, leased or transferred at its fair value for
uses in accordance with the redevelopment plan notwithstanding such
value may be less than the cost of acquiring and preparing such
property for redevelopment. In determining the fair value of real
property for uses in accordance with the redevelopment plan, the
authority shall take into account and give consideration to the uses and
purposes required by such plan; the restrictions upon and the
covenants, conditions and obligations assumed by the redeveloper of
such property; the objectives of the redevelopment plan for the
prevention of the recurrence of blighted or insanitary areas; and such
other matters as the authority shall specify as being appropriate. In
fixing rentals and selling prices, an authority shall give consideration to
appraisals of the property for such uses made by land experts employed
by the authority.
B. The authority shall, by public notice published at least two (2) times in a
newspaper having a general circulation in its area of operation, prior to
the consideration of any redevelopment contract proposal, invite
proposals from and make available all pertinent information to private
redevelopers or any persons interested in undertaking the
redevelopment of an area or any part thereof which the Governing Body
has declared to be in need of redevelopment. Such notice shall identify
the area and shall state that such further information as is available
may be obtained at the office of the authority. The authority shall
consider all redevelopment proposals and the financial and legal ability
of the prospective redevelopers to carry out their proposals and may
negotiate with any redevelopers for proposals for the purchase or lease
of any real property in the land clearance project area. The authority
may accept such redevelopment contract proposal as it deems to be in
the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this Chapter,
provided that the authority has, not less than thirty (30) days prior
thereto, notified the Board of Aldermen in writing of its intention to
accept such redevelopment contract proposal. Thereafter, the authority
may execute such redevelopment contract in accordance with the
provisions of Subsection (A) of this Section and deliver deeds, leases
and other instruments and take all steps necessary to effectuate such
redevelopment contract. In its discretion, the authority may, with
regard to the foregoing provisions of this Subsection, dispose of real
property in a land clearance project area to private redevelopers for
redevelopment under such reasonable competitive bidding procedures
as it shall prescribe subject to the provisions of Subsection (A).

A. Purpose.
1. The City of Ozark has undertaken to establish this Chapter to
protect the public health and safety of its citizens and to promote
the general welfare of the citizens and animals residing within the
City. Animal ownership is encouraged and welcomed within this
City; however, strong emphasis is placed on responsible ownership
of animals. Animal owners are encouraged to respect the rights of
their fellow citizens and also those of their animals. Primary
responsibility is placed upon animal owners to properly train and/
or secure their animals so as to prevent them from causing injuries
and/or creating nuisances.
2. It is the policy of the City of Ozark animal control section of the
Public Works Department and its animal impound facility that no
adoptable animal shall be euthanized if it can be transferred to a
qualified rescue organization.
3. The City of Ozark animal control section of the Public Works
Department and the animal impound facility operates as a no-kill
facility within the parameters of and lawful constraints imposed by
virtue of its municipal status. As such, the no-kill designation does
not preclude the euthanization of any animal when such action is
necessary to ensure the public health, safety and welfare, nor does
it prohibit the euthanization of sick or injured animals when no
viable humane alternative remains.
B. Administration.
1. Administration of this Chapter shall be coordinated by the Public
Works Department through the animal control section with
oversight by the City Administrator.
2. The Department shall provide a facility and equipment for
impounding stray animals and housing confiscated animals in
cruelty or neglect cases for a limited period of time as hereinafter
specified in the policies and procedures authorized by the following
Subsection.
3. The Animal Control Officer or his/her designee shall establish and
update, from time to time, written policies and procedures which
implement the provisions of this Chapter and which govern the
administration of the animal control section and the handling of
animals that come within their purview.

or rental agreement, the lessor may notify the local law enforcement
agency of the failure of the lessee to return such motor vehicle, and the

expiration of the lease or rental agreement or within ten (10) days after
proper notice.

other form of presentment involving the transmission of account
information for the payment of money, knowing that there are
insufficient funds in or on deposit with that account for the

is designed as an integral part of the City's program of health and
sanitation to be operated as an adjunct to the City's system for
providing potable water and the City's system for providing
sewerage disposal. The City may enforce collection of such charges
by bringing proper legal action against the occupant of any
premises which has received such services to recover any sums due
for such services plus a reasonable attorney's fee to be fixed by the
court.
4. The service charge herein provided for is hereby imposed upon the
occupant of each dwelling unit receiving such service under the
provisions of this Chapter, and billing therefor shall be made to the
person contracting for City water and/or sewerage service or for
other water service or otherwise providing water service to each
such dwelling unit. In the absence of information that such person
is neither the owner nor the tenant of such dwelling unit, billing

provisions hereof, but if more than one (1) dwelling unit is served
by City water and/or sewerage service and included in one (1) such
water bill, such service charge shall be multiplied by the number of
dwelling units so served and included in said water bill. If a
dwelling unit in said City is not served with City water and/or
sewerage service for which a monthly water bill is not issued, a
separate bill for such service charge shall be issued to the owner or
occupant of such property.

4. The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the
hand and arm or by a signal light or signal device in good
mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a
hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear
of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by such light or
device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded
that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front
and rear when the distance from the center of the top of the
steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load
exceeds twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the rear limit of the body or

stop shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not
proceed until such school bus resumes motion or until signaled by its
driver to proceed.
B. Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon
the front and rear thereon a plainly visible sign containing the words
"School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in height. Each bus
shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following:
"State Law: Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading". Each school bus
subject to the provisions of Sections 304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall
be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device approved

system which has a gross vehicle weight rating of more than ten
thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted entirely in
front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels,
and which is used for the transportation of school children shall be
equipped with a crossing control arm. The crossing control arm, when
activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from the
face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on
the right side of the front bumper and shall be activated by the same
controls which activate the mechanical and electrical signaling devices
described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all
other Missouri school children who have been injured or killed during
the operation of a school bus.
D. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus
in the process of loading or unloading students upon a street or
highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical signaling devices,
in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to
communicate to drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or
unloading. A public school district has the authority pursuant to Section
304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a
divided highway of four (4) or more lanes may pull off of the main
roadway and load or unload students without activating the mechanical
and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for
other drivers to stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert
motorists that the school bus is slowing to a stop; provided that the
passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner
which indicates that drivers should proceed with caution and, in such
case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the school bus with due
caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers
at any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of
traffic, whether or not divided by a median or barrier, in such manner as
to require the passengers to cross more than two (2) lanes of traffic; nor
shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is
upon the road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is
plainly visible for at least five hundred (500) feet in each direction to
drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder and a
speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three
hundred (300) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon
other highways, and on all highways, only for such time as is actually
necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
E. The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need
not stop upon meeting or overtaking a school bus which is on a different
roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite direction on a highway
containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a
loading zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or

Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from
opposite directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is
attempting to or is making a left turn.
C. The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the
left shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the
opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close thereto as
to constitute an immediate hazard.
D. The driver of a vehicle intending to make a left turn into an alley, private
road or driveway shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching
from the opposite direction when the making of such left turn would
create a traffic hazard.
E. The City may, on any section of road where construction or major
maintenance operations are being effected, fix a speed limit in such
areas by posting of appropriate signs, and the operation of a motor
vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so posted shall be
deemed prima facie evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a

Miscellaneous Provisions
Section 380.140. Financial Responsibility Required.
A. No owner of a motor vehicle registered in this State or required to be
registered in this State shall operate the vehicle, or authorize any other
person to operate the vehicle registered, or maintain registration of a
motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle upon
the streets or the alleys of this City unless the owner maintains the
financial responsibility as required in this Section which conforms to
the requirements of the laws of this State. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the
owner has not maintained financial responsibility unless such person
has financial responsibility which covers the person's operation of the
other's vehicle. However, no owner shall be in violation of this
Subsection if he/she fails to maintain financial responsibility on a motor
vehicle which is inoperable or being stored and not in operation.
B. For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall
mean the ability to respond in damages for liability on account of
accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said financial
responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a
motor vehicle, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1) person in
any one (1) accident and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the
amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury
to or death of two (2) or more persons in any one (1) accident and in the
amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to or
destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.
C. Proof of financial responsibility may be shown by any of the following:
1. A current insurance identification card issued by a motor vehicle
insurer or by the Director of Revenue of the State of Missouri for
self-insurance. A motor vehicle liability insurance policy, a motor
vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the
name and address of the insurer, the name and address of the
named insured, the policy number, the effective dates of the policy
and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five
(5) digits of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if
the insurance policy covers five (5) or more motor vehicles shall be
satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance
identification card.
2. A certificate of the State Treasurer of a cash or security deposit
according to Section 303.240, RSMo.
3. A surety bond according to Section 303.230, RSMo.

Section 380.150. Display of False Evidence of Insurance — Penalty
— Confiscation of False Evidence.
No person shall display evidence of insurance to a Law Enforcement Officer
knowing there is no valid liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle
as required pursuant to this Article or knowing the evidence of insurance is
illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance.
If the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator
for displaying invalid evidence of insurance, the officer shall confiscate the
evidence for presentation in court. Any person convicted of violating this
Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.
Section 380.160. Alteration, Production or Sale of Invalid
Insurance Card.
No person shall alter an invalid insurance card to make it appear valid. No
person knowingly shall make, sell or otherwise make available an invalid or
counterfeit insurance card. Any person who violates this Section is guilty of
an ordinance violation.
D. Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the
insured motor vehicle or by the operator of the motor vehicle if the
proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator rather
than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall
exhibit the insurance identification card on the demand of any Peace
Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or commercial vehicle
inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident
while that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the
officer's or inspector's duties.
E. However, no person shall be found guilty of violating this Section if the
operator demonstrates to the court that he/she met the financial
responsibility requirements of Section 303.025, RSMo., at the time the
Peace Officer wrote the citation.
F. Any person who violates any provisions of this Section shall be guilty of
an ordinance violation and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished
by a fine of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than three
hundred dollars ($300.00) for each and every violation.

Section 405.410. Planned Unit Development Regulations. [Ord. No.
09-012 §1, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 10-038 §1, 12-6-2010]
j. Access to the cemetery shall be from a dedicated public street,
and all driveways and internal streets shall conform to the
standards set forth in Section 410.031 of this Title.
k. The site plan shall provide for a minimum of one (1) parking
space per acre of the cemetery. In addition parking spaces
shall be provided for cemetery structures and/or employees
when applicable.
E. Parking Regulations. Off-street parking space shall be provided in
accordance with the requirements set forth in Article V of this Chapter.
F. Dimensional Requirements. Minimum width, depth and minimum lot
size shall be provided in accordance with the requirements set forth in
Section 405.420 of this Chapter.
G. Landscaping Requirements. Landscaping shall be provided in
accordance with the requirements set forth in Article VI of this Chapter.
A. Purpose And Intent. The purpose and intent of the planned unit
development regulations are to provide for the compatible development
of two (2) or more different land uses within a single site. This
combination of traditional zoning classifications under one (1)
development is designed to permit greater flexibility and should benefit
both the developer and the public interest.
It is not the intent of these regulations to circumvent traditional zoning
classifications, increase the average density or uses beyond that which
is provided for in other Sections of the Zoning Code or allow
development which is not compatible with the principles of the
Comprehensive Plan. These regulations should provide for a greater
flexibility in the design of yards, courts, buildings and circulation than
would otherwise be possible through the strict application of district
regulations in order to provide the opportunity for:
1. A pattern of development which preserves trees, outstanding
natural topography, geologic features and prevents soil erosion.
2. A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
development.
3. Example: Usage of the method of urban planning called "coving"
opposed to conventional or grid planning methods. Some of the
advantages of a coved layout reduces construction costs by
reducing roadway, thereby lowering paving and utility line costs.
The reduction in road surface adds usable land for lots and parks.
Other benefits are increased pedestrian safety due to less road and
Section
405.390
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.410
AO:459
fewer intersections. Individual properties also gain aesthetic value
from the separate meandering setback lines, sidewalks and
roadways.
4. Open space and/or recreation areas.
5. An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and
streets and thereby lower building costs.
6. An environment of stable character in harmony with surrounding
development.
7. A more desirable environment than would be possible through the
strict application of other Sections of this Chapter.
The Planning and Zoning Commission and subsequently the
Board of Aldermen may exclude any uses within the
development and/or attach or include any restrictions or
conditions. Consideration may be given but not be limited to
the compatibility and relationship of uses with the project, the
compatibility and relationship of land uses adjacent to or in
close proximity to the proposed development, overall impact
of the proposed development upon the community and the
proposed development's conformance with the Comprehensive
Plan.
B. Application For Planned Development Zone. A planned unit
development zone may be proposed for any location in the City if it is in
accordance with the provisions of this Section.
C. Effect Of Planned Unit Development Approval. Approval of planned unit
development zone shall constitute an amendment to the Zoning Code.
Approval of a planned unit development shall supersede all existing and
prior zoning classifications. Property approved for planned unit
development shall be identified with the letters PUD followed by the
corresponding zoning case number.
D. Required Standards. All planned unit development districts shall, at a
minimum, satisfy the following standards and requirements:
1. Permitted uses. The planned unit development must contain a
minimum of two (2) different land uses or intensities from the
following list:
a. "R-1A" Single-Family Estate.
b. "R-1B" Single-Family.
c. "R-1C" Single-Family.
d. "R-2" Two-Family.
e. "R-3" Medium Density Multi-Family.
Section

f. "R-4" High Density Multi-Family.
g. "O-W" Office Warehousing District.*
h. "C-2" General Commercial.
i. "C-4" Central Business.
j. "I-1" Industrial.*
* Industrial and office warehousing uses shall be
allowed on a case-to-case basis, where this use would
be compatible to adjacent land uses.

uses subject to the provisions of this Title and approval by the
Planning and Zoning Commission: [Ord. No. 14-016 §15,
4-21-2014]
a. Cemeteries. Cemeteries shall be a conditional permanent use
and shall address the unique requirements of cemetery uses in
a manner conducive to the public health, safety and general
welfare and in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan of the
City. Cemeteries shall only be allowed when all of the following
conditions have been met:
(1) The property must be a single tract or parcel consisting of
no less than one-half (½) acre.
(2) Only endowed cemeteries will be permitted, and, prior to
approval, the applicant must comply with all relevant
Missouri statutory requirements.
(3) Prior to approval the applicant shall show documentary
proof from the Christian County Health Department that
the proposed cemetery will meet all health standards
required by the laws of the State of Missouri.
(4) The property must consist of a single tract or parcel not
divided by any street, alley or other property.
(5) An administrative site plan approval, as set forth in
Sections 410.220 through 410.230, will be required prior
to the issuance of any building permit for any cemeterytype
structure or prior to the interment of any deceased
person.
(6) Principal entryways must be clearly defined by
architecturally treated entry gates.
(7) Around the property lines of all cemeteries a ten-foot-wide
strip of land shall be devoted to a buffer between the
cemetery and the adjacent property, including street
rights-of-way. This buffer shall contain a decorative fence,
Section
405.410
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.410
AO:461
wall or hedge which is a minimum of four (4) feet in
height and a maximum of eight (8) feet in height. Fence
details and landscaping plans for the buffer strip shall be
submitted and approved with the required administrative
site plan.
(8) No signs shall be permitted except for the following:
cemetery identification sign which must be monument
style, directional signs, signs displaying the hours and
days of operation, signs displaying rules and regulations,
headstones or other memorials.
(9) No signs shall be permitted to be attached to or hung from
the required screening.
(10) Access to the cemetery shall be from a dedicated public
street, and all driveways and internal streets shall conform
to the standards set forth in Section 410.031 of this Title.
(11) The site plan shall provide for a minimum of one (1)
parking space per acre of the cemetery. In addition
parking spaces shall be provided for cemetery structures
and/or employees when applicable.
2. Development intensity. The intensity of the planned unit
development as a whole or by subarea shall not exceed that allowed
in the comparable zoning district of the allowed uses and shall
further be governed by the following:
a. For non-residential development, the intensity of development
may be regulated by:
(1) Specifying an appropriate floor area ratio(s) (FAR),
(2) Specifying maximum square footage or gross leasable
area,
(3) Specifying setbacks, height and bulk restrictions,
(4) A combination of such restrictions for the project as a
whole or for components or subareas within the project.
In addition, non-residential development plans
may specify performance standards to be
imposed on the project and restrictions
regarding the location and nature of
commercial and other non-residential activities.
b. The residential density of a project shall be computed in
accordance with the following formula:
The maximum number of dwelling units permitted shall be
computed based on the requirements of Chapter 405 Article
Section
405.410
OZARK CITY CODE Section
405.410
AO:462
II. The permitted number of dwelling units may be distributed
in any manner over the residential portion of the project
consistent with the intent and provisions of this Article. The
preliminary development plan shall specify distribution of
residential density for the project as a whole or for subareas
within the project. In making its determination regarding the
distribution of residential densities, the Planning and Zoning
Commission and Board of Aldermen may consider the
compatibility of residential densities with other uses within the
district as well as outside the district, including the impact of
residential densities on public facilities and services.
(1) Public facilities. The preliminary development plan shall
specify conditions, restrictions and standards relating to
the timely provision of necessary public facilities. In
making its determinations regarding such conditions,
restrictions and standards, the Planning and Zoning
Commission and Board of Aldermen may consider the
adequacy of existing facilities, the timely provision of
adequate facilities, the impact of the proposed
development on existing and/or planned facilities and the
overall costs to the community.
(2) Access to public thoroughfares. The preliminary
development plan shall specify the location and general
design of ingress and egress to the project along with any
proposed access restrictions. The Planning and Zoning
Commission and Board of Aldermen may impose such
access standards and restrictions as are necessary to
protect the integrity and function of the City's
thoroughfare system and to insure the safe and efficient
circulation of vehicles and pedestrians within the Planned
Development District. In making its determination
regarding such access standards and restrictions, the
Planning and Zoning Commission and Board of Aldermen
may consider the classification and function of the
thoroughfare system, existing and projected volumes, the
condition and design of the affected thoroughfares, the
effect of the proposed development on traffic flow and
circulation patterns, and the consistency with the City of
Ozark Comprehensive Plan and other adopted plans and
policies. (See Ozark Design Standards.)
(3) Parking. Unless specifically modified by the planned unit
development amendment, the parking requirements of
Article V of this Chapter shall apply. Reductions in parking
requirements shall be approved only if it can be
demonstrated that parking demand will be less due to the
design and character of the planned unit development.
Section
405.410
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.410
AO:463
(4) Signs. The placement of all signs within the planned unit
development shall be regulated by Chapter 407 of this
Code. This shall include the size, location, illumination,
structural integrity and relation to surrounding uses. Any
regulations concerning signs shall be so stated in the
planned unit development amendment. Modifications to
the sign regulations shall be approved only if the general
intent of the regulations is adhered to.
(5) Landscaping and perimeter treatment. The preliminary
development plan shall specify the design and
arrangement of landscaping (see Article VI of this
Chapter) on all open space areas in the planned
development district and on all buffer (see Article VI of this
Chapter) and perimeter areas provided to mitigate the
impact of the project upon adjoining properties and/or to
achieve an appropriate transition between land uses and
densities.
E. Procedure For Planned Unit Development Designation. Applications for
planned unit development shall be processed pursuant to a three (3)
step review process. This procedure shall include:
1. Pre-application conference.
a. Not less than forty-five (45) days before preparing and
submitting the preliminary plat to the Planning and Zoning

A. Purpose. The conditional use permit procedure is intended to provide
the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Aldermen with
discretionary review of requests to establish or construct uses or
structures which may be necessary or desirable in a zoning district, but
which may have the potential for negative or deleterious impact on the
health, safety and welfare of the public. The purpose of the review is to
determine whether the proposed location of the use or structure is
appropriate and whether it will be designed, located and operated so as
to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse impacts upon the community and
other properties in the vicinity. The Board of Aldermen may impose
conditions upon such uses and structures that are intended to avoid,
minimize or mitigate adverse impacts upon the community and other
properties in the vicinity. The Board of Aldermen may deny requests for
a conditional use permit when it is evident that a proposed use or
structure will or may cause harm to the community or injury to the
value, lawful use and reasonable enjoyment of other properties in the
vicinity.
B. Conditional Uses Authorized. The Planning and Zoning Commission
may recommend and the Board of Aldermen may authorize the
establishment of those conditional uses that are expressly permitted as
a conditional use in a particular zoning district. No conditional use shall
be authorized unless such conditional use to be granted complies with
all of the applicable provisions of this Chapter.
C. Application For Conditional Use Permit. An application for conditional
use permit shall be filed with the City on a form developed by the
Department of Planning and Development and shall include the
following information at a minimum:
1. Description of the proposed conditional use.
2. Statement as to why the proposed use will comply with the
applicable standards.

Board of Aldermen its recommendation containing specific findings
of fact on the proposed conditional use and any conditions,
safeguards and restrictions that the Commission recommends be
imposed to ensure compliance with the standards set forth in
Section 405.500 to avoid, minimize or mitigate potentially adverse
effect of the conditional use on the community and properties in the
vicinity.
E. Board Of Aldermen Action On Conditional Use Permit. The Board of
Aldermen may, by ordinance, authorize the issuance of a conditional use
permit for such use as recommended by the Commission or may reverse
or modify such decision by a majority vote of the full Board of Aldermen.
In authorizing said conditional use permit, the Board of Aldermen may
impose additional conditions or restrictions as it may determine
necessary to ensure compliance with the standards set forth in Section
405.500 to avoid, minimize or mitigate potentially adverse effect of the
conditional use on the community and properties in the vicinity. All such
conditions or restrictions shall be set out in the ordinance approving
the conditional use permit.
F. Permit Validity.
1. Any conditional use permit authorized shall be nullified if any of the
conditional uses have not been complied with and/or have been
violated.
2. Any conditional use permit authorized shall be nullified and void if
the applicant ceases to conduct the approved use for a period of six
(6) months. If the applicant ceases to conduct the approved use for
a period of six (6) months or more, he or she must reapply for a
conditional use permit to re-establish the prior use requested.

3. Any conditional use permit authorized shall be nullified and void if
the applicant should move or leave the location where the use was
originally approved.
4. If the applicant wishes to continue with a prior approved use, he or
she shall have to reapply for approval of a conditional use permit at
the new location of choice.
5. The approval of a conditional use is connected to the original
applicant to whom it was issued and not to the structure for which
the conditional use was granted.
G. Conditional Use Standards. A conditional use permit shall be granted
only if evidence is presented at the public hearings that the conditional
use will comply, to the extent applicable, with the following standards:
1. The conditional use will be consistent with the policies and intent of
the Ozark Comprehensive Plan and the Ozark zoning regulations.
2. The conditional use will not increase flood or water damage hazard
to adjoining properties.
3. The conditional use will not generate noise that exceeds the sound
levels that are typical of uses permitted in the district.
4. Adequate access roads or entrance and exit drives will be designed
and provided to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic
congestion at the site.
5. Street right-of-way and pavement width in the vicinity of the
conditional use is or will be adequate for traffic reasonably
expected to be generated by the proposed use.
6. Glare of stationary or vehicular lights from the conditional use will
not adversely affect the character of the neighborhood and if such
lights will be visible from a residential district, measures to shield
or direct lights to mitigate glare are proposed.
7. The conditional use will not have any substantial adverse effect
upon the use or enjoyment of adjacent and nearby property or
conditions affecting the public health, safety and welfare.
8. The conditional use will be designed, constructed and operated so
as not to interfere with the development and use of adjacent
property in accordance with the applicable zoning district
regulations.

a conditional use permit, the structure shall meet all fire, health,
building, plumbing and electrical requirements of the City of
Ozark.

Section 405.570. Non-Conforming Uses of Land. [Ord. No. 09-012
§1, 4-6-2009]
A. Within the districts established by this Chapter or by amendments that
may later be adopted, there exists lots, premises structure and uses of
land which were lawful before this Chapter was effective or amended,
but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
provisions of this Chapter or future amendment.
B. It is the intent of this Chapter to permit these non-conformities to
continue until they are removed (except as otherwise herein provided),
but not to encourage their survival. Such non-conformities are declared
by this Chapter to be incompatible with the permitted structures and
uses of land and structures in the districts involved. It is further the
intent of this Chapter that such non-conformities shall not be enlarged
upon, expanded or extended except as provided for herein, nor to be
used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district.
C. A non-conforming use of land, premises or structure shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded or extended after the effective date of this
Chapter.
D. If a non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming
use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of
repairs and maintenance and is declared by any duly authorized official
to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
E. A non-conforming use or a non-conforming building or structure which
is non-conforming only because of failure to provide required off-street
parking spaces or loading berths shall have all the rights of a
conforming use or structure.
A. Where, on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter,
a lawful use of land exists that is no longer permissible under the
regulations and standards of this Chapter as adopted or amended, such
use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to
the following provisions:
1. No such non-conforming use of land shall be enlarged, increased or
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter.

2. No such non-conforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other portion of the lot or tract of land occupied on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter.
3. If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than thirty (30) consecutive days, any subsequent
use of such land shall conform to the resolutions and standards set
by this Chapter for the district in which such land is located.
4. A non-conforming use of land shall not be changed to any other use
except to a use permitted in the district in which the land is located.
A. Where, on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter,
a lawful structure exists that could not be built under the regulations
and standards of this Chapter as adopted or amended by reasons of
restrictions on lot area, lot coverage, floor area ratio, heights, yards,
spacing between buildings or other characteristics of the structure or
its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it
remains lawful subject to the following provisions:
1. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its non-conformity. On a non-conforming structure work
may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on
ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring or plumbing, provided that the volume of such
building or the size of such structure as it existed at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter shall not be
increased.
2. Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than sixty percent (60%) of its replacement cost at the time of
destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with
the provisions of this Chapter.
3. Should any structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations and
standards for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
A. Where, on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter,
a lawful use of a structure or a premises exists that is no longer
permissible under the regulations and standards of this Chapter as
adopted or amended, such use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions:
1. No existing building or structure devoted to a use not permitted by
this Chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged,

Section 405.600. (Reserved)
extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or altered except in
changing the use of such building or structure to a use permitted
in the district in which it is located. On a structure devoted to a
non-conforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve
(12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs or replacement of
non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not to
exceed ten percent (10%) of the then current replacement value of
the structure, provided that the volume of such building or the size
of such structure as it existed at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Chapter shall not be increased.
2. Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of
the building or structure which were manifestly arranged or
designed for such use at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Chapter, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy land outside building or structure.
3. If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of
building or structure or of any premises may be changed to another
non-conforming use provided that the Planning and Zoning
Commission, either by general rule or by making findings in the
specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate
or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such changes the Planning and
Zoning Commission may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards in accord with the provisions of this Chapter.
4. Any building or structure, or any premises, in or on which a nonconforming
use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter
conform to the regulations and standards of the district in which
such building, structure or premises is located and the nonconforming
use shall not be resumed.
5. When a non-conforming use of a building or structure or of a
premises is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive
months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year
period, the building or structure or the premises shall not
thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations and
standards of the district in which it is located.
6. Where non-conforming use status applies to the use of a building,
removal or destruction of the building or structure shall eliminate
the non-conforming use status and any use of a new building or
structure must be a use permitted in the district in which it is
located. "Destruction", for this purpose, is defined as damage to an
extent of more than sixty percent (60%) of the replacement cost at
time of destruction.

Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements
Section 405.610. Off-Street Parking General Requirements. [Ord.
No. 09-012 §1, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 10-028 §1, 9-7-2010; Ord. No.
10-035 §1, 11-1-2010; Ord. No. 13-026 §§1 — 2, 7-15-2013]
A. Applicability. All developments in all districts, except "C-4" Central
Business, shall provide sufficient off-street parking spaces solely for the
parking of motor vehicles in operating condition of patrons, occupants
or employees in accordance with the requirements of this Article. Each
application for a building permit, site plan or other zoning request
involving the construction, expansion or alteration of off-street parking
areas shall include plans indicating the minimum number of parking
spaces required in this Section. Plans shall include information as to the
location and dimensions of off-street parking spaces and the means of
access to the spaces. The administrative official shall not approve any
application until he/she determines that the requirements of this
Section are met.
1. The basic requirement of all off-street parking is to exist on the
same lot of the primary structure and/or use. However, if the
number of off-street parking spaces required by this Chapter
cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal
use associated with these parking spaces is located, then spaces
may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the
provisions of this Section. These off-site spaces are referred to in
this Section as satellite parking spaces.
2. All such satellite parking spaces must be located within four
hundred (400) feet of the use or building which is the subject of an
application for joint use of parking. Provided however, that no offstreet
parking facility for a structure or use permitted in a
commercial or manufacturing district shall be located in a
residential zoning district. The principal use shall be permitted to
continue only as long as its parking requirements are met.
3. The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this
Section must present satisfactorily written evidence that he/she
has permission of the owner or other persons in charge of the
satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The written evidence
shall at a minimum consist of a perpetual, mutual parking/access
easement submitted for review by the City Planner and duly filed
and recorded with the Christian County Recorder; said easement
shall include a specific time schedule for the availability of parking
by use. The demand for available parking created by each of the
uses must occur at separate times, thereby eliminating a conflict of
need.
B. Principal Use. Off-street parking is hereby prohibited as a principal use
in all residential zoning districts. Whenever the proposed principal use
Section
405.610
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.610
AO:497
of any parcel of land in a non-residential zoning district is off-street
parking, the owner and/or developer shall apply for a building permit,
site plan or other zoning request involving the construction, expansion
or alteration of off-street parking areas. Plans shall include information
as to the location and dimensions of off-street parking spaces and the
means of access to the spaces. The administrative official shall not
approve any application until he/she determines that the requirements
of this Section are met. [Ord. No. 13-041 §1, 10-21-2013]
C. Building Or Use Enlarged.
1. Commercial. Whenever a building constructed or a use established
after the effective date of this Article is changed or enlarged in
floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating
capacity or otherwise to create a need for an increase of ten
percent (10%) or more in the number of existing parking spaces,
such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or
change. Whenever a building or use existing prior to the effective
date of this Article is enlarged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or
more in floor area or in the area used, said building or use shall
then and thereafter comply with the parking requirements set forth
herein.
2. Residential. An approved surface/driveway addition in a
residentially zoned district shall not enclose or cover any surface
utilities such as water meters, manhole covers, phone boxes, etc.
The total surface area of driveway shall not exceed thirty-five
percent (35%) of the total area of the front yard calculated from the
front elevation of the principal structure to the front and side
property lines. The approved driveway addition may be of any
composition provided that the addition is constructed of threeeighths
(?) inch base rock, asphalt, pavers or concrete. A base rock
surface will not be permitted where stormwater runoff is capable of
transporting the rock to the public right-of-way. Base rock
surfacing shall consist of three-eighths (?) inch maximum size
rock, crushed rock, limestone or dolomite and if this surface is used
it must be bordered with landscaping timbers. An addition utilizing
base rock or pavers shall be properly prepared with removal of
existing vegetation and top soil and placement of a weed barrier

9. Retention and protection of large trees. The landscape plan shall
provide, to the maximum extent practical, for the preservation of
existing trees. It is the intent to discourage the practice of
removing all existing trees in the improvement or development of
properties within the City. Plans which provide for clear cutting of
existing trees shall be approved by the Planning and Development
Department only if the developer or contractor establishes by clear
and convincing evidence that the prohibition of clear cutting
substantially and unreasonably restricts his/her ability to develop
the property and that the development will not be economically
viable unless clear cutting is permitted. The following criteria also
applies:
a. Every development shall retain all existing trees eighteen (18)
inches in diameter or more unless the retention of such trees
would unreasonably burden the development.
b. No excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be
undertaken within the drip line of any tree eighteen (18) inches
in diameter or more and no impervious surface (including, but
not limited to, paving or buildings) may be located within
twelve and one-half (12½) feet (measured from the center line
of the trunk) of any tree eighteen (18) inches in diameter or
more unless compliance with this Subsection would
unreasonably burden the development.
c. If space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be
so used because of the requirements of paragraphs (a) or (b)
and, as a result, the parking requirements set forth in the City
Of Ozark Code of Ordinances cannot be satisfied, the number
of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces
"lost" because of the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b), up to
a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required spaces.

the landscape plan and the amount of credit shall be indicated. Any
trees that receive credit and are later removed shall be replaced with

variance if it concludes that strict enforcement of the ordinance would
result in practical difficulties or undue hardship for the applicant and,
by granting the variance, the spirit of the ordinance will be observed,
public safety and welfare will be secured and substantial justice will be
done. The Board of Adjustment may reach these conclusions if it finds in
writing that:

condition of the specific property involved would result in undue
hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience if the strict letter of the regulations were carried
out;
2. The conditions of which the applicant complains is one suffered by
the applicant and would not be applicable to other property in the
same zoning classification;
3. The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return or the
applicant cannot make reasonable use of his property if strict
compliance with the regulations is required;
4. The hardship relates to the applicant's land, rather than personal
circumstances;
5. The alleged hardship has not been created by any person presently
having an interest in the property;
6. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the area
in which the property is located; and

signs (electrically, environmentally or mechanically activated), except
those that blink, flash or are animated by lighting in any fashion that
would cause such signs to have the appearance of traffic safety signs

to comply with such notice, the Code Official is hereby authorized to
cause removal of such sign copy, and any expense incident thereto shall
be paid by the owner of the building, structure or ground or which the
sign is located.
J. Non-Conforming Signs. Any sign legally existing at the time of the
passage of this Chapter that does not conform in use, location, height or
size with the regulations of the property use in which such sign is
located shall be considered a legal non-conforming use or structure and
shall be permitted to continue provided that it is maintained in good
condition, but shall not be:

Subdivision Regulations and Requirements
Section 410.310. Physical Problem Areas. [Ord. No. 09-012 §1,
4-6-2009]
In order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the people,
the Planning and Zoning Commission will reject any proposed subdivision
located in an area subject to periodic flooding. Whenever a subdivision is
proposed to be located in an area having poor drainage or other adverse
physical characteristics and impairment, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may approve the plat, provided the developer binds himself/
herself legally to make such improvements as, in the judgment of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, will render the subdivision substantially
safe and otherwise acceptable for the intended use. In this case the
developer shall post with the Commission a surety performance bond,
running to the City of Ozark or other security acceptable to the Planning
and Zoning Commission, sufficient to cover the cost of such improvements
as estimated by officials having jurisdiction.
Section 410.320. Comprehensive Plan — Compliance. [Ord. No.
09-012 §1, 4-6-2009]
The subdivision layout shall conform to the official thoroughfare plan or
other elements of the Comprehensive Plan. Whenever a tract to be
subdivided embraces any part of a highway, thoroughfare or other major or
collector street so designated on said plan, such part of such public way
shall be platted by the developer in the location and at the width indicated
in the plan.
Section 410.330. Sidewalks and Infrastructure. [Ord. No. 09-012 §1,
4-6-2009; Ord. No. 16-020 §1, 5-2-2016; Ord. No. 18-056,
10-15-2018]
A. Purpose. The purpose of these requirements is to ensure continuity in
the existing sidewalk system and compliance with the following goals:
1. Providing pedestrian circulation routes throughout the City,
offering safe and accessible routes for the health, safety, and
welfare of the public;
2. Promoting minimum Americans with Disability Act guidelines for
all sidewalk or pathway installations, existing and proposed;
3. Promoting attractive and well-constructed sidewalks or pathways
that correspond to the character, aesthetic qualities, natural,
environmental, and historical features of developing or existing
neighborhoods;
Section
410.310
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
410.330
AO:603
4. Connecting to existing and projected sidewalks or pathways
whenever the opportunity arises to ensure an interconnected
pedestrian system; and
5. Ensuring that all development actively implements the building of
sidewalks for new construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation.
B. Sidewalks.
1. Sidewalks shall be required for the full length of street or right-ofway
frontage of any proposed new residential, commercial or
industrial development along all existing and proposed residential
collectors, primary collectors, secondary arterials, primary
arterials and commercial streets as defined in the Ozark Missouri
Major Thoroughfare Plan. Sidewalks shall also be required along
one (1) side of an existing or proposed residential street.
2. Existing developments shall be required to install sidewalks
consistent with the regulations of this Section if either: (a) the
existing footprint area of the building structure is expanded by
thirty percent (30%) or more; (b) improvements affecting more
than twenty percent (20%) of the total existing development site
area; or (c) existing public sidewalks are within five hundred (500)
feet of the existing development's property line.
3. The location of sidewalks along residential streets shall be
determined at the time of preliminary platting. The Director of
Public Works shall have the authority to determine sidewalk
locations along residential streets to ensure compliance with the
Pedestrian Master Plan and the potential impact on sidewalk
accessibility and usability. Additional right-of-way may be required
to be dedicated if needed to meet this requirement.
4. All infrastructure, public or private, including sidewalks shall
comply with the latest edition of the City of Ozark Design
Standards for Public Improvements and the City of Ozark Standard
Drawing Details for Public Improvements. All new curbs which are
constructed in the City and all existing curbs which are a part of
any reconstruction shall comply with this Section. In order to
enable persons using wheelchairs to travel freely and without
assistance, at each crosswalk a ramp shall be built into the curb so
that the sidewalk and street blend to a common level. Where,
because of surrounding buildings or other restrictions it is
impossible to conform the slope to this requirement, the ramp shall
contain a slope with as shallow a rise as possible under the
circumstances not to exceed ten percent (10%).
C. Optional Fee In Lieu Of Construction.
1. If the property owner feels a hardship exists that hinders the
construction of a sidewalk, the property owner may submit a
request to pay a fee in lieu of construction of sidewalks together

09-012 §1, 4-6-2009]
with such information and studies as the Director of Public Works
may deem necessary to consider the request. Upon filing a
complete application, this request will be reviewed or denied by
the Director of Public Works, or his/her designee, on the following
criteria:
a. The City plans to construct public improvements in the area
which would result in damage or destruction of the proposed
sidewalk;
b. The cost to construct the proposed sidewalk would be at least
twenty-five percent (25%) greater than the average cost of
sidewalk construction; or
c. The street is edged by a shoulder and ditch rather than a curb
and gutter.
If the Director of Public Works, or his/her designee, denies the request,
the property owner may appeal to the Planning and Zoning
Commission within ten (10) days of the decision by filing a request
for appeal with the City Clerk in writing. The commission shall review
the denial only on a claim that the denial was arbitrary and capricious
and a submission of sufficient facts and evidence to establish that the
Director of Public Works has acted in such a fashion. If the Planning
and Zoning Commission finds by an affirmative majority vote that the
Director of Public Works did act in an arbitrary and capricious fashion,
a fee in lieu shall be allowed.
2. The fee shall be calculated as a fixed amount per linear foot as
approved by the Board of Aldermen.
3. The fee shall be held by the City of Ozark, Missouri, Finance
Department in an account to be used for sidewalk construction
only.
4. Use Of Fees Paid In Lieu Of Sidewalk Construction. At a time
determined by the City Administrator and/or the Director of Public
Works, collected fees in lieu of construction shall be used to
construct sidewalk in the same City Ward as the property from
where the fee was collected if it is not used to construct a sidewalk
adjacent to said property.
A. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
location and physical character of the proposed subdivision and for the
type of development contemplated in compliance with applicable
zoning ordinances or regulations as set out in Chapter 405.

Section 415.010. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and
Purposes. [Ord. No. 09-012 §1, 4-6-2009]
A. Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the State of Missouri has in
Section 89.020, RSMo., delegated the responsibility to local
government units to adopt floodplain management regulations
designed to protect the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore,
the Board of Aldermen of the City of Ozark, Missouri, ordains as
follows.
B. Findings Of Fact.
1. Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood
hazard areas of the City of Ozark, Missouri, are subject to
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief
and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
2. General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused
by:
a. The cumulative effect of development in any delineated
floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities;
and
b. The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
C. Statement Of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize those losses
described in Section B(1) of this Section; to establish or maintain the
community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(b) by
applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood
heights or velocities;
Section
410.510
OZARK CITY CODE Section
415.010
AO:612
Section 415.020. General Provisions. [Ord. No. 09-012 §1, 4-6-2009;
Ord. No. 10-037 §1, 12-6-2010]
2. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that
serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of
initial construction; and
3. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the
intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.
A. Lands To Which Chapter Applies. This Chapter shall apply to all lands
within the jurisdiction of the City of Ozark identified as unnumbered A
Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Christian County
dated December 17, 2010 on map panel numbers 29043C0070C,
29043C0080C, 29043C0085C, 29043C0090C, 29043C0095C,
29043C0230C and 29043C0235C as amended and any future revisions
thereto. In all areas cover by this Chapter, no development shall be
permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development
permit granted by the Board of Aldermen or its duly designated
representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the Board of
Aldermen or the designated representative may reasonably impose for
the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the
inhabitants of the City and as specifically noted in Section 415.040.
B. Floodplain Administrator. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
appoint a representative of the Planning and Development Department
to serve as the Floodplain Administrator.
C. Compliance. No development located within the special flood hazard
area of this community shall be located, extended, converted or
structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this
Chapter and other applicable regulations.
D. Abrogation And Greater Restrictions. It is not the intent of this Chapter
to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or
deed restrictions. However, where this Chapter imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail. All other
ordinances inconsistent with this Chapter are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.
E. Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be
liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body and shall not be
deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State
Statutes.
F. Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study.
Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be
increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge

AO:613
Section 415.030. Administration and Implementation of the
Floodplain Management Ordinance. [Ord. No. 09-012 §1, 4-6-2009]
openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas
outside unnumbered A Zones or land uses permitted within such areas
will be free from flooding or flood damage. This Chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City of Ozark, any officer or employee thereof
for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this Chapter or
any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
G. Severability. If any Section, clause, provision or portion of this Chapter
is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate
jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter shall not be affected thereby.
H. Guidance For Unnumbered A Zones. In dealing with Flood Hazard
Boundary Maps (FHBM) and Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), flood
areas designated as "Zone A" may be encountered. When converting to
the regular phase of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the
FIRM for the community may show the special flood hazard areas
without assigned 100-year base flood elevations. The lack of elevations
on the flood maps does not remove the requirement for elevating
structures. The City is required under Section 60.3(b)(4) of the NFIP
regulations or local floodplain ordinance/resolutions to obtain, review
and reasonably use any base flood elevation (BFE) and floodway data
available from a Federal, State or other source. These data are to be
used by the City to require that:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to
or above the base flood level; and
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated or floodproofed to or above the base flood elevation.
A. Floodplain Development Permit (Required). A floodplain development
permit shall be required for all proposed construction or other
development, including the placement of manufactured homes, in the
areas described in Section 415.020(A). No person, firm, corporation or
unit of government shall initiate any development or substantial
improvement or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a
separate floodplain development permit for each structure or other
development.
B. Designation Of Floodplain Administrator. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall appoint a representative of the Planning and
Development Department to administer and cause to be implemented
the provisions of this Chapter.
C. Duties And Responsibilities Of Floodplain Administrator. Duties of the
Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to:

H. Enforcement Action. Should there be violations, the applicant and/or
his/her on-site contractor will be informed both verbally and in writing
by a representative of the City's Department of Code Enforcement. The
inspection report will provide a timetable for correcting deficiencies. If
no action is taken within the designated timetable, the City's
Department of Code Enforcement may issue a stop work order until the
deficiency is corrected. Should a permit applicant wish to appeal a
decision of the Department of Code Enforcement, they may appeal to
the Floodplain Administrator.
I. Tracking And Recording Floodplain Development Permits. The
Department of Planning and Development shall establish and keep on
file the records pertaining to floodplain management activities in the
City Of Ozark. Files will consist of both blank and completed forms

Aldermen or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court
as provided in Section 89.110, RSMo.
D. Floodplain Management Variance Criteria. In passing upon such
applications for variances, the Board of Aldermen shall consider all
technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other Sections of this Chapter and the following criteria:
Section
415.050
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
415.060
AO:623
1. The danger to life and property due to flood damage;
2. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
6. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood
damage, for the proposed use;
7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
8. The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and
11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets
and bridges.
E. Conditions For Approving Floodplain Management Variances.
1. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre
or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
(2) through (6) below have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
2. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, the State inventory of historic places or local inventory of
historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity
will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
3. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
Section
415.060
OZARK CITY CODE Section
415.060
AO:624
4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
5. Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. A showing of good and sufficient cause,
b. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result

which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.

A. Purpose And Intent. The design, size, number, and placement of signs
contribute to the overall environment of the buildings, streetscape, and
historic district. These sign regulations are specifically designated to
ensure compatibility and vehicular and pedestrian scale. Public interest
is served in ensuring that signs are well designed, carefully placed and
properly maintained in accordance with the overall desired character of
any historic district, landmark, or property.
It is not the intent of these standards to create uniformity of signage or
to inhibit creative initiative. Nothing contained in this Section shall be
construed to prohibit an individual from exercising rights protected by
the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
No sign shall be attached to any utility pole, public light standard, trees,
rocks, natural features, fences, fence posts, fence railing, benches,
flower boxes, perimeter or privacy walls, accessory structures, trash
enclosures and any other public facility located within the public rightof-
way.
B. Sign Content. The content of signs is not regulated by this Chapter, and
the content of the message to be conveyed shall not be considered in
making decisions pursuant to this Chapter.

C. General Provisions. It shall be unlawful to erect, alter, or remove, any
sign in the area governed by this Chapter unless a Certificate of
Appropriateness is granted by the Preservation Commission, except as
may be authorized by the Planning and Development Department
pursuant to the authority of this Chapter.
D. Buildings With Multiple Tenants Or Uses. A master sign plan may be
considered for a multi-use or multi-tenant building. This plan shall be
submitted and approved by the Preservation Commission. The plan
shall indicate how all signage will be consistent or well-coordinated in
terms of lighting, colors, fonts, composition of materials, location in
relation to the building and proportions. Upon approval of a master sign
plan, the Planning and Development Department shall be authorized to
issue sign permits (upon application) for individual signs upon being
deemed consistent with the approved master signage plan, without the
need to obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness.
E. Master Sign Plans. Any sign permit application if consistent with an
approved uniform sign plan, is exempt from individual approval by the
Preservation Commission, and the Planning and Development Office is
authorized to issue sign permits after application, provided they are
consistent with the uniform sign plan.
F. Administrative Approval. The Planning and Development Office may
use the criteria established in this Section as a basis for administrative
approval. In addition, those same criteria may be referenced in the
administrative decision as a basis to approve, conditionally approve, or
disapprove sign permits.
G. Specific Criteria For Signs. In addition to criteria specified for
Certificates of Appropriateness by the Ozark Historic Preservation
Ordinance, the Preservation Commission may consider the following
criteria, which are specifically applicable to signs:
1. The size, scale and design of the sign shall be compatible with the
size scale and design of the property, building, or site upon which it
is to be located.
2. Signs shall be designed and placed so as to appear an integral part
of the building design; not to obscure any significant architectural
features of the building, property or site.

AO:652
6. Signs should be maintained if they are determined to be an original
part of a building as it was originally constructed.
7. Signs that are not original to a building, may have acquired
significance by virtue of their age, design, materials and
craftsmanship. Such signs should be maintained and preserved.
8. Existing signs may not be appropriate due to disguising,
obstructing or detracting from the significant facade elements.
Existing signs shall be reviewed by the Preservation Commission
before any repairs, alterations or replacement.
9. Existing non-conforming signs are allowed to remain in their
existing unaltered state if they are in sound condition. Nonconforming
signs may be reviewed by the Preservation Commission
before any maintenance, repairs, alterations or replacement are
completed to determine actions to bring the sign into compliance.
10. All sign attachments shall be designed in such a way that the
smallest possible amount of a building's historic fabric is damaged.
This includes mounting sign attachments on brick buildings
through the masonry joints, rather than through the masonry itself.
H. Design Requirements.
1. Proportionality. Signs shall be sized in proportion to the building.
Notwithstanding the maximum areas allowed under the terms of
this Chapter, an individual sign may be disapproved if it is found to
be excessive or non-proportional in relation to the building on
which it is placed or which it serves.
2. Sign Materials.
a. Exposed surfaces of signs must be constructed of or appear to
be constructed of metal, glass, stone, concrete, brick, cloth, or
wood, or similar approved materials. If synthetic materials are
authorized, they shall have the same finished appearance as
the materials specified in this paragraph.

appropriate materials for signs and shall not be permitted.
3. Professional Fabrication. Hand-written, hand-painted, hand-made
or other unprofessionally fabricated signs may not be approved for
use.

Section 430.100. Monitoring of Discharges. [Ord. No. 09-038 §1,
10-19-2009]
3. A person is considered to be in violation of this Chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such
a connection to continue.
A. Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations. The
Department of Public Works may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present
imminent and substantial danger to the environment or to the health or
welfare of persons or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the Department of Public Works may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this Chapter may have their MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The Department of Public Works will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the
Department of Public Works for a reconsideration and hearing.
C. Offense Committed. A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this Section
without the prior approval of the Department of Public Works.
A. Applicability. This Section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
B. Access To Facilities.
1. The Department of Public Works shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this Chapter as often
as may be necessary to determine compliance with this Chapter. If
a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
Section
430.070
OZARK CITY CODE Section
430.100
AO:666
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
2. Facility operators shall allow the Department of Public Works ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept
under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater
and the performance of any additional duties as defined by State
and Federal law.
3. The Department of Public Works shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the department to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
4. The Department of Public Works has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
5. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the
Department of Public Works and shall not be replaced. The costs of
clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
6. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Department of Public Works
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater
discharge permit and of this Chapter. A person who is the operator
of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater
associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person
denies the Department of Public Works reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this Chapter.
7. If the Department of Public Works has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged and he/
she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may
be a violation of this Chapter or that there is a need to inspect and/
or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this Chapter or any order issued
hereunder or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the Department of Public Works
may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Christian County
Circuit Court.

a stop work order or citation. Issuance of a stop work order shall result
in a suspension of all construction activity on the site, except for work
related to remediation of the violation, until the violation is resolved to the
City's satisfaction. The stop work order shall also suspend the right of the
permittee, applicant, owner, contractor, developer or any related entity to

any portion of the site, terminate City utility services to the site, and to
suspend all inspections and plan review related to any other work that is
taking place on the site, until such time as the violation is resolved to the
City's satisfaction. Stop work orders shall specifically state the provisions of
this Chapter or the land disturbance permit being violated. Any person, who
shall continue any work in or about the site after having been served with
a stop work order, except such work related to remediation of the violation,

order may be lifted upon the presentation and construction of an accepted
plan to avoid sediment runoff and the removal of any such sediment as
ordered. All stop work orders that are issued by the Director must be posted

a summons to court may be issued to the responsible party. The summons
to court shall contain all the information required by the City Code and
will be enforced and issued through the Municipal Court. The Director shall
have the option of causing a summons to Municipal Court to be issued
immediately upon discovery of a violation, in lieu of a NOV.

Section 515.050. Continuation of Street Names. [Ord. No. 11-033
§1, 10-3-2011]
The assignment of continuous street names, or street names assigned to
grid lines, shall be given to new thoroughfares that have the same basic
alignment with an existing street. To help reduce the total number of names
within the system, new street names will not be issued to streets that fall
within an address grid line with an established name. New street names
can only be issued if a current linear street name cannot be used, or
to designated collector and arterial thoroughfares that have a special or
unique alignment and configuration. Street names shall not be changed due
to a change in direction of the street, nor shall a new prefix be used for
those streets that meet the criteria for using a directional indicator in the
street name.
Section 515.055. Addressing Agency. [Ord. No. 11-033 §1,
10-3-2011]
The Christian County Emergency Services Board (CCESB) is hereby
appointed as the addressing authority for the City of Ozark and shall utilize
the existing E 9-1-1 addressing service to assign street address numbers
Proposed street names and name changes shall be compared with
existing street names of both the Municipality and County name index
to determine if the proposed street name would create a duplicate
name.
B. Similar Or Confusing Spelling Of Street Names Not Permitted. To
eliminate confusion resulting from diction problems when individuals
are reporting street names under stress, similar (text or phonetic) or
confusing spelling of street names shall not be approved.
C. Length Of Street Names. Street names of twelve (12) or fewer
characters are encouraged to maximize visibility of street signs. New
street names shall not contain more than sixteen (16) characters, which
does not include either the direction (north, east, etc.) or the street type
(lane, drive, etc.). Names shall not contain hyphens, apostrophes, or
other non-letter characters. New street names shall not contain more
than two (2) words, exclusive of direction or street type.
D. Use Of Directional Indicators In Street Names. Directional indicators,
such as north and west, shall not be included in street name proposals
as a prefix or suffix to a street name.
E. No separate name is to be used for a cul-de-sac that provides street
frontage for three (3) or less lots or units. The name shall be the same
as that of the intersecting street.
F. In circumstances where a street changes directions abruptly, generally
greater than forty-five degrees (45°), a new street name shall be
assigned.

in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein. The administrative staff
of the CCESB shall be responsible for the day-to-day administration of
this Chapter, and for making the initial decision on any matter under
this Chapter. All buildings used for residential, commercial, institutional or
governmental purposes shall be provided with an address identifying the
building.

Section 515.065. Private Rights-of-Way. [Ord. No. 11-033 §1,
10-3-2011]
In situations where three (3) or more structures are located on a private,
un-named right-of way, the private drive shall be named. Once a street
A. The assignment of address numbering within the City of Ozark shall
utilize the grid addressing system as follows:
1. Gridalities. The purpose of the address numbering grid is to
provide a more uniform and orderly spacing of block numbers.
Each new subdivision parcel, each pad in a mobile home park,
commercial unit, apartment, condominium, or town house shall be
assigned an address on the street providing access to the parcels.
The grid system allows a series of numbers to be assigned for
approximately every five hundred (500) feet. The address grid
includes the NW, NE, SW, and SE quadrants of the City and uses
primary routes within the City as zero baselines.
2. Address grid baselines. E 9-1-1 address numbering system shall be
on a grid system dividing the address area into quadrants
establishing zero baselines from which numbers are assigned. The
grid baseline identifies the point at which block numbers will
change in increments of one hundred (100).
3. Application of address grid. Application of the address grid will
vary, as few streets run directly north, south, east or west. Most
streets run at angles to the cardinal directions and often change
direction. The primary consideration for assigning addresses on
streets that diverge from the cardinal directions is the even
distribution of address numbers. The grid shall be used to assist in
assigning numbers by orienting the grid parallel to the direction of
the street. In this manner, an appropriate distance between
address numbers can be maintained.
4. Streets — frequency of numbers. Every twenty-five (25) feet of
ground or fraction of a lot less than twenty-five (25) feet fronting
upon each street shall have one (1) number. This will yield
approximately four hundred (400) numbers per mile, two hundred
(200) odd on one side and two hundred (200) even on the other
side.

name has been approved, a standard street name sign shall be installed at
the owner's expense. The structures shall then be numbered according to
the foregoing principles using the grid numbering method. Nothing in this
Chapter shall cause any private drive to become public property or to be in
any way dedicated or to be deemed dedicated.
Section 515.070. Loop or Circular Streets. [Ord. No. 11-033 §1,
10-3-2011]
The properties fronting circle streets shall be numbered without regard to
the change in direction. Continuous even or odd numbers shall be assigned
around the outside, and the appropriate opposite even or odd number shall
be assigned continuously around the inside of the circle. In some cases this
will result in fewer numbers on the inside of the circle. Adjustments will be
made where necessary to provide numbers with similar numeric value for
properties which face each other along the street.
Section 515.075. Corner Lots. [Ord. No. 11-033 §1, 10-3-2011]
When assigning numbers to corner lots, the front door shall be used. When
the front door is obscured or if the structure is best reached for emergency
purposes by the driveway, assign the property number based on where the
driveway falls on the road.
Section 515.080. Curvilinear Streets. [Ord. No. 11-033 §1,
10-3-2011]
To assign numbers, consideration must be given to the overall direction of
the entire street and the pattern of existing and future development. The
street numbers shall be determined from the grid axis that is most nearly at
a right angle to the overall direction of the street.
Section 515.085. Single-Family Lots. [Ord. No. 11-033 §1,
10-3-2011]
Addresses for single-family dwelling lots shall be assigned consecutively on
the odd and even sides of the street.
Section 515.090. Mobile Home Parks. [Ord. No. 11-033 §1,
10-3-2011]
Addresses for home sites in a single street/road access mobile home park
are assigned consecutively on the odd and even sides of the street. A
separate street address number shall be assigned for each mobile home pad
or lot.
Section 515.095. Multi-Family Apartments. [Ord. No. 11-033 §1,
10-3-2011]
Multi-family housing units, such as apartments and condominiums, will
have a separate whole number street address assigned to each individual
Section
515.065
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
515.095
AO:711
building. Street addresses shall be assigned based on the normal criteria
for assignment. Within the individual structures, separate dwelling units
shall be assigned apartment numbers as secondary location indicators.
Structures having multiple levels with dwelling units placed one above
another will receive a consecutive whole unit number assigned from the left
to right as viewed from the common entrance. The lowest floor shall begin
with 101, 102, 103 etc., until all units have been assigned unit numbers.
Successively higher floors shall begin with successively higher increments
of hundreds. The complete official street address for each unit will consist
of the street address, street name, and unit number.
Section 515.100. Commercial Development. [Ord. No. 11-033 §1,
10-3-2011]
Commercial developments shall be numbered just as apartments, with one
(1) street address applied to each individual building, with additional
addresses for the buildings consisting of suite numbers. Commercial
buildings will be numbered with the middle of the building determining the
number of the building with offices or businesses in the building numbered
as suites (e.g. 625 E. Mt. Vernon, Suite 34).
Section 515.110. Appeal Process. [Ord. No. 11-033 §1, 10-3-2011]
The approval of all street naming shall be accomplished by the
administrative staff of the CCESB in accordance with this Chapter. In the
event any person is aggrieved by a final decision of the administrative staff
of the CCESB under this Chapter, then he/she/it shall have the right to an
appeal hearing before the CCESB by requesting an appeal hearing within
ten (10) days after the final decision by the administrative staff of CCESB.
The aggrieved party shall have the right to appear in person or through
an attorney at the appeal hearing and to submit documents or records for
consideration by the Board. The decision of the Board shall be final.

10. For failure to test backflow assemblies in accordance with the
City's Cross-Connection Control Policy.
G. The discontinuance of the supply of water to a property, as provided in
this Chapter for any reason shall not prevent the City from pursuing any
other lawful remedy for the collection of monies due from the water
user or property owner. In the event that it becomes necessary for the
City to file actions in the Circuit Court of Christian County to collect
delinquent amounts owed for water services, fees and penalties, in
addition to any other provable damages, the City shall be allowed to
collect a reasonable attorney's fee and the costs of the litigation. [Ord.
No. 14-006 §2, 2-3-2014]
H. Only an employee, or a person authorized by the City, may turn water
on or off and all applicants and water users are expressly forbidden to
do so.
A. Readiness To Accept. Before installing a service extension and
providing water, the City may require the applicant to pipe his/her
home and be in readiness to accept the service.
B. Continuity Of Service. The City will make all reasonable efforts to
supply continuous, uninterrupted service. However, the City shall have
the right to interrupt service for the purpose of making repairs,
connections, extensions or for other necessary work to the municipal
water system. Efforts will be made to notify water users whenever
possible who may be affected by such interruptions.
C. Services. All permit and inspection fees shall be acquired prior to
construction. The owner or water user applicant will be responsible for
the construction and cost to install the meter assembly and all
appurtenances necessary to establish service. All such construction
must conform to the latest edition of the Design Standards, Standard
Drawing Details and the Construction Specifications.
D. Right To Inspect. Representatives of the City shall have the right at all
reasonable hours to enter upon the water user's premises to read and

AO:789
test meters, inspect piping, and to perform other duties for the
maintenance and operation of service, or to remove its meters and
equipment upon discontinuance of service by the water user.
E. Piping Work To Be Inspected. All piping work in connection with pipe
and services connected with the City's main shall be submitted to the
inspection of the City before such underground work is covered up. The
inspector shall present proper credentials when conducting a site
inspection. Whenever the City determines that a plumbing job is
obviously defective, although not in direct violation, the City may
require that it be corrected before the water will be turned on. The user
shall conform to the type of materials and the standard of workmanship
as indicated in the Design Standards, Standard Drawing Details and the
Construction Specifications. All such materials and workmanship shall
be subject to the approval of the City.
F. Intercepting Tank Required For Large Customers. Service pipes shall
not be connected to the suction side of pumps. The supply for use of a
character requiring a large quantity of water within a short period will
not be permitted except through intercepting or intermediate storage
tanks.
G. Check Valves, Flush Valves, Backflow Assemblies And Vacuum
Breakers. Water users having boilers or hot water systems connected
with mains of the City must have a check valve and/or a backflow
assembly for boilers in the supply pipe to the boilers and water heating
systems, together with a release valve at some point between the check
valve and the heating system. All water users are hereby cautioned
against danger of collapse of boilers since it is sometimes necessary to
shut off the supply of water without notice and, for this reason, a
vacuum valve should be installed in the steam lines to prevent collapse
in case the water supply is interrupted. The City, however, will not be
responsible for accidents or damages resulting from the imperfect
action or failure of said valves. Backflow assemblies shall be required to
be installed in all in-ground sprinkler and/or irrigation systems and
shall be inspected annually and the results of such tests shall be
provided to the City.
H. Applicants Having Excessive Requirements. In the event of an applicant
whose water requirements are bound to exceed the City's ability to
supply it from existing physical assets without adversely affecting
service to other water users, the City will not be obligated to render
such service. The applicant may install additional private supply/
storage systems required for any excessive water requirements. The
supply/storage system shall adhere to the City's standards and longrange
planning efforts of the municipal water system. Final approval of
a supply/storage system shall be determined by the Director. All cost
incurred for such improvements and for future maintenance shall be
the responsibility of the applicant.

I. Customer's Duty Regarding Service Lines. The water user's service
pipe and all connections and fixtures attached thereto shall be subject
to the inspection of the City before the water will be turned on, if the
City so elects, and all properties receiving a supply of water and all
service pipes, meters and fixtures, including any and all fixtures within
any improvements or buildings on said properties, shall at all
reasonable hours be subject to inspection by any duly authorized
employee or agent of the City.
J. Additional Requirements.
1. All service pipes shall be laid at all points at least thirty (30) inches
below the surface of the ground and shall be placed on firm and
continuous earth so as to give unyielding and permanent support.
The City shall not be responsible for damage of any service lines
due to freezing or excavation activities. They shall not be laid in
sewer ditches. It shall be installed in the trench with a minimum of
ten (10) feet of horizontal and eighteen (18) inches vertical
separation provided between water lines and sewer lines, in
undisturbed earth, separate from any other trench wherein are laid
gas pipe, sewer pipe or other utility, public or private. Such service
line shall not pass through premises other than that to be supplied
unless the City shall so agree in writing.
2. Water user shall, at his/her own cost and expense, make all changes
in the service pipe required or rendered necessary on account of
changes in the street grades, relocation of mains or other causes.
3. No fixture shall be attached to, or any branch made in, the service
pipe between the main of the City and the meter.
4. A separate and independent water service shall be provided for
every building.

inconvenience caused by reason of any break, leak or defect in, or
by water escaping from service pipes, or from fixtures on the
premises of the owner or water user. The water user shall be billed
in the usual manner for the cost of all such water according to the
rate schedule of the City as provided for in these rules and
regulations.

off water to any water user or to any property, except in the case of
escaping water.
L. Water Users Requiring Uninterrupted Supply. The City will endeavor to
give reasonable service, but does not guarantee a sufficient or uniform
pressure or an uninterrupted supply of water, and water users are
cautioned to provide sufficient storage of water where an absolutely
uninterrupted supply must be assured, such as for steam boilers, hot
water heating systems, gas engines, etc. Fixtures or devices taking a
supply of water directly from the service pipes, depending upon the
hydraulic pressure of the pipe system of the City for supplying same
under working pressure, would do so at the risk of the parties making
such attachments, as the City will not be responsible for any accidents
or damages to which such fixtures or devices are subject.
A. Meters Owned By City. Meters will be owned, inspected, tested and
kept in proper operating condition by the City, without cost to the water
user, except that such water user shall pay a water capacity fee as set
forth in these rules and regulations, which shall not be refundable. The
complete record of tests and histories of meters will be kept if deemed
necessary by the City. Meter tests will be made according to methods of
the American Waterworks Association by the City as often as deemed
necessary by the City.
B. Meter Accuracy. Service meter errors which do not exceed two percent
(2%) fast or slow shall be considered as being within the allowable
limits of accuracy for billing purposes. The percentage of error will be
considered at that arrived at by taking the average of the error at full
load and that at ten percent (10%) load, unless a water user's rate of
usage is known to be practically constant, in which case the error at
such constant use will be used.
C. Meter Location. Meters shall be set in an accessible place on the
outside of buildings, except when otherwise permitted by the City. All
meters shall be set horizontally and never connected into a vertical
pipe. Meters outside of the buildings shall be placed in meter boxes
approved by the City. Refer to the Standard Drawing Details for
additional information.
D. Requested Meter Tests. Meter tests requested by water users shall be
performed without cost to the water user if the meter is found to be in
excess of two percent (2%) fast. Otherwise, the water user for whom
the requested test was made will be charged for the cost of making the
test.
E. Water User's Responsibility. The water user shall be responsible for and
shall pay for any damage to the meter or component parts thereof,

tear.
A. Application for extensions of water mains and lines shall be made by the
person desiring such extension. If said application is approved, the
main or line shall be extended provided that:
1. The applicant shall pay all construction, engineering, easement
acquisition and legal expense of such extension.
2. Before granting to an applicant the right to make such extension or
before entering into an agreement with the applicant, the City shall
first determine that the extension will not materially affect in an
adverse manner the service rendered to any existing customer of
the City. In the event the City determines, based upon information
furnished by its employees and consultants, that such extension
would have a material adverse effect upon existing water users of
the City, the City shall not permit such extension or may require the
applicant to make additional improvements to the water system to
prevent adverse effects of the proposed extension. Final approval
of any proposed additional improvements shall be determined by
the Director.
3. The construction and materials shall be inspected by a qualified
inspector furnished by the City. The inspector shall present proper
credentials when conducting site inspections. Upon satisfactory
completion and testing, the improvements shall be dedicated, free
and clear of all encumbrances, to the City, unless the City deems
that it should be designated as private.
4. All new private water main extensions shall have an approved
backflow assembly installed in a vault as close to the City's water
main as possible before water service shall be granted.

5. The design of all main extensions or improvements shall conform to
the most recent edition of the Missouri Department of Natural
Resources Public Water Program, Design Guide for Community
Public Water Supplies, the Design Standards, Standard Drawing
Details and the Construction Specifications and must be approved
by the City. A permit to construct, issued by MODNR, will be
received prior to construction, alteration or extension of the
municipal water system.
6. No main shall be constructed that conflicts with an approved
systemwide or local master plan. When such master plan requires a
size of pipe or facility that exceeds the domestic or fire protection
demands of the area to be served by the main extension, the
applicant may request reimbursement for the documented
difference in cost included by conforming to the master plan. The
applicant may receive reimbursement from future development for
oversized infrastructure as development occurs. Future
developments would be required to pay a capacity charge for
connection to existing facilities that have been oversized. The
charge would be collected by the City and reimbursed to the
original developer that installed the oversized improvements. The
amount charged would be based on the amount of capacity the
future development would require. The Board shall review and
approve all such requests. The City has the right to refuse
reimbursement to the applicant at the discretion of the Board.
A. In the event that a mobile home court/multiple living units desires
service, then the owner shall be required to enter into a agreement with
the City whereby all units of such mobile home court/multiple living
units are served by one (1) water meter. The bill will be based on the
total actual usage but the total billing shall not be less than the
minimum calculated for each unit. The amount of the water meter
deposit/water capacity fee shall be determined by the City as set forth
in these rules and regulations.
B. City of Ozark mobile home relocation permit is required when any
existing mobile home that was connected to the City's water and/or
sewer is to be removed from its existing site. The purpose of this permit
is to ensure that existing water and sewer connections are properly
capped to prevent potential water loss and/or stormwater inflow. [Ord.

other substances which the City, the MODNR, or the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has notified the user is a fire hazard or a
hazard to the system.
2. Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids
or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with
other wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment
process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public
nuisance, or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the
sewage treatment plant including, but not limited to, cyanides in
excess of two (2) mg/1 as CN in the wastes as discharged to the
public sewer.
3. Any waters or wastes having:
a. A five (5) day biochemical oxygen demand greater than three
hundred (300) parts per million by weight; or
b. Containing more than three hundred fifty (350) parts per
million by weight of suspended solids; or
c. Having an average daily flow greater than two percent (2%) of
the average sewage flow of the City, shall be subject to the
review of the Director.
Where necessary in the opinion of the Director, the owner shall
provide, at his/her expense, such preliminary treatment as may
be necessary to:
(1) Reduce the biochemical oxygen demand to three hundred
(300) parts per million by weight; or
(2) Reduce the suspended solids to three hundred fifty (350)
parts per million by weight; or
(3) Control the quantities and rates of discharge of such
waters or wastes. Plans, specifications, and any other

described substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely in
the opinion of the Director that such wastes can harm either the
sewers, sewage treatment process or equipment, have an adverse
effect on the receiving stream, or can otherwise endanger life, limb,
public property or constitute a nuisance. In forming his/her opinion as
to the acceptability of these wastes, the Director will give consideration
to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows
and velocities in the sewers, construction material of the sewers, nature
of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment
plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant,
and other pertinent factors. The substances prohibited are:
1. Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than one hundred
fifty degrees Fahrenheit (150°F), sixty-five degrees Centigrade
(65°C) at the point before entering the public sewer, or any sewage
having a temperature which will result in a waste with a
temperature at the introduction into the sewage works which
exceed one hundred four degrees Fahrenheit (104°F) (40°C), or
which would cause interference at the sewage treatment plant.
2. Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred (100) mg/1 or
containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at
temperatures between thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit (32°F) and
one hundred fifty degrees Fahrenheit (150°F), zero to sixty-five
degrees Centigrade (0 and 65°C).

similar objectionable or toxic substances; or wastes exerting an
excessive chlorine requirement to such degree that any such
material received in the composite sewage at the sewage treatment
Section
710.070
OZARK CITY CODE Section
710.070
AO:806
works exceeds the limits established by the Director for such
materials.
6. Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odorproducing
substances in such concentrations exceeding limits
which may be established by the Director as necessary, after
treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of
the State, Federal or other public agencies of jurisdiction for such
discharge to the receiving waters.
7. Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration
as may exceed limits established by the Director in compliance with
applicable State or Federal regulations.
8. Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of nine point five (9.5)
or less than four point zero (4.0) or having any other corrosive
property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures,
equipment and personnel of the sewage works.

a. Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, Fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride
and sodium sulfate).
b. Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions).
c. Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine
requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant
load on the sewage treatment works.
d. Unusual volume of low or concentration of wastes constituting
"slugs" as defined herein.
10. Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that
the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements
of other agencies having jurisdiction over the receiving waters.
E. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances
or possess the characteristics enumerated in Subsection (D) above, and
which in the judgment of the Director may have a deleterious effect
upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance,
the Director may:
1. Reject the wastes; or
Section
710.070
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
710.070
AO:807
2. Require pre-treatment, at the owner's expense, to reduce
objectionable characteristics or constituents to an acceptable
condition for discharge to the public sewers; and/or
3. Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge by
developing discharge limitations.
If the Director permits the pre-treatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and
equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the
Director and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes,
ordinances and laws.
F. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable
wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Director and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. All grease traps and interceptors shall be
cleaned out periodically as required to ensure that grease is maintained
within the trap or interceptor and not entering the public sewer. The
scheduling and costs of the cleaning is the responsibility of the owner.
Documentation of the cleaning and removal of grease from the grease
trap shall be provided to the inspector as requested. This includes
under-sink grease traps. Facilities required to have a grease trap shall
maintain records of the cleaning and maintenance of all grease traps on
a manifest kept at the facility. Failure to provide the manifest and
cleaning/maintenance records when requested by the inspector may
result in a citation. If a problem occurs in the public sewer due to
grease, the facilities connected to that portion of the public sewer will
be subject to inspection including a review of the cleaning/maintenance
records. Any facility that has not cleaned the grease trap properly, or
the grease trap is not functioning properly, may be held liable for any
damage or costs created by the grease in the public sewer and/or may
receive a citation. Any existing facility that does not currently have a
grease trap or has an inadequate grease trap that has reoccurring
problems with discharges of grease into the public sewer shall be
required to install an adequate grease trap. The inspector shall be
allowed access to the grease trap for the purpose of inspection during
normal business hours. Sizing and installation of grease traps shall
comply with the latest edition of the Design Standards as well as
current International Building and Plumbing Code requirements.
G. Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be continuously maintained in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner(s) at his/her expense.
H. When required by the Director, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control

the owner at his/her expense and shall be maintained by him/her so as
to be safe and accessible at all times.
I. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this Section shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods
for the Examination of Water and Wastewater" published by the
American Public Health Association and shall be determined at the
control manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at said
control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be called out by
customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon
the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life,
limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is
appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.)
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from twenty-four (24) hours composites of all outfalls whereas
pHs are determined from periodic grab samples. An industry shall
provide regular sampling of sewer discharge if deemed appropriate by
the City due to a violation or suspicion of illegal discharge. The required
frequency of the sampling will be determined on the magnitude of the
issue. The owner shall be responsible for the scheduling and costs of
the sampling.
J. No statement contained in Subsections (A) through (I) shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement
between the City and any industrial concern whereby any industrial
waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the City for
treatment, subject to payment therefore by the industrial concern.

to be served by the main extension, the applicant may request
reimbursement for the documented difference in cost incurred by
conforming to the master plan. The applicant may receive
reimbursement from future development for oversized
infrastructure as development occurs. Future developments would
be required to pay a capacity charge for connection to existing
facilities that have been oversized. The charge would be collected
by the City and reimbursed to the original developer that installed
the oversized improvements. The amount charged would be based
on the amount of capacity the future development would require.
The Board shall review and approve all such requests. The City has
the right to refuse reimbursement to the applicant at the discretion
of the Board.
