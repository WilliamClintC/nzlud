delinquency is sent to the recipient of the service or the recipient’s representative or estate, the
City or its contractor on behalf of the City may use any lawful means allowed to a private party
for collection of an unsecured delinquent debt. The City may also use the authority of Section
17-8(3) to collect unpaid service charges of this kind from delinquent recipients of services who
are owners of taxable property in the City, or areas served by the City for emergency services.
The powers conferred by this section are in addition and supplemental to the powers conferred
by any other law for a City to impose a service charge or assessment for a service provided by
the City or contracted for by the City.

charge or fee on the owner, lessee, or occupant of property, or any of them, for a governmental

Article 3. Eminent Domain Legislation
Sec. 2-31. General.
(1) The purpose of this article is to establish the guidelines that the City Council will use in
the future regarding the utilization of eminent domain or condemnation within the City
of New Brighton.
(2) In 2005, the United States Supreme Court decision in Kelo v. City of New London
determined that a local government can utilize eminent domain to enhance its tax base
and that economic development may qualify as a “public use” if a legislative body
makes such a determination. The United States Supreme Court emphasized in its
opinion that state or local municipalities may place further restrictions on its utilization
of eminent domain or condemnation authority.
(3) In 2006, the Minnesota Legislature amended Chapter 117 of the Minnesota Statutes in
response to the Kelo decision to further restrict the power of the state, its agencies, and
municipality’s use of eminent domain and condemnation for private or economic
development.
(4) The New Brighton City Council has determined that it is in the best interest of its
citizens to limit the utilization of eminent domain or condemnation.
Sec. 2-32 Legal Authorization.
The City of New Brighton is a municipal corporation and a subdivision of the State of
Minnesota organized and operating under Minnesota law, and is authorized by Minn. Stat,. Secs.
412.211 and 465.01 and Ch. 469 to acquire real estate by exercising the power of eminent
domain under and pursuant to Minn. Stat. , Ch. 117.
Sec. 2-33. Rules and Procedures.
(1) In exercising the authority to utilize eminent domain or condemnation, the City
Council’s termination of public use or public purpose shall be limited to the uses and
purposes stated in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 117.
(2) Three public hearings must be held by the City Council prior to a formal vote
authorizing the initiation of eminent domain or condemnation proceedings. An
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the entire City Council shall be
required to make any finding that the proposed condemnation is for a proper public
purpose and is not primarily for the purpose of economic development.
(3) In exercising the powers of eminent domain or condemnation under Minnesota Statutes,
a two-thirds vote of the entire City Council shall be required to authorize the initiation of
eminent domain or condemnation proceedings. Only the New Brighton City Council
may use eminent domain or condemnation to take property from private owners for a
2-7

Sec. 6-148. Seizure.
(1) Immediate Seizure.
A. The Animal Control Officer or any public safety officer may immediately seize any

provision of Section 6-146 or 6-147, and the person is charged with a subsequent violation
relating to the same dog, the Animal Control Officer must seize the dog. If the owner is
convicted of the crime for which the dog was seized, the court shall order that the dog be
destroyed in a proper and humane manner and the owner is responsible for paying the cost of
confining and destroying the animal. If the person is not convicted of the crime for which the
dog was seized, the owner may reclaim the dog upon payment to the City of a fee for the care
and boarding of the dog. If the dog is not reclaimed by the owner within seven days after the
owner has been notified that the dog may be reclaimed, the dog may be disposed of as provided
under Minn. Stat. § 35.71, subdivision 3. The owner is liable to the City for the costs incurred in
confining, impounding, and disposing of the dog.
(4) Disposition of Seized Dogs.
A. Right to a Hearing. The owner of any seized dog has the right to a hearing before an
impartial hearing officer. The notice and hearing requirements in Section 6-144 will
apply to a hearing requested under this Section. Any hearing requested under this
Section will be held within fourteen days of the request. In the event that the seizure is
upheld by the hearing officer, actual expenses of the hearing up to a maximum of $1,000
will be the responsibility of the dog owner. The hearing officer will issue a decision
within ten days after the hearing. The decision will be hand-delivered to the dog’s owner
or delivered via registered mail as soon as practical and a copy will be provided to the
Animal Control Officer and City Manager.
B. Security. A person claiming an interest in a seized dog may prevent disposition of
the dog by posting security in an amount sufficient to provide for the dog’s actual cost of
care and keeping. The security must be posted within seven days of the seizure
inclusive of the date of seizure.
Sec. 6-149. Restrictions on Dog Ownership.
(1) Dog ownership prohibited. Except as provided in paragraph 3 of this Section, no person

the household is permitted to own a dog.
(3) Dog ownership prohibition review. Beginning three years after a conviction under Section
6-149 (1) that prohibits a person from owning a dog, and annually thereafter, the person may
request in writing to the City Manager that the Animal Control Officer review the prohibition.
The Animal Control Officer may consider such facts as the seriousness of the violation or
violations that led to the prohibition, any criminal convictions, or other facts that the Animal
Control Officer deems appropriate. The Animal Control Officer may rescind the prohibition
entirely or rescind it with limitations. The Animal Control Officer also may establish
conditions a person must meet before the prohibition is rescinded, including, but not limited to,
successfully completing dog training or dog handling courses. If the Animal Control Officer
rescinds a person’s prohibition and the person subsequently fails to comply with any limitations
imposed by the City or the person is convicted of any animal violation involving unprovoked
bites or dog attacks, the Animal Control Officer may permanently prohibit the person from
owning a dog in this state.
Sec. 6-150. Destruction of Dog in Certain Circumstances.

food practices. However, the keeping of certain types of fowl can create unintended negative
impacts, including noise and odors that are not typical of urban environments. The regulations
within this Article aim to address the negative impacts that result from keeping fowl within an
urban environment. Additionally, in recognition that bees have health implications for certain
individuals, this Article establishes minimum hive standards and notification requirements.

The keeping of fowl shall not exceed a total of six per property on all property throughout the
City.

Sec. 6-203. Outdoor Butchering.
No outdoor butchering of fowl is permitted.
Section 6-204. Minimum Coop Size.
Under no circumstances shall coop size be less than three (3) square feet per fowl kept.
Section 6-205. Coop Standards.
All coops shall be:
(1) Clean and sanitary;
(2) Made of sound construction and craftsmanship;
(3) Be maintained so they remain structurally sound;
(4) Protect the fowl from the weather;
(5) Be located in the rear/back yard and meet the most restrictive of the following setbacks:
a. 5 feet from side and rear property lines.
b. 25 feet from residences on adjacent and nearby lots.
c. A setback from adjacent and nearby residences a distance at least equal to the
distance the coop is placed from the residence on the subject property.
d. 25 feet from a lake, wetland, pond, stream, tributary, drainage ditch or the like.
6-23
e. All other structure or building setbacks required under the Zoning Code.
(6) Not be located inside a primary residence or place of business; and
(7) Follow best practices for nests.
Section 6-206. Restraining Fowl.
All fowl shall be prohibited from running at large off of the owner’s property.
Section 6-207. Roosters.
All roosters are prohibited.
Section 6-208. Hive Notification.
Any property owner who keeps bees shall notify the City’s Code Compliance Inspector, or
designee, of all hives the person intends to establish within the City.
Section 6-209. Water Source Required.
Any property owner who keeps bees shall provide and maintain a nearby, designated water
source.

Editor’s Notes
City Code-Chapter 6
Animals and Fowl
Introduction. The main purpose of this Chapter is to regulate the keeping of dogs and cats.
General Comments. As with all other parts of the codification, the language in this Chapter has been
simplified and made gender neutral.
Also, the Articles have been rearranged so that “Large Animals” is the last Article. Consequently, all of
the Articles dealing with dogs and cats now will follow one another.
New Materials 6-3.1. Humane Disposal. Expanded the City’s ability to humanely dispose of an animal
to include diseased animals as wells as vicious animals.
Confinement and Cleanup - 6-16 - 6-17. Previously, a separate Article covered confinement and
cleanup for dogs and then this same information was repeated in another Article for cats. This edition of
the codification combines these sections into one Article.

Editor’s Notes
Chapter 9
Fire Protection and Prevention
Introduction. This Chapter establishes the City’s Fire Service and also adopts the MN Uniform Fire
Code.
General Comments. As with all other parts of the codification, the language in this Chapter has been
simplified and made gender neutral. Also, the recodification follows a format which assigns general
responsibility to the lead administrator, this case the Fire Chief, rather than to site specific individuals.
The idea behind the “general” approach is to prevent the Code from becoming outdated. The term “Fire
Department” is replaced with “Fire Service” to better reflect the public safety organization now in place.
Section 9-16. The recodification eliminates any mention of the Fire Prevention Bureau and simply
declares fire prevention as a duty of the Fire Service acting under the direction of the Fire Chief.
Section 9-17. The original text permitted the City Manager to assign members of the “building and
planning department” to serve as inspectors. The recodification opens the assignment up to “other
employees”.
Section 9-33. The City Manager is added as a review authority when the Fire Chief denies an application
for modification of the Fire Code. The City Council remains as the final authority for an appeal.
Section 9-35. These definitions (municipality and corporation counsel) are deleted as they are covered in
the general provisions of Chapter 1.

Editor’s Notes
Chapter 11
Garbage and Trash
Introduction. The main purpose of this Chapter is to regulate the collection of garbage and trash.
General Comments. As with all other parts of the codification, the language in this Chapter has been
simplified and made gender neutral.
Sections 11-10 and 11-34. The deadlines mentioned in both these sections has been clarified by adding
the word “calendar”. For example, “14 days prior” has been edited to read “14 calendar days prior”.
Sections 11-38 and 11-53. The specified fees now will be established by resolution. This change in
procedure will make it easier to keep the Code up-to-date.

access to locked buildings by public safety personnel, thereby enhancing the safety and security of the
building’s occupants.
Sec. 13-171. Requirements.
Where access to a multiple dwelling building is restricted because of secured entrances, the Department
of Public Safety is authorized to require a key box to be properly installed and maintained in an accessible
location as close as possible to the main entrance door. The key box must not be located at a height over
six (6) feet above the finished grade but high enough to prevent water and snow from entering or blocking
it. The key box installation must be approved by the Department of Public Safety. The key box shall be

Sec. 15-510. Findings and Purpose.
Studies conducted by the Minnesota Attorney General, the American Planning Association, and cities such
as St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Hopkins, Minnesota; Ramsey, Minnesota; Rochester,
Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California; and Seattle, Washington have examined the
impacts that adult establishments have in those communities. These studies have concluded that adult
establishments have adverse impacts on the surrounding neighborhoods. These impacts include increased
crime rates, lower property values, increased transiency, neighborhood blight, and potential health risks.
Based on these studies and findings, the City Council concludes:
(1) Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set forth in the preamble.

governed by geographic, licensing, and health requirements.

opportunity to locate in the City.
(4) Minnesota Statutes, Sections 462.357 and 412.221 allow the City to adopt regulations to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare.

Division 2. Public Health Regulations
Sec. 15-521. Findings and Purpose Conduct.
In order to further the substantial interest of public health, the following findings are made regarding the
need to regulate commercial premises, buildings, and structures that are conducive to the spread of
communicable disease of danger to persons:
(1) The experience of other cities establishes that:
A. Certain commercial premises, buildings, and structures, or parts thereof, by reason of the
design and use of the premises, buildings, or structures are conducive to the spread of
communicable disease of danger to persons frequenting such premises, building, or structures,
as well as to the general public, and
B. The risk of spreading infectious and contagious diseases can be minimized by regulating such
commercial premises, buildings, and structures.
(2) The experience of other cities where such commercial premises, buildings, and structures are present
indicates that:
A. The risk of spreading the sexually transmittable disease known as Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is increased by the presence of the premises, buildings, and
structures; and
B. The increased risk is because the design or use of such premises, buildings, and structures, or
parts thereof can facilitate high-risk sexual conduct.
(3) Medical publications of the Center for Disease Control of the United States Department of Health and
Human Services indicate that the sexually transmittable disease known as AIDS is currently irreversible
and uniformly fatal. Medical research has further established that the risk factors for obtaining or
spreading AIDS are associated with high-risk sexual conduct.
(4) Certain commercial premises, buildings, and structures, or parts thereof, by reason of their design and
use, are conducive to high-risk sexual conduct and hence the spread of communicable disease. The risk of
spreading infectious and contagious diseases can be minimized by regulating these commercial premises,
buildings, and structures.
(5) The City shall promote public health, safety, morals and general welfare by the adoption of regulations
governing commercial premises, buildings, and structures conducive to high-risk sexual conduct.
(6) The purpose of these regulations shall be to regulate commercial premises, buildings, and structures
that are conducive, by virtue of design and use, to high-risk sexual conduct that can result in the spread of
sexually transmitted diseases to persons frequenting such premises, buildings, and structures. (Ord. No.

(1) Notice.
(A) Whenever the City determines that a public nuisance is being maintained or exists on
a premises in the City, the Building Official or their designated representative may
abate the nuisance after providing written notice to the affected record property
owner.
(B) The notice shall be given to the affected record property owner by U.S. Mail or
personal delivery. Refusal by the recipient to accept the notice shall not constitute a
defense that the notice was not received. If the record owner is not able to be found,
the City shall attach a copy of the notice or a door hanger with the same information
to the main entrance door of the principal structure on the property. The notice shall
state the following information at a minimum:
(i) The date;
(ii) The address or legal description of the property;
(iii) A description of the nuisance and the section or sections of the City Code which
was/were violated;
(iv) The steps to be taken in order to abate the nuisance;
(v) The date by which the nuisance must be abated (grass and weed violations must
be abated within five calendar days from the date of the notice);
(vi) That if the nuisance is not abated by the date stated, the City will abate the
nuisance and the costs incurred by the City will be charged, and if left unpaid,
will be certified to the county auditor for collection with property taxes or
specially assessed;
17-6
(vii) That the recipient has the right to appeal, in writing, the notice to the City
Council and the date by which such an appeal must be filed; and
(viii) A description of the penalties that may apply if the condition is not corrected.
(2) Abatement. If the nuisance is not abated by the date stated in the notice and no appeal
has been filed, the City may abate the nuisance. City staff must keep a record of the total cost of
the abatement attributable to the property and report the information to the Finance Director.
(3) Abatement charges. When the abatement has been completed and the cost determined,
the City shall prepare a bill and mail it to the record owner and thereupon the amount shall be
immediately due and payable. If the record owner fails to pay the bill, the total charges may be
certified by the City to the county auditor for collection with property taxes as set forth in Section
17-8(3) of this Article, or specially assessed in accordance with Minnesota Statutes Sections
429.101 and 429.061, whichever may be applicable.
(4) Emergency abatement. Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the City, without notice
or other process, from immediately abating any nuisance condition in an emergency situation
which poses an imminent and serious hazard to the public health, safety, or welfare. To proceed
with immediate abatement, the City official shall determine that a public nuisance exists or is
being maintained on the premises and that delay in abatement will unreasonably endanger the
public health, safety, or welfare. If at all possible, the City official shall attempt to notify the
record owner of the nature of the nuisance and the abatement prior to the abatement. If
notification prior to abatement is not possible, the City official shall notify the record owner as
soon as practicable after abatement.

Sec. 18-70. Purpose
Administrative offense procedures established pursuant to this chapter are intended to provide the public and

violations of certain ordinance provisions. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on the part of those
who have been charged with administrative offenses. At any time prior to the payment of the administrative
penalty as is provided for hereafter, the individual may withdraw from participation in the procedures in
which event the City may bring criminal charges in accordance with law. Likewise, the City, in its
discretion, may choose not to initiate an administrative offense and may bring criminal charges in the first
instance. In the event a party participates in the administrative offense procedures but does not pay the
monetary penalty which may be imposed, the City will seek to collect the costs of the administrative offense
procedures as part of a subsequent criminal sentence in the event the party is charged and is adjudicated
guilty of the criminal violation. (Ord. #704 3/25/03)

notify the violator, or in the case of a vehicular violation, attach to the vehicle a notice of the violation. Said
notice shall set forth the nature, date and time of violation, the name of the official issuing the notice, and the
amount of the scheduled penalty. (Ord. #704 3/25/03)
Sec. 18-73 Payment.
Once such notice is given, the alleged violator may, within seven (7) days of the time of issuance of the
notice, pay the amount set forth on the schedule of penalties for the violation, or may request a hearing in
writing, as is provided for hereafter. The penalty may be paid in person or by mail, and payment shall be
deemed to be an admission of the violation. (Ord. #704 3/25/03)
Sec. 18-74 Hearing.
Any person contesting an administrative offense pursuant to this Chapter may, within seven (7) days of the
time of issuance of the notice, request a hearing by a hearing officer who shall forthwith conduct an informal
hearing to determine if a violation has occurred. The hearing officer shall have authority to dismiss the
violation or reduce or waive the penalty. If the violation is sustained by the hearing officer, the violator shall
pay the penalty imposed. (Ord. #704 3/25/03)

This Chapter has been renumbered to be consistent with the numbering system used throughout the Code:
The first division within a Section is numbered “(1)” followed by “(2)”, etc.
The next division of a Section is numbered with an “A” followed by “B”, etc.
As with all other parts of the codification, the language in this Chapter has been simplified and made general
neutral.
Sections 18-36 through 18-41. Narcotics. Since the provisions of State Statute are adequate for regulating
sale, use, and possession of controlled substances, Article 3 has been deleted.

This Chapter has been renumbered to be consistent with the numbering system used throughout the Code:
The first division within a Section is numbered “(1)” followed by “(2), etc.
The next division of a Section is numbered with an “A” followed by “B”, etc.
As with all other parts of the codification, the language in this Chapter has been simplified and made
gender neutral.
Article 3 has been renumbered as Article 2 because the original text of Article 2 (Parks Commission) has
been reassigned to Chapter 2.
Section 19-38 has been deleted because the declaration of a misdemeanor for violation duplicates the
general condition cited in Section 1-9.
Section 19-41 has been deleted because the effective date no longer is necessary.

Division 2. Charges
Sec. 24-49. Purpose.
(1) Every lot, parcel of land, building, or premises shall be charged a "connection charge". The charge is
for the privilege of making a connection, direct or indirect, to the disposal system through which the
facilities of the City are made available for disposal of sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquid
from such premises.
(2) Connection charges shall be used for:
A. The necessary construction, maintenance, additions, extensions, and operation of the disposal
system.
B. The payment of principal and interest due on bonds and other obligations issued for the
construction, maintenance, and operation of the system. (Code 1966; Ord. No. 314, 2-13-73;
Code of 1988; Code of 2001)
Sec. 24-50. Payment.
Connection charges shall be payable at the time the building permit is issued. No building permit shall be
issued until the connection charge is paid. If a building permit was issued prior to January 1, 1973
without connection to the disposal system, connection charges shall be payable prior to the time of
connection. (Code 1966; Ord. No. 314, 2-13-73; Code of 1988; Code of 2001)

Sec. 24-52. Increased Charges Based on Measurement.
Determination of the connection charge is at all times subject to further review by the City or Sewer
Board after the connection has been made and used. The review shall include an actual measurement of
the sewage or waste discharge entering into the system. The receipt and acceptance by the City of any
money paid as previously imposed does not bar the City's right to recover payment of the correct amount
of money due as determined by the actual measurement. After a connection has been made and the
connection charge established, imposed, and paid, no diminution in discharge from the premises shall
entitle the owner or occupant to a reduction, reimbursement, or refund with respect to the connection
charge. (Code 1966; Ord. No. 314, 2-13-73; Code of 1988; Code of 2001)

charge. The Sewer Board shall review actual sewage flow one year after the initial discharge and the City
shall impose additional connection charges as may be determined in accordance with Section 24-52.

average base and the proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of waste treatment services
provided by the Metropolitan Waste Control Commission. The resolution and any amendments are
hereby incorporated by reference.

Article 6. Courtesy Benches
Sec. 25-120. Purpose.
The placement of courtesy benches on the public right-of-way in some locations provides a public
amenity. However, such benches increase visual clutter thereby decreasing property values and are
inconsistent with the character of the neighborhood, are inconvenient for maintenance of lawn or
landscaping, and may create distractions or hazards to traffic and unsafe conditions for pedestrians.
Therefore, the City Council finds it necessary and appropriate to weigh these conflicting public policy
objectives and regulate the placement of such courtesy benches in the City. (Ord. No. 636, 10-14-97;
Code of 2001)
Sec. 25-121. Permit Required.

as shall be required. The application shall be accompanied by an inspection fee.
(2) Location. The location of each bench shall be placed at a designated pickup location for the public
transit route. Other locations that are deemed to be in the public interest may be approved by the City.
(3) Letter of Consent. The application shall be accompanied by a letter of consent signed by the owner or
lessee of the property adjacent to the portion of the street or sidewalk where each bench is proposed to be
located giving consent to the installation and maintenance of the bench at the proposed location. The
letter of consent and proof of ownership or lease shall be on forms as prescribed by the City Attorney.
(4) Permit Fee. If the application is approved, an additional permit fee for each bench shall be required.
A permit shall expire on December 31 following the date of issuance.
(5) Renewal. Upon application for renewal, a renewal fee shall be paid. Renewal of a permit shall not be
automatic. One factor in considering a permit renewal will be the level of demonstrated demand by the
public for the courtesy bench. Application for renewal shall be made on a form as prescribed by the City
and shall be submitted prior to the expiration date of the preceding permit.
(6) Written Objection. A renewal permit may be issued without further proof of consent of the owner of
the land or lessee of the property adjacent to the portion of the street or sidewalk where each bench is
located unless written objection to the renewal shall have been previously filed by the owner or lessee.
The City Manager is authorized to approve permit renewals.
(7) Bench Sold or Transferred. A new permit shall be required when a bench for which a permit has been
25-18
issued is sold or title control is transferred or assigned.
(8) Single Application. One application may be made by the owner of several benches at different
locations but a separate number and permit shall be assigned and issued for each bench authorized to be
installed and each such permit shall be valid only for the designated location.

of the City Council. (Ord. No. 636, 10-14-97; Code of 2001, Ord. No 751, 11-13-2007)

No permit shall be issued for installation of a bench:
(1) At any location that would interfere with the use of the street or sidewalk and any alley or driveway,
or impair vision at intersections or crosswalks. The determination of interference or impairment shall be
in the judgement of the City Manager.
(2) At any location less than thirty feet or more than fifty feet from the nearest point of intersection at the
curb face with a street or within twenty feet of a fire hydrant. The City Council may waive this
requirement, or make necessary adjustments, based on a hardship caused by a unique or unusual
circumstance pertaining to the physical character of the bench site or street intersection.
(3) At any location between the curb face of a street and an existing public sidewalk. The City Council
may waive observance of this requirement in case of inconvenience or hardship.
(4) Courtesy benches shall be installed parallel with the curb and set back not less than sixty inches from
the face of the curb in locations where a public sidewalk is not present. (Ord. No. 636, 10-14-97; Code of
2001)
Sec. 25-124. Denial or Revocation of a Permit.
(1) Need. New or renewal applications may be denied by the City Manager if, in the exercise of the City
Manager’s discretion, there is not a sufficient need to justify placement of a bench in light of the visual
clutter, hazards, or inconvenience caused thereby. The application shall be denied if the City Manager
finds that the bench would tend unduly to obstruct passage along any public sidewalk or public right of
way, or to create a hazard, or otherwise to be detrimental to the public safety, convenience or welfare.
(2) Consent Withdrawn. If the owner or lessee of any surrounding property shall withdraw their consent
in writing with the City Manager on or before the first day of January preceding the expiration of any
permit then the City Manager shall promptly notify the permittee of the filing and shall deny the renewal
of the permit.
(3) Appeal to City Council. An applicant may appeal the decision of the City Manager denying, revoking,
or declining to renew a permit or attaching conditions or restrictions to a permit, to the City Council by
requesting a hearing in writing within ten days of receipt of the City Manager’s decision.
(4) Failure to Comply. Failure to comply with any section of this Article is a misdemeanor and ground
for revocation of the permit. (Ord. No. 636, 10-14-97; Code of 2001)
25-19

bench and supporting structure and restore the site to its original condition.

notice has been given by mail directed to the address of the permittee on file. If the permittee shall fail to
pay the costs of removal and restoration within a period of sixty days after the giving of such notice, the
permittee's right to the bench shall be forfeited. The forfeiture shall not excuse the permittee from the
payment of costs for removal and restoration of the bench area.
(3) The permittee shall be responsible for the permanent or temporary removal or relocation of the
courtesy bench if it interferes with any public improvements occurring within the right of way. (Ord. No.

Article 4. Park Land Dedication
Sec. 26-50. Land Required.
(1) Dedication to City. The owners of land being subdivided shall dedicate to the City a reasonable
portion of the land for use as public parks, playgrounds, trails or open space.
A. In all residential subdivisions it shall be presumed that a reasonable amount of
land has been dedicated for parks and playgrounds if the subdivider dedicates at
least ten percent of the total land in the proposed subdivision. The City shall
determine whether a cash payment in lieu of land dedication is appropriate.
B. In all commercial and industrial subdivisions, it shall be presumed that a
reasonable amount of land has been dedicated to serve the needs of the resident
and working population for parks and playgrounds if the subdivider dedicates at
least ten percent (10%) of the land in the subdivision for parks, recreation and
usable open space. The City shall determine whether a cash payment in lieu of
land dedication is appropriate.
C. The dedication of a portion of land for parks or playgrounds, or the payment of
cash in lieu thereof, provided for above shall be presumed to be reasonable.
However, upon the request of the applicant, the recommendation of Parks,
Recreation, and Environmental Commission, or at the discretion of the Council,
the City may either increase or decrease such dedication or payment upon a
determination by the Council that such dedication or payment is unreasonable or
insufficient given the specific characteristics of the proposed subdivision and its
intended use.
(2) Suitability of Land. The City may determine the location and configuration of any land dedicated,
taking into consideration the suitability of the land for its intended purpose and future needs of the
community for park, playground, trail, or open space property.
(3) Exemption. This Article shall apply to all new residential, commercial and industrial developments,
and lot combination or redivisions meant to facilitate such development. It shall not apply to lot
combination or redivisions that do not increase the number of single-family residential lots, conversion of
apartments to condominiums, or internal leasehold improvements.
(4) Contribution in Lieu of Land. At the City’s option, the subdivider shall contribute an amount in cash
in lieu of all or a portion of the land required under Section 26-50 (1). The contribution amount shall be
determined prior to the City granting final approval. The amount of any cash in lieu contribution shall be
based on the average fair market value of the land that would otherwise be required to be dedicated. For
the purposes of this section, “fair market value” means the value of land as determined by the City
annually based on tax valuation or other relevant data, and set forth in the City’s fee schedule. If the
applicant disputes the amount of the proposed cash in lieu contribution, the applicant, at the applicant’s
expense, may obtain an independent appraisal of the property. The appraisal must be made by a certified
real property appraiser who is licensed in the State of Minnesota and holds a MAI membership
designation from the Appraisal Institute, or equivalent certification. If the City disputes the appraisal, the
City may, at the applicant’s expense, obtain an appraisal of the property by an appraiser that meets the
requirements of this paragraph. In that event, the fair market value of the land shall be determined by
averaging the two appraisals.
26-14
(5) Land Title. Prior to the dedication of the required property, the subdivider shall provide the City with
an acceptable title opinion or title insurance policy addressed to the City that insures the title and the
City's proposed interest in the property. In any dedication of land, the subdivider must transfer good and
marketable title to the City, free and clear of any mortgages, liens, encumbrances or assessments, except
easements or minor imperfections of title acceptable to the City. If this land is not formally dedicated to
the City with the final plat, the subdivider shall record all deeds for conveyance of the property to the City
at the same time as the final plat or other appropriate division documents are filed.
(6) Land Acceptability. At the City's option, the following properties shall not be accepted for purposes of
the owner's compliance with Section 26-50 (1) and (4):
A. Land dedicated or obtained as easements for stormwater retention, drainage, roadway, and
other utility purposes;
B. Land that is unusable or of limited use; and
C. Land that is protected wetlands or floodplain areas.
(7) Cash Contributions.
A. Cash contributions for single-family residential development will be due and payable at the
time of final plat approval. Cash contributions will be based on the number of new lots created.
B. Cash contributions for multi-family residential, commercial and industrial development will be
due and payable at the time of building permit issuance. For multi-family residential, commercial
and industrial development, the applicant will execute a document in a form satisfactory to the
City Attorney that acknowledges the obligation to pay these fees at the time building permits are
secured. Such documents shall be in recordable form and any fee charged in connection with the
filing thereof shall be paid by the applicant. Cash contributions for multi-family residential
developments will be based on the number of units in the complex. Cash contributions for
commercial and industrial development will be based on the area of the subdivision.
(8) Park Fund. Any cash contribution received pursuant to this Article shall be placed in a separate fund
and used only for park, playground, trail, or open space purposes.
(9) Resubdivisions and Minor Subdivisions. In the case of subdivision of land that have previously been
subdivided and for which land has been dedicated for parks or playgrounds, or cash payments in lieu of
such dedication have been made, the Council shall make reasonable adjustments to recognize such
previous dedication or payment. (Ord. No. 558; 12-8-87; Code of 1988; Code of 2001 Ord. No. 739)

Editor’s Notes
City Code-Chapter 30
Water Utility
Introduction. The purpose of this Chapter is to provide for operation of the municipal water system.
This Chapter has been renumbered to be consistent with the numbering system used throughout the Code:
The first division within a Section is numbered “(1)” followed by “(2)”, etc.
The next division of a Section is numbered with an “A” followed by “B”, etc.
As with all other parts of the codification, the language in this Chapter has been simplified and made
general neutral.
Section 30-1, Definitions. The City has been cited as the responsible party thereby making the need to
define the words superintendent and inspector not necessary.
Section 30-3, Resale of water. The restriction on the resale of municipal water was expanded by deleting
the phrase “to any other person”.
Section 30-4, Turning on water. To be consistent with current practice, the word “permit” is replaced
with “permission”.
Section 30-6(D), Service connection. Subsection D has been deleted because this provision now is
obsolete. The subsection required a connection charge for already existing customers.
Section 30-7, Application. To prevent obsolence, the application form will be “as requested by the City”.
Previously, the content of the form was specified in the Code.
Section 30-25, Repair of leaks. The specified fee of $5 has been replaced by “a fee as specified by the
City”.
Section 30-60, Rates. Reference to “quarterly” deleted to simplify the definitions of rate and fee.
Section 30-63, Delinquent accounts. To prevent obsolence, the interest charge will be as specified by
resolution. Previously, an interest charge of 12% was contained in the Code.

Stormwater Utility
Article 1. General Conditions, §§ 31-1--31-7
Article 1. General Conditions
Sec. 31-1. Purpose.
(1) The municipal storm sewer system shall be operated as a public utility pursuant to Minnesota
Statutes, Section 444.075. The utility revenues will be derived subject to the provisions of this Chapter
and Minnesota Statutes. (Ord. No. 608, 12-13-94; Code of 2001)
(2) To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system
(MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user.
(3) To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer
system.
(4) To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, enforcement, and
monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this Article.
(5) This Section is adopted pursuant to the authorization and policies contained in Minnesota
Statutes, Chapters 103B and 462, Minnesota Rules, Parts 6120.2500-6120.3900 and 7050.0210;
Minnesota Rules Chapters 8410, 8420. (Ord. No. 831)
31-2
Sec. 31-2. Definitions.
The definitions of this Section shall apply when these words and phrases are used in this Chapter.
(1) Stormwater Utility Rate. The rate for the Stormwater Utility is the rate developed for each land
classification pursuant to City regulations. This utility rate shall be established by ordinance. (Ord. No
751, 11-13-2007)
(2) Stormwater Utility Fee. The fee for the Stormwater Utility is the charge developed for each parcel
and is equal to the Stormwater Utility rate multiplied by the parcel area, in acres. In the case of the single
and two family residential land classification, a standard lot size of 1/3 acre will be used to calculate the
stormwater utility fee regardless of the actual lot size.
(3) Stormwater Utility Budget. The Stormwater Utility budget is the estimated annual expenditures for
planning, reconstruction, and maintenance, and meeting all State and Federal laws, rules and regulations,
pertaining to storm water management of the City’s storm sewer system. This budget shall be established
during the annual budgeting process by the City Council. (Ord. No. 608, 12-13-94; Code of 2001, Ord
763 6-24-2008.))
31-3
Sec. 31-3. Fees and Rates.
Stormwater fees shall be established by ordinance. The following steps will be taken to determine the fee
to be charged each property: (Ord. No 751, 11-13-2007)
(1) The depth of runoff for a one year rainfall event (a two inch rainfall), shall be as determined by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service guidelines for soil types common to New
Brighton. A curve number (CN), based on the percentage of impervious surface, shall be chosen for each
land classification. The depth of runoff for each land classification shall be calculated using the following
equation from the Soil Conservation Service, Technical Release No. 55:
Q=(P - 0.2S)2
P + 0.8S
Where: Q =Depth of runoff in inches S =1000/CN - 10, dimensionless P =2 inches
The next table represents the runoff depths, in inches, for each land classification from the previous
calculations:
Classification Description Runoff Depths
1 Parks, Cemeteries, Golf Courses 0.08
2 Single and Two Family Residences 0.28
3 Schools 0.28
4 Townhouses and Mobile Home Parks 0.36
5 Churches 0.47
6 Apartments, Condominiums, Senior Housing, Nursing Homes 0.55
7 Commercial, Industrial, Warehouses 0.98
8 Unimproved Vacants 0.06
(2) The depth of runoff due to development for each land classification shall be calculated by subtracting
the depth of runoff calculated in Section 31-3(1) for unimproved vacant land.
(3) The total area for each land classification from the table in Section 31-3(1) shall then be calculated.
(4) The volume of runoff for each land classification shall be calculated using the depth of runoff due to
development from Section 31-3(2) and multiplying it by the area for each land classification found in
Section 31-3(3).
(5) The total volume of runoff due to development for the entire City shall be calculated by summing the
results from Section 31-3(4).
31-4
(6) The annual revenue to be provided to the Stormwater Utility by each land classification then shall be
calculated by dividing the volume of runoff due to development for each land classification found in
Section 31-3(4) by the total runoff due to development for the entire City from Section 31-3(5) and
multiplying this result by the Stormwater Utility budget.
(7) The Stormwater Utility rates shall be calculated by using the annual revenue for each land
classification from Section 31-3(6) and dividing it by the total area for each land classification from
Section 31-3(3).
(8) The Stormwater Utility fee shall be calculated by multiplying the parcel's lot size, in acres, by the
Stormwater Utility rate from Section 31-3(7). In the case of the single and two family residential land
classification, a standard lot size of 1/3 acre will be used to calculate the fee, regardless of actual lot size.
(Ord. No. 608, 12-13-94; Code of 2001)
Sec. 31-4. Adjustment of Fees.
Fees may be adjusted in accordance with the conditions cited in this Section. In the case of an adjustment
under Section 31-4 (3-6) the property owner shall provide the information required to justify an
adjustment. The adjustments allowable in Section 31-4 (3-5) will not be made to single and two family
residential parcels. The adjustments allowable in section 31-4(6) will be made only to single and two
family residential parcels.
The City shall review parcels with adjustments once every five years. The review shall consist of an
inspection to ensure that the site conditions still exist to meet the requirements of the fee adjustment.
Property owners who refuse a site inspection or do not maintain the site conditions to meet the
requirements of the fee adjustment shall have the fee adjustments removed. (Ord. 763 6-24-2008)
(1) Budget. The estimated expenditures for the management of storm runoff will be revised at a frequency
and procedure consistent with the sanitary sewer and water utilities.
(2) Change in Land Classification. Changes in land classification of existing parcels.
(3) Parcel Runoff. Parcel runoff is significantly different from the land classification standard. Where
the unit runoff generated by a parcel differs from the amount for that land classification by more than
twenty percent, the City may adjust the parcel's fee in accordance with the following procedure:
A. Property owner applies for reduction and supplies the City with the following information:
1. Site Plan.
2. Lot Size.
3 Total area of impervious surface.
B. City determines the difference in parcel unit runoff to land classification standard unit runoff.
C. Percent credit = Difference from Step B
Land classification standard unit runoff
(4) Stormwater Detention / Infiltration. An adjustment of up to 25 percent will be made for those
parcels with onsite measures that limit outflow peak events according to the conditions cited in this
Subsection.
A. A ten percent credit for parcels that limit peak outflow rates during a five year rainfall event to
rates comparable to the rates from an unimproved vacant property of the same size.
31-5
B. An additional fifteen percent credit will be given to parcels that limit peak outflow rate during
a 100-year rainfall event to rates comparable to the rates from an unimproved vacant property of
the same size. (Ord 763 6-24-2008)
(5) Wet Ponding Credit. An adjustment of up to 25 percent will be made to the Stormwater Utility fee of
a parcel for onsite measures that are owned and maintained by the applicant that effectively reduce the
amount of sediments/nutrients that enter the system. It is the responsibility of the applicant to prove that
the wet pond in question meets the following design criteria:

The Authorized Enforcement Officer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual
or threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or
Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension
order issued in an emergency, the Authorized Enforcement Officer may take such
steps as are deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or
Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
(2) Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge
Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this section may have their
MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The Authorized Enforcement Officer will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Authorized
Enforcement Officer for a reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises

31-12
A. The Authorized Enforcement Officer shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this Article as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this Article. If a discharger has
security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the Authorized
Enforcement Officer.
B. Facility operators shall allow the Authorized Enforcement Officer ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions
of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any
additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
C. The Authorized Enforcement Officer shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
Authorized Enforcement Officer to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of
the facility's storm water discharge.

discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a
safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.
All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
E. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Authorized Enforcement
Officer and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall
be borne by the operator.
F. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Authorized Enforcement Officer
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge
permit and of this Article. A person who is the operator of a facility with
a NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial
activity commits an offense if the person denies the Authorized
Enforcement Officer reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this Article.
G. If the Authorized Enforcement Officer has been refused access to any part
of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able
to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
31-13
this Article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance
with this Article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the Authorized
Enforcement Officer may seek issuance of a search warrant from any
court of competent jurisdiction.
Sec. 31-17. Requirement to Prevent, Control, and Reduce Storm Water Pollutants
by the Use of Best Management Practices. The Authorized Enforcement Officer will adopt
requirements identifying Best Management Practices for any activity, operation, or facility that
may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or
waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use
of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or
premise that is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at
said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms
and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with
industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
Sec. 31-18. Watercourse Protection. Every person owning property through which a
watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would
pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In
addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or
adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function,
or physical integrity of the watercourse.
Sec. 31-19. Notification of Spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon
as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials that are
resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm
drain system, or water of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said
person shall notify the Authorized Enforcement Officer in person or by phone or facsimile no
later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by
written notice addressed and mailed to the Authorized Enforcement Officer within three business
days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on31-
14
site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records
shall be retained for at least three years.
Sec. 31-20. Enforcement.
Notice of Violation.
Whenever the Authorized Enforcement Officer finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this Article, the Authorized Enforcement Officer
may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may
require without limitation:
a. The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
b. The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
c. That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;
d. The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or contamination hazards
and the restoration of any affected property; and
e. The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set
a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline,
the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
Sec. 31-21. Appeal of Notice of Violation. Any person receiving a Notice of Violation
may appeal the determination of the Authorized Enforcement Officer. The notice of appeal must
be received within ten days from the date of the Notice of Violation. Hearing on the appeal
before the City Council shall take place within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the
notice of appeal. The decision of the City Council shall be final.
Sec. 31-22. Enforcement Measures After Appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, or, in the event of an
appeal, within ten days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the
Authorized Enforcement Officer, then representatives of the Authorized Enforcement Officer
31-15
may enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person,
owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency
or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.
Sec. 31-23. Cost of Abatement of the Violation. Within thirty (30) days after
abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement,
including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the
amount of the assessment within ten days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner
as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which
to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall
constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall become liable to the City by
reason of such violation.
Sec. 31-24. Injunctive Relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any
provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this Article. If a person has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of this Article, the Authorized Enforcement Officer may
petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities that
would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of
the violation.
Sec. 31-25. Violations Deemed a Public Nuisance. In addition to the enforcement
processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any
of the provisions of this Article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense,
and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be
taken.
Sec. 31-26. Criminal Prosecution. Any person that has violated or continues to violate
this Article shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and shall be
subject to a criminal penalty as a misdemeanor.

the breach.

by the City involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the
facilities at issue.

way, and future City plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined

(7) LODGER. The person obtaining lodging from an operator.
Section 34-2. Imposition of Tax.
There is hereby imposed a tax of three percent (3%) on the rent charged by an operator for
providing lodging to any person. The tax shall be stated and charged separately and shall be
collected by the operator from the lodger. The tax collected by the operator shall be a debt owed
by the operator to the City and shall be extinguished only by payment to the City. In no case
shall the tax imposed by this section upon an operator exceed the amount of tax that the operator
is authorized and required by this Chapter to collect from a lodger.
Section 34-3. Collections.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this Chapter at the time rent is paid. The tax
collections shall be held in trust by the operator for the City. The amount of tax shall be
separately stated from the rent charged for the lodging.

An exemption shall be granted to any person as to whom or whose occupancy it is beyond the
power of the City to tax. No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the

refunded. In computing the tax to be collected, amounts of tax less than one cent shall be
considered an additional cent
Section 34-6. Payments and Returns.
The taxes imposed by this Chapter shall be paid by the operator to the City no later than twenty
five (25) days after the end of the month in which the taxes were collected. At the time of

to the portion of such consideration that became uncollectible.
Section 34-7. Examination of Return, Adjustments, Notices and Demands.
The Director may rely upon the Minnesota State Sales and Use Tax Return filed by the operator
with the State of Minnesota in determining the accuracy of a return filed under this Chapter.

records and accounts of the person making the return, if the Director reasonably determines that
such steps are necessary for determining the correctness of the return.
The Operator shall provide to the City the results of any Minnesota Sales & Use Tax Return audit
performed along with any additional payments due to the City or refunds due from the City.
The tax computed on the basis of such examination shall be the tax to be paid. If the tax due is
found to be greater than that paid, such excess shall be paid to the City within ten (10) days after
receipt of a notice thereof, given either personally or sent by registered mail to the address shown
on the return. If the tax paid is greater than the tax found to be due, the excess shall be refunded
to the person who paid the tax to the City within (10) days after determination of such refund.
Section 34-8. Refunds.
Any person may apply to the City for a refund of taxes paid for a prescribed period in excess of
the amount legally due for that period, provided that no application for refund shall be considered
unless filed within one year after such tax was paid, or within one year from the filing of the
return, whichever period is the longer. The Director shall examine the claim and make and file
written findings thereon denying or allowing the claim in whole or in part and shall mail a notice
thereof by registered mail to such person at the address stated upon the return. If such claim is
allowed in whole or in part, the Director shall credit the amount of the allowance against any
taxes due under this Chapter from the claimant and the balance of said allowance, if any, shall be
paid by the Director to the claimant.
Section 34-9. Failure to File a Return.

prescribed, or shall make, willfully or otherwise, an incorrect, false, or fraudulent return,
the operator shall, upon written notice and demand, file such return or corrected return
within five (5) days of receipt of such written notice and shall at the same time pay any
tax due on the basis thereof. If such person shall fail to file such return or corrected
return, the Director shall make a return or corrected return, for such person from such
knowledge and information as the Director can obtain, and assess a tax on the basis
thereof, which tax, less any payments theretofore made on account of the tax for the
taxable period covered by such return shall be paid within five (5) days of the receipt of
written notice and demand for such payment. Any such return or assessment made by the
Director shall be prima facie correct and valid, and such person shall have the burden of
establishing its incorrectness or invalidity in any action or proceeding in respect thereto.
(2) If any portion of a tax imposed by this Chapter, including penalties thereon, is not paid
within thirty (30) days after it is required to be paid, the City may institute such legal
action as may be necessary to recover the amount due plus interest, penalties, the costs
and disbursements of any action.
(3) Upon a showing of good cause, the Director may grant an operator one thirty (30) day
extension of time within which to file a return and make payment of taxes as required by
this Chapter provided that interest during such period of extension shall be added to the
taxes due at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum.
Section 34-10. Penalties.
If any tax imposed by this Chapter is not paid within the time herein specified for the payment, or
an extension thereof, there shall be added thereto a specific penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of
the amount remaining unpaid. The amount of tax not timely paid, together with any penalty
provided by this section, shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the
time such tax should have been paid until it is paid. Any interest and penalty shall be added to
the tax and be collected as part thereof.
Section 34-11. Administration of Tax.
The Director shall administer and enforce the assessment and collection of taxes imposed by this
Chapter. The Director shall cause to be prepared blank forms for the returns and other documents
required by this Chapter and shall distribute the same throughout the City and furnish them on
application, but failure to receive or secure them shall not relieve any person from any obligation
required of him or her under this Chapter.
Section 34-12. Examination of Records.
The Director and those persons acting on behalf of the Director, authorized in writing by the
Director, may examine the books, papers and records of any operator in order to verify the
accuracy of any return made, or if no return was made, to ascertain the tax as provided in this
Chapter. Every such operator is directed and required to give to the Director, or such other
authorized agent or employee, the means, facilities and opportunity for such examinations and
investigations as are hereby authorized.
Section 34-13. Violations.
Any person who willfully fails to make a return required by this Chapter; or who shall fail to pay
the tax after written demand for payment, or who shall fail to remit the taxes collected or any
penalty or interest imposed by this Chapter, after written demand for such payment, or who shall

who shall willfully make may incomplete, false or fraudulent return shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.

Secs. 4-441--449.  Reserved. 
Sec. 4-451. Interim Use District. 
It is recognized that there are a certain number of detached single family homes existing in R-3B Multiple Family Residential Districts, the continued use of which as single family residences may no longer be appropriate. These single family home sites are commonly located between or adjacent to multiple family residential developments, are located on arterial or collector streets, are near to commercial and industrial districts, and are designated for multiple family residential use by the City’s comprehensive plan.  These detached single family homes may prove attractive to the small business use which could convert the entire single family home to a business office use at a relatively inexpensive cost. In order to allow for this transition from residential use to business office use on an interim basis while still recognizing the best and highest use of the site as multiple family residential, the R-3B1 District is hereby created.

(2) 
Special permits for such interim uses shall be considered pursuant to Section 8-110 through 8-130.  

(3) 
At the time of granting such a permit, the City Council shall specify a date or event that can be identified with certainty by which the interim use must be terminated.  In any event, however, such interim use shall not continue beyond any date when the City Council, or other governmental body having the power of eminent domain, adopts a resolution approving acquisition of the property by eminent domain, or the zoning of the property is changed to any classification under which the interim use is no longer permitted. 

(4) 
The City Council may impost any conditions on such interim use which it deems necessary or expedient to protect the public health, safety, or welfare, or to assure that permission for the interim use will not impose additional costs on the public if it is necessary or expedient to take the property in the future.  No such permit shall be issued unless the applicant first agrees in writing to the imposition of such conditions. 

(5) 
In addition to any other conditions which may be imposed by the City Council, the following restrictions shall apply: 

A. Lot standards and sign regulations applicable to R-3B uses shall be observed.

Article 7. Palmer Drive Overlay Area 

Section 5-610.  Purpose and Intent. 
The area located at 1101 – 1151 Silver Lake Road was redeveloped in late 2007 and early 2008 through a Planned Unit Development. The City recognizes this site, currently known as Brighton Village, together with nearby properties, as a redevelopment area. Further, the City recognizes the need for in-fill development in this area and has determined that it is in the public interest to accommodate in-fill development that is consistent with the development parameters approved with the Brighton Village Planned Unit Development. 
The City wishes to accomplish these goals through establishment of an overlay area. This will allow the City to specify the properties that may take advantage of such overlay standards without undermining the intent of the existing zoning regulations.  A property lying within this overlay area may choose whether or not to take advantage of this Article, as the underlying zoning will remain in full force and effect.  
The intent of the Council in establishing this overlay area is to allow variations from the underlying zoning standards through the Site Plan procedures of Section 8-010 and Special Use procedures of Sections 8-110 through 8-130 when such variations are consistent with variations approved through the Brighton Village Planned Unit Development. 
Section 5-620.  Designation of the Palmer Drive Overlay Area. 
The following properties are included within the Palmer Drive Overlay Area: 
(1) 
Any property with a zoning designation of B-3, General Business and abutting Brighton Village at 1101 – 1151 Silver Lake Road. 

(2) 
Any property with a zoning designation of B-3, General Business and located on the north side of Palmer Drive, east of Silver Lake Road. 

(3) 
Any property with a zoning designation of B-3, General Business on the west side of Silver Lake Road, north of Interstate 694, east of 27th Avenue NW, and south of Innsbruck Drive subject to Council discretion. 


Section 5-630.  Permitted Variations. 
Any property in the Palmer Lake Overlay Area may take advantage of the following permitted Zoning Code variation: 
(1)  A reduced parking setback from that required under Zoning Code Section 11-020 (6) of 15’, except when such setback is abutting property zoned for residential uses, if no other variations are requested. 
Section 5-640.  Special Variations. 
Any property in the Palmer Lake Overlay Area may take advantage of the following Zoning Code variations by review and approval of a Special Use Permit: 
(1)
  A reduced parking setback from that required under Zoning Code Section 11-020 (6) to between 0’ and 15’, except when such setback is abutting property zoned for residential uses. 

(2) 
A reduced building setback from that required under Zoning Code Section 5-250 (which defers to Section 5-150) to between 0’ and 30’, except when such setback is abutting property zoned for residential uses. 


Section 5-650.  Special Use Standards and Procedures. 
The procedure for consideration of special uses under this Article is as set forth in Sections 8-110 through 8-113.  In addition to the standards set forth in Section 8-130, the Council, with a recommendation from the Planning Commission, will approve such use only upon a finding that such variations are consistent with the development parameters of Brighton Village and of adjacent and nearby uses developed in accordance with this Article including, but not limited to, parameters relating to: 
(1)
  Enhanced Landscaping; 

(2) 
Pedestrian linkages to neighboring developments for residents, employees, or shoppers that use decorative crosswalk treatment types; and

Article 7:  Environmental Constraint Overlay Area 
Section 6-760.  Purpose and Intent. 
There are certain properties within the City with environmental constraints that were created by past land uses. The City recognizes in these situations that conformance with underlying zoning regulations may be difficult due to site characteristics that resulted from those environmental issues and/or remediation efforts. Further, the City recognizes that it may not be feasible to comply with underlying zoning designations due to these environmental characteristics. 
Rather than leave these sites dormant or allow them to persist as unsightly or underutilized, the City wishes to provide a means to develop or use these properties that is both practical and economical.  The City recognizes that certain deviations from the industrial district standards may be necessary for a viable use to develop and evolve so that landowners are able to make good use of property. 
It is the intent of the Environmental Constraint Overlay Area to provide the legislative means to meet land use goals for these unique sites while also imposing such regulations and limitations on the uses, or the accumulation of those uses, that may occur within the area in order to ensure the adequate protection of the environment and the health, safety, and welfare of the surrounding properties. (Ord. 832) 
Section 6-770.  Designation of the Environmental Constraint Overlay Area. 
Property included in the Environmental Constraint Overlay Area is illustrated in Figure A. 
Requests for additional property to be included by ordinance in the Environmental Constraint Overlay Area may be considered by following the procedures set forth in Section 8-320 to 8-350, provided the property meets the following requirements at the time of application: 
(1)
  Underlying I-1, Light Industrial or I-2, Heavy Industrial zoning 

(2)
  Maximum lot area of 40 acres 

(3)
  Not adjacent to residential or commercial uses 

(4)
  The boundary of the site must be at least 800’ from nearest residence 

(5)
  Primary access is served by a private roadway or a public roadway when a 650’ road setback exists 

(6)
  There are documented environmental constraints that limit the use of the property for a typical industrial use and that were not caused by the current landowner/user. (Ord. 832) 


Section 6-780.  Permitted Uses. 
Any permitted use of the underlying zoning shall only be allowed in the Environmental Constraint Overlay Area upon issuance of a special use permit. (Ord. 832) 
Section 6-790.  Accessory Uses. 
Only those accessory uses of the underlying zoning that are directly related to the permitted principal use on a property shall be an allowed accessory use on the property in the Environmental Constraint Overlay Area. (Ord. 832) 
Section 6-800.  Specially Permitted Uses. 
(1)
  Any permitted or specially permitted use of the underlying zoning. 

(2)

E. No more than 13,500 tons of salt shall be brought onto the property in any calendar year. 
F. Salt tonnage per delivery and delivery dates and times shall be logged and made available for review to ensure compliance with this section.  No salt deliveries shall be made between the hours of 9pm-8am.  No weekend or holiday deliveries are permitted. 
G. An Environmental Storm Water Sampling Program shall be reviewed and approved as part of the Special Use Permit and shall be commissioned to ensure road salt activity is not negatively impacting down gradient storm water receptors. Such program shall be reopened and/or revised as necessary throughout the life of the special use to ensure salt storage activities do not negatively impact down gradient storm water receptors. 
H. Failure to strictly comply with the specific requirements in this Paragraph (4) shall not constitute a violation if the item of noncompliance is, in the City’s determination, nominal or is due to factors beyond the reasonable control of the business such as weather or equipment failures.  However, no flexibility shall be allowed with respect to the total limits established in this Paragraph (4) for total square footage of sheds and total amount of salt brought onto a property. (Ord. 832)

Article 1. Planned Residential Development 
Sec. 7-010. Reserved. (Code of 2001) 
Sec. 7-020. Purpose. 
The Zoning Code and the Platting Ordinance of the City have been adopted to ensure uniformity in the treatment of land use, density, bulk and open space.  Such uniform treatment is based on the concept of a single building on a single lot.  The City Council recognizes that there have been important changes in the methods of subdivision layout, the design and use of land, and placement of buildings thereon.  The City Council also recognizes that the methods for preservation of public health, safety, morals, and general welfare must be altered from time to time as the City Council deems fit to meet advances in technology and changes in social thought as they occur and present the demand. 
This Article of the Zoning Code presents a method whereby, with the approval of the City Council, an applicant may proceed with a program for the use of land in a manner that encourages social interchange, life-cycle environment, and efficiency in the use of land without creating a detriment to public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. 
The City Council further recognizes that in the creation of planned residential development, variations in density, bulk, height, setback, and other regulations pertaining to the use of land may occur that are not in strict accordance with other provisions of the Zoning Code or any other ordinance of the City.  However, if it can be shown by the applicant that such variations, due to the design and layout of the planned residential development, are not detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare, then variations will be allowed within the confines stated elsewhere in this Article. 
The purpose of this Article of the Zoning Code is to provide for and encourage advances in housing design; changes in types of dwellings; more flexibility in layout and site planning; the development of the life-cycle environment; and the more efficient use of land, open space, and public facilities.  This Article also details the requirements for obtaining a permit for a planned residential development of residential and ancillary uses. (Code of 2001)

(Previously was Section 8-670; Code of 2001) 


Sec. 8-061.  Determination of Permitted Use. 
The provisions of this Code listing permitted uses cannot reasonably include all possible uses of the same or similar nature and character. To limit permitted uses to those which are specifically set forth in the Code would be unduly restrictive, and to require an amendment to the Code to allow uses which are essentially the same as those listed in their impact on the community would be unnecessarily burdensome.  However, to serve the purposes of the Zoning Code and protect the public health, safety and welfare and general convenience of the community, the Code must be so interpreted, enforced, and administrated as to assure compatible and complimentary land uses.  The procedures and criteria set forth in Sections 8-061 through 8-063, therefore, are enacted to meet these objectives.  (Ord. No. 587, 11-10-92; Previously was Section 8­700; Code of 2001) 
Sec. 8-062.  Procedure for Determining Permitted Use. 
(1)The procedure and voting requirements for determining whether a proposed use is permitted pursuant to Sections 5-010 (4), 5-120 (2) G, 5-220 (1), 5-340 (1) C and 5-420 (2) shall be the same as that specified for consideration of special use permits in section 8-120. 
(2) The determination of the City Council shall be set forth in a resolution which includes findings addressing the criteria set forth in Section 8-063.  The resolution shall specify and describe the proposed use in whatever detail is deemed necessary by the City Council to define the nature and characteristics of the use to which the findings relate.  No change, alteration, extension or expansion of the use described in the resolution may be made without first securing from the City Council a new determination in accordance with Sections 8-061 through 8-063.  (Ord. No. 587, 11-10-92; Previously was Section 8-710; Code of 2001) 
Sec. 8-063.  Criteria for Determining Permitted Use. 
(1)
 The City Council shall not approve a proposed use as a permitted use unless it finds that all of the following criteria are met: 

A. The proposed use is consistent with the City's comprehensive plan. 
B. The proposed use is not listed as a special use in the district. 
C. The proposed use meets the criteria set forth in Section 8-130. 
D. The proposed use is not a residential use. 
E. The proposed use is suitable for any property in the district. 
F. The proposed use is consistent with any general description in the code of the nature of uses for which the district is intended. 
G. The proposed use is compatible with and complimentary to other permitted uses in the district. 
H. The proposed use is so similar in its nature and characteristics with respect to general zoning purposes that it is deemed in all practical respects to be the same as a listed permitted use. 
I. The proposed use will not have a detrimental effect on the economic viability of other permitted uses in the district. 

(2)
 In making its determination the City Council shall consider, among other factors, the similarity of the proposed use to listed permitted uses with respect to:  the creation of dust, noise, glare, litter, vibrations, fumes and odors; hours of operation; visual and aesthetic compatibility; services and goods provided or sold; the community served by the proposed use; the generation of traffic; outside storage or activities; maintaining continuity and compatibility of uses in the district; and the need for police, fire or other public services.  (Ord. No. 587, 11-10-92; Previously was Section 8-720; Code of 2001) 


Article 2. Special Use Permit and Variance 

Sec. 8-110. Special Uses and Special Use Permits. 
Special uses as shown in specified districts of this Chapter may be permitted in those districts by the City Council where such uses are deemed essential or desirable to the public convenience and welfare, and are in harmony with the various elements or objectives of the comprehensive plan, and if their location, plan, and character of the development are first considered by the Planning Commission following the procedure set forth in this Chapter. 
In the exercise of its approval, the City Council may impose such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable in the furtherance of the purposes of the Zoning Code. (Code of 2001) 
Sec. 8-120. Procedure. 
An application for a special use permit shall be referred by the proper City official to the Planning Commission for consideration at a public hearing following publication as prescribed in Section 8-055 and recommendation to the City Council. The Planning Commission shall report to the City Council within forty days after receiving the application at a regular meeting. The City Council shall consider the application within 45 days after receipt of the application by the Planning Commission and with or without a recommendation from the Planning Commission. The City Council may grant application for a special use permit by a majority vote of the City Council. The fee for processing a special use permit shall be established by resolution. (Ord. No. 539, 2-25-86; Code of 2001; Ord. 861, 5-8-2018) 
Sec. 8-130. Special Use Standards. 
No special use shall be recommended by the Planning Commission unless it shall find: 
(1)
 That the establishment, maintenance, or operations of the special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare. 

(2)
 That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood. 

(3)
 That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district. 

(4) 
That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities have been or are being provided. 

(5)
 That the special use shall in all other respects conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located. (Code of 2001) 


Sec. 8-140 through 8 – 200. Reserved. 
Sec. 8-210. Variance. 
The City Council shall have the power to grant variances from the literal provisions of the City’s Zoning Code as authorized by Minnesota Statutes, Section 462.357, Subd. 6, as may be amended. The variance process is intended to provide limited relief from the strict requirements of the Zoning Code in cases where strict application of a particular requirement will create practical difficulties due to circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration.  It is not intended that variances be granted to allow a use not permitted by the underlying zoning district, nor to merely remove inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of the Zoning Code may impose on property owners in general.  Variances are intended to address extraordinary, exceptional, or unique situations that were not caused by the applicant’s act or omission. (Ordinance No 796, 01-11-2011; Ord. No. 863, 11-13-2018) 
Sec. 8-220. Application. 
All applications for a variance shall include: 
(1) 	
A completed City of New Brighton application form; 

(2) 
Verification of authority to file the application (i.e. proof of ownership or control of the property; if not the owner of the property, the signature of the fee owner of the property); 

(3) 
A written narrative demonstrating that the criteria for a variance as set out in Section 8­230(1) have been met; 

(4) 
An up-to-date survey of the property showing all information necessary to allow the City to determine conformance with all zoning provisions, and to calculate the specific variance(s) being requested.  Information shall include but not be limited to: 

A. Property and structure dimensions; 
B. Setback dimensions/measurements; and 
C. Parking and access locations and dimensions; 

(5) 	
Electronic copies of all documents required by the specific application; 

(6) 	
Applicable fee; and 

(7) 
Any other information deemed necessary by the City in order to review the application. (Ord. No. 539, 2-25-86; Code of 2001; Ord. 861, 5-8-2018; Ord. No. 863, 11-13-2018) 


Sec. 8-230. Review 
(1) 	
Variance Criteria. Approval of a variance requires that the City find that all of the following criteria are satisfied, as they may be modified from time to time by statute or interpretative court decisions: 

A. 	The request is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the Zoning Code; 
B. 	The variance is consistent with the City’s comprehensive plan; 
C. 	The applicant can establish there are “practical difficulties” in complying with the Zoning Code based on the following: 
1. 	
The applicant proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not permitted by the Zoning Code; 

2. 	
The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not created by the landowner; and 

3. 	
A variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. 



(2) 
Practical Difficulties and Variance Guidelines. 

A. Economic considerations alone shall not constitute a sufficient basis for granting a variance if reasonable use for the property exists under the terms of the ordinance. 
B. Practical difficulties include, but are not limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. 
C. Variances shall be granted for earth sheltered construction, as defined by State Statute, when in harmony with the ordinance. 
D. A variance to permit a use that is not otherwise allowed by this ordinance is prohibited. 
E. Variances may be granted to permit the temporary use of a one-family dwelling as a two-family dwelling. 

(3) 
Planning Commission. 

A. 	Before any variance is considered by the City Council acting as the Board of Adjustments and Appeals, the Planning Commission shall hold at least one public hearing after proper notice has been issued in accordance with Section 8-055. 
B. 	Following the hearing, the Planning Commission will be asked to discuss the facts of the case and adopt findings and recommendations on the proposed variance for consideration by the City Council. 
C. 	Applications may be forwarded to the City Council without a recommendation from the Planning Commission if it is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with state mandated deadlines for application review. 

(4) 
City Council. 


A. The City Council shall consider the applicant’s submittals, the Planning Commission’s recommendation, City staff’s recommendation, and the comments received at the public hearing against the variance review criteria outlined in Section 8-230(1), and take action on the request(s) as soon as practicable. 
B. Approval or denial of a variance shall require a majority vote of the City Council. 
1. 	
In approving a variance, the City Council may impose conditions on the approval as deemed appropriate to ensure compliance with the approval and to protect adjacent properties. Any conditions must be directly related to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance. 

2. 	
Denial of any request shall be accompanied by findings of fact as to how the request did not meet one or more of the review criteria. (Ordinance No 796, 01-11-2011; Ord. No. 863, 11-13-2018) 


Sec. 8-240. Effect of a Variance 
(1) 	
The issuance of a variance shall authorize only the particular variation that is approved by the City Council. 

(2) 	
A variance, including any conditions, shall run with the land and shall not be affected by a change in ownership. (Code of 2001; Ordinance No. 863, 11-13-2018) 


Sec. 8-250. Subsequent Development 
Development authorized by the Variance shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other approvals required by this zoning ordinance or any other applicable chapters or regulations.  The granting of a variance does not constitute, imply, or guarantee the granting of any other such required approval (e.g.: a building permit). (Code of 2001; Ordinance No. 863, 11-13-2018) 
Sec. 8-260. Time Limit 
(1)

Sec. 8-310. Reserved. 
Sec. 8-320. Rezoning by Petition. 
(1)
 The Planning Commission shall, upon the petition of fifty percent or more by number of the property owners within 200 feet of the property to be rezoned, fix a date for a public hearing. The petition shall be accompanied by an abstractor's certificate showing the names of all property owners within 350 feet of the property to be rezoned. The fee for processing a rezoning shall be established by resolution. 

(2) 
The Planning Commission shall hold at least one public hearing on any petition for rezoning after published notice of the time and place at least ten days before the hearing.  The Planning Commission shall also cause a notice to be mailed to each property owner within 350 feet of the property for which rezoning is petitioned, such notices to be mailed to the last known addresses of the owners at least ten days before the hearing. 

(3)
 The petitioner requesting rezoning shall erect, or cause to be erected, at least one sign per street frontage on the property described in the petition. The sign(s) shall be of a design approved by the City and shall be 36 inches by sixty inches in size, shall have letters at least four inches high using Helvetica medium type face or other letter style approved by the City and shall be constructed of sturdy material, shall be neatly lettered, and shall be in clear public view of persons on the adjoining street right-of-way.

(4) After hearing the petition, the City Council may, by ordinance, grant the petition by a majority vote of all its members. If the rezoning changes all or part of the existing classification of a zoning district from residential to either commercial or industrial, a two-thirds majority vote of all members of the City Council is required. (Ord. No. 518, 1-24-84; Ord. No. 539, 2-25-86; Code of 2001; Ord. 861, 5-8-2018) 
Sec. 8-330. Rezoning by Council Initiative.

Sec. 8-350. Planning Commission to Act. 
(1) The City Council shall not rezone any land or area in any zoning district without such rezoning proposal having first been reviewed by the Planning Commission at a public hearing. (Code of 2001) 

Article 4. Nonconforming Use 
Sec. 8-410. Nonconforming Use. 
(1) 
It is recognized that there are structures, uses of land, and combinations thereof that were lawfully established and that do not now comply with all applicable portions of the Zoning Code. 

(2) 
While it is recognized that such nonconforming uses may not be summarily terminated, it is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to discourage their survival. Such uses are hereby declared to be incompatible with the Zoning Code. It is further the purpose and intent of this Chapter to discourage the enlargement, expansion of, extension of any nonconforming uses or any increase of the impact of such nonconforming uses on adjoining premises. The elimination of nonconformities and/or the reduction of their impact on adjacent premises shall be encouraged. 

(3) 
It is further the purpose and intent to discourage the use of the provisions of this Chapter to expand structures beyond allowable zoning district density and floor area ratio requirements. The provisions of the Chapter shall not apply to signs. Signs shall be controlled by the provision of Chapter 9 of the Zoning Code. (Ord. No. 550, 8-11-87; Code of 2001) 

(4) 
For purposes of this Article, “expansion” or “expanded” shall be defined as increasing the intensity of the use based upon the original nature, function, or purpose of the nonconforming use.   This includes, but is not limited to increasing the use’s hours of operation, amount of traffic being generated, the amount of parking on the property, the amount of noise being generated, the amount of exterior storage on the property, exterior lighting, the number of types of operations on the property, the types of goods or services being offered on the property, the amount of odor being generated, the area of operation on the property, the number of employees, the size of the structures on the property, and other factors deemed relevant by the City. (Ordinance 852; 6-27­2017) 


Sec. 8-420. Types of Nonconforming Uses. 
There are four types of nonconforming uses. They are: 
(1) 
Type 1. The nonconforming use of land that is vacant, or has no structure, or improvement or combination thereof with an assessor's market value over $1,000. 

(2) 
Type 2. Any use of a structure that is not a use permitted in the zoning district where located as provided for in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. 

(3) 
Type 3. Any use of land not necessary or customarily incidental to the principal use of the structure located on such land where such use of land is not a use permitted in the zoning district where located as provided for in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. 

(4) 
Type 4. Any structure or use of land not included in Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3. (Ord. No. 550, 8-11­87; Code of 2001) 


Sec. 8-430. Regulations as to Type 1 Nonconformities. 
(1) 
No such use shall be expanded or enlarged to use more land area. 

(2) 
No such use shall be moved to a different area within the parcel of land. 

(3) 
No such use shall be reestablished if the use has been discontinued for one or more months. 

(4)
 No structure or improvement shall be enlarged or replaced. 

(5)
 Type 1 nonconformities may continue for a period of twelve months from February 13, 1975, whereupon such nonconforming use shall cease. (Code of 2001) 


Sec. 8-440. Regulations as to Type 2 Nonconformities. 
(1) 
No such structure shall be expanded, enlarged, replaced or located except in changing the use to a permitted use. 

(2) 
Any existing nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of the structure which is manifestly arranged or designed for such use but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such structure. 

(3) 
No such use shall be reestablished if the use has been discontinued for six or more months. 

(4)
 Removal or destruction of such structure shall terminate the right to continue any nonconforming use of the premises. 

(5) 
Any such use may be changed to another nonconforming use with permission of the City Council.  The permission shall only be granted upon the City Council's finding that the proposed use is equally or more appropriate to the zoning district than the present use and that the impact of the nonconformity on adjacent premises will not be increased. The procedure (not conditions) shall be the same as that for a variance, Section 8-220. The fee for processing a nonconforming use shall be established by resolution. The City Council may require plans or other evidence regarding the present and proposed use. 

(6) 
Whenever any such use is superseded by a permitted use, the nonconforming status of the premises shall terminate. (Ord. No. 539, 2-25-86; Code of 2001) 


Sec. 8-450. Regulations as to Type 3 Nonconformities. 
The Type 3 nonconformities may continue for a period of twelve months from February 13, 1975, whereupon such nonconforming use shall cease. (Code of 2001) 
Sec. 8-460. Regulations as to Type 4 Nonconformities. 
(1)
 Where Type 4 nonconformities are present and are proposed to continue, expansion of the existing structure or use, construction of new structures, or resumption of use after discontinuance of use for six or more months shall be allowed only upon permission of the City Council. The procedure (not conditions) shall be the same as that for a variance, Section 8-220. The fee for processing a nonconforming use shall be established by ­resolution. 

(2)
 Such permission may be granted only if one or more of the following conditions are met: 

A. The total number of nonconformities is reduced. 
B. The impact of the expansion of any nonconformity upon adjacent premises is reduced to the greatest practical extent. 
C. The extent of any nonconformity is reduced where practical. 

(3)
 The City Council may condition the granting of such permission to more effectively carry out the intent of the Zoning Code. 

(4)
 Expansion of a Type 4 nonconformity shall meet the requirements of Section 8-460 (1) through (3) except that the conditions for a variance must also be present. For the purposes of this Chapter, such permission shall be called a nonconforming use variance. 

(5)
 Removal or destruction of the principal structure shall terminate the right to continue any nonconforming use of the premises. (Ord. No. 539, 2-25-86; Code of 2001; Ord. 852, 6-27-2017) 


Sec. 8-470. Eminent Domain. 
Where the taking under eminent domain of a portion of the land upon which there existed a lawful use of the land or a structure thereon prior to such taking results in such use becoming unlawful under the Zoning Code, such use is a nonconforming use and may be continued under the provisions of this Chapter. (Code of 2001) 
Sec. 8-480. Repairs and Maintenance. 
Repair and maintenance work may be permitted by the City on buildings included in Type 2 and Type 4 Nonconformities so long as the cost does not exceed fifty percent of the current assessor's market value for such building and so long as such work does not involve repair or replacement of the foundation or bearing walls. Where the cost of such work exceeds fifty percent of the current assessor's market value, permission for such work must be obtained from the City Council pursuant to Section 8-460 in the case of a Type 4 Nonconformity, and the nonconforming status of the building shall terminate as to a Type 2 Nonconformity. (Code of 2001) 
Sec. 8-500 thru 8-690 reserved 6/10/03. 
Sec. 8-700.  Permitted Use Determination, Purpose. 
The provisions of this Code listing permitted uses cannot reasonably include all possible uses of the same or similar nature and character.  To limit permitted uses to those which are specifically set forth in the code would be unduly restrictive, and to require an amendment to the code to allow uses which are essentially the same as those listed in their impact on the community would be unnecessarily burdensome.  However, to serve the purposes of the zoning code and protect the public health, safety and welfare and general convenience of the community, the code must be so interpreted, enforced and administrated as to assure compatible and complimentary land uses.  The procedures and criteria set forth in sections 8-700 through 8-720, therefore, are enacted to meet these objectives. (Ord. No. 587, 11/10/92 entered 6/10/03) 
Sec. 8-710.  Permitted Use Determination, Procedure. 
The procedure and voting requirements for determining whether a proposed use is permitted pursuant to sections 5-010(4), 5-120(G),  5-220(11),5-340(3) and 5-420(2) shall be the same as that specified for consideration of special use permits in section 8-120.  The determination of the council shall be set forth in a resolution which includes findings addressing the criteria set forth in section 8-720.  The resolution shall specify and describe the proposed use in whatever detail is deemed necessary by the council to define the nature and characteristics of the use to which the findings relate.  No change, alteration, extension or expansion of the use described in the resolution may be made without first securing from the council a new determination in accordance with sections 8-700 through 8-720. (Ord. No. 587, 11/10/92 entered 6/10/03) 
Sec. 8-720.  Permitted Use Determination, Criteria. 
(1)
 The council shall not approve a proposed use as a permitted use unless it finds that all of the following criteria are met: 

A. The proposed use is consistent with the city=s comprehensive plan. 
B. The proposed use is not listed as a special use in the district. 
C. The proposed use meets the criteria set forth in section 8-130. 
D. The proposed use is not a residential use. 
E. The proposed use is suitable for any property in the district. 
F. The proposed use is consistent with any general description in the code of the nature of uses for which the district is intended. 
G. The proposed use is compatible with and complimentary to other permitted uses in the district. 
H. The proposed use is so similar in its nature and characteristics with respect to general zoning purposes that it is deemed in all practical respects to be the same as a listed permitted use. 
I. The proposed use will not have a detrimental effect on the economic viability of other permitted uses in the district. 

(2)
 In making its determination the council shall consider, among other factors, the similarity of the proposed use to listed permitted uses with respect to: the creation of dust, noise, glare, litter, vibrations, fumes and odors; hours of operation; visual and aesthetic compatibility; services and goods provided or sold; the community served by the proposed use; the generation of traffic; outside storage or activities; maintaining continuity and compatibility of uses in the district; and the need for police, fire or other public services.

B. Electric and/or Dynamic Signs. All electric and/or dynamic signs shall be designed and installed in accordance with the electrical code and shall obtain an electrical permit. 
C. Clearance from High-Voltage Power Lines. Signs shall be located no less than six feet horizontally or twelve feet vertically from overhead electrical conductors that are energized in excess of 750 volts. The term "overhead conductors" as used in this Section means any electrical conductor, either bare or insulated, above the ground except such conductors that are enclosed in iron pipe or other material covering of equal strength.

F. Traffic Flow. No sign shall be used at any location or in any manner where it may be confused or construed as a traffic-control device or create a traffic hazard. 
G. Sign Maintenance. The owner of any sign shall properly maintain and keep the sign in a safe, orderly condition and keep such sign, including all parts and supports, properly painted. (Ord. No. 534,  9-24-85; Ord. No. 583, 10-22-91; Code of 2001; Ord. No. 758, 3-11-08, Ord No 804, 10-25-2011; Ord. 860, 3-27­2018) 
Sec. 9-041. Area of Special Control. 
(1) 
It is recognized that regulations provided in this Chapter cannot sensitively handle all the sign situations in the City.  Therefore, the City Council may designate by resolution any of the following as areas of special control: 

A. Scenic Areas. Are areas where special architectural or historical characteristics or where natural beauty requires special sign regulations to ensure that all signs used within the areas are compatible with each other. 
B. Shopping Centers. Are more intensive commercial areas signs should be permitted that differ from those that would otherwise be allowed under this Chapter. A shopping center is a premises planned and developed as a unit, with an undivided or nonsegregated parking area that is advertised as a center and has multiple occupancy. 
C. Renewal Areas. Are areas designed for renewal, redevelopment, or as development districts in accordance with the procedures established in Minnesota Statutes. 

(2) 
In areas of special control, the City Council may, by special permit, establish special regulations for signs that are either more restrictive or less restrictive than those provided by this Chapter, having regard for the character of the area of special control to which the special permit will apply. 

A. In scenic areas, it is generally expected that sign regulations will be more restrictive than those that would otherwise be applicable under this Chapter. 
B. For shopping centers, in addition to general standards in Section 9-040, the following apply: 
1.
 The shopping center should be identified by a single ground sign for the purpose of center identification. 

2.
 The height and size limitations of a ground and wall sign shall follow the B-3 zoning requirements, unless approved otherwise through the special use permit provisions herein. 

3. 
would be an identity sign only. 


C. In renewal areas it is recognized that Zoning Code regulations may have to be varied to creatively and reasonably revitalize the area. It is the intent of this paragraph that a comprehensive sign plan shall be a component of an overall renewal plan and be sensitive to and compatible with the unique physical circumstances that may be created by a renewal project. The general purposes of sound identification, reduction or clutter, and aesthetic enhancement shall, however, be the controlling standard.

Affected Lands.  This Chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City as shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Flood Plain Districts. 

(2) 
Official Zoning Map Established. The Official Zoning Map together with all materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Chapter. The attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study for Ramsey County, Minnesota (All Jurisdictions), Flood Insurance Rate Map panel therein numbered 27123C0004G, 27123C0005G, 27123C0010G, 27123C0012G, 27123C0016G and the Flood Insurance Rate Map Index numbered 27123CIND0A, all dated June 4, 2010 and prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  The Official Zoning Map shall be on file in the Office of the City Clerk and the City Planner. (Ord. No. 790, 4-27-2010) 

(3) 
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. The Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a floodway. 

(4) 
Interpretation. 

A. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State Statutes. 
B. The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map.  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the decision by City staff, the City Council shall make the necessary interpretation.  All decisions will be based on elevations on the regional 100 year flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time of initial adoption of this floodplain ordinance or on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data.  Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the City Council and to submit technical evidence.  (Ord. No. 790, 4-27-2010) 

(5) 
Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.  However, where this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail.  All other ordinances inconsistent with this Chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 

(6) 
Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages.  This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 

(7) 
Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter shall not be affected thereby. 

(8) 
Definitions. Words or phrases used in this Chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and so as to give this Chapter its most reasonable application unless specifically defined in this Subsection. 


A. Accessory Use or Structure. A use or structure on the same lot with and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal use or structure. 
B. Basement. Any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level. 
C. Special Use. A specific type of structure or land use listed in the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that:  
1.
 Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist and  

2.
 The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists 


and is compatible with the existing neighborhood. 
Special Use is synonymous with the term Conditional Use.  

D. Equal Degree of Encroachment. A method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows. 
E. Flood.  A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas. 
F. Flood Frequency. The frequency at which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may be equalled or exceeded. 
G. Flood Fringe. That portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway.  Flood fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood Insurance Study for City. 
H. Flood Plain. The beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake, or watercourse that have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood. 
I. Flood-Proofing. A combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages. 
J. Floodway. The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those portions of the adjoining flood plain that are reasonably required to carry or store the regional flood discharge. 
K. Lowest Floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement).  An unfinished or floor resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor. 
L. Manufactured Home.  A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities.  The term “manufactured home” does not include the term “recreational vehicle.” 
M. Obstruction. Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory flood plain that may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water. 
N. Principal Use or Structure. All uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures. 
O. Reach.  A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction.  In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach. 
P. Recreational Vehicle. A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.  For the purposes of this Chapter, the term recreational vehicle shall be synonymous with the term travel trailer/travel vehicle. 
Q. Regional Flood. A flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100 year recurrence interval.  Regional flood is synonymous with the term “base flood” used in the Flood Insurance Study. 
R. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.  The Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a floodway. 
S. Structure. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, travel trailers/vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in Section 10-090(3)A. 
T. Substantial Damage. Means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
U. Substantial Improvement.  Within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement.  This term includes structures that have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed.  The term does not, however, include either: 
1. 
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 

2. 
Any alteration of an “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an “historic structure.”  For the purpose of this Chapter, “historic structure” shall be as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 


59.1. 
V. Variance. A modification of a specific permitted development standard required in an official control, including this Chapter, to allow an alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty, or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.   
(9) Annexations:  The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into Section 10-020 (2) above may include floodplain area that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the City of New Brighton at the time of adoption of this Chapter.  If any of these floodplain land area are annexed into the City of New Brighton after the date of adoption of this Chapter, the newly annexed floodplain lands shall be subject to the provisions of this Chapter immediately upon the date of annexations into the City of New Brighton. (Ord. No. 581, 6-11-91; Code of 2001, ord. No. 790, 4-27-2010) 
Sec. 10-030. Establishment of Zoning Districts. 
(1) Districts. 
A. Floodway District. The Floodway District shall include those areas designated as floodway on the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in Section 10-020 (2).  For lakes, wetlands and other basins, the Floodway District shall include those areas designated as Zone AE (that do not have a floodway designated) and Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted in Section 10-020 that are below the ordinary high water level as defined in Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.0005, subdivision 14.

For lakes, wetlands and other basins, the Flood Fringe District shall include those areas designated as Zone AE (that do not have a floodway designated) and Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted in Section 10-020 (2) that are below the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100­year flood elevation) but above the ordinary high water level as defined in Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.005, subdivision 14. 
C. General Flood Plain District. The General Flood Plain District shall include those areas designated as Zone A and Zone AE (without a floodway designated) on the Flood Insurance Rate 
Map adopted in Section 10-020 (2), which are not subject to criteria in A and B above. 
(2) Compliance. No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Chapter and other applicable regulations that apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this Chapter. Within the Floodway, Flood Fringe, and General Flood Plain Districts, all uses not listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in Section 10-040, 10-050, and 10-060, respectively, shall be prohibited.  In addition, a caution is provided here that: 
A. New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain recreational vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this Chapter and specifically Section 10-090. 
B. Modifications, additions, structural alterations, normal maintenance and repair, or repair after damage to existing nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of structures or land are regulated by the general provisions of this Chapter and specifically Section 10-110; and 
C. As-built elevations for elevated or flood-proofed structures must be certified by ground surveys and flood-proofing techniques must be designed and certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as specified in the general provisions of this Chapter and specifically as stated in Section 10-100 of this Chapter. (Ord. No. 581, 6-11-91; Code of 2001) 
Sec. 10-040. Floodway District (FW).

D. Residential lawns, gardens, parking areas, and play areas. 

(2) 
Standards for Floodway Permitted Uses. 

A. The use shall have a low flood damage potential. 
B. The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists. 
C. The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and shall not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations, or storage of materials or equipment. 

(3) 
Special Uses. 


A. Structures accessory to the uses listed in 10-040 (1) and the uses listed in 10-040 (3) B-H. 
B. Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials. 
C. Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water control structures.

G. Recreational vehicles either on individual lots of record or in existing or new subdivisions or commercial or condominium type campgrounds, subject to the exemptions and provisions of Section 10-090 (3) of this Chapter. 
H. Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes, and floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual structures, and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten year frequency flood event. 
(4) Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses. 
A. All Uses. No structure (temporary or permanent) fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100 year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damage in the reach or reaches affected. 
B. Standards. All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained in Section 10-100 (4) of this Chapter. 
C. Underlying District. The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists. 
D. Fill. 
1.
 Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the flood plain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap, or other acceptable method. 

2.
 Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a long term site development plan is submitted that includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element. 

3.
 As an alternative, and consistent with Section 10-040 (4) D2, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials that would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100 year or regional flood but only after the Governing Body has received an appropriate plan that assures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available.  The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the Office of the County Recorder. 


E. Accessory Structures. 
1.
 Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation. 

2.
 Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood waters. 

a.
 Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow, and,  

b.
 So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures. 



3.
 Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry flood-proofed in accordance with the FB-1 or FP-2 flood-proofing classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be flood-proofed to the FB-3 or FB­4 flood-proofing classification in the State Building Code provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage.  All flood-proofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards, 

a.
 The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; 

b.
 Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation or properly flood-proofed; and. 

c.
 To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total 




net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding.  There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
F. Storage of Materials and Equipment: 
1.
 The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 

2.
 Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the Governing Body. 


G. Structural Works. Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current, or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 103G. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory flood plain shall not be allowed in the floodway.  
H. Levee Impact. A levee, dike, or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100 year or regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream. (Ord. No. 581, 6-11-91; Code of 2001,  Ord. No 790, 4-27-2010) 
Sec. 10-050. Flood Fringe District (FF). 
(1) 
Permitted Uses.  Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s).  If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential or non-residential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in the flood fringe provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance.  All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood fringe “permitted uses” listed in Section 10-050 (2) and the “standards for all flood fringe uses” listed in Section 10-050 (5). 

(2) 
Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses. 

A. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor including the basement floor is at or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.  The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least fifteen feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon. 
B. As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its largest projection may be internally flood-proofed in accordance with Section 10-040 (4) E3. 
C. The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of 1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a special use, unless said fill is specially intended to elevate a structure in accordance with Section 10-050 (2) A. 
D. The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. 
E. The provisions of Section 10-050 (5) of this Chapter shall also apply. 

(3) 
Special Uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood-proofed in accordance with Section 10­050 (2) A-B or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in Section 10-050 (2) C-D shall only be allowable as a special use.  An application for a special use shall be subject to the standards, 


criteria, and evaluation procedures specified in Sections 10-050 (4) and (5) and 10-100 (4). 
(4) Standards for Flood Fringe Special Uses. 
A. Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure’s lowest floor above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.  These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck-under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor if: 
1.
 The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 


2.
 It is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 


3.
 It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. 
The noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards:   


a.
 Design and certification. The structure’s design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities must be at or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of  flooding. 

b.
 Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas.  Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck-under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: 




i) The minimum area of “automatic” openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a flood-proofing technique.  There shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade.  The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice.  The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and. ii) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage. 
B. Basements, as defined by Section 10-020 (8) B of this Chapter shall be subject to the following: 
1.
 Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. 

2.
 Non-residential basements may be allowed below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood-proofed in accordance with Section 10-050 (4) C of this Chapter. 


C. All areas of non-residential structures including basements to be placed below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation shall be flood-proofed in accordance with the structurally dry flood-proofing classifications in the State Building Code.  Structurally dry flood-proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood-proofing classification in the State Building code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.  Structures flood-proofed to the FP-3 and FP-4 classification shall not be permitted. 
D. When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar materials is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a State approved shoreland management ordinance.  In the absence of a State approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100 year or regional flood event.  The professional plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the Governing Body.  The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the flood plain if adequate flood warning time exists.   
E. Storage of materials and equipment. 
1.
 The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 

2.
 Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the Governing Body. 


F. The provisions of Section 10-050 of this Chapter shall also apply. 
(5) Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses.   
A. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.  If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.   
B. Commercial uses.  Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth greater that two feet or be subject to flood velocities greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the regional flood. 
C. Manufacturing and industrial uses. Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in Section 10-050 (5) B.  In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in the flood plain areas. 
D. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover, or other acceptable method.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100 year flood elevation. FEMA’s requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be required. 
E. Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the Official Zoning Map. 
F. Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in Section 10-090 (3). 
G. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.  Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.  This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. (Ord. No. 581, 6-11-91; Code of 2001 Ord. No. 790, 4-27-2010) 
Section 10-060. General Flood Plain District. 
(1) 
Permissible Uses. 

A. The uses listed in Section 10-040 (1) of this Chapter shall be permitted uses. 
B. All other uses shall be subject to the 1% annual change flood (100-Year Flood Elevations) and/or floodway/flood fringe determinations criteria pursuant to Section 10-060 (2) and Section 10-060 (3) below.  Section 10-040 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Floodway District and Section 10-050 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Flood Fringe District. 

(2) 
Procedures for 1% annual chance flood (100-Year Flood Elevations) and/or Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations for Streams Located Within the General Flood Plain District. 


A. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the General Flood Plain District, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator for the determination of the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and whether the proposed use is within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District. 
1.
 A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water information. 

2.
 Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground; pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations; size, location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site; location and elevations of streets; photographs showing existing land uses and vegetation upstream and downstream; and soil type. 

3.
 Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development. 


B. The applicant shall submit a copy of the information required by Section 10-060 (2) A to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining the 1% annual chance flood (100-Year Flood Elevations), if not available, whether the proposed use is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District and to determine the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.500-6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation.  The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective Department of Natural Resources’ Area Hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis.  The designated engineer or expert shall: 
1.
 Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood. 

2.
 Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas. 

3.
 Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot.  A lesser stage increase than 0.5 foot shall be 


required if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increased flood damage would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both side of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 
C. The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and findings of the designated engineer or expert to the City Council. The City Council must formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit application.  The City Council, prior to official action, may submit the application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Natural Resources, or the Planning Commission for review and comment.  Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe boundaries have been determined, the City Council shall refer the matter back to the City staff who shall process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of Section 10-040 and 10-050 of this Chapter.   
(3) Procedures for determining 1% annual chance flood elevations (100-YR flood elevations) for lakes located in Zone A: 
A. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within a Zone A, the Zoning 
Administrator will use the 1% annual chance flood elevation for that basin that has previously 
been determined in accordance with approved FEMA methods, if available.  If the 1% annual 
chance flood elevation has not been previously determined, the applicant shall be required to 
furnish all necessary information as deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator for the 
determination for the 1% annual chance flood elevation in accordance with approved FEMA 
methods. 

B. The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to a 
designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining  
whether the proposed use is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District and to determine the 1% 
annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevations).  Procedures consistent with Minnesota 
Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000 – 6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall 
be followed in this expert evaluation.  The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged 
to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective Department of 
Natural Resources’ Area Hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. 

C. Once the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation) has been determined, 
the Zoning Administrator shall process the permit application consistent with the applicable 
provisions of Section 10-040 and 10-050 of this Chapter.

Article 4. Park Land Dedication 
Sec. 26-50. Land Required. 
(1) 
Dedication to City.  The owners of land being subdivided shall dedicate to the City a reasonable portion of the land for use as public parks, playgrounds, trails or open space. 

A. 	In all residential subdivisions it shall be presumed that a reasonable amount of land has been dedicated for parks and playgrounds if the subdivider dedicates at least ten percent of the total land in the proposed subdivision. The City shall determine whether a cash payment in lieu of land dedication is appropriate. 
B. 	In all commercial and industrial subdivisions, it shall be presumed that a reasonable amount of land has been dedicated to serve the needs of the resident and working population for parks and playgrounds if the subdivider dedicates at least ten percent (10%) of the land in the subdivision for parks, recreation and usable open space.  The City shall determine whether a cash payment in lieu of land dedication is appropriate. 
C. 	The dedication of a portion of land for parks or playgrounds, or the payment of cash in lieu thereof, provided for above shall be presumed to be reasonable. However, upon the request of the applicant, the recommendation of Parks, Recreation, and Environmental Commission, or at the discretion of the Council, the City may either increase or decrease such dedication or payment upon a determination by the Council that such dedication or payment is unreasonable or insufficient given the specific characteristics of the proposed subdivision and its intended use. 

(2) 
Suitability of Land. The City may determine the location and configuration of any land dedicated, taking into consideration the suitability of the land for its intended purpose and future needs of the community for park, playground, trail, or open space property. 

(3) 
Exemption. This Article shall apply to all new residential, commercial and industrial developments, and lot combination or redivisions meant to facilitate such development. It shall not apply to lot combination or redivisions that do not increase the number of single-family residential lots, conversion of apartments to condominiums, or internal leasehold improvements. 

(4) 
Contribution in Lieu of Land. At the City’s option, the subdivider shall contribute an amount in cash in lieu of all or a portion of the land required under Section 26-50 (1). The contribution amount shall be determined prior to the City granting final approval. The amount of any cash in lieu contribution shall be based on the average fair market value of the land that would otherwise be required to be dedicated. For the purposes of this section, “fair market value” means the value of land as determined by the City annually based on tax valuation or other relevant data, and set forth in the City’s fee schedule. If the applicant disputes the amount of the proposed cash in lieu contribution, the applicant, at the applicant’s expense, may obtain an independent appraisal of the property. The appraisal must be made by a certified real property appraiser who is licensed in the State of Minnesota and holds a MAI membership designation from the Appraisal Institute, or equivalent certification. If the City disputes the appraisal, the City may, at the applicant’s expense, obtain an appraisal of the property by an appraiser that meets the requirements of this paragraph.  In that event, the fair market value of the land shall be determined by averaging the two appraisals. 

(5) 
Land Title. Prior to the dedication of the required property, the subdivider shall provide the City with an acceptable title opinion or title insurance policy addressed to the City that insures the title and the City's proposed interest in the property. In any dedication of land, the subdivider must transfer good and marketable title to the City, free and clear of any mortgages, liens, encumbrances or assessments, except easements or minor imperfections of title acceptable to the City. If this land is not formally dedicated to the City with the final plat, the subdivider shall record all deeds for conveyance of the property to the City at the same time as the final plat or other appropriate division documents are filed. 

(6) 
Land Acceptability. At the City's option, the following properties shall not be accepted for purposes of the owner's compliance with Section 26-50 (1) and (4): 

A. Land dedicated or obtained as easements for stormwater retention, drainage, roadway, and other utility purposes; 
B. Land that is unusable or of limited use; and 
C. Land that is protected wetlands or floodplain areas. 

(7) 
Cash Contributions. 

A. Cash contributions for single-family residential development will be due and payable at the time of final plat approval.  Cash contributions will be based on the number of new lots created. 
B. Cash contributions for multi-family residential, commercial and industrial development will be due and payable at the time of building permit issuance. For multi-family residential, commercial and industrial development, the applicant will execute a document in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney that acknowledges the obligation to pay these fees at the time building permits are secured. Such documents shall be in recordable form and any fee charged in connection with the filing thereof shall be paid by the applicant. Cash contributions for multi-family residential developments will be based on the number of units in the complex. Cash contributions for commercial and industrial development will be based on the area of the subdivision. 

(8) 
Park Fund. Any cash contribution received pursuant to this Article shall be placed in a separate fund and used only for park, playground, trail, or open space purposes. 

(9) 
Resubdivisions and Minor Subdivisions. In the case of subdivision of land that have previously been subdivided and for which land has been dedicated for parks or playgrounds, or cash payments in lieu of such dedication have been made, the Council shall make reasonable adjustments to recognize such previous dedication or payment.
