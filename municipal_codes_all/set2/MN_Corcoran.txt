or to support or advocate for non-city related business or purposes. All use of City
electronic communication resources is subject to management access pursuant to this
ordinance.
33-2
Incidental and occasional personal use of electronic communications resources is permitted
if it does not interfere with the use of equipment for City purposes and is not excessive, or
does not unduly interfere with an employee’s work time, job activities, or the job activities
of other employees. Such use and any messages or data created or accessed will be treated
no differently from other messages or data. If the City’s electronic communications
resources are used for personal use, the employee assumes personal responsibility for the
additional cost of any such personal use and will pay any cost incurred for such use (for
example: telephone long distance charges or cellular phone time charges). The City
reserves the right to reduce or eliminate any personal uses by an employee on a case-bycase
basis, or take disciplinary action as needed or required.

The use of electronic mail is not private. Messages sent via e-mail are subject to
monitoring, interception, and forwarding, which is beyond the control of the person

deleted, the message or the data that it contained may nevertheless continue to exist on the
computer system in which the e-mail system operates. Stored e-mail messages and other
computerized data are discoverable documents, which may be exchanged in litigation. The
content of e-mail messages may subject the sender to civil liability, discipline and criminal
sanctions.
Users should be aware that even though they may have a confidential password to access
e-mail, this does not suggest that the e-mail is the property right of the employee. The City
retains the right to and shall maintain the ability to, access any employee’s e-mail or other
electronic data on devices. An employee assigned a computer access account is responsible
for all usage of that resource. Users should not share their passwords with anyone other
than their supervisor and must take all reasonable precautions for password protection and
maintenance.
The contents of electronic data sent by, between, and/or to individuals covered by this
ordinance may be disclosed within or outside the City without the permission of the
individual at any time for any purpose deemed necessary by the City, subject to any
limitations imposed by law, including but not limited to, the Minnesota Government Data
Practices Act. Under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, the public has broad
access to government records. Government records include data that is in the possession
of the government “regardless of its physical form, storage media, or conditions of use.”
Electronic data, including e-mail messages, is treated as government records subject to data
practices requests.
Employees who resign, are terminated, laid off, suspended, or otherwise cease
(permanently or temporarily) their employment with the City of Corcoran have no right to
the contents of their e-mail messages and shall not be allowed access to the computer
system. Supervisors may access an employee’s e-mail if employees are on leave of
absence, vacation or otherwise absent, or at any other time that the supervisor deems
necessary for the City’s business purposes.
4. Security Measures -- The user must scan application executables (.exe) or data files from
all outside sources, including the Internet, with anti-virus software before first use.
Supervisors may review the usage of the City’s electronic communications resources and
the City’s access to the Internet or Online services by employees they supervise to
determine whether there have been any breaches of security, violations of City policy or
ordinances, or other violation of duty on the part of the employee. The City, at its discretion,
may also use computer programs that monitor the usage of the City’s electronic
communications resources and the City’s access to the Internet and other online services,
for purposes of assuring system security and compliance with City policies.

activity. Restrictions may be placed on use of the Internet or online services to protect the City

designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof will be
charged to the offending party.
d. In the event that the abatement or restoration work is performed by the City, the
City may charge the violator for its costs and expenses associated with the work. If
the bill received for abatement or restoration is not paid within 30 days, the City
may draw the amount of the bill from any financial guarantees that the City may
be holding or may certify the amount to the county for collection with the property
taxes.
PENALTY
Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
shall be subject to a maximum fine or maximum period of imprisonment, or both, as specified
by Minnesota Statutes Section 609.03. Each additional day that the property remains in violation
of this section shall constitute a separate violation of this section and may be prosecuted
accordingly. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation of this section, including, but not
limited to, seeking a civil injunction or a restraining order.

of facilities and equipment currently within its rights of way or to be placed therein at some future
time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this
chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the rights of way will bear financial responsibility for
their work. Finally, this chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from
persons using the public rights of way.

laws governing applicable rights of the city and users of the right of way. This chapter shall also
be interpreted consistent with Minnesota Rules 7819.0050–7819.9950 and Minnesota Rule,
Chapter 7560 where possible. To the extent any provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted
consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that interpretation most consistent with the Act and other
applicable statutory and case law is intended. This chapter shall not be interpreted to limit the
regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.

within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The
loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area unless
specifically authorized by the permit.
Subd. 4. Trenchless Excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits, permittees
employing trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited to Horizontal Directional
Drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in Minnesota Statute Chapter 216D and
Minnesota Rule, Chapter 7560 and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing
underground utilities before excavating, as determined by the director.
DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT
Subd. 1. Reasons for Denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements
and conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the denial is necessary to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the public or when necessary to protect the right of way and its
current use.
Subd. 2. Procedural Requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be made in
writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must notify the applicant or rightof-
way user in writing within three business days of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If
an application is denied, the right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by
52-15
the city and resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of receipt of
the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be imposed. The city must approve or
deny the resubmitted application within 30 days after submission.
INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work performed in the right
of way shall be done in conformance with Minnesota Rule 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other
applicable local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the Minnesota Statutes
237.162 and 237.163. Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with
Minnesota Rule, Chapter 7560 and these ordinances. Service lateral installation is further
subject to those requirements and conditions set forth by the city in the applicable permits
and/or agreements referenced in Section 52.24 Subd. 2 of this ordinance.
INSPECTION
Subd. 1. Notice of Completion. When the work under any permit hereunder is completed, the

others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution of and
upon completion of the work.
Subd 3. Authority of Director.
(a) At the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work
which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety, or well-being of the public.
(b) The director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does not conform to
the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order
shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit.
Within ten (10) days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the
director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to Sec. 52.23.
WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT
Subd. 1. Emergency Situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any
event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to
take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Excavators’ notification to
Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement.
Within two (2) business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply
for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in
response to the emergency.
If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s facilities, the city will
attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by
52-16
the emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to
the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
Subd. 2. Non-Emergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first
having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right of way must subsequently
obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the
other fees required by the city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any
damage to the right of way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION
If the obstruction or excavation of the right of way begins later or ends sooner than the date
given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of the accurate information as soon as this
information is known.
REVOCATION OF PERMITS
Subd. 1. Substantial Breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right
of way permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of
any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial
breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
(a) The violation of any material provision of the right of way permit.
(b) An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right of way permit, or the
perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens.
(c) Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right of way permit.
(d) The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit extension is
obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the
permittee’s control.
(e) The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition
indicated on an order issued pursuant to Sec. 52.20.
Subd. 2. Written Notice of Breach. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a
substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or any
condition of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such
violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to place
additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
Subd. 3. Response to Notice of Breach. Within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving notification
of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will cure
the breach. Permittee’s failure to so contact the city, or permittee’s failure to timely submit an
acceptable plan, or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause
for immediate revocation of the permit.
52-17
Subd. 4. Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse
the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with such revocation.
MAPPING DATA
Subd. 1. Information Required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping
information required by the city in accordance with Minnesota Rules 7819.4000 and
7819.4100. Within ninety (90) days following completion of any work pursuant to a permit,
the permittee shall provide the director accurate maps and drawings certifying the “as-built”
location of all equipment installed, owned, and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and
drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment
and shall be provided consistent with the city’s electronic mapping system, when practical
or as a condition imposed by the director. Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant
to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder’s registration.
Subd. 2. Service Laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service
laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rule 7560.0150, Subp. 2, shall
require the permittee’s use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of
installed service laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the
director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the
director evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral locations.
Compliance with this subdivision 2 and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and
Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after Dec. 31, 2005, shall be a
condition of any city approval necessary for:
a) payments to contractors working on a public improvement project, including
those under Minnesota Statute Chapter 429, and
b) city approval under development agreements or other subdivision or site plan
approval under Minnesota Statute Chapter 462. The director shall reasonably
determine the appropriate method of providing such information to the city.
Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed
may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or future permits to
the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES
Subd. 1. Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other
applicable law, and with Minnesota Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000, and 7819.5100, to the extent
the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
Subd. 2. Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities found in a right of
way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or
taking possession of the facilities and restoring the right of way to a useable condition.
Subd. 3. Limitation of Space. To protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, or when
52-18
necessary to protect the right of way and its current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit
or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right of way. In making such
decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential
users of the right of way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right of way, the time of
year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right of way, and
future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined
to be in the public interest.
PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION
In addition to complying with the requirements of Minnesota Statute 216D.01-.09 (“One Call
Excavation Notice System”) before the start date of any right of way excavation, each
registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal
and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities are less than twenty
(20) inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the
excavation contractor to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for
excavation.
DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES
When the city does work in the right of way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or
move a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the city shall notify the local representative as early
as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and
must be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be
responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right of way which it or its facilities
damage. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another registrant caused during the city’s response to an emergency occasioned by
that registrant’s facilities.
RIGHT OF WAY VACATION
Reservation of right. If the city vacates a right of way that contains the facilities of a
registrant, the registrant’s rights in the vacated right of way are governed by Minnesota Rule
7819.3200.
INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY
By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a registrant or
permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance with the provisions of
Minnesota Rule 7819.1250.
ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES
Subd. 1. Discontinued Operations. A registrant who has determined to discontinue all or a
portion of its operations in the city must provide information satisfactory to the city that the
52-19
registrant’s obligations for its facilities in the right of way under this chapter have been lawfully
assumed by another registrant.
Subd. 2. Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right of way shall remove
it from that right of way if required in conjunction with other right of way repair, excavation, or
construction, unless this requirement is waived by the city.
APPEAL
A right of way user that: (1) has been denied registration; (2) has been denied a permit; (3) has
had a permit revoked; (4) believes that the fees imposed are not in conformity with Minnesota
Statute 237.163, Subd. 6; or (5) disputes a determination of the director regarding Section 52.23,
Subd. 2 of this ordinance may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision reviewed,
upon written request, by the City Council. The City Council shall act on a timely written request
at its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the right of way user has submitted its appeal
with sufficient time to include the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the City
Council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by
written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
RESERVATION OF REGULATORY AND POLICE POWERS
A permittee’s rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce
general ordinances as necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.
SEVERABILITY
If any portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction,
such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. Nothing in this chapter precludes
the city from requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in addition to
requirements set forth herein.

CHAPTER 70: TRAFFIC RULES
STATE PROVISIONS ADOPTED.
The regulatory provisions of M.S. Chapters 169 and 171 Annotated, together with all amendments
thereto, are hereby adopted as a traffic code regulating use of highways, streets and alleys within
the city and are hereby incorporated and made a part of this section as completely as if set out
herein full.
The penalty for violations of the provisions of state statutes adopted by reference in this section
shall be identical with the penalties provided for in the statutes for the same offence.
WEIGHT RESTRICTIONS.
The City Council finds that it is in the public interest to regulate the weight of vehicles on city
roads and hereby adopts the following regulations:
a. Seasonal Weight Limits; Posting. The Public Works Department may prohibit the
operation of vehicles upon any street under the jurisdiction of the city or impose restrictions
as to the weight of vehicles to be operated upon any city street when, by reason of
deterioration, rain, snow, or climatic conditions, such city street may be damaged or
destroyed unless the use of vehicles thereon is prohibited or the permissible weight thereof
reduced. The Public Works Department shall cause to be posted on any such city street
appropriate signs designating such restrictions. The city will follow the State of Minnesota
Commissioner of Transportation dates of seasonal load limits. However, the City may
deem necessary to extend the date as recommended by the Public Works Department.
b. Administrative Regulation of Trucks. The Public Works Department shall monitor the
condition of all streets under the jurisdiction of the city and the use thereof by vehicles over
9,000 pounds gross weight, which vehicles are defined as trucks for purposes of this
section. Whenever the Department determines that the excessive use of any city street by
trucks has or is likely to endanger public health or safety or that such use has or may
damage or destroy the street due to any condition, including but not limited to, street
deterioration, rain, snow, climatic conditions, soil or subsurface conditions, or sight lines,
the Department may regulate, restrict, or prohibit truck traffic on the street. The
Department may set conditions or limitations on the use of the street to protect public health
and safety or to prevent damage to the street, including requiring that a letter of credit or
other financial guarantee be posted to compensate the city for damage to the street,
establishing haul routes and restricting hours of operation. Any person aggrieved by a
decision of the Public Works Department regarding regulation of truck traffic under this
section may appeal that decision to the City Council. The City Council may continue,
modify or terminate the regulations as it deems appropriate in order to protect public health
and safety and to prevent or minimize damage to the city streets.
70-2
c. Weight Limits; Seasonal Restrictions. Subdivision 1, Probation: Weight. It is unlawful
to operate any vehicle or a combination of vehicles upon any public street, alley or highway

CHAPTER 80: ABANDONED AND JUNK VEHICLES
DISPOSITION OF ABANDONED PROPERTY.
(A) Procedure. In accordance with Minn. Stat. §471.195, as may be amended from time to time,
all property, except for abandoned and junked vehicles, lawfully coming into possession of the city
shall be disposed of as provided in this section. Abandoned and junked vehicles shall be disposed of
according to the procedures of 80.10
(B) Storage. The department of the city acquiring possession of the property shall arrange for its
storage. If city facilities are unavailable or inadequate, the department may arrange for storage at a
privately owned facility.
(C) Claim by owner. The owner may claim the property by exhibiting satisfactory proof of
ownership and paying the city any storage or maintenance costs incurred by it. A receipt for the
property shall be obtained upon release to the owner.
(D) Sale. If the property remains unclaimed in the possession of the city for 60 days, the property
shall be sold to the highest bidder at a public auction conducted by the city or the city’s designee after
two weeks' published notice setting forth the time and place of the sale and the property to be sold.
(E) Disposition of proceeds. The proceeds of the sale shall be placed in the general fund of the
city. If the former owner makes application and furnishes satisfactory proof of ownership within six
months of the sale, the former owner shall be paid the proceeds of the sale of the property less the
costs of storage and the proportionate part of the cost of published notice and other costs of the sale.
FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

that such vehicles can harbor noxious materials; furnish shelter and breeding places for vermin, and
present physical dangers to the safety and well-being of children and other citizens. Abandoned motor
vehicles and other scrap metals also constitute blight on the landscape of the city and therefore a
detriment to the environment.

PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND INTENT.
The purpose of this ordinance is to provide regulations of general applicability for property
throughout the city in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community and its

substantial.
This ordinance intends to:
1. Provide public safety.
2. Reduce the likelihood of recidivism for predatory offenders.
3. Provide protection and security for crime victims.
4. Maintain neighborhood stability.
5. Safely reintegrate former offenders into the law-abiding community.

The intent of this ordinance is to provide residency opportunities within the city where predatory
offender residency can safely be established subject to the limitations of this code.

method for disposal of the material exists, or a pollution or nuisance condition
would result, or if a burn event safety plan cannot be drafted to the satisfaction of
the Fire Chief, Police Chief, Fire Marshal, Police Officer, Fire Warden or
Assistant Fire Marshals, these officers may deny the application for the open burn
permit.

SECTION 925 –PREMATURE SUBDIVISION PROHIBITED
925.010 - PREMATURE SUBDIVISION PROHIBITED.
Any proposed subdivision deemed premature for development shall not be approved by
the City Council. A subdivision shall be deemed premature if the Council determines that
any of the following conditions exist. The burden of proof shall be upon the subdivider to
show that the proposed subdivision is not premature.
Subd. 1. Inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan. A proposed subdivision may
be deemed premature if it is inconsistent with the purposes, objectives,
development staging plan, or recommendations of the City’s Comprehensive
Plan, as may be amended. Application for reguiding and/or rezoning may be
made simultaneously with an application for subdivision approval, however,
a subdivision application will not be considered for approval by the City
Council until and unless any necessary reguiding and/or rezoning application
is approved by the Council.
Subd. 2. Inconsistent with the Capital Improvements Program. A proposed
subdivision may be deemed premature if it is inconsistent with the capital
improvements program because public improvements, facilities, or services
necessary to accommodate the proposed subdivision would not be
completed within two years of the date of application.
Subd. 3. Lack of Adequate Water Supply. A proposed subdivision shall be deemed
to lack adequate water supply if the proposed subdivision does not have
adequate sources of water to serve the proposed subdivision if developed to
its maximum permissible density without causing an unreasonable
depreciation of existing water supplies for surrounding areas. Within the
urban service boundary, a proposed subdivision may be deemed premature
if public water is not available to serve the proposed subdivision.
Subd. 4. Lack of Adequate Waste Disposal Systems. A proposed subdivision shall
be deemed to lack adequate waste disposal if there is inadequate on-site
sewer capacity to support the subdivision if developed to its maximum
permissible density.
Within the urban service boundary, a proposed subdivision may be deemed
premature if:
A. Sanitary sewer is neither available nor proposed; or
Section 925 (Premature Subdivision) Page 13
September 13, 2018
B. Available or proposed sanitary sewer is inadequate to support the
subdivision if developed to its maximum permissible density after
reasonable sewer capacity is reserved for schools, public facilities, and
other developments planned within five years of the date of application.
Subd. 5. Lack of Adequate Streets to Serve the Subdivision. A proposed
subdivision may be deemed premature if:
A. Streets which serve the proposed subdivision are of such a width, grade,
stability, vertical and horizontal alignment, site distance or surface
condition that the traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision
would create a hazard to public safety and general welfare, or would
seriously aggravate an existing hazardous condition; or
B. The traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create
congestion or unsafe conditions on existing or proposed streets.
Subd. 6. Lack of Adequate Drainage. A proposed subdivision may be deemed
premature if:
A. Surface or subsurface water retention and runoff is such that it
constitutes a hazard to the stability of proposed or existing structures; or
B. The proposed subdivision would cause pollution of water sources or
would cause damage from erosion or siltation on downstream property;
or
C. Factors including, but not limited to, the presence of floodplain, poor soils
or subsoils, or steep slopes exist in such a manner as to preclude
adequate site drainage or treatment of runoff.
Subd. 7. Inconsistent with Environmental Requirements. A proposed subdivision
may be deemed premature if it is inconsistent with the rules and policies of
the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board, as may be amended, and could
adversely impact critical environmental areas, or potentially disrupt or
destroy, in violation of State historical preservation laws, historic areas
which are designated or officially recognized by the City Council.
Subd. 8. Burden of Proof. The burden shall be on the applicant to show that the
proposed subdivision or development has adequate public facilities and is
not premature.

affect the use, development density, lot size, or lot layout that was approved.
Subd. 8. Expiration of Lot Line Adjustment Approval. Unless the Zoning
Administrator specifically approves a different time period, the approval of a lot line
adjustment shall expire 2 years from the date it was approved, unless the applicant
has recorded the lot line adjustment with Hennepin County and provided proof of
the same to the City; or, unless before expiration of the 2-year period, the applicant
submits a written request for an extension thereof. Such request for an extension
shall include the following: 1) an explanation for why a minor subdivision has not

Section 940 (Open Space and Preservation Plats) Page 45
September 13, 2018
SECTION 940 – OPEN SPACE AND PRESERVATION (OS&P) PLATS
940.010 – PURPOSE OF DIVISION.
The purpose of Open Space and Preservation plats (OS&P) is to minimize acreage used in
developments that are approved prior to availability of urban services and to improve and
preserve wildlife habitat, quality of life and land values within the City through economic
incentives to preserve high quality woodlands, interconnected vegetated corridors,
agricultural land, open space, and other significant natural features as identified in the
Comprehensive Plan. OS&P plats provide owners within the rural residential zoning
district with added flexibility in designing plats as well as incentives to voluntarily protect,
preserve, enhance or restore natural resources on their property. OS&P Plats includes
three application types beyond the basic development type, based on the amount of
permanently preserved open space. Each application type includes some development
right bonus. In addition to encouraging natural resource preservation and restoration,
OS&P plats are intended as a means of facilitating an orderly and economically viable
transition to eventual development with urban services.
940.020 – OBJECTIVES OF DIVISION AND DEFINITIONS.
Subd. 1. The objectives of this division are to:
A. Preserve natural resources as identified in the Comprehensive Plan.
B. Preserve permanent natural habitat and vegetated corridors for the
shelter and movement of diverse wildlife.
C. Preserve viable tracts of land for long-term agricultural use.
D. Allow greater flexibility in the design of residential developments in
order to create a more esthetically pleasing visual impact than standard
development, particularly along arterial roadways and with respect to
abutting properties.
E. Create cohesive neighborhoods to establish local identity and increase
community interaction.
F. Reduce the costs of future public road and utility infrastructure through
designing to improve the efficiency of future connections and minimize
site restoration costs associated with future utility construction.
Section 940 (Open Space and Preservation Plats) Page 46
September 13, 2018
G. Provide economic incentives to land owners to preserve, protect and/or
restore high quality woodlots and other identified natural resources
areas.
H. Accomplish the objectives of the comprehensive plan in a voluntary
manner through the use of incentives.
940.030 APPLICATION TYPES.
Subd.1. Four application types are available, three of which are an OS&P
development with development right bonuses as indicated below:
A. Standard Plat: 100% of development rights.
B. OS&P with no permanent preservation or restoration: Lots clustered and
in acceptable lot sizes to accommodate private septic system and a
minimum of 25% of gross land area shall be preserved or restored and of
that 50% shall be upland area. = 150% of development rights.
C. OS&P with permanent preservation and or restoration: Lots clustered
and in acceptable lot sizes to accommodate private septic system and a
minimum of 25% of gross land area shall be preserved or restored and of
that 50% shall be upland area. = 200% of development rights.
D. OS&P with permanent preservation and or restoration and other
provisions as required in “C” with community well and septic under a
PUD = 300% of development rights
Subd 2. Lands within the Greenway corridor as identified on natural resource maps
in the Comprehensive Plan qualify for OS&P plats. Other areas have been
identified as target areas by the City within the MUSA and in rural residential
areas. These areas are indicated on overlay natural resource maps attached
to the Comprehensive Plan. A parcel outside one of these categories may
apply for permanent preservation or restoration and, if the proposed
permanent preservation or restoration is approved by the City, receive the
applicable development right bonus as approved by the City. Preservation
and restoration areas shall follow the City’s adopted Design Standards for
Preservation and Restoration lands.
Subd 3. Any Application type can develop in stages based on the approved plat.
Section 940 (Open Space and Preservation Plats) Page 47
September 13, 2018
Subd 4. A Planned Unit Development (PUD) will be required for any application type
that proposes a deviation from minimum lot size and/or the use of off-lot
septic or well or community septic or well.
940.040 – PROCEDURE.

940.050 – DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
Subd. 1. OS&P or restoration plats shall comply with the following minimum
standards:
A. Land area.
1. Minimum gross acreage is determined based on a wastewater
treatment plan. On-site treatment will require appropriate setbacks
and a primary and secondary wastewater treatment/disposal site.
2. Under an OS&P with no permanent preservation or restoration, land
not used in the development may be retained by the owner and any
successor in interest, subject to a covenant with the City that such
Section 940 (Open Space and Preservation Plats) Page 49
September 13, 2018
land may not be developed until such time as urban sewer service is
provided and at such time shall be subject to development standards
with urban densities. Continued agricultural use shall be permitted
until such time as sewer and water are available and orderly urban
development occurs.
3. Under an OS&P plat a minimum of 25% percent of the gross land area
(of no more than two pieces) of the development site shall be
dedicated as preserved open space (either temporary or permanent).
Permanent open space must be protected by a conservation easement
or deed restrictions in favor of the city. Of that amount, 50 percent
(net 12.5%) shall be upland area. Wetland restoration (including
abandonment of legally tiled areas) will be credited towards the
12.5% upland. One acre of restored wetland shall equal one acre of
upland.
B. Open space development standards. Open space to be permanently
preserved or restored within an OS&P plan shall meet the following
criteria:
1. Open spaces shall be protected by the placement of a conservation
easement, covenant or deed restriction in favor of the City over the
open space.
2. Open space shall be owned by an individual, a homeowners'
association, the City or other legal entity that will use the land for
open space purposes pursuant to a conservation easement or
covenant restricting additional development until urban services are
provided (only applies to open space in excess of required 25%). In
the case of private ownership of open space where public access is
desired, such as a trail crossing or other public purpose, the City shall
require that a public easement be provided over the open space area.
3. In the event that it is impossible to locate sufficient suitable building
sites to use the development rights generated by the property and
plat design, such rights may be transferred to an adjacent property,
within the city, so long as the development rights are used in a
development that also follows open space development standards and
does not exceed a 35% increase in development intensity compared
to the property without transferred-in development rights. A PUD will
be required for any OS&P desiring to transfer development rights.
Section 940 (Open Space and Preservation Plats) Page 50
September 13, 2018
4. A preservation, restoration and management plan agreeable to the
City shall be prepared and filed for open space land. This plan shall
include areas proposed for interim agricultural uses as well as
permanent easements.
a. The City Council may, at its discretion, require financial guarantees
of performance of restoration, seeding, cutting or planting.
b. Where land remains in the ownership of the developer or an
association, the City may inspect the property at any time to
ensure that provisions of the management plan are being
implemented.
c. The City shall adopt a model restoration and management plan
that may be adapted as appropriate to each situation.
C. Water and sewer systems.
1. Water may be provided by individual on-site wells, or by one or more
community wells in open space areas, meeting all State Department of
Health requirements.
2. Individual sewage treatment systems are required to be located on
each individual lot, except as otherwise approved by the City Council.

located on land with permanent preservation or restoration
easements or land dedicated to the City.
3. The City may approve a centralized wastewater treatment system and
smaller individual lots as part of a Planned Unit Development (PUD),
provided the applicant can show compliance with MPCA standards
and the City finds that the proposal would comply with PUD
standards, all City requirements and would have no adverse impact on
the environment or neighboring properties. The City will review the
following information as part of the plan review, but all permitting
shall be as required by the State of Minnesota. Centralized
wastewater treatment systems may be located in temporarily
restricted open space within an easement. This area shall not be
included in the land area designated as preserved or restored open
space. A sewage treatment system management plan must be
submitted to the city that must be reviewed and approved prior to
Section 940 (Open Space and Preservation Plats) Page 51
September 13, 2018
being recorded with the final plat. The plan shall clearly identify the
following:

viii. Provision for cost effective future connection of the
wastewater treatment system(s) to urban services within one
year after such services are provided at the boundary of the
development, with sufficient financial guarantees to ensure no
added cost to the City.
ix. If financial guarantees for any of the above provisions are part
of an association assessment or treasury fund, the City shall be
given access to annual audit records, at the expense of the
association, to ensure proper funding. If such guarantees are
the private responsibility of the developer, the City shall
require guarantees from the responsible individual(s).
D. Dimensional regulations and Development standards. The dimensional
regulations for open space preservation plats must comply with
standards of the underlying zoning district, but may vary from the

street or trail. Connect individual home sites with pedestrian
corridors or sidewalks to larger open spaces and places of destination
on-site and off-site. Open spaces should be accessible to pedestrians
at roughly 1,200-foot intervals along public roadways. Pedestrian
corridors between lots shall be at least 50 feet in width and buffered
from view of adjacent properties.
5. Locate lots to preserve woodlands, farmland or other natural features
or character, including places of historic, archeological or cultural
value. Preserve natural resources as identified in the Comprehensive
Plan to the maximum extent possible in a contiguous, connected
configuration. Natural open spaces may include, but are not limited
to, fields, wetlands, slopes, bluffs, woods, lakes, ponds, streams, shore

940.070 – CALCULATION OF BASE DENSITY; DENSITY BONUSES.
Subd. 1. To calculate the allowed density for a given parcel for open space
preservation plat purposes, the following shall apply:
Section 940 (Open Space and Preservation Plats) Page 57
September 13, 2018
A. OS&P Plats (all application types) must provide paved access within the
site and must require all owners and their successors to covenant that
they will participate at 100% of the per unit cost of future assessments
for paving to City standards the principal roads servicing the site, if those
roads are not currently paved.
B. Development rights shall be as recorded on the official City of Corcoran
“Development Rights Map” and as described in Section 1040.030, Subd. 7
(Density Requirements) of the Zoning Ordinance.
C. Multiply the number of development rights on the parcel by the percent
based on the application type to determine the maximum number of lots.
Percentages are as follows:
1. Standard Plat: = 100% of development rights (1 in 10 or 1 in 30)
2. OS&P design with no permanent preservation or restoration = 150%
3. OS&P with permanent preservation and or restoration = 200%
4. OS&P with community well and septic (subject to PUD) = 300%
.
Example 1:
Gross land area consisting of approximately 46 acres in a 1 in 10
density district.
Standard Plat: 46 x 1 (100% of development rights) = 4.6
development rights which is rounded up to 5.
OS&P with no permanent dedication = (46/10) x 1.5 (150% of
development rights) = 6.9 development rights which is rounded up
to 7.
OS&P with permanent dedication= (46/10) x 2.0 (200% of
development rights) = 9.2 development rights, which rounds down
to 9.
OS&P with permanent dedication and community well and septic =
(46/10) x 3.0 (300% of development rights) = 13.8 development
rights, which rounds up to 14.
Maximum density = 46/14 = 1 in 3.29
Section 940 (Open Space and Preservation Plats) Page 58
September 13, 2018
Example 2:
Gross land area consisting of approximately 60 acres in a 1 in 10
density district.
Standard Plat: 6 x 1 (100% of development rights) = 6 development
rights
OS&P with no permanent dedication = (60/10) x 1.5 (150% of
development rights) = 9 development rights.
OS&P with permanent dedication = (60/10) x 2.0 (200% of
development rights) = 12 development rights.
OS&P with permanent dedication and community well and septic =
(60/10) x 3.0 (300% of development rights) = 18 development
rights.
Maximum density = 60/18 = 1 in 3.33

Section 945 (Design Standards) Page 59
September 13, 2018
SECTION 945 – DESIGN STANDARDS
945.010 - GENERAL STANDARDS.
Subd. 1. Contiguous Land. A preliminary plat shall include all of the owner’s
contiguous land, unless subdivision of property contiguous to the subdivision
would be premature as defined by this Chapter. If subdivision of the
contiguous property owned by the applicant would be premature, the
applicant shall submit a sketch plan with enough detail to demonstrate how
that property can be subdivided in the future in a manner consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan and this Chapter. Final platting may be accomplished in
phases.
Subd. 2. Subdivisions Straddling Municipal Boundaries. Whenever access to the
subdivision is required across land in another city, the City shall request
assurance from the affected city that access is legally established and that the
access road is adequately improved or that a guarantee has been duly
executed and is sufficient in amount to assure the construction of the access
road. In general, lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross municipal
boundary lines.
Subd. 3. Monuments.
A. Official permanent monuments shall be placed as required by Minnesota
Statutes, Section 505.02 (as may be amended).
B. All monument markers shall be correctly in place upon final grading and
installation of utilities.
C. The City will not issue building permits for a lot within a plat until
monuments have been placed for that lot.
D. All United States, state, county or other official benchmarks, monuments
or triangulation stations in or adjacent to the property shall be preserved
in precise position.
Subd. 4. Subdivision Names. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other
subdivision in the City. The City shall have final authority to designate the
name of the subdivision.
Section 945 (Design Standards) Page 60
September 13, 2018
Subd. 5. Engineering Design Standards. Public and private improvements shall
comply with standards set forth in the City’s Engineering Design Standards,
which are herein adopted by reference.
945.020 - LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
Subd. 1. Lot Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no
foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance. In addition, all lots shall abut and have direct access to an
improved street or private drive except for developments with unit lots, in
which case the base lot shall abut and have direct access to an improved
street.
Subd. 2. Minimum Lot Dimensions. All lot dimensions shall comply with the
minimum standards of the Zoning Ordinance. Depth and width of properties
reserved or laid out for commercial, office or industrial purposes shall be
adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required
for the type of use contemplated, as established in the Zoning Ordinance,
except as may be modified within a duly approved planned unit development
(PUD).
Subd. 3. Side Lot Lines. Side lines of lots shall be substantially at right angles to
street lines and substantially radial to curved street lines, unless an
alternative layout will result in a better street or lot plan.
Subd. 4. Corner Lots. Corner lots shall be of sufficient width and depth to comply
with the minimum building setback requirement from both streets and to
comply with the minimum driveway setback from the intersection, as
established in the Zoning Ordinance.
Subd. 5. Through or Double Frontage Lots and Access to Lots.
A. Through or Double Frontage Lots. Through or double frontage lots shall
not be permitted except where lots back on an arterial roadway or where
specific disadvantages of topography or other conditions render
subdividing otherwise unreasonable.
B. Access from Minor Arterials and Minor Collectors. Lots shall not, in
general, derive access exclusively from a minor arterial or major collector
roadway. No lot parallel to a minor arterial or major collector roadway
and having a width of less than 200 feet should front on these roadways
Section 945 (Design Standards) Page 61
September 13, 2018
unless 1) access is limited to streets other than a minor arterial or major
collector, 2) access is provided jointly with other lots or 3) access is
ultimately to be provided from a planned frontage road. Where possible,
driveways shall be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring
vehicles to back into traffic on minor arterial or major collector roadways.
Subd. 6. Lots Abutting Water. Lots abutting a water body, wetland, drainage way,
channel, stream or pond shall be of sufficient width and depth and at the
elevation needed to assure that building sites are not subject to flooding. The
platting of lots within the floodplain is subject to the Zoning Ordinance
provisions relating thereto.
Subd. 7. Large Tracts. When a parcel of land is subdivided into larger tracts than for
building lots, such tracts shall be divided so as to allow for the opening of
major streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets and utilities.
Subd. 8. Lot Remnants. All remnants of land which are below the minimum lot size
or which are otherwise unbuildable must be added to adjacent lots and shall
not be platted as an unusable outlot or parcel.
Subd. 9. Soil Preservation, Grading and Sodding/Seeding.
A. Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated
with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Where possible,
drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm water
drainage from each lot to adjacent lots.
B. Sodding/Seeding. Sodding and seeding shall be done in conformance
with the Zoning Ordinance and Engineering Design Standards.
Subd. 10. Debris and Waste. No cut trees, diseased trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks,
stones, soil, junk, rubbish, former building foundations, abandoned wells,
abandoned septic systems or other waste materials of any kind shall be
buried in any land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and removal of those items and
materials shall be required prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy
in a subdivision. No items and materials as described in the preceding
sentence shall be left or deposited in any area of the subdivision at the time
of expiration of the Development Contract or dedication of public
improvements, whichever occurs sooner.
Section 945 (Design Standards) Page 62
September 13, 2018
Subd. 11. Waterbodies and Watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains a
water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the
entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The City
may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and
responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will
not become a City responsibility.
Subd. 12. Access.
A. Block length and width or acreage within bounding streets shall be
sufficient to accommodate the size of lots required by the Zoning
Ordinance and to provide for convenient access, circulation control and
safety of street traffic.
1. In the municipal urban service boundary, block lengths shall not
exceed 900 feet nor be less than 500 feet, measured from the
centerlines of streets, except where topography or other conditions
justify a departure from that standard.
2. In the rural areas, block lengths shall not exceed 1,320 feet nor be less
than 400 feet, except where topography or other conditions justify a
departure from that standard. In blocks longer than 800 feet,
pedestrian walkways and/or easements at least 10 feet wide may be
required near the center of the block.
B. Vehicle access shall be prohibited from a stub street to adjoining lots until
such time as the stub street is extended into an adjoining tract, or unless a
temporary cul-de-sac is provided.
C. When a proposed plat contains or borders on the right-of-way of an
existing or planned principal or minor arterial roadway, the City Council
may require dedication and installation of a street approximately parallel
to and on each side of such right-of-way for adequate protection of
properties and to afford a separation of local and through traffic. Such
streets shall be located at a distance from the major roadway suitable for
the appropriate use of any intervening land. Such distance shall also be
determined with due regard for the requirements of approach
connections, future grade separations, and lot depths.
D. The subdivider shall provide access to all lots via local streets or private
drives. When a proposed plat contains or borders on the right-of-way of
a principal arterial, vehicle access points shall be restricted in accordance
with the City’s Comprehensive Plan and the access requirements of the
Section 945 (Design Standards) Page 63
September 13, 2018
Minnesota Department of Transportation and Hennepin County. When a
proposed plat contains or borders on the right-of-way of a minor arterial
or major collector roadway, vehicle access points shall be restricted from
such roadways. If access onto a minor arterial or major collector is the
only option for access and is therefore required, such vehicle access
points shall be limited from individual lots onto such streets through the
use of shared driveways, consistent with the access management
provisions of the City’s Comprehensive Plan.
E. Access to minor arterial and major collector streets shall be at intervals of
not less than ¼ mile, and through existing and established crossroads
where possible. In the platting of small tracts of land fronting on minor
arterial streets where there is no other alternative, a temporary access
permit may be granted. As neighboring land becomes subdivided and
access to other streets becomes possible, such temporary access permit
shall become void.
F. When a residential lot has frontage on multiple streets, access to such lot
shall be prohibited from higher-order streets (e.g., a lot that fronts on a
minor arterial street and a collector street shall be prohibited from
having access on the minor arterial street, and a lot that fronts on a
collector street and a local street shall be prohibited from having access
on the collector street).
Subd. 13. Street Names. Street names shall be designated by the City street naming
system, as administered by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning
Administrator shall have discretion to alter the City street naming system,
when appropriate, in order to avoid confusion to the traveling public. A
petition to rename a street shall require action by the City Council.
Subd. 14. Street Regulatory Signs. Street signs of standard design approved by the
City shall be installed at each street intersection or at such other locations
within the subdivision as designated by the City Engineer.
Subd. 15. Traffic Control Signs. Traffic control signs pursuant to Minnesota Statutes,
Section 169.06, shall be installed at locations within the subdivision as
designated by the City Engineer.
Subd. 16. Turn Lanes and Traffic Lights. Turn lanes and traffic lights shall be
installed at the expense of the subdivider when required as a result of the
proposed subdivision. The cost of the improvements shall be apportioned
among benefiting properties as determined by the City.
Section 945 (Design Standards) Page 64
September 13, 2018
Subd. 17. Street Lights. Street lights shall be installed at all intersections and at other
locations, as required by the City Engineer. All street lights within new
subdivisions in the urban area shall be on ornamental poles with
underground electrical service, and shall conform to City lighting standards.
Subd. 18. Sidewalks and Trails. Required sidewalks and trails shall be installed at the
time a street is constructed.
Subd. 19. Dead-End Streets, Stub Streets and Cul-de-Sac Streets (permanent and
temporary).
A. Dead-End Streets. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stub
streets.
B. Stub Streets. Stub streets shall be installed to permit future street
extensions into adjoining tracts, where appropriate. Barricades shall be
installed at the end of stub streets and signage shall be provided
indicating a future street connection
C. Cul-de-Sac Streets (permanent). Cul-de-sac streets may be installed
where necessary due to topography, configuration of land, existing road
layouts or other special circumstances.
D. Cul-de-Sac Streets (temporary). In those instances where a street is
terminated pending future extension in conjunction with future platting
and its terminus is located 1,320 feet or more from the nearest
intersection in rural areas or 900 feet in urban areas, a temporary cul-desac
with a pavement width of 90 feet in diameter shall be provided at the
closed end. Any portion of a temporary cul-de-sac not located within the
street right-of-way shall be placed in a temporary roadway easement
extending beyond the curb line of the temporary cul-de-sac in all
directions. No building permit shall be issued for any properties
containing such temporary easement until after the temporary cul-de-sac
is constructed. A financial guarantee will be required for removal and
restoration, as required by the Development Contract for the subdivision.
Subd. 20. Alleys and Private Drives. Alleys and private drives may be permitted by
the City Council, and are subject to the following standards:
A. Private Drives in the Rural Residential District. In conjunction with the
review of plats in the Rural Residential District Zoning District, the City
Council may approve private drives provided that all of the following
conditions are met:
Section 945 (Design Standards) Page 65
September 13, 2018
1. The council finds that a public street connection is not required for
the public street network.
2. Design Standards.
a. A private drive shall not exceed 2,640 feet in length unless it forms
a continuous connection or loops back to a public street. Any such
private drive with a terminus 1,320 feet or more from the nearest
intersection will be required to provide a cul-de-sac at the closed
end according to City Engineering Standards.
b. The subdivider shall provide access to lots via public streets.
Private drives are subject to the access standards of 945.020,
Subd.12, D and 945.020 Subd. 12, F.
c. Roadway standards must comply with Section 945.010, Subd. 5
(Engineering Design Standards). Private drives shall conform to
the City of Corcoran Standard Detail Plates for shared driveways,
as may be amended. The City Engineer may require additional site
information and may require additional design standards that
enhance safety.
d. Individual unit driveways that gain access from any such private
drive shall be a minimum of 22 feet in length.
e. A decorative sign stating “Private Drive” shall be located near each
entrance to a private drive. Such sign shall also provide the range
of addresses served by the private drive.
f. If the private drive accesses directly onto a paved public street, the
private drive must include a paved apron of 75 feet The apron
shall be measured from the edge of the existing pavement along
the centerline of the private drive.
(Ord. 317, passed 05-26-16)
3. Lot Standards.
a. Areas devoted to private roads shall not be included in parcel size
calculations.
b. The private drive may not be placed in an outlot, and must be
included with the parcel.
Section 945 (Design Standards) Page 66
September 13, 2018
c. Lot width shall be measured at the lot line. For purpose of
complying with the minimum lot width requirements, the front of
the lot shall be the lot line adjacent to the private drive.
d. Access for each lot in the subdivision shall be from the private
drive. No direct access to public streets shall be allowed for lots
within the subdivision.
4. Easement and Maintenance Agreement. An access easement and
maintenance agreement shall be established for all private drives,
subject to review and approval of the City Attorney and shall be
recorded at Hennepin County prior to issuing building permits.
5. Homeowners Association Agreement. A homeowners association
agreement shall be established to ensure that any such private drive
remains “private” in perpetuity, subject to review and approval of the
City Attorney, and shall be filed with the plat at Hennepin County.
Such instrument shall require mandatory participation of all
homeowners that have access via the private drive, shall include the
requirement for creation of a fund to address maintenance, drainage
and snow removal on the private drive, subject to City review and
approval.
Subd. 21. Design Standards, Streets.
A. General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width and
general improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford
satisfactory access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation and
road maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a
convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties,
the following design standards for streets are hereby required.
B. Street Surfacing and Improvements. After the subdivider has installed
sewer and water, the subdivider shall construct poured-in-place concrete
curbs and gutters and shall surface streets to the width prescribed in this
Chapter. Types of pavement shall be as prescribed in the City’s
Engineering Design Standards. Adequate provision shall be made for
culverts, drains and bridges. The portion of the right-of-way outside the
area surfaced shall be sodded. All road pavement, shoulders, drainage
improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall
conform to all construction standards and specifications in the City’s
Engineering Design Standards and shall be incorporated into the
Section 945 (Design Standards) Page 67
September 13, 2018
construction plans required to be submitted by the subdivider for final
plat approval.
C. Right-of-Way Width.
1. Minimum right-of-way width for minor arterial and collector streets
shall be as follows:
Street Type Right-of-Way Width
Principal Arterial 100 feet
A Minor Reliever 80 feet
A Minor Expander 60 feet
2. The right-of-way width for local streets shall be determined by the
City Engineer and shall be adequate to accommodate pavement width
and other improvements required within the right-of-way.
3. In order to ensure safety and accommodate existing and future street
intersections, bridge overpasses, railway crossings, interchanges,
topography and the like, the City may require dedication of a greater
right-of-way width than specified above.
4. A subdivider may be required to install landscaped medians for
certain minor arterial and collector roadways platted within the
subdivision, in accordance with roadway standards established by the
City Engineer and the Design Guidelines located in Appendix A of the
Zoning Ordinance.
D. Principal Arterials. Lots abutting principal arterials shall have sufficient
lot depth required to accommodate any additional structure setbacks
provided by the Zoning Ordinance.
E. Pavement Width shall be as identified in the City Engineering Design
Standards.
F. Cul-de-Sac Street Turnarounds. Residential cul-de-sacs may include a
center island within the turn-around for snow storage. Maintenance of
such center islands shall become the responsibility of a Homeowners
Association for the subdivision. The pavement width between the
outside curb of the turn-around and such island shall be a minimum of 28
feet wide.

September 13, 2018
G. Street Grades. The minimum grade for all streets shall be ½ percent.
Grades within 30 feet of intersections with arterial and collector streets
and grades for the turnaround portion of a cul-de-sac street shall not
exceed 3 percent. Otherwise, the maximum grades shall be as follows:
Street Type Maximum Grade
Minor Arterial 4%
Collector 6%
Local 8%
H. Intersections.
1. Streets shall be laid out to intersect at right (90 degree) angles with a
50-foot minimum tangent from the radius return. The angle of an
intersection may be varied in cases where topography or other factors
justify a variation, but in no case shall a street intersect with another
street at angle of less than 75 degrees. Intersections having more
than 4 corners shall be prohibited.
2. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall,
wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs shall have a centerline offset
of at least 150 feet.
3. Minimum curb radius at the intersection of 2 local streets shall be at
least 10 feet.
I. Street Alignment.
1. Reverse Curves (horizontal alignment). Collector and Arterial streets
shall comply with Minnesota State Aid Standards.

September 13, 2018
B. Streets in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid
new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a
new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and
dedicated by the subdivider. The City Council may authorize a new
perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire
required street right-of-way width within the subdivision boundaries.
C. Where a subdivision borders an existing substandard street or street
needing improvement, the subdivider shall be required to improve and
dedicate at its expense those areas for widening or improvement. Such
streets shall be improved and dedicated as required by this Subdivision
Ordinance. The cost of the improvements shall be apportioned among
benefiting properties as determined by the City.

storm water drainage system shall be separate and independent of the
sanitary sewer system.
B. Water quality basins shall be designed in accordance with the City’s
Engineering Design Standards.
Subd. 2. Dedication of Drainage Easements.
A. General Requirements. Where a watercourse, drainage way, channel or
stream traverses a subdivision, the subdivider shall provide a storm
water easement, drainage right-of-way or park dedication, whichever the
City may deem more appropriate. This easement, right-of-way or
dedication shall conform substantially with the lines of such water
courses, together with such further width or construction, or both, as will
be adequate for the storm water drainage of the area. The City Engineer
shall determine the width of such easements, etc.
B. Drainage Easements.
1. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-ofway,
the subdivider shall provide perpetual, unobstructed easements
at least 20 feet in width for drainage facilities across property outside
the road lines and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements
shall be indicated on the plat. Drainage easements shall extend from
the road to a natural watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
2. When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be
secured and indicated on the plat.
3. The subdivider shall dedicate by a drainage easement, land on each
side of the centerline of any wetland, body of water, watercourse or
drainage channel, whether or not shown on the City’s Comprehensive
Plan, to a sufficient width to 1) provide proper protection for water
quality, 2) provide retention of storm water runoff and 3) provide for
the installation and maintenance of storm sewers.
945.050 - SEWER AND WATER FACILITIES.
Subd. 1. General Requirements.
Section 945 (Design Standards) Page 71
September 13, 2018
A. The subdivider shall install adequate sewer and water facilities subject to
the specifications in the City’s Engineering Design Standards.
B. Within the municipal urban service boundary, the subdivider shall install
sewer and water mains and service connections, which are stubbed to the
property line, to serve all lots in the subdivision. The City Council, in its
discretion, may waive this requirement upon a showing that to require
the installation of sewer and/or water mains within the subdivision
would not be feasible with regard to the extension of existing trunk mains
to service the subdivision or that particular locations or unusual
circumstances of the proposed plat would cause undue hardship to either
the owner or subdivider or the City.
C. Within the municipal urban service boundary, the subdivider shall extend
sewer and water lines to the lot lines of abutting sites within the urban
service area that do not have public water service.
D. In the rural areas, well and septic systems shall be installed in accordance
with City and State requirements.
945.060 - OTHER UTILITIES.
Subd. 1. Location. All utility facilities, including but not limited to telephone, CATV,
natural gas and electric power, shall be located underground. Whenever
existing utility facilities are located above ground, except when existing on
public roads and right-of-way, they shall be removed and placed
underground. Underground service connections to the street property line
of each platted lot shall be installed at the subdivider’s expense. At the
discretion of the City, the requirement for service connections to each lot
may be waived in the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership
and intended to be developed for the same primary use.
Subd. 2. Easements. Utility easements shall be required within the perimeter of each
lot, measured from the lot lines. Such easements shall be at least 10 feet
wide. Such easements shall have continuity for alignment from block to
block. Such easements shall also be provided at deflection points for poleline
anchors where necessary.
Subd. 3. Dedication. Easements shall be dedicated on the plat instrument for the
required use.

SECTION 950 – EROSION CONTROL
950.010 - EROSION CONTROL PLAN.
Prior to commencing any earth disturbing activity in a subdivision, the subdivider shall
submit an erosion control plan for approval by the City Engineer. The plan shall be
approved if it complies with the City’s Zoning Ordinance and Erosion Control Ordinance
and the requirements contained herein.
950.020 - EROSION CONTROL MEASURES.
Subd. 1. All development must comply with the City Erosion Control Ordinance. The
following erosion control measures are required for an erosion control plan:
A. The developer must provide the City Engineer with both a temporary and
permanent erosion control plan which shall be suited to the topography
and soils so as to create the least erosion potential. Acceptable
temporary and permanent erosion control plans shall include, but not be
limited to, the following elements:
1. A site map with existing and final grades. These grades shall include
dividing lines and direction of flow for all pre and post construction
storm water runoff drainage areas located within the project limits.
The site map must also include impervious surfaces and soil types.
2. Locations of all critical areas, and areas delineated for nondisturbance.
3. Locations of areas where construction will be phased to minimize
duration of exposed soil areas.
4. Locations and types of all temporary and permanent erosion and
sediment control Best Management Practices (BMPs). Standard plates
and/or specification for the BMPs used on the project must be
included in the final plans and specifications for the project.
5. Locations and type of sediment control treatment for all stockpiles
located on the project.
6. Plans and specifications for temporary seeding and mulching any
exposed soils during construction.
Section 950 (Erosion Control) Page 74
September 13, 2018
7. Plans and specifications for final vegetation establishment, including
where appropriate utilizing a long term vegetation management plan
for controlling noxious weeds.
8. All plans shall include maintenance requirements and who will be
responsible for such maintenance requirements.
B. The land shall be developed in increments of workable size on which
adequate controls of erosion and siltation can be provided and
maintained during the construction period. Grading operations and other
land disturbing operations shall be staged so that the area being
developed is not exposed for long periods of time without stabilization.
Developments are encouraged to plan and implement appropriate
construction phasing, vegetative buffer strips, horizontal slope grading,
and other construction land management practices that minimize
erosion.
C. Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect the areas
exposed during the development. These areas shall be seeded, mulched
and stabilized with erosion control netting or blanket acceptable to the
City Engineer.
D. Soil shall be exposed for the shortest feasible period of time. Unless the
areas are discharging to a special water, or 303 (d) listed water, the
following restraints for soil exposure shall apply.
Type of Slope Time of Exposure without being actively
worked
Steeper than
3:1
7 days
10:1 to 3:1 14 days
Flatter than
10:1
21 days
E. Where the topsoil is removed, sufficient topsoil shall be set aside for
respreading over the developed area. Topsoil shall be restored or
provided to a depth of 4-inches or to a depth directed by the City
Engineer and shall be of a quality at least equal to the soil quality prior to
development.
F. Natural vegetation shall be protected whenever practical. All areas of
natural vegetation that are to be protected shall be identified prior to any
construction activity commencing.
Section 950 (Erosion Control) Page 75
September 13, 2018
G. Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps) shall be
installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from
the land undergoing development. Storm sewer inlets shall be provided
with debris guards and microsilt basins to trap sediment and avoid
possible damage from blockage. The silt shall be removed when
necessary. If sediment/siltation measures taken are not adequate and
result in downstream sediment, the subdivider shall be responsible for
cleaning out or dredging downstream storm sewers and ponds as
necessary. During construction activity, all curb and gutter openings,
manholes, and catch basins shall be temporarily protected with some
type of inlet protection as approved by the City Engineer.
H. Before grading is commenced, all control measures as shown on the
approved plan shall be installed. Also, any areas not to be disturbed must
be delineated (e.g. with flags, stakes, signs, silt fences, etc.) on the
development site before the work begins.
I. Before grading is commenced, a schedule such as the below listed
example shall be provided to the City Engineer.
Activity Date
Install perimeter protection devices
Install vegetation and non-disturbance
protection
Install erosion control practices
Start Clearing and Grubbing
Start grading
Installation of Temporary Stabilization
Practices
Installation of Permanent Stabilization
Practices
J. Erosion control practices shall comply with the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency's Best Management Practices and all applicable NPDES
Phase II construction site permit requirements.
K. The subdivider shall be responsible for cleaning all streets in the
subdivision and adjacent to the subdivision from silt and dirt from the
subdivision. Vehicle tracking of sediment form the construction site must
be minimized by appropriate BMPs, and street sweeping must be used if
the BMPs are not adequate to prevent sediment from being tracked onto
the street.
Section 950 (Erosion Control) Page 76
September 13, 2018
L. Maintenance standards and requirements shall include, but not be limited
to, the following:
1. Inspection for effectiveness of all erosion and sediment control BMPs
will occur on a schedule determined by the City Engineer. This
inspection could occur as frequent as weekly or after each ¼” rain
event, if determined to be appropriate by the City Engineer.
2. Accumulated sediment will be removed from all sediment control
devices after they reach one-third their capacity.
3. All sediment that moves off site due to construction activities shall be
removed at the end of each workday.
4. All sediment that moves off site due to storm events will be cleaned
up as soon as possible, but at least by the end of the next day.
5. Temporary gravel access drives will be maintained throughout
construction in working condition.
6. All erosion control practices will be maintained until the disturbed
areas they protect are permanently stabilized and established. Upon
permanent stabilization establishment, the temporary practices shall
be removed.
Subd. 2. Financial Guarantee:
A. A financial guarantee to provide a financial guarantee in accordance with
Section 960 of the City Code in an amount determined adequate by the
City to guarantee compliance with erosion control measures shall be
furnished before work is commenced. The financial guarantee shall
remain in place until all the subdivider's obligations under the erosion
control plan have been satisfied.
B. If the City draws upon the financial guarantee, the subdivider shall within
10 days of the draw, deposit with the City additional security of the same
type and amount that the City has drawn. No further inspections will be
conducted, no new building permits will be issued, and all work shall stop
within the development until the cash deposit for erosion control is
restored to the pre-draw balance.
Section 950 (Erosion Control) Page 77
September 13, 2018
Subd. 3. Street Cleaning. Prior to commencement of grading, the subdivider shall
enter into a contract with an unrelated third party to scrape and sweep the
streets in the subdivision and on abutting streets from soil and silt deposited
on the streets. At a minimum, scraping and sweeping shall take place on a
weekly basis. The City shall be furnished a copy of the contract. The contract
shall provide that the contract cannot be canceled without at least 30 days
advance written notice to the City. The contract shall further provide that
the City may order cleaning of the streets and that the subdivider shall pay
the cost. If the subdivider fails to do so, the City may draw on the
subdivider's financial guarantee with the City and use it to provide payment
for the cleaning.
Subd. 4. Enforcement.
A. The City may issue a stop work order halting all development work and
building construction for noncompliance with the erosion control plan.
B. The City will conduct site inspections for compliance with appropriate
erosion control measures, and any related issues regarding noncompliance
will be addressed as appropriate.
C. The City may draw down the posted financial guarantee and perform any
work necessary to achieve compliance with the erosion control plan. The
City will endeavor to give the subdivider advance notice of such action.
The issuing authority may act against the appropriate security if there
exists any of the conditions below. The issuing authority shall use funds
from the appropriate security to finance remedial work undertaken by
the City or a private contractor under contract to the City, and to
reimburse the City for all direct costs incurred in the process of remedial
work including, but no limited to, staff time, attorneys, and inspection
fees. Reasons for drawing down the posted financial guarantee may be,
but are not limited to, the following:
1. The permittee ceases land disturbing activities and/or filling and
abandons the work site prior to the completion of the grading plan.
2. The permittee fails to conform to the temporary or permanent
erosion control plan as approved or as modified and has his/her
permit revoked.
3. The techniques utilized under the temporary or permanent erosion
control plan fail within one year of installation, or before a final plan is
implemented for the site or portions of the site, whichever is later.
Section 950 (Erosion Control) Page 78
September 13, 2018
4. The issuing authority determines that action by the City is necessary to
prevent excessive erosion from occurring on the site.

Section 955 (Park Dedication) Page 80
September 13, 2018
SECTION 955 – PARK DEDICATION
955.010 - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND STATEMENT OF
PURPOSE
Subd. 1. Statutory Authorization. Minnesota Statutes Section 462.358.Subd.2b
provides that municipal subdivision regulations may require that a reasonable portion of
any proposed subdivision be dedicated to the public or preserved for conservation
purposes or for public use as parks, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space, and that
the municipality may alternatively accept an equivalent amount in cash based upon the
undeveloped land value.
Subd. 2. Findings of Fact. The City Council finds that:
A. The preservation and development of parks, playgrounds, trails and open
space areas within the City are essential to maintaining a healthy and
desirable environment for residents and persons employed within the
City. The presence of parks, trails and open space amenities also
enhances the value and attractiveness of residential and
commercial/industrial developments to landowners, developers,
purchasers, employers, and employees. The City must not only provide
for its present citizens, but it must also provide for the future.
B. New developments place a burden upon the City’s parks and open space
system. New facilities must be developed concurrently with development
in order to provide the desired level of service and the quality of the
environment for all. Therefore, new developments shall be required to
contribute toward the City’s park system in rough proportion to the
relative burden they will place upon the park system.
C. The City Council recognizes that the need for such parks, trails, and public
open spaces is directly related to the density and intensity of population
and development permitted and allowed in the City. Urban development
results in increased population, increased intensity of use and greater
demands for such public areas and facilities.
D. Residential development of land will create approximately ninety-five
(95) percent of the need for park and recreational land and facilities
within the City.
E. Commercial/industrial development of land will create approximately
five (5) percent of the need for park and recreational land and facilities
within the City.
Section 955 (Park Dedication) Page 81
September 13, 2018
F. Development of land for schools, religious institutions or other non-profit
organizations may create additional demand on the City’s park and
recreational land and facilities. The City may create partnerships with
these organizations that foster cooperative use of school, non-profit and
park properties for recreational activities.
955.020 - REQUIRED DEDICATION
Subd. 1. Dedication of Land or Cash
A. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes Section 462.358, Subd. 2b, the City
requires all subdividers as a prerequisite to approval of a final
subdivision plat, land division or development of any land previously
divided by plat, metes or bounds or any other means, which has not
provided park dedication, to convey to the City or dedicate to the public
use for park, playground, open space, or trail a reasonable portion of the
land being platted, divided, or developed as hereinafter specified. The
portions to be dedicated will be approved by the City; or in lieu thereof
the subdivider shall at the option of the City pay to the City, for use in the
acquisition or development of public parks, playgrounds, or in debt
retirement in connection with land previously acquired for such public
purposes, an equivalent amount in cash based upon the undeveloped land
value. Park Dedication is only due in cases where additional new parcels
are created. Park dedication would not be due in situations where a
replat or lot line adjustment is required to modify lot boundaries without
creating any additional lots.
B. The form of contribution (cash, land, or any combination thereof) shall be
decided by the City Council based upon need and conformance with the
comprehensive plan.
Subd. 2. Administrative Procedures. The City Council shall establish such
administrative procedures as they may deem necessary and required to
implement the provisions of this chapter.
Subd. 3. Parks and Trails Commission Recommendation.
A. The Parks and Trails Commission shall, in each case, recommend to the
City Council the total area and location of such land that the Parks and
Trails Commission feels should be so conveyed or dedicated within the
development for the above public purposes. These recommendations
shall be based on the recommendations included in the City parks and
trails plan.
Section 955 (Park Dedication) Page 82
September 13, 2018
B. The Parks and Trails Commission shall review the preliminary plat and
recommend to the Planning Commission and City Council the total area
and location of the land the Park and Trails Commission determines
should be dedicated for park use. The Park and Trails Commission shall
provide its recommendation, prior to the time that the Planning
Commission completes its public hearings on the preliminary plat.
C. In those instances where the Parks and Trails Commission concludes that
a cash equivalency payment should be made by the applicant or owner in
lieu of dedication of land, the Parks and Recreation Commission shall
recommend to the Planning Commission the percentage of the total park
dedication requirement to be paid to the City in cash.
D. In the event that review at a regular meeting of the Parks and Trails
Commission would result in a delay in the review and approval process
so that the time limitations of Minnesota Statutes Section 462.358 may
not be met, the requirement of review by the Parks and Trails
Commission may be waived by either the applicant or by the City Council
at the time of its review of the application.
Subd. 4. Standards for Determination.
A. The Parks and Trails Commission shall develop and recommend to the
City Council for adoption standards and guidelines for determining which
portion of each such development should reasonably be required to be
conveyed or dedicated. Such standards and guidelines may take into
consideration the zoning classification to be assigned to the land to be
developed, the particular use proposed for such land, amenities to be
provided, and factors of density and site development as proposed by the
subdivider. The Parks and Trails Commission shall further recommend
changes and amendments from time to time to such standards and
guidelines to reflect changes in the usage of land which may occur,
changes in zoning classification and concepts and changes in planning
and development concepts that relate to the development and usages to
which land may be put.
B. The Parks and Trails Commission shall develop and recommend
standards for design and construction of public parks, trails, and open
space areas in the City. These standards shall be included in the parks
and trails plan.
Subd. 5. Dedicated Land Requirements. Any land to be dedicated as a requirement
of this chapter shall be reasonably adapted for the above public purposes.
Section 955 (Park Dedication) Page 83
September 13, 2018
Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed dedication areas shall
include size, shape, topography, drainage, geology, tree cover, rare species
and other significant wildlife habitats, access, and location.
Subd. 6. Area of Dedicated Land. Subdividers shall be required to dedicate to the
City for park, trail and open space the percentage of net land area identified
below:
Land Dedication Requirements:
Land Use Category based
on the Comprehensive Plan
Units per acre (Density,
Net – Pre-Development)
Percentage of
land
Rural/Ag Residential Less than 3 4%
Low Density Residential 3-5 15%
Medium-Density Residential 6-8 17%
Mixed Residential 8-10 27%
High-Density Residential and
Mixed-Use
10+ 22%
Commercial and Industrial N/A 3%
The City Council will identify a park dedication fee per residential unit
to be paid in lieu of land dedication when the council determines that
that land is not needed in the area of the proposed subdivision. If the
council determines that land is needed in the subdivision, but in a
lesser amount than the required percentage, the council will require
payment of the per unit fee based on a pro-rata share of the land
dedication that would otherwise be required.
A. The City Council shall review park dedication fee requirements
periodically, to ensure that the required fee remains consistent with park
and trail system development costs.
B. Commercial and industrial land uses: Dedication requirement
is five percent (3%) of land or equivalent market value in cash.
C. Dedication requirements for mixed use development will be pro-rated
based on the acres of land devoted to each type of land use.
D. Developments that include memory care and assisted living units shall
apply the commercial rate to the percentage of memory care and/or
assisted living units that are in the project, multiplied by the project net
acres.
Section 955 (Park Dedication) Page 84
September 13, 2018
E. Schools, religious institutions and other non-profit organizations:
Dedication requirement shall be determined by the City Council
based on discussion with the School District or non-profit agency.
Recommendations will be based on anticipated use of City park
facilities by the school or organization, and shall consider
agreements for cooperative use of school recreational facilities.
F. Determination of Fair Market Value The fair market value of the
undeveloped land shall be determined by the City annually based on
tax valuation or other relevant data. If the City’s calculation of
valuation is objected to by the applicant, then the value shall be as
negotiated between the City and the applicant, or based on the
market value as determined by the City based on an independent
appraisal of land in a same or similar land use category.
G. Lands Designated on Official Map or Comprehensive Land Use
Plan. Where a proposed park, playground, trail or open space
area indicated in the City park and trail plan or comprehensive
plan is located in whole or in part within a proposed subdivision, all
or part of the proposed public site shall be designated as such and
should be dedicated to the City, based on the area of land dedication
required by this ordinance.
H. Deviation from Required Dedication. The dedication requirements
based on the development's proportional share of the City park system
are presumptively appropriate. The City Council may modify the land
dedication required for a subdivision if it finds that the value of the land
dedicated would exceed the development’s proportional share of the park
system cost.
I. Wetlands and Ponding Areas. Existing wetlands drainage ways
accepted by the City shall not be considered in the parkland and/or cash
contribution to the City.
(Ord. 291, passed 12-11-14, Ord. 325, passed 07-01-16)
Subd. 7. Land Dedication/Payment of Fees
A. Land Dedication. When land is to be dedicated to satisfy the park
dedication requirement, separate lots or outlots shall be indicated on
the plat drawings for the area(s) to be dedicated. Permanent trail
easements may be allowed for dedication of trail corridors shown on
the Parks and Trails Plan. Park dedication credit shall be given for the
net acreage (pre-development) of these off-road trails, but no credit
shall be given for trails within the public right-of-way. Such lots,
Section 955 (Park Dedication) Page 85
September 13, 2018
outlots or easements shall be deeded to the City prior to the issuance
of any building permits within the plat
B. Installation of Improvements. As part of their development contract
or site plan approval responsibilities, owners and developers shall be
responsible for making certain improvements to the developments for
park, playground, trail and public open space purposes, including, but
not limited to, finished grading and ground cover for all park,
playground, trail and public open spaces within their developments.
No credit toward the required dedication shall be given for this work.
The City reserves the right to pave the trails or require the developer
to pave these off-road trails. Should the City require the developer to
pave the trails, the City shall reimburse the Developer for the costs for
paving of the trail.
C. Cash fee. When a cash fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the
payment of such fee shall be required as follows:
1. For residential developments, the fee shall be paid prior to the
City’s release of the signed final plat mylars for recording with
Hennepin County.
2. For commercial and industrial developments the fee shall be
paid prior to issuance of any building permits within the
subdivision.
3. Park dedication is required for all newly created lots or
parcels. Park dedication is not due for parcels that have
previously paid park dedication (land or cash-in-lieu).
4. In plats that include outlots for future development, the
subdivider may pay to the City 1) the development’s
proportional share for the entire subdivision, including the
outlots, or 2) the development’s proportional share excluding
such outlots, providing that the park dedication requirement
shall be satisfied when such outlots are replatted.
(Ord. 291, passed 12-11-14)
Subd. 8. Credit for Private Parks
A. Standards for Credit. At the City Council's discretion, Park dedication
credit may be given where private parks and facilities are provided in a
proposed subdivision, and such space is to be privately owned and
maintained by the future residents of the subdivision. Credit may be
Section 955 (Park Dedication) Page 86
September 13, 2018
considered when the City Council finds it is in the public interest to do so, and
that the following standards are met:
1. Such credit may be given only for park areas within the proposed
subdivision that are designed on the Parks and Trails Map as Neighborhood
Parks.
2. The facilities proposed for the private parks and facilities shall be in
substantial accordance with the provisions of the Parks and Trails Plan, and
approved by the City Council.
3. In no circumstances shall such credit for private facilities exceed 20
percent of the amount required to be dedicated to the public under
this chapter. The council and Parks Commission will consider the
proportion of neighborhood park needs provided by the proposed facility,
and the proportion of new neighborhood residents to be served by the
facility in determining the credit to be given for private park facilities.
4. Yards, court areas, setbacks and other open space required to be
maintained by the zoning ordinance shall not be included in the
computation of such private open space.
5. The private ownership and maintenance of the parks is adequately
provided for by written agreement.
6. The private parks are restricted for park and recreation purposes
by recorded covenants that run with the land in favor of the future owners
of property within the subdivision and which cannot be modified without
the written consent of the City Council.
7. The proposed private parks are reasonably adaptable for use for
park or recreation purposes, taking into consideration such factors
as size, shape, topography, geology, drainage, access, and location of
the proposed facilities.
Subd. 9. Park Fund.
A. Purpose of Park Fund. Cash payments shall be placed by the City in a
special park fund and used only for the acquisition and development of
land for parks, trails, playgrounds, public open space; development of
existing park and playground sites, public open space; and debt
retirement in connection with land previously acquired for park
purposes.
Section 955 (Park Dedication) Page 87
September 13, 2018
B. Annual Financial Report. Each year, the Parks and Trails Commission
shall present to the council, in such detail as the council shall require, its
estimate of the financial needs of the Parks and Trails Commission for the
ensuing fiscal year.
C. Gifts and Donations. The Parks and Trails Commission is authorized to
receive gifts, devises, bequests, endowments, or other donations of
money and property on behalf of the City. All moneys received shall be
deposited in the Park Fund.

Subd. 1. The financial guarantee shall be held by the City until, upon written notice by
the subdivider and certification from a professional engineer that part or all
of the required improvements have been completed and upon verification of

City has received 1) certified, reproducible record plans of all required
improvements installed by the subdivider and 2) a title insurance policy
approved by the City Attorney indicating that the improvements are free and
clear of any and all liens and encumbrances.
Section 960 (Development Contract) Page 91
September 13, 2018
Subd. 2. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to insure that a submitted
financial guarantee shall continue in full force and effect until the City
Engineer has approved and accepted all of the required improvements, and
thereby is authorized to release the guarantee or reduce the amount of the
guarantee as provided in Subd. 1 above.
Subd. 3. When any instrument submitted as a financial guarantee contains provision
for an expiration date, after which the instrument may not be drawn upon,
notwithstanding the status of the Development Contract or of the required
improvements, the expiration date shall be October 31 or the closest
business day in the case of weekends and legal holidays. Further, the
financial guarantee shall be deemed automatically extended without change
for 6 months from the expiration date unless 60 days prior to the expiration
date, the financial institution notifies the City in writing by certified mail that
it does not elect to renew the financial guarantee for an additional period. If
the instrument is not to be renewed and has not been released by the City
Engineer, another acceptable financial guarantee in the appropriate amount
shall be submitted at least 60 days prior to the expiration. The term of any
extension shall be approved by the City Engineer and subject to the

Section 965 (Official Maps) Page 93
September 13, 2018
SECTION 965 – OFFICIAL MAPS
965.010 – PURPOSE.
Land that is needed for future street purposes and as sites for other necessary public
facilities and services is frequently diverted to non-public uses which could have been
located on other lands without hardship or inconvenience to the owners. When this
happens, public uses of land may be denied or may be obtained only at prohibitive cost or
at the expense of dislocating the owners and occupants of the land. Identification on an
official map of land needed for future public uses permits both the public and private
property owners to adjust their building plans equitably and conveniently before
investments are made which will make such adjustments difficult to accomplish. It is the
purpose of this ordinance to provide a uniform procedure for the proper use of official
maps as authorized by the Minnesota Municipal Planning Act, Minnesota Statutes, Section
462.351 to 462.36.
965.020 - OFFICIAL MAP DEFINED.
“Official map” as used in this ordinance means a map adopted in accordance with this
ordinance showing existing streets, proposed future streets, and the area needed for
widening of existing streets of the City. An official map may also show the location of
existing and future land and facilities within the City. An official map may cover the entire
City or any portion of the City.
965.030 - INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS.
Proceedings for adoption, amendment, or repeal of an official map or any part thereof may
be initiated by 1) the City’s Planning Division; 2) a recommendation of the Planning
Commission; or 3) action by the City Council.
965.040 - REFERENCE TO PLANNING COMMISSION.
Every proposed official map or change in a map shall be referred to the Planning
Commission for advice and recommendation thereon, and such recommendation shall be
submitted to the City Council within 45 days after reference to the Planning Commission
along with the report of the Commission on the effect of the proposal on the
comprehensive plan of the City. If no recommendation is received by the Council from the
Planning Commission within 45 days after reference of the proposal to the Commission by
the Council, the Council may take such action as it may deem proper upon the proposal
without further action by the Planning Commission.
Section 965 (Official Maps) Page 94
September 13, 2018
965.050 - NOTICE AND HEARING.
Subd. 1. Notice. Upon receiving the recommendation of the Planning Commission or
after 45 days from the submission of the proposal to the Planning
Commission without a recommendation from the Commission, the Council
may call a public hearing on the proposal. A notice of the time, place, and
purpose of the hearing and a description of property to be included in the
mapped streets and public grounds shall be published in the official
newspaper at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing. At least 10 days
prior to the hearing the Clerk shall also mail a copy of the notice to each
owner of land situated within or abutting any street or other public ground
shown on the official map. For purposes of this notice the owners shall be
determined by the records of the County Auditor and the notice shall be
addressed to the last known address as shown by the Auditor’s records.
Failure to serve any such notice shall not invalidate the proceedings.
Subd. 2. Hearing. At the time and place specified in the notice, the Council shall hear
evidence and arguments concerning the proposal. The hearing may be
continued from time to time without further notice. The Council may direct
the Planning Commission to conduct a hearing and following the hearing to
report its recommendation to the Council.
965.060 - PREPARATION AND FILING OF MAPS.
The official map or maps shall be prepared in sufficient detail to permit the establishment
of future acquisition lines on the ground. In unplatted areas a minimum of a centerline
survey shall be made prior to the preparation of the final draft of the official map. A
licensed land surveyor shall attest to the accuracy of the future acquisition lines shown on
the official map. After enactment of any ordinance adopting an official map or amending or
repealing a previous official map ordinance, a certified copy of the official map or section to
which the ordinance relates together with an attached copy of the ordinance shall be filed
with the County Recorder.
965.070 – EFFECT.
After an official map has been adopted and filed, the issuance of building permits by the
City shall be subject to the provisions of this ordinance. The City shall deny every
application for a permit to construct a new building or structure or expand an existing
building or structure within any area designated on the official map for street or other
Section 965 (Official Maps) Page 95
September 13, 2018
public purposes. Whenever any street or highway is widened or improved or any new
street is opened, or any interest in lands for other public purposes is acquired by the City,
the City is not required in such proceedings to pay for any building or structure placed
without a permit or in violation of conditions of a permit within the limits of the mapped
street or outside of any building line that may have been established upon the existing
street or within any area thus identified for public purposes. The adoption of an official
map does not give the City any right, title, or interest in areas identified for public purposes
thereon, but the adoption of the map does authorize the
City to acquire such interest without paying compensation for buildings or structures
erected in such areas without a permit or in violation of the conditions of a permit.
965.080 – APPEALS.
Whenever a building permit is denied pursuant to this ordinance, the Board of Appeals and
Adjustments shall, upon appeal filed with it by the owner of the land, grant a permit for
building in an area designated on the official map for a street or other public purpose in
any case in which the Board finds, upon the evidence and the arguments presented to it, (a)
that the entire property of the appellant of which the area designated for public purposes
forms a part cannot yield a reasonable use to the owner unless such a permit is granted, or
(b) that balancing the interest of the City in preserving the integrity of the official map and
of the comprehensive City plan and the interest of the property owner in the use of his
property and in the benefits of ownership, the grant of such permit is required by
considerations of justice and equity. The Board of Appeals and Adjustments shall hold a
public hearing upon the appeal after notice of the hearing has been published in the official
newspaper once at least 10 days before the hearing. If the Board authorizes the issuance of
a permit, it shall specify the exact location, ground area, height, and other details as to the
extent and character of the building for which the permit is granted. If the Board
authorizes issuance of a permit, the Council or other Board or Commission having
jurisdiction shall have 6 months from the date of the decision of the Board to institute
proceedings to acquire such land or interest therein, and if no such proceedings are started
within that time, the City shall issue the permit if the application otherwise conforms to
local ordinances.

References to the “Council” hereafter in this section shall mean the City Council acting in its
capacity as the Board of Adjustment and Appeals.
970.030 - REVIEW CRITERIA.

The burden of proof is on the applicant to show that all of the following criteria have been
met:

ordinance.
B. That the conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are
unique to the parcel of land for which the variance is sought and were not

NATIVE PLANT SPECIES: The pre-European settlement group of plant species that
is native to the local region, and were not introduced as a result of European
settlement or subsequent human introduction.
WETLAND: Lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, where
the water table is usually at or near the surface, or the land is covered by shallow
water. Consistent with the Wetland Conservation Act (WCA), wetlands are to be
identified and delineated using the methodology set forth in the Federal Manual for
Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands (Interagency Task Force on
Wetland Delineation, 1987, or it most recent revision). For purposes of this
definition, wetlands have three of the following attributes:
1. A predominance of hydric soils
2. Inundation or saturation by surface or ground water at a frequency and
duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation
typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions
3. Under normal circumstances support a prevalence of such vegetation
This definition does not include wetlands created from uplands either: (1) for storm
water storage and management purposes, or (2) by actions not intended to create
the wetland and approved, permitted, funded or overseen by a public entity.
WETLAND EDGE: The line delineating the outer edge of a wetland. This line shall
be established by using the 1987 Corps of Engineers (COE) Wetlands Delineation
Manual, or its most recent version.
WETLAND FUNCTIONS: The natural processes performed by wetlands, including
providing wildlife and fishery habitat, facilitating food chain production, providing
habitat for nesting, rearing, and resting sites for animal species, maintaining the
availability and quality of water, purifying water, acting as a recharge and discharge
area for groundwater aquifers, and moderating surface water and storm water

flows, improving storm water quality, providing aesthetic benefits, and performing
other functions, including but not limited to those set out in U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers regulations at CFR Section 320.4 (b)(2)(1988).
WETLANDS, HIGH QUALITY: These wetlands exist in a largely unaltered state and
have special or unusual qualities that call for a high level of protection. These
wetlands may provide habitat for rare, threatened and/or endangered plant and
animal species; and are ranked High in Wetland Functional Level for most
categories (Floral Diversity/Integrity, Flood/Stormwater Attenuation, Water Quality
Protection, Wildlife and/or Fishery Habitat, Aesthetics/Recreation) when evaluated
using the Minnesota Rapid Assessment Method for Evaluating Wetland Functions.
WETLANDS, MEDIUM QUALITY: These wetlands have experienced some
alteration, and are ranked Medium in Wetland Function Level for most categories
(Floral Diversity/Integrity, Flood/Stormwater Attenuation, Water Quality
Protection, Wildlife and/or Fishery Habitat, Aesthetics/Recreation) when evaluated
using the Minnesota Rapid Assessment Method for Evaluating Wetland Functions.
WETLANDS, LOW QUALITY: These wetlands have usually been substantially
altered by human activities, and ranked Low in Wetland Function Level for most
categories (Floral Diversity/Integrity, Flood/Stormwater Attenuation, Water Quality
Protection, Wildlife and/or Fishery Habitat, Aesthetics/Recreation) when evaluated
using the Minnesota Rapid Assessment Method for Evaluating Wetland Functions.
YARD: An area on a lot between the lot line and the nearest principal structure, unoccupied
and unobstructed by any portion of a structure from the ground upward, except as
otherwise provided in this Ordinance.
YARD, FRONT: An area extending the full width of a lot between the front lot line and the
nearest principal structure.
YARD, REAR: An area extending the full width of a lot between the rear lot line and the
nearest principal structure.
SIDE YARD: An area extending the depth of a lot from the front yard to the rear yard
between the side lot line and the nearest principal structure.
ZONING ADMINISTRATOR: Individual or firm so designated and authorized by the
Corcoran City Council.
ZONING DISTRICT: An area or areas within the limits of the City for which the regulations
and requirements governing use are uniform.
ZONING DISTRICT AMENDMENTS: A change authorized by the governing body either in
the allowed use within a district or in the boundaries of a district.

be permitted to have on-site employees or employees on-site for the
purpose of staging work to be performed off-site.

from time to time by resolution of the City Council.
E. All permits issued under this Ordinance shall be reviewed by the City
every 3 years from the date of issuance for a determination that the
existing Home Occupation, considered in light of the existing standards
and criteria, still warrants the issuance of a license. The City may revoke
or modify an administrative permit or CHOL upon a finding that
conditions have changed to warrant revocation or modification of the
license.
Subd. 12. Violations/Penalty.

1040.135 – GENERAL MIXED USE (GMU) DISTRICT
Subd. 1. Purpose. The purpose of the General Mixed Use District (GMU) is to provide
an area for compact, inter-connected, walkable, mixed-use development
along key community corridors and to support high quality development and
site flexibility due to the unique site conditions in these areas. The mixture of
land uses within the district is essential to establishing the level of vitality
and intensity needed to support retail and service uses. A combination of
retail, office, service and residential uses are encouraged although not
required. Buildings may also be entirely one use. The placement of the
building and the relationship of the building, parking, landscaping, and
pedestrian spaces is essential to creating the pedestrian-friendly
environment envisioned for the GMU District. The standards in this Section
are reinforced within the Design Guidelines contained in Appendix A. New
development within this district will be allowed only when a full range of
municipal services and facilities are available to serve the area.
The General Mixed Use District applies to those properties classified as Mixed
Use on the 2030 Future Land Use Plan and adjacent to County Road 30. The
character of the General Mixed Use District shall reflect high quality design
due to the high visibility of these areas at the gateway to the City at County
30. Although development in this mixed-use district will be more autooriented
in design than the Downtown Mixed Use District, pedestrian
connections and amenities will still be required to provide connections to
existing and future planned areas, sidewalks and trails and to provide for
safe pedestrian circulation within the site. Landscaping, and architectural
details shall be used to unify sites within the General Mixed Use District.

1040.140 – PUD (PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT)
Subd. 1. Purpose. The purpose of the PUD, Planned Unit Development District, is to
promote creative and efficient use of land by providing design flexibility in
the development of residential neighborhoods and/or nonresidential areas
that would not be possible under a conventional zoning district. The decision
to zone property to PUD is a public policy decision for the City Council to
make in its legislative capacity.
Subd. 2. Intent. The intent of this district is to:
A. Provide for the establishment of PUD districts in appropriate settings and
situations to create or maintain a development pattern that is consistent
with the City’s Comprehensive Plan.
B. Allow for the mixing of land uses within a development when such mixing
of land uses could not otherwise be accomplished under the existing
zoning and subdivision regulations.
C. Provide for variations to the strict application of the land use regulations
to improve site design and operation, while at the same time
incorporating design elements, e.g. construction materials, landscaping,
lighting, etc., that exceed the City’s standards to offset the effect of any
variations.
D. Promote more creative and efficient approach to land use within the City,
while at the same time protecting and promoting the health, safety,
comfort, aesthetics, economic viability, and general welfare of the City.
E. Preserve and enhance natural features and open spaces.
F. Maintain or improve the efficiency of public streets and utilities.
G. Ensure appropriate transitions between differing land uses.
Subd. 3. Application. A PUD district shall not be established for parcels guided in the
Comprehensive Plan for Rural/Ag Residential and Rural Service/Commercial,
except where allowed for an Open Space Preservation Plat. It will be used in
areas guided Mixed Use or Mixed Residential on the Land Use Plan and in
other areas where the City finds that the proposal meets the intent of this
district.
Subd. 4. Allowed Uses. All permitted uses, permitted accessory uses, conditional uses,
and interim uses contained in the underlying zoning districts shall be treated
as potentially allowable uses within a PUD district.
Section 1040 (District Regulations) Page 156
October 25, 2018
Subd. 5. Lot Dimensions, Setbacks and Building Heights. The various lot width, lot
area, setback and height regulations of the underlying zoning district shall be
considered presumptively appropriate, but may be departed from to
accomplish the purposes described in this Section.
Subd. 6. Processing Procedures. The general sequence for application, review and
action on a PUD shall be according to the following procedures:
A. Pre-application Conference
Prior to filing of an application or submittal of a sketch plan the applicant shall
arrange for and attend a conference with the Zoning Administrator. The
primary purpose of the conference shall be to provide the applicant with an
opportunity to gather information and obtain guidance as to the general
suitability of the proposal for the area and its conformity to the provisions of
this district prior to incurring substantial expenditures in the preparation of
plans, surveys, and other data.
B. PUD Sketch Plan
Prior to filing a preliminary PUD development plan application, the applicant
shall submit a sketch plan of the project to the Zoning Administrator prior to
submission of a formal application. The Zoning Administrator shall refer the
sketch plan to the City Council for discussion, review and informal comment.
Any opinions or comments provided to the applicant shall be considered
advisory only and shall not constitute a binding decision on the request.
The purpose of the sketch plan is to inform the City of the applicant’s intentions
and to inform the applicant as to the general acceptability of the proposal
before extensive costs are incurred.
The PUD Sketch Plan shall be conceptual in nature but shall be drawn to scale
and shall contain at a minimum the following:
1. Location map showing the location within the City and more detailed
locations on half-section plat maps showing all perimeter property
lines.
2. Aerial photograph of the area.

Districts as described and regulated in Section 1050.
11. Any other items as may be deemed necessary by City staff.
(Ord. 286, passed 9-25-14)
C. Preliminary PUD Development Plan
The purpose of the preliminary PUD development plan is to establish the
intent, density, and intensity of the proposed development. Upon receipt of
the complete application for rezoning to PUD and the preliminary PUD
development plan, the item shall be scheduled for a public hearing at the
Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall conduct a public
hearing in accordance with the provisions of the City’s Code. Upon due
consideration, the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the
City Council.
Following the Planning Commission recommendation, the City Council shall
consider the rezoning request and preliminary PUD development plan. At
this meeting the City Council shall receive the recommendation from the
Planning Commission and a report from the City Staff. Upon due
consideration the City Council shall approve, disapprove, or approve with
specified modifications and/or conditions by majority vote.
If a preliminary development plan has been denied by the City Council, the
owner or applicant may not reapply for the same or similar on the same
property for a six (6) month period following the date of the denial.
D. Final PUD Development Plan
The applicant shall submit a final PUD development plan to the City. The
Planning Commission shall review the final plan in accordance with the
Section 1040 (District Regulations) Page 158
October 25, 2018
provisions of this Section. The Planning Commission shall review the
application to ensure that the proposed final PUD development plan is in
substantial conformance with the approved preliminary PUD development
plan. Upon due consideration the Planning Commission shall make their
recommendation to the City Council.
Following the Planning Commission recommendation, the City Council shall
consider the final development plan. Upon due consideration the City
Council shall approve, disapprove, or approve with specified modifications
and/or conditions by majority vote.
If the applicant desires, and the City Council concurs, the preliminary and
final development plans may be processed concurrently, provided all items
required for both applications are submitted.
The rezoning of the property defined in the development plan shall not
become effective until such time as the City Council approves an ordinance
reflecting said amendment, which shall take place at the time that the City
Council approves the final development plan.

the reasonable enjoyment of the neighborhood property.
G. The quality of the building and site design proposed by the PUD plan shall
substantially enhance the aesthetics of the site, shall demonstrate higher
Section 1040 (District Regulations) Page 159
October 25, 2018
standards, more efficient and effective uses of streets, utilities and public
facilities, it shall maintain and enhance any natural resources within the
development, and create a public benefit that is greater than what would
be achieved through the strict application of the primary zoning
regulations.
Subd. 8. Preliminary Development Plan Content. The intent of the preliminary
development plan is to allow City review of site plan and general
development issues, without the need for detailed architectural plans. The
applicant shall submit preliminary development plans which include the
following:

SECTION 1050 – OVERLAY DISTRICTS
1050.010 - WETLAND OVERLAY DISTRICT
Subd. 1. Findings, Intent and Incorporation by Reference.
A. The City has determined that wetlands serve to maintain water quality by
filtering water that is discharged into ground water aquifers and by
retaining inorganic sediments, toxicants and nutrients. They also retain
and reduce the discharge of phosphorus and transform nutrients from
their inorganic to organic forms, thereby protecting streams and water
bodies from eutrophication and contamination. Wetlands also store
runoff and reduce the velocity and magnitude of flood peaks.
B. Wetland vegetation also prevents the erosion of shoreline areas. Wetland
vegetation provides food, shelter, and important habitat for wildlife. All
of these wetland characteristics provide valuable recreation and
education resources.
C. The City has also found that wetlands vary significantly in the degree that
they have been altered. Wetlands within the City exhibit great variations
in their floral diversity, quality of wildlife and fishery habitat, degree of
fluctuation in response to storms, the extent to which their shorelines
have been altered or eroded, and their relative value in protecting water
quality. Therefore, the City has found it necessary and beneficial to
classify wetlands based upon their functions and values. The City has also
found that it is in the best interest of the general health and welfare of the
City to achieve no net loss of wetlands within the community.
D. The City recognizes that a substantial amount of wetland degradation
results from sedimentation and nutrient loading related to construction
projects. Therefore, the City finds it necessary to require extraordinary
measures to prevent such construction related degradation.
E. In addition to having regulations that affect the physical impacts within
wetland areas the City also finds that it is necessary to regulate the use of
lands surrounding wetlands. Buffer strips are necessary and beneficial to
maintaining the health of wetlands. These strips of land surrounding
wetlands protect their shorelines from erosion, while serving to filter
sediment, chemicals and other nutrients before the storm water
discharges into the wetland. Buffer strips are also beneficial in providing
habitat for wildlife.
F. This Section hereby incorporates by reference the Wetlands Conservation
Act of 1991 [Minn. Stat. 103G.221 et seq. (hereinafter referred to as the
WCA)] and any future amendments adopted by the legislature. All
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 167
October 25, 2018
wetlands, as defined in Section 1020.020 of this Chapter, including those
governed by the Department of Natural Resources, are covered by the
other provisions of this Chapter. Also, there are circumstances under
which the strict enforcement of these regulations may be unreasonable
and in circumstances that meet the criteria established in Subd. 5 of this
Chapter, departures from the strict application of these standards may be
permitted.
G. It is the intent of this Chapter to avoid the alteration and destruction of
wetlands. When wetlands are altered or destroyed, the mitigation must
be provided to recreate the functions and values of the wetland.
Subd. 2. Purpose and Implementation.
A. Through the adoption and enforcement of this Section, the City shall
promote the general health, safety, and welfare of its residents by both
conserving and protecting wetlands and requiring sound management
practices and mitigation as provided for in the WCA when development
occurs in the vicinity of wetlands. Through the implementation of this
Section, the City seeks to accomplish the following purposes:
1. To satisfy the requirements of the WCA as it may be amended and,
thereby achieve no net loss of wetlands within the City;
2. To balance the needs to preserve and protect natural resources and
systems with both the rights of private property owners and the need
to support the efficient use of developable land within the City;
3. To preserve the natural character of the landscape through the
maintenance of wetland ecosystems;
4. To promote water quality by maintaining the ability of wetlands to
recharge ground water and receive the discharge of ground water, to
retain sediment and toxicants and filter nutrients from surface water
runoff before it discharges into community lakes and streams, thus
avoiding the contamination and eutrophication of these water
features; and
5. To provide wildlife habitat and thereby support the maintenance of
diversity of both plant and animal species within the City.
B. To accomplish these purposes, the City:
1. Has conducted an inventory of wetlands and other natural areas
within the City;
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 168
October 25, 2018
2. Has developed a system of classification for wetlands within the City
and classified the City’s wetlands based upon their relative values
related to floral diversity, wildlife habitat, water quality protection,
fishery habitat, flood storage, shoreline protection, and aesthetic,
recreational and educational benefits using the Minnesota Rapid
Assessment (MNRAM) methodology;
3. Has prepared and maintains a comprehensive set of official maps
identifying the location and classification of wetlands inventoried in
the Natural Resources Inventory;
4. Has established wetland regulations that are coordinated with flood
plain and shoreland protection regulations;
5. Requires sound management practices to protect, conserve, maintain,
enhance, and improve the quality of wetlands within the community;
6. Enforces standards for the alteration of wetlands when alteration is
allowed, including standards and procedures for the mitigation of the
loss of wetland areas and their functions and values, when alteration
or destruction occurs;
7. Obtains protective easements over or acquires fee title to wetlands as
appropriate;
8. Educates the public about the numerous benefits and features that
wetland provide and the adverse effects of improperly managed
development on wetlands.
Subd. 3. General Provisions.
A. Identification and Delineation of Wetlands
1. This Section shall apply to all land containing wetlands and land
within the setback and buffer areas required by this Section.
Wetlands shall be subject to the requirements established herein, as
well as restrictions and requirements established by other applicable
Federal, State, and City ordinances and regulations. These wetland
protection regulations shall not be construed to allow anything
otherwise prohibited in the zoning district where the wetland is
located.
2. A wetland is land that meets the definition of “wetlands” set forth in
Section 1020.020. The classification of a wetland shown on the
“Natural Resource Communities Quality Ranking Map” will be prima
facie evidence of the classification of a wetland.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 169
October 25, 2018
3. The presence or absence of a wetland on the official maps does not
represent a definitive determination as to whether a wetland covered
by this Section is or is not present. Wetlands that are identified
during site specific delineation activities but do not appear on the
official wetland maps are still subject to the provisions of the Section.
Areas that appear on the official wetland maps as wetlands that are
not identified as wetlands during site specific delineation activities
are not subject to the provisions of this Section.
4. It will be the responsibility of an applicant for required City approvals
or permits to delineate the exact wetland boundary or to determine
that no wetland exists on a subject property. All delineations must be
reviewed and approved by the City or its delegated authority.
5. If an applicant questions whether a wetland exists or disputes its
classification on the official map, the applicant shall have the burden
to supply detailed information for review supporting the applicant’s
assertion, including but not limited to, topographic, hydrologic,
floristic, and/or soil data deemed necessary by the City to determine
the jurisdictional status of the wetland, its exact boundary and its
classification. Wetland delineations supplied by applicants shall be
certified by a qualified wetland delineator. Wetland delineators must
satisfy any certification requirements that may be established by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the Minnesota Board of Water and
Soil Resources.
6. Applicants seeking a change in wetland classification must submit to
the City a completed MNRAM version 1.0 form, or the most recent
version. The technical evaluation panel will review the request for
change. The technical evaluation panel will make a recommendation
to the City regarding a change in classification.
7. Only that portion of a property within the boundaries of a wetland
shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
8. This Section establishes three wetland classifications as defined in
Section 1020.020: High Quality, Medium Quality, and Low Quality.
Subd. 4. General Standards.
The following standards apply to all lands within and/or abutting a wetland:
A. Septic and soil absorptions systems must be setback a minimum of 75
feet from the City approved boundary of the wetland.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 170
October 25, 2018
B. The lowest ground floor elevation shall be 2 feet above the 100-year flood
elevation or three feet above the Ordinary High Water Mark of public
waters regulated by Section 1050.020, whichever is greater.
C. Structures intended to provide access across a wetland shall be
prohibited unless a permit is obtained in conformance with State
Regulations.
D. The MPCA’s Best Management Practices shall be followed to avoid
erosion and sedimentation during the construction process.
E. City inspection schedules and fines for erosion control will double on
projects abutting wetlands.
F. Before the City issues a building permit for a lot with a required wetland
buffer, the lot owner shall:
1. Record a notice of the wetland buffer requirement against the title to
the lot with the office of the Hennepin County Recorder or Registrar of
Titles, and
2. Install the wetland monuments required by Subd. 7 of this Chapter.
Subd. 5. Wetland Buffer Strips and Setbacks.
A. For lots of record created after March 23, 2004, a buffer strip shall be
maintained abutting all wetlands identified in Subd. 3 below. The setback
and buffer provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to lots of record on
March 23, 2004, to developments for which conditional use permits, site
plans, and preliminary plats, final plats or preliminary or final planned
unit development plans have been approved by the City within 2 years
prior to March 23, 2004, or to developments for which complete
applications for any of the above actions have been accepted by the City
for review, but not yet acted upon, prior to March 23, 2004. The City
does, however, strongly encourage the use of a wetland buffer and
setback on all lots in the City.
B. Wetland buffer strips and structure setbacks shall apply to all parcels of
land whether or not the wetland is on the same parcel as a proposed
development.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 171
October 25, 2018
C. Wetland buffer strips are required on wetland sizes and types as follows:
Wetland Buffers and Setback Requirements
High Medium Low
Wetland Buffer Average Width: 50’ 25’ 15’
Wetland Buffer Width (Min.): 40’ 20’ 10’
Wetland Buffer Width (Max.):* 60’ 40’ 20’
Structure Setback (from Buffer):** 15’ 15’ 15’
Total Buffer and Setback (Average): 65’ 40’ 30’
*Buffer widths in excess of the listed maximums shall not be used in calculating average buffer width.
**These setbacks shall take precedence over other setbacks required in this Chapter. These setbacks apply to
structures only—a 5-foot setback is required for roads and parking lots. Trails that serve an interpretive
function may be exempted from buffer and setback requirements.
Example of Buffer and Setback
Applied to a High Quality Wetland
D. Notwithstanding the foregoing, wetland buffer strips are not required for:
1. A wetland if Minnesota Statutes Section 103G.2241, subdivision 4, 5
or 9 would exempt the draining or filling of that wetland from the
replacement plan requirements of Minnesota Statutes Section
103G.222, or
2. A wetland that is a Type 1, 2 or 6 wetland as defined in Minnesota
Statutes Section 103G.005, subdivision 17b and that is located outside
the Natural Resources Corridors identified on official City maps.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 172
October 25, 2018
E. Buffer strip vegetation shall be established and maintained in accordance
with the requirements found in this Subdivision. During the first 2 years,
any buffer vegetation that does not survive must be replanted. After 2
years, if the condition of the buffer area changes through natural
processes not caused by the property owner, the owner shall not be
required to reestablish the buffer area to meet the standards contained in
Subd. 8 of this Chapter. Buffer strips shall be identified within each lot by
permanent monuments approved by the City.
F. For roadways that must be aligned either adjacent to or across wetlands
and are subject to WCA replacement requirements, additional wetland
filling to create a buffer strip shall not be required. Trails that the City
has determined serve an interpretive function may also be exempted
from the buffer requirement. All other roadways and trails shall meet the
buffer standards established in this Subd. or in Subd. 6 below.
G. If the area of the buffer has a preconstruction slope of 12 percent or
greater, the buffer shall be at the applicable maximum for width for the
wetland classification. The use of a meandering buffer stripe to maintain
a natural appearance is encouraged but not required in areas of flat
topography.
H. The required structure setback shall apply to all structures, except that
such structure setback shall be reduced to 5 feet for roadways, trails, and
parking lots, and their related retaining walls and fences.
I. Wetland buffer strips not required by this Section may be voluntarily
created in conformance with the requirements of this Section concurrent
with approval of a site plan, or in the absence of a site plan, upon
approval of an administrative permit.
Subd. 6. Alternative Wetland Buffer Strips and Setbacks: With Extraordinary
Management Measures.
A. Because of the unique physical characteristics of a specific parcel of land,
narrower buffer strips may be necessary to allow for a reasonable use of
land,
B. The City Council may approve alternative standards, based on an
assessment of the following:
1. Size of the parcel
2. Existing roads and utilities
3. Percentage of parcel impacted by wetlands
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 173
October 25, 2018
4. Configuration of wetlands on the parcel
5. Quality of the affected wetlands
C. The City Council will evaluate the appropriateness of using the alternative
standards as a part of its review of a sketch plan. An applicant must
receive Council approval through this review process prior to submitting
a preliminary plan or plat application that applies the alternative buffer
strip standards.
D. Alternative standards shall not be allowed on wetlands within the Natural
Resource Corridors identified on official City maps.
E. In instances where the City Council approves alternative buffer
standards, an applicant will be required to apply extraordinary
management measures to control erosion, sedimentation and nutrient
loading during and for two years after construction. The applicant must
demonstrate that the proposed measures will limit dissolved phosphorus
concentration to one milligram per liter (mg/l) or less. Buffer strips and
structure setbacks shall meet the following standards:
Alternative Wetland Buffers and Setbacks, With Extraordinary Measures
High Medium Low
Average Wetland Buffer Width 25’ 15’ 10’
Wetland Buffer Width (Minimum) 20’ 10’ 5’
Wetland Buffer Width (Maximum)* 30’ 20’ 15’
Structure Setback from Buffer** 15’ 15’ 15’
Total (Average): 40’ 30’ 25’
*Buffer widths in excess of the listed maximums shall not be used in calculating the average buffer width.
**These setbacks shall take precedence over other setbacks required in this Chapter. Structure setbacks
apply to structures only; roads, trails and parking lots shall have a 5-foot required setback.
F. Extraordinary management measures that may be permitted in
conjunction with and up-slope from the buffer strip and setback
requirements listed above include, but are not limited to measures that
add redundant protections to normal required Best Management
Practices.
G. The applicant shall be responsible to submit all of the necessary
information to document that the proposed extraordinary construction
and stormwater management practices (hereinafter referred to as
“Extraordinary Management Practices”) will at least duplicate the
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 174
October 25, 2018
performance of the required buffers and setbacks shown in Subd. 5 of this
Chapter, if not exceed it. The applicant shall also have the burden of
proving that the purpose and objectives of the Chapter will be met
through the use of these Extraordinary Management Practices.
H. The approval of any Extraordinary Management Practices shall be
conditioned upon a site improvement performance agreement (Section
1070.050, Subd. 9 of this Chapter) that includes a binding commitment to
the maintenance of the proposed alternative treatments throughout their
useful life.
Subd. 7. Monument Required.
A permanent wetland buffer monument shall be installed at each lot line
where it crosses a wetland buffer, and where needed to indicate the contour
of the buffer, with a maximum spacing of 200 feet of wetland edge. If no
buffer is required, the monument shall be at the edge of the wetland.
Subd. 8. Buffer Strip Vegetation Performance Standards.
A. Where acceptable natural vegetation exists in buffer strip areas, the
retention of such vegetation in an undisturbed state is preferred. A buffer
strip has acceptable natural vegetation if it:
1. Has a continuous, dense layer of perennial grasses that have been
uncultivated or unbroken for at least 10 consecutive years, or
2. Has an overstory of trees and/or shrubs with at least 80 percent
canopy closure that have been uncultivated or unbroken for at least
10 consecutive years, or
3. Contains a mixture of the plant communities described in (1) and (2)
above, that have been uncultivated or unbroken for at least 10
consecutive years.
B. Notwithstanding the above performance standards, the City may
determine existing buffer vegetation to be unacceptable if:
1. It is composed of undesirable plant species (including, but not limited
to reed canary grass, common buckthorn, purple loosestrife, leafy
spurge and noxious weeds), or
2. It is lacking a layer of organic thatch or duff, or
3. Has topography that tends to channelize the flow of surface runoff, or
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 175
October 25, 2018
4. For some other reason it is unlikely to retain nutrients and sediment.
C. Where buffer areas, or a portion thereof, are not vegetated or have been
cultivated or otherwise disturbed within 10 years of the permit
application, such areas shall be re-planted and maintained according to
each of the following standards:
1. The soil in wetland buffer strips shall be amended, as necessary, to
ensure that the soil has an organic content of not less than 10 percent
and not more than 20 percent.
2. Buffer zones shall be planted with a seed mix containing 100 percent
perennial native plant species, except for a one-time planting of an
annual nurse or cover crop such as oats or rye.
3. The seed mix to be used shall consist of at least 12 pounds pure live
seed (PLS) per acre of native prairie grass seed and 5 pounds PLS per
acre of native forbs. Native prairie grass and native forb mixes shall
contain no fewer than 4 and 5 species respectively.
4. The annual nurse or cover crop shall be applied at a rate of 20 pounds
per acre.
5. Native shrubs may be substituted for forbs. Such shrubs may be bare
root seedlings and shall be planted at a rate of 60 plants per acre.
Shrubs shall be distributed so as to provide a natural appearance and
shall not be planted in rows.
6. Any ground cover or shrub plantings installed in buffer areas are
independent of landscaping requirements set forth elsewhere in the
City Code and City policy.
7. Native prairie grasses and forbs shall be planted by a qualified
contractor using a drill designed for native prairie grass seedlings,
such as a Truax or Nesbitt Native Grass Drill or a John Deere 1550
Power-Till Seeder.
8. No fertilizer shall be used in establishing new buffer zones, except on
highly disturbed sites when deemed necessary to establish acceptable
buffer vegetation and then limited to amounts indicated by an
accredited soil testing laboratory.
9. All seeded areas shall be mulched immediately with clean straw at a
rate of 1.5 tons per acre. Mulch shall be anchored with a disk or
tackifier. On slopes that are steeper than 3:1, additional soil
stabilization materials such as straw mat or coconut fiber mat shall be
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 176
October 25, 2018
used, as specified in the MnDOT Seeding Manual 2000, or most recent
MnDOT manual.
10. Buffer zones (both natural and created) shall be protected by silt
fence during construction and the fence shall remain in place until the
area crop is established.
11. Applicants may obtain from the City a set of standard seeding and
planting specifications for buffer zones that meet all City
requirements.
D. During the first 2 years, the developer shall replant any buffer vegetation
that does not survive. After 2 years, if the condition of the buffer area
changes through natural processes not caused by the property owner, the
owner shall not be required to reestablish the buffer area to meet the
standards established in this subdivision.
Subd. 9. Encroachment in Required Setback and Buffer Areas.
A. Patios and decks may encroach up to a maximum of 6 feet into required
structure setback areas. Porches may not encroach into required setback
areas. Buffer and wetland areas must be kept fee of all structures,
including fences and play equipment.
B. Water quality ponds may encroach into required wetland buffer areas,
provided that the amount of buffer encroached upon does not exceed 50
percent of the total area required for such ponding, and provided that the
amount of buffer encroached upon does not exceed 50 percent of the total
area required for buffering. These limitations may be exceeded where
two-cell water quality ponding is utilized.
Subd. 10. Variances.
A. Requests for variances shall be made in accordance with the procedures
and requirements set forth in Section 1070.040 of this Chapter.
B. Variances shall only be granted when the standards and criteria set forth
in Section 1070.040 of this Chapter have been met. Variances shall not be
granted which would circumvent the intent and purposes of this
subdivision.

D. Design Criteria for Structures
1. Structures must be placed in accordance with floodplain regulations
applicable to the site as required in Section 1050.030.
a. Section 1050.030 requires that all structures, including accessory
structures, additions to existing structures, and manufactured
homes, shall be constructed so that the basement floor, or first
floor if there is no basement, is at least 2 feet above the regional
flood elevation.
b. Each lot may have one water-oriented accessory structure not
meeting the normal structure setback requirements of this
Ordinance if this water-oriented accessory structure complies
with the following provisions:
c. The structure or facility must not exceed 10 feet in height,
exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than
250 square feet. Detached decks must not exceed eight feet above
grade at any point.
d. The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high
water level must be at least 10 feet.
e. The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility as
viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation,
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 182
October 25, 2018
topography, increased setbacks, or color, assuming summer, leafon
conditions.
f. The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails but must not be
enclosed or used as a storage area.
g. The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human
habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage
treatment facilities.
2. All structures in residential districts, except Places of
Worship/Assembly and nonresidential agricultural structures, are
limited to a maximum height of 25 feet in height.
Subd. 6. Shoreland Vegetative Buffers.
A. Buffer Requirements and Standards. For lots of record created after
March 23, 2004, a buffer area shall be maintained abutting all lakes,
rivers and streams. Buffer sizes and other requirements are included in
Section 1050.010. Buffer vegetation shall be established and maintained
in accordance with the requirements that follow.
1. Buffer area vegetation shall be considered adequate when the buffer
has a continuous, dense layer of perennial grasses, flowers, trees,
and/or shrubs that have been undisturbed (i.e., not cultivated, mown
or disturbed) for at least 10 consecutive years. Vegetation shall be
considered unacceptable if:
a. It is composed of noxious weeds.
b. Topography or sparse vegetation tends to channelize the flow of
surface water;
c. For some other reason the vegetation is unlikely to retain
nutrients and sediment.
2. Where buffer areas, or a portion thereof, are not vegetated, or have
been cultivated or otherwise disturbed within the past 10 years of the
permit application, such areas shall be re-planted and maintained
according to each of the following standards:
a. Buffer areas shall be planted with a seed mix containing 100
percent perennial native plant species, except for a one-time
planting of annual nurse or cover crop such as oats or rye.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 183
October 25, 2018
b. The seed mix to be used shall consist of at least 15 pounds pure
live seed (PLS) per acre of native grass seed and 1 pound PLS per
acre of native forbs. Native grass and native forb mixes shall
contain no fewer than 4 and 5 species respectively.
c. The annual nurse or cover crop shall be applied at a rate of 20
pounds per acre.
d. Native shrubs may be substituted for forbs. Such shrubs may be
bare-root stock and shall be planted at a rate of 60 plants per acre.
Shrubs shall be distributed so as to provide a natural appearance
and shall not be planted in rows.
e. Native grasses and forbs shall be planted by a qualified contractor
by using a drill designed for native grass seeding or by
broadcasting or hydroseeding at Minnesota Department of
Transportation rates (MNDOT Standard Specifications for
Construction).
f. All seeded areas shall be mulched immediately with clean straw at
a rate of 1.5 tons per acre. Mulch shall be anchored with a disk or
tackifier.
g. Buffer areas (both natural and seeded) shall be protected by
erosion control measures as determined by the City. These must
be employed during construction until permanent ground cover is
established to prevent siltation of the buffer area and wetlands.
h. A walking trail may be established within a shoreland buffer area.
The trail should be constructed to minimize erosion. An
undisturbed area of vegetative buffer at least 10 feet in width
should remain between the trail and the wetland edge or the top of
the stream bank.
3. Buffer areas shall be identified by permanent monuments acceptable
to the City. In residential subdivisions, a monument is required for
each lot. In other situations, a monument is required for each 300 feet
of wetland edge.
4. The clearing and removal of vegetation in the buffer area is
prohibited, except for selective clearing and pruning of individual
trees that are dead, diseased, noxious weeds, or hazards.
5. Owners are encouraged to leave dead trees and branches in the buffer
area, because they are part of the native natural environment and
provide necessary habitat to many birds and native wildlife. Dumping
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 184
October 25, 2018
yard waste in buffer areas, including leaves and grass clippings, is
prohibited by this Ordinance.
6. All buffer areas are measured from the ordinary high water level as
marked in the field.
7. The following buffer sizes are minimum requirements for stream
buffers. Classification of lakes and wetlands in shoreland areas and
buffer sizes shall be consistent with the City’s Wetland Overlay
District 1050.010.
Stream Type Average Buffer
Width
Minimum Buffer Structure Setback
Tributary Stream 25’ 20’ 50’
8. The City may recommend buffer averaging for buffers in instances
where it will provide resource protection to a valuable adjacent
upland habitat, or allow for reasonable use of property, provided that
the total buffer area on-site contained in the buffer area remains the
same. Buffer averaging in shoreland areas will be consistent with
buffer averaging requirements in the Wetland Overlay District
(Section 1050.010).
9. If the area of the buffer has a pre-construction slope of 12 percent or
greater, the buffer shall be at the maximum width for the applicant’s
stream classification. The use of a meandering buffer area to maintain
a natural appearance is encouraged, but not required in areas of flat
topography.
Subd. 7. Shoreland Buffer Area Mitigation.
A. Where alteration of a stream buffer area is approved and mitigation is
required, mitigation must result in equal or improved buffer function and
value. Mitigation plans must address water quality protection and
wildlife habitat. The following criteria shall be required for stream buffer
area mitigation:
B. Buffers must be replaced at a 1:1 ratio.
C. Mitigation should always result in equal or improved buffer function and
value. The function and value will include protection of water quality and
provision of wildlife habitat.
D. Mitigation involving the buffer area shall provide landscaping for nesting,
food for wildlife, wildlife cover, and utilize a diversity of native flora
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 185
October 25, 2018
(trees, shrubs, grasses, herbaceous plants) to encourage wildlife
diversity.
E. Stream buffer mitigation should be undertaken on site. If this is not
feasible, mitigation should occur locally within the subwatershed. If this
is not possible, mitigation should occur outside the subwatershed,
elsewhere in the City.
Subd. 8. Vegetation Alterations.
A. Exemptions. Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of
structures and sewage treatment systems, agricultural uses, and the
construction of roads are exempt from the vegetation alternation
standards that follow.
B. Alteration Standards
1. Intensive vegetation clearing such as mowing and cutting within the
shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes is not allowed.
2. In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited clearing
of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is
allowed to provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling
site and to accommodate the placement of stairways and landings,
picnic areas, access paths, livestock watering areas, beach and
watercraft access areas, and permitted water-oriented accessory
structures or facilities, provided that:
a. The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed
from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not
substantially reduced.
b. Along streams, existing shading of water surfaces is preserved;
and
c. The above provisions are not applicable to the removal of trees,
limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards.
Subd. 9. Topographic Alterations, Grading and Filling.
A. Permits. Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the
construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways
under validly issued construction permits for these facilities do not
require the issuance of a separate grading and filling permit. However,
the grading and filling standards in this Section must be incorporated into
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 186
October 25, 2018
the issuance of permits for construction of structures, sewage treatment
systems, and driveways.
B. Standards
1. A grading and filling permit will be required for the movement of
more than 10 cubic yards of material on steep slopes or within shore
and bluff impact zones. A grading and filling permit will be required
for the movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material in a
shoreland area that is outside of steep slope and shore and bluff
impact zones.
2. The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to
during the issuance of construction permits, grading and filling
permits, conditional use permits, variances and subdivision
approvals:
Grading or filling in any wetland is subject to the regulations of the
Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act, reviews or approvals by
other local, state or federal agencies such as a watershed district,
the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, or the United
States Army Corps of Engineers, and the City of Corcoran Wetland
Overlay District (Section 1050.010).
a. The proposed work should be evaluated for its effect on the
following functional values of the wetland: a) sediments and
pollutant trapping and retention; b) storage of surface runoff to
prevent or reduce flood damage; c) fish and wildlife habitat; d)
recreational use; e) shoreline or bank stabilization; or f)
noteworthiness, including special qualities such as historic
significance and critical habitat.
b. Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that
ensures only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for
the shortest time possible.
c. Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for
temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover
must be established as soon as possible.
d. Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before
they reach any surface water feature must be used.
e. Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control
standards consistent with the Minnesota Pollution Control
Agency’s Best Management Practices.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 187
October 25, 2018
f. Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that
creates an unstable slope.
g. Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must be
reviewed by the City Engineer for continued slope stability and
must not create finished slopes of 30 percent or greater.
h. Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public
waters must first be authorized by the Commissioner of Natural
Resources under Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245.
i. Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely
affect adjacent or nearby properties.
j. Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of
the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the
finished slope does not exceed 3 feet horizontal to one foot
vertical, the landward extent of the riprap is within 10 feet of the
ordinary high water level, and the height of the riprap above the
ordinary high water level does not exceed 3 feet.
k. Excavations where the intended purpose is connection to a public
water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors, must be
controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for excavations
may be given only after the commissioner has approved the
proposed connection to public waters.
3. Extractive Use Standards
a. Site Development and Restoration Plan. An extractive use site
development and restoration plan must be developed, approved,
and followed over the course of operation of the site. The plan
must address dust, noise, possible pollutant discharges, hours and
duration of operation, and anticipated vegetation and topographic
alterations. It must also identify actions to be taken during
operation to mitigate adverse environmental impacts, particularly
erosion, and must clearly explain how the site bill be rehabilitated
after extractive activities end.
b. Setbacks for Processing Machinery. Processing machinery must
be located consistent with setback standards for structures from
ordinary high water levels of public waters and from bluffs.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 188
October 25, 2018
Subd. 10. Placement and Design of Roads, Driveways and Parking Areas. Public and
private roads and parking areas must be designed to take advantage of
natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view
from public waters. Documentation must be provided by a qualified
individual that all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to
minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency’s Best Management Practices and the following:
A. Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and
must not be placed within shore and bluff impact zones, when other
reasonable and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives
exist, they may be placed within these areas, and must be designed to
minimize adverse impacts.
B. Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and accessrelated
parking areas may be placed within the shore impact zones
provided the vegetative screening and erosion control conditions of this
subpart are met. For private facilities, the grading and filling provisions
of this Ordinance must be met.
Subd. 11. Stormwater Management.
A. Design and Construction Standards
1. When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetland, and vegetated
soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain
stormwater runoff before discharge to public waters.
2. Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff, velocities, erosion
potential, and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must
be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or
methods used to retain sediment on the site.
3. When development density, topographic features, and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle
stormwater runoff using natural features and vegetation, various
types of constructed facilities, such as diversion, settling basins,
skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used.
Preference must be given to designs using surface drainage,
vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried pipes and man-made
materials and facilities.
4. Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 25 percent of the
lot area.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 189
October 25, 2018
5. When constructed facilities are used for stormwater management,
documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that they
are designed and installed consistent with National Urban Runoff
(NURP) Standards, requirements of the Elm Creek Watershed District,
and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s Best Management
Practices as described in Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas.
6. New constructed stormwater outfalls to public waters must provide
for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface
debris before discharge.
Subd. 12. Agricultural and Forest Management Use Standards.
A. Permitted Uses
General cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture, forestry, truck
farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if steep
slopes and shore impact zones are maintained in permanent vegetation or
operated under an approved conservation plan (Resource Management
Systems) consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and
water conservation districts or the United States Natural Resource
Conservation Service, as provided by a qualified individual or agency. The
shore impact zone for parcels with permitted agricultural land uses is equal
to a line parallel to and 50 feet from the ordinary high water level.
B. Animal Feedlots. Animal feedlots must meet the following standards:
1. New feedlots must not be located in the shoreland of watercourses or
in bluff impact zones, and must meet a minimum setback of 300 feet
from the ordinary high water level of all public waters basins; and
2. Modifications or expansions to existing feedlots that are located
within 300 feet of the ordinary high water level or within a bluff
impact zone are allowed if they do not further encroach into the
existing ordinary high water level setback.
C. Forest Management Standards. The harvesting of timber and associated
reforestation must be conducted consistent with the provisions of the
Minnesota Nonpoint Source Pollution Assessment-Forestry and the
provisions of Water Quality in Forest Management “Best Management
Practices in Minnesota.”
Subd. 13. Administration.
A. Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator is designated by the
City Council to enforce this Ordinance. If he/she finds a violation of the
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 190
October 25, 2018
provisions of this Ordinance, he/she shall notify the person responsible
for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation, and ordering the
action necessary to correct it.
B. Permits Required. A permit is required for the construction of buildings
or building additions (including such related activities as construction of
decks and signs), the installation and/or alteration of sewage treatment
systems, and those grading and filling activities not exempted by Subd. 9
of this Ordinance. Application shall be made to the Zoning Administrator
on forms furnished by him/her and shall include the following where
applicable: plans drawn to scale, showing the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the lot; existing or proposed structures, fill,
or storage of materials; and the location of the foregoing in relation to the
stream channel.
C. State and Federal Permits. Prior to granting a permit or processing an
application for a Conditional Use Permit or Variance, the Zoning
Administrator shall determine that the applicant has obtained all
necessary State and Federal Permits.
D. Nonconforming Sewage Treatment System. Whenever a permit or
variance authorizes any improvement on, or new use of, a property in the
shoreland district, it will require reconstruction of any existing
nonconforming sewage system on the property to meet or exceed
applicable rules of the Minnesota Department of Health, the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency, specifically Chapter 7080 for individual sewage
treatment systems, and any applicable local government standards. The
City of Corcoran will notify landowners in shore impact zones about this
requirement, and will also encourage property owners to evaluate their
sewage treatment systems and voluntarily upgrade systems that are
nonconforming.
E. Variances
1. Variances may only be granted in accordance with Minnesota
Statutes, Chapter 462, as applicable. A variance may not circumvent
the general purposes and intent of this Ordinance. No variance may
be granted that would allow any use that is prohibited in the zoning
district in which the subject property is located. Conditions may be
imposed in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance and to
protect adjacent properties and the public interest. In considering a
variance request, the City Council must also consider whether the
property owner has reasonable use of the land without the variance,
whether the property is used seasonally or year-round, whether the
variance is being requested solely on the basis of economic
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 191
October 25, 2018
considerations, and the characteristics of development of adjacent
properties.
2. The City Council shall hear and decide requests for variances in
accordance with the rules that it has adopted for the conduct of
business. When a variance is approved after the Department of
Natural Resources has formally recommended denial in the hearing
record, the notification of the approved variance required in Section F
below shall also include the board of adjustment’s summary of the
public record/testimony and the findings of facts and conclusions
which supported the issuance of the variance.
3. For existing developments, the application for variance must clearly
demonstrate whether a conforming sewage treatment system is
present for the intended use of the property. The variance, if issued,
must require reconstruction of a nonconforming sewage treatment
system.
F. Notifications to the Department of Natural Resources
1. Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances,
Zoning Ordinance amendments, zoning map amendments or
conditional uses under local shoreland management controls must be
sent to the Commissioner of Natural Resources, or the
Commissioner’s designated representative and postmarked at least
10 days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to consider proposed
subdivisions/plats must include copies of the subdivision/plat.
2. A copy of approved Zoning Ordinance amendments and
subdivisions/plats, and final decisions granting variances or
conditional uses under local shoreland management controls must be
sent to the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designated
representative and postmarked within 10 days of final action.
Subd. 14. Nonconformities.
A. Existing Nonconformities
1. All legally established nonconformities as of the date of this Ordinance
may continue, but they will be managed according to applicable State
statutes and other regulations of this community for the subjects of
alterations and additions, repairs after damage, discontinuance of use
and intensification of use.
2. Lots of record in the office of the County recorder on the date of
enactment of local shoreland controls that do not meet the
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 192
October 25, 2018
requirements of this Ordinance may be allowed as building sites
without variance from lot size requirements provided the use is
permitted in the zoning district, the lot has been in separate
ownership from abutting lands at all times since it became
substandard, was created compliant with official controls in effect at
the time, and sewage treatment and setback requirements of this
Ordinance are met.
B. Variance from Setback Requirements. A variance from setback
requirements must be obtained before any use, sewage treatment system,
or building permit is issued for a lot. In evaluating the variance, the board
of adjustment shall consider sewage treatment and water supply
capabilities or constraints of the lot, and shall deny the variance if
adequate facilities cannot be provided.
C. Contiguous Lots. If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the
same ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of
this Ordinance, the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel of land
for the purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with
the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land,
each meeting the requirements of this Ordinance as much as possible.
D. Additions or Expansions
1. Additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an existing
nonconforming structure must meet the setback, height and other
requirements of this Ordinance. Any deviation from these
requirements must be authorized by a variance.
2. Deck additions may be allowed without a variance to a structure not
meeting the required setback from the ordinary high water level if all
of the following criteria and standards are met:
a. The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were
established.
b. A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no
reasonable location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing
ordinary high water level setback of the structure.
c. The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level does
not exceed 15 percent of the existing setback of the structure from
the ordinary high water level or does not encroach closer than 30
feet, whichever is more restrictive.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 193
October 25, 2018
d. The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed or
screened.

1050.030 – FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT
Subd. 1. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purpose
A. Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in
Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the
responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses.
B. Purpose.
1. This ordinance regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the
City of Corcoran. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic
inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of this ordinance to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare by minimizing
these losses and disruptions.
2. National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This ordinance is
adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National
Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations
Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility
in the National Flood Insurance Program.
3. This ordinance is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics
and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate
flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil
erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and
economic development.
Subd. 2. General Provisions.
A. How to Use This Ordinance. This ordinance adopts the floodplain maps
applicable to the City of Corcoran and includes three floodplain districts:
Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Floodplain.
1. Where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are delineated on the
floodplain maps, the standards in Subd. 4 or Subd. 5 will apply,
depending on the location of a property.
2. Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are not
delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the
General Floodplain district. Within the General Floodplain district, the

Floodway District standards in Subd. 4 apply unless the floodway
boundary is determined, according to the process outlined in Subd. 6.
Once the floodway boundary is determined, the Flood Fringe District
standards in Subd. 5 may apply outside the floodway.
B. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies. This ordinance applies to all lands
within the jurisdiction of the City of Corcoran shown on the Official
Zoning Map and/or the attachments to the map as being located within
the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Floodplain
Districts.
1. The Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Floodplain Districts are
overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts.
The standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any
other requirements in this ordinance. In case of a conflict, the more
restrictive standards will apply.
C. Incorporation of Maps by Reference. The following maps together with all
attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a
part of the Official Zoning Map and this ordinance. The attached material
includes the Flood Insurance Study for Hennepin County, Minnesota, and
Incorporated Areas, dated November 4, 2016 and the Flood Insurance
Rate Map panels enumerated below, dated November 4, 2016, all

D. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. The regulatory flood protection
elevation (RFPE) is an elevation no lower than two feet above the
elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation
caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation
of a floodway.
E. Interpretation. The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by
scaling distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
1. Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the
official zoning map and actual field conditions, the flood elevations
shall be the governing factor. The Zoning Administrator must
interpret the boundary location based on the ground elevations that
existed on the site on the date of the first National Flood Insurance
Program map showing the area within the regulatory floodplain, and
other available technical data.
2. Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given
a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the City Council
acting in its capacity as the Board of Adjustment and Appeals and to
submit technical evidence.
F. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this ordinance
to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or other
private agreements. However, where this ordinance imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
G. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. This ordinance does not imply that
areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such
districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance does
not create liability on the part of the City of Corcoran or its officers or
employees for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

H. Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this ordinance
is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the remainder of
this ordinance shall not be affected and shall remain in full force.
I. Definitions. Unless specifically defined in Section 1020.020 (Floodplain
Related Definitions) of this ordinance, words or phrases used in this
ordinance must be interpreted according to common usage and so as to
give this ordinance its most reasonable application.

3. Accessory Structures. Accessory structures, as identified in Subd. 4. C.
1, may be permitted, provided that:
a. structures are not intended for human habitation;
b. structures will have a low flood damage potential;
c. structures will be constructed an placed so as to offer a minimal
obstruction to the flow of flood waters;
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 200
October 25, 2018
d. Service utilities, such as electrical and heating equipment, within
these structures must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation or properly floodproofed;

in accordance with the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classifications in
the State Building Code. All floodproofed structures must be
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls.
f. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet
floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the
State Building Code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a
minimal investment and does not exceed 576 square feet in size.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
criteria:
(i) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside
walls of the structure, with a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding; and
(ii) There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure
and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot
above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not
satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
4. Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current
or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters are subject to
the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245.
5. A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must not cause
an increase to the 1% chance or regional flood. The technical analysis
must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a
stream.
6. Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary

October 25, 2018
A. Permitted Uses. Permitted uses are those uses of land or structures
allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the
standards in Subd. 5. B.
B. Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses.
1. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill
so that the lowest floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures must be
no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation and the fill must extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet
beyond the outside limits of the structure.
2. Accessory Structures. As an alternative to the fill requirements of
Subd. 5. B. 1, structures accessory to the uses identified in Subd. 5. A
may be permitted to be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4
floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code, provided that:
a. The accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does
not exceed 576 square feet in size, and is only used for parking and
storage.
b. All portions of floodproofed accessory structures below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation must be:
i. adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls,
ii. be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage,
and
iii. must have all service utilities be water-tight or elevated to
above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
c. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
criteria:
i. To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside
walls of the structure, with a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding; and
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 202
October 25, 2018
ii. There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure
and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot
above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not
satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
3. The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel must
not exceed 1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended to
elevate a structure in accordance with Subd. 5. B. 1 of this ordinance,
or if allowed as a conditional use under Subd. 5. C. 3 below.
4. The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill to
the regulatory flood protection elevation.
5. All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or watertight
to prevent infiltration of floodwaters.
6. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding,
flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.

protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method.
8. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an
elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood
protection elevation, or must have a flood warning /emergency
evacuation plan acceptable to the City Council.
9. Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks and parking lots may be
at an elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation.
However, any facilities used by employees or the general public must
be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time
for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such
that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second)
would exceed a product of four upon occurrence of the regional (1%
chance) flood.
10. Interference with normal manufacturing/industrial plant operations
must be minimized, especially along streams having protracted flood
durations. In considering permit applications, due consideration must
be given to the needs of industries with operations that require a
floodplain location.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 203
October 25, 2018
11. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the
standards of Subd. 9 of this ordinance.
C. Conditional Uses. The following uses and activities may be allowed as
conditional uses, if allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any

conditional uses.
2. Basements, as defined by Section 1020.020 of this ordinance,
Floodplain Related Definitions, are subject to the following:
a. Residential basement construction is not allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
b. Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally
dry floodproofed in accordance with Subd. 5. D. 3 of this
ordinance.
3. All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation must be
floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing
classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry
floodproofing must meet the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classification
in the State Building Code, which requires making the structure
watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 204
October 25, 2018
water and with structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
4. The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar
material on a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a
structure to the regulatory flood protection elevation) must comply
with an approved erosion/sedimentation control plan.
a. The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the
fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the regional (1%
chance) flood event.
b. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to
the City Council.
c. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of
the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time
exists.
5. Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood
protection elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan
providing for removal of such materials within the time available after
a flood warning.
6. (OPTIONAL) Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill
may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The base or floor of an enclosed
area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure’s basement
or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one
side of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally flood and is
constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted
alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional
standards:
a. Design and Certification - The structure’s design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the
State Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating,
ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other
service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from
entering or accumulating within these components during times of
flooding.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 205
October 25, 2018
b. Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas - Above-grade,
fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages
must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must
stipulate:
i. The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall
be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the
structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher
than one foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a
minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a
registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a
smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be
equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
ii. That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP3 or FP4 classifications in
the State Building Code and shall be used solely for building
access, parking of vehicles or storage.
Subd. 6. General Floodplain District (GF)
A. Permitted Uses.
1. The uses listed in Subd. 4. A of this ordinance, Floodway District
Permitted Uses, are permitted uses.
2. All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation
criteria specified in Subd. 6. B below. Subd. 4 applies if the proposed
use is determined to be in the Floodway District. Subd. 5 applies if the
proposed use is determined to be in the Flood Fringe District.
B. Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations.
1. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within
the General Floodplain District, the Zoning Administrator must obtain,
review and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and
floodway data available from a federal, state or other source.
2. If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available,
the applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to
determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the
proposed use would fall within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 206
October 25, 2018
Information must be consistent with accepted hydrological and
hydraulic engineering standards and the standards in Subd. 6. B. 3
below.
3. The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the
following components, as applicable:
a. Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance) flood.
b. Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank
areas.
c. Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half (0.5)
foot. A lesser stage increase than 0.5 foot is required if, as a result
of the stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An
equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within
the reach must be assumed in computing floodway boundaries.
4. The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information and
assess the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway
and/or Flood Fringe District boundary. The assessment must include
the cumulative effects of previous floodway encroachments. The
Zoning Administrator may seek technical assistance from a
designated engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources. Based on this assessment, the
Zoning Administrator may approve or deny the application.
5. Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been
determined, the Zoning Administrator must process the permit
application consistent with the applicable provisions of Subd. 4 and 5
of this ordinance.
Subd. 7. Land Development Standards.
A. Recognizing that flood prone areas may exist outside of the designated
floodplain districts, the requirements of this section apply to all land
within the City of Corcoran.
B. No land may be subdivided which is unsuitable for reasons of flooding or

prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified individual, and must
demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the
evacuation.
E. For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe
District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the
required elevation of all access roads must be clearly labeled on all
required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
F. In the General Floodplain District, applicants must provide the
information required in Subd. 6. B of this ordinance to determine the
regional flood elevation, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District
boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation for the
subdivision site.
G. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood
prone area, any such proposal must be reviewed to assure that:
1. All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage within the flood prone area,
2. All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate

Administrator prior to conducting the following activities:
a. The erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation or alteration of
any building, structure or portion thereof. Normal maintenance
and repair also requires a permit if such work, separately or in
conjunction with other planned work, constitutes a substantial
improvement as defined in this ordinance.
b. The use or change of use of a building, structure or land.
c. The construction of a dam, fence or on-site septic system, although
a permit is not required for a farm fence as defined in this
ordinance.
d. The change or extension of a nonconforming use.
e. The repair of a structure that has been damaged by flood, fire,
tornado or any other source.
f. The placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of
materials or equipment within the floodplain.
g. Relocation or alteration of a watercourse (including new or
replacement culverts and bridges), unless a public waters work
permit has been applied for.
h. Any other type of “development” as defined in this ordinance.
2. Application for Permit. Permit applications must be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator on forms provided by the Zoning Administrator.
The permit application must include the following as applicable:
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 211
October 25, 2018
a. A site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, existing or proposed
buildings, structures and significant natural features having an
influence on the permit.
b. Location of fill or storage of materials in relation to the stream
channel.
c. Copies of any required municipal, county, state or federal permits
or approvals.
d. Other relevant information requested by the Zoning Administrator
as necessary to properly evaluate the permit application.
3. Certificate of Zoning Compliance for a New, Altered, or
Nonconforming Use. No building, land or structure may be occupied
or used in any manner until a certificate of zoning compliance has
been issued by the Zoning Administrator stating that the use of the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this ordinance.
4. Certification. The applicant is required to submit certification by a
registered professional engineer, registered architect or registered
land surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance.
Floodproofing measures must be certified by a registered professional
engineer or registered architect.
5. Record of First Floor Elevation. The Zoning Administrator must
maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including
basement) of all new structures and alterations or additions to
existing structures in the floodplain. The Zoning Administrator must
also maintain a record of the elevation to which structures and
alterations or additions to structures are floodproofed.
6. Notifications for Watercourse Alterations. Before authorizing any
alteration or relocation of a river or stream, the Zoning Administrator
must notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has applied for a
permit to work in public waters pursuant to Minnesota Statutes,
Section 103G.245, this will suffice as adequate notice. A copy of the
notification must also be submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
7. Notification to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase or Decrease
Base Flood Elevations. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such supporting information becomes available,
the Zoning Administrator must notify the Chicago Regional Office of
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 212
October 25, 2018
FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy of the relevant technical or
scientific data.
C. Variances.
1. Variance Applications. An application for a variance to the provisions
of this ordinance will be processed and reviewed in accordance with
applicable state statutes and Section 1070.040 of the Zoning
Ordinance.
2. Adherence to State Floodplain Management Standards. A variance
must not allow a use that is not allowed in that district, permit a lower
degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection
elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than those
required by state law.
3. Additional Variance Criteria. The following additional variance
criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be
satisfied:
a. Variances must not be issued by a community within any
designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
b. Variances may only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing
of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to
grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
c. Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
4. Flood Insurance Notice. The Zoning Administrator must notify the
applicant for a variance that: 1) The issuance of a variance to
construct a structure below the base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as
$25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and 2) Such construction below
the base or regional flood level increases risks to life and property.
Such notification must be maintained with a record of all variance
actions.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 213
October 25, 2018
5. General Considerations. The community may consider the following
factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances
and conditional uses in floodplains:
a. The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments;
b. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others;
c. The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the
ability of these systems to minimize the potential for disease,
contamination and unsanitary conditions;
d. The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
e. The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use
to the community;
f. The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
g. The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding;
h. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
i. The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Land
Use Plan and floodplain management program for the area;
j. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
k. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
6. Submittal of Hearing Notices to the Department of Natural Resources
(DNR). The Zoning Administrator must submit hearing notices for
proposed variances to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at
least ten days’ notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by
electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist.
7. Submittal of Final Decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions
granting variances must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of
such action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to
the respective DNR area hydrologist.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 214
October 25, 2018
8. Record-Keeping. The Zoning Administrator must maintain a record of
all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and must
report such variances in an annual or biennial report to the
Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program, when
requested by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
D. Conditional Uses.
1. Administrative Review. An application for a conditional use permit
under the provisions of this ordinance will be processed and reviewed
in accordance with Section 1070.020 of the Zoning Ordinance.
2. Factors Used in Decision-Making. In passing upon conditional use
applications, the City Council must consider all relevant factors
specified in other sections of this ordinance, and those factors
identified in Subd. 10. C. 5 of this ordinance.
3. Conditions Attached to Conditional Use Permits. The City Council may
attach such conditions to the granting of conditional use permits as it
deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this ordinance. Such
conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:

b. Limitations on period of use, occupancy and operation.
c. Imposition of operational controls, sureties and deed restrictions.
d. Requirements for construction of channel modifications,
compensatory storage, dikes, levees and other protective
measures.
e. Floodproofing measures, in accordance with the State Building
Code and this ordinance. The applicant must submit a plan or
document certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the
regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood factors
for the particular area.
4. Submittal of Hearing Notices to the Department of Natural Resources
(DNR). The Zoning Administrator must submit hearing notices for
proposed conditional uses to the DNR sufficiently in advance to
provide at least ten days’ notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent
by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist.
Section 1050 (Overlay Districts) Page 215
October 25, 2018
5. Submittal of Final Decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions
granting conditional uses must be forwarded to the DNR within ten
days of such action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S.

requirements for required landscaping.
Subd. 2. Required Landscaping and Maintenance. Prior to approval of a building
permit, all semi-public, non-residence uses, and residential developments of
four units or more, shall be subject to a mandatory landscape plan and
specification requirements. Residential developments of less than 4 units
shall not require a landscape plan but shall be required to install a minimum
number of trees as outlined in this Section, item G.
A. The landscape plan shall be developed with an emphasis upon the
boundary or perimeter of the proposed site at points adjoining other
property and the immediate perimeter of the structure.
B. Required Ground Cover. The lot area remaining after providing for offstreet
parking, off-street loading, sidewalks, driveways, building site
and/or other requirements shall be sodded or seeded and mulched
within 30 days of building occupancy or a financial guarantee shall be
provided to guarantee said installation.
C. Required Plantings. In addition to required ground cover specified in
Subd. 2(B) above and exclusive of required buffering or screening, all new
development shall be landscaped using ornamental grass, shrubs, trees or
other acceptable vegetation or treatment generally used in landscaping
within one year following the date of building occupancy. Where
landscaping is required as part of City approvals, any plant material that
is diseased or dies shall be replaced with a like kind of the original size.
No landscaped area shall be used for the parking of vehicles or for the
storage or display of materials, supplies or merchandise, unless
specifically approved by the City.

overstory trees may be substituted with the use of understory trees in
combination with other design elements. In such cases, not less than
3 understory trees shall be provided for each one required overstory
tree substituted.
4. At the sole discretion of the City, a portion of the total number of
required trees for any development may be planted at a public
location when it is determined by the City that site constraints or
existing vegetation limit the ability to plant on site. Cash fees based
on the estimated cost of materials and installation of required
materials may be substituted for public location planting at the
discretion of the City.

accomplished with the existing topography where possible. When the
existing topography prohibits effective screening, berming may be
used.
a. Planting screens are the preferred method of screening. The
planting screen shall consist of hardy trees that will provide a
minimum of 80 percent opacity year-round. Planting screens shall
contain a mix of overstory and understory plantings and a mix of
deciduous and coniferous materials.
b. Fences or walls may be used in conjunction with landscaping to
provide screening. When required for screening, minimum of 80
percent opacity shall be provided. No landscaping or screening
shall interfere with driver or pedestrian visibility for vehicles
entering or exiting the premises.

1060.100 – TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES
Subd. 1. Findings.
The City Council finds: The Federal Communications Act of 1934 as amended
by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“the Act”), and subsequent
revisions, grants the Federal Communications Commission exclusive
jurisdiction over the regulation of the environmental effects of radio
frequency emissions from telecommunications facilities and the regulation of
radio signal interference among users of the radio frequency spectrum.
Consistent with the Act, the regulation of towers and telecommunications
facilities in the City is not intended to have the effect of prohibiting any
person from providing wireless telecommunications services. The general
purpose of this subsection is to regulate the placement, construction and
modification of telecommunication towers and related facilities in order to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while not unreasonably
interfering with the development of the competitive wireless
telecommunications marketplace in the City. Specifically, the purposes of
this Ordinance are:
A. To regulate the location of telecommunication towers and facilities.
B. To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts
of telecommunication towers and facilities.
Section 1060 (Performance Standards) Page 242
October 25, 2018
C. To minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunication towers and
facilities through design, siting, landscaping, and innovative camouflaging
techniques.
D. To promote and encourage shared use and co-location of
telecommunication towers and antenna support structures.
E. To avoid damage to adjacent properties caused by telecommunication
towers and facilities by ensuring that those structures are soundly and
carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained and promptly
removed when no longer used or when determined to be structurally
unsound.
F. To ensure that telecommunication towers and facilities are compatible
with surround land uses.
G. To facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunications services to the
residents and businesses of the City in an orderly fashion.
Subd. 2. Development of Towers; Approvals Required.
A. Conditional use. A tower is a conditional use in specified zoning districts
within the City. A tower may not be constructed in those districts unless
a conditional use permit has been issued by, and site plan approval
obtained from, the City Council, and the building official has issued a
building permit.
B. Administrative Permit. Co-location of additional antennas onto an
existing tower and associated ground equipment may be granted by
administrative permit. An administrative permit may be issued by City
staff in accordance with the requirements of Section 1070.060 of the
Zoning Ordinance.
C. Preferred Locations. If co-location is not feasible, the preference for
location of new towers within the City is, in order of priority:
1. Existing public property.
2. Agricultural property.
3. Commercial/industrial property.
D. Applicant must demonstrate in writing, to the City’s satisfaction, that a
lower priority site location is necessary as part of the application. The
City has no obligation to allow the use of City property for this purpose.
Section 1060 (Performance Standards) Page 243
October 25, 2018
Subd. 3. Application Process.
A. A person desiring to construct a tower must submit an application for site
plan approval and, for a conditional use permit, to the City Planner.
B. An application to develop a tower must include:
1. Name, address and telephone number of the applicant.
2. Name, address and telephone numbers of the owners of the property

3. Written consent of the property owner(s) to the application.
4. Written evidence from an engineer that the proposed structure meets
the structural requirements of this code.
5. Written information demonstrating the need for the tower at the
proposed site in light of the existing and proposed wireless
telecommunications network(s) to be operated by persons intending
to place telecommunications facilities on the tower.
6. A copy of relevant portions of a lease signed by the applicant and
property owner(s), requiring the applicant to remove the tower and
associated telecommunications facilities upon cessation of operations
on the leased site, or, if a lease does not yet exist, a written agreement
to include such a provision in the lease to be signed.
7. An application fee established from time to time by resolution of the
City Council.
8. Any other information that City Staff, Planning Commission or Council
deem necessary to consideration of the application.
C. Administrative Costs and Expenses. In addition to the application fee, the
applicant shall be responsible to pay for all administrative costs incurred
by the City in their review process, including staff administrative time,
legal, engineering, and any other consultant or expert fees deemed
necessary by the City. The City, in its discretion may hire experts to assist
in its review of any application and the applicant shall pay the cost of
such expertise.
D. Council Action. Requests for site plan approval and conditional use
permit approval will be processed contemporaneously, according to the
provisions outlined in the Corcoran Zoning Ordinance.
Section 1060 (Performance Standards) Page 244
October 25, 2018
E. Staff Action. Request for site plan approval and administrative permit for
co-location onto existing towers or structures will be processed
contemporaneously, according to the provisions outlined in the Corcoran
Zoning Ordinance.
Subd. 4. Performance Standards.
A. Co-location capability. All equipment used for transmitting or receiving
telecommunication, television, or radio signals shall be co-located on
existing towers whenever possible. Unless the applicant presents clear
and convincing evidence to the City Council that co-location is not
feasible, a new tower may not be built, constructed or erected in the City
unless the tower is capable of supporting at least two
telecommunications facilities comparable in weight, size, and surface area
to each other.
B. Setback Requirements. All towers and accessory equipment must comply
with the following minimum setback requirements:
1. Towers and accessory equipment shall meet the setbacks of the
underlying zoning district. The tower may not encroach upon any
easements.
2. The tower shall be setback from the nearest residential structure at
least the height of the tower. Exceptions to such setback may be
granted if a qualified structural engineer specifies in writing that any
collapse of the pole will occur within a lesser distance under all
foreseeable circumstances.
3. The setback for a tower or accessory equipment may be reduced or its
location in relation to a public street varied, at the discretion of the
City, to allow the integration of the structure into an existing or
proposed structure, such as a light standard, power line support
device, or similar structure.
4. Setback requirements for towers are measured from the base of the
tower to the property line of the parcel on which it is located.
C. Engineer Certification. Towers must be designed and certified by an
engineer to be structurally sound and in conformance with the Uniform
Building Code, and any other standards set forth in this code.
D. Height Restriction. A tower may not exceed 150 feet in height.
Measurement of tower height must include the tower structure itself, the
Section 1060 (Performance Standards) Page 245
October 25, 2018
base pad, and any other telecommunications facilities attached thereto.
Tower height is measured from grade.
E. Lighting. Towers may not be artificially lighted except as required by the
Federal Aviation Administration. At time of construction of a tower, in
cases where there are residential uses located within a distance which is
three times the height of the tower from the tower, dual mode lighting
must be requested from the Federal Aviation Administration.
Notwithstanding this provision, the City may approve the placement of an
antennae on an existing or proposed lighting standard, provided that the
antennae is integrated with the lighting standard.
F. Exterior Finish. Towers not requiring Federal Aviation Administration
painting or marking must have an exterior finish as approved in the site
plan.
G. Fencing. Fences constructed around or upon parcels containing towers,
antenna support structures, or telecommunications facilities must be
constructed in accordance with the applicable fencing requirements in
the zoning district where the tower or antenna support structure is
located, unless more stringent fencing requirements are required by
Federal Communications Commission regulations.
H. Landscaping. Landscaping on parcels containing towers, antenna support
structures or telecommunications facilities must be in accordance with
landscaping requirements as approved in the site plan. Ground mounted
equipment must be screened from view by suitable vegetation, except
where a design of non-vegetative screening better reflects and
complements the character of the surrounding neighborhood.
I. Accessory Buildings and Equipment. No more than one accessory
building is permitted per user on a tower. Accessory buildings may be no
more than 400 square feet in size. Utility buildings and structures
accessory to a tower must be architecturally designed to blend in with the
surrounding environment and to meet such setback requirements as are
compatible with the actual placement of the tower. Accessory structures
shall comply with the building design and material standards of the
district in which they are located. Telecommunications facilities not
located on a tower or in an accessory building must be of stealth design.
J. Security. Towers must be reasonably posted and secured to protect
against trespass. All signs must comply with applicable sign regulations.
K. Design. Towers must be of stealth design, if practical.
Section 1060 (Performance Standards) Page 246
October 25, 2018
L. Removal of Towers. Abandoned or unused towers and associated aboveground
facilities must be removed within twelve months of the cessation
of operations of the telecommunications facility at the site unless an
extension is approved by the City Council. Any tower and associated
telecommunications facilities that are not removed within twelve months
of the cessation of operations at a site are declared to be public nuisances
and may be removed by the City and costs of removal assessed against
the property pursuant to the nuisance abatement Section of the Corcoran
City Code.
Inspections. The City may conduct inspections at any time, upon
reasonable notice to the property owner and the tower owner to
inspect the tower for the purpose of determining if it complies with the
Uniform Building Code and other construction standards provided by
the City Code, federal and state law. The expense related to such
inspections will be borne by the property owner. Based upon the
results of an inspection, the building official may require repair or
removal of a tower.
M. Maintenance. Towers must be maintained in accordance with the
following provisions.
1. Tower owners must employ ordinary and reasonable care in
construction and use commonly accepted methods and devices for
preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage,
injuries, or nuisances to the public.
2. Tower owners must install and maintain towers, telecommunications
facilities, wires, cables, fixtures and other equipment in compliance
with the requirements of the National Electric Safety code and all
Federal Communications Commission, State, and local regulations,
and in such a manner that they will not interfere with the use of other
property.
3. Towers, telecommunications facilities or antenna support structures
must be kept and maintained in good condition, order, and repair.
4. Maintenance or construction on a tower, telecommunications facilities
or antenna support structure must be performed by qualified
maintenance and construction personnel.
5. Towers must comply with radio frequency emissions standards of the
Federal Communications Commission.
Section 1060 (Performance Standards) Page 247
October 25, 2018
6. If the tower owner discontinues the use of a tower, the tower owner
must provide written notice to the City of its intent to discontinue use
and the date when the use will be discontinued.
Subd. 5. Variances.
An applicant may request a variance to the setback, separation, buffer
requirements, or maximum height provisions of this Code in accordance with
the procedures outlined for the granting of a variance in the Corcoran City
Code. The City Council may grant the requested variance if the applicant
demonstrates with written or other satisfactory evidence that:
A. The locations, shape, appearance or nature of use of the proposed tower
will not substantially detract from the aesthetics of the area nor change
the character of the neighborhood in which the tower is proposed to be
located.
B. The variance will not create a threat to the public health, safety or
welfare.
C. In the case of a requested modification to the setback requirement, that
the size of parcel upon which the tower is proposed to be located makes
compliance impossible, and the only alternative for the applicant is to
locate the tower at another site that poses a greater threat to the public
health, safety or welfare or is closer in proximity to a residentially zoned
land.
D. In the case of a request for modification of separation requirements, if the
person provides written technical evidence from an engineer that the
proposed tower and telecommunications facilities must be located at the
proposed site in order to meet the coverage needs of the applicant’s
wireless communications system and if the person agrees to create
approved landscaping and other buffers to screen the tower from being
visible to the residential area.
E. In the case of a request for modification of the maximum height limit, that
the modification is necessary to:
1. Facilitates co-location of telecommunications facilities in order to
avoid construction of a new tower.
2. To meet the coverage requirements of the applicant’s wireless
communications system, which requirements must be documented
with written, technical evidence from a recognized expert in the
telecommunications industry.

portion of the financial guarantee as is attributable to such completed
work. Landscaping improvements shall not be deemed complete until the
City has verified survivability of all required plantings through one winter

Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for the inspection of the
improvements to determine that the useful life of all work performed
meets the average standards for the particular industry, profession, or
material used in the performance of the work. Any required work failing
to meet such standards shall not be deemed to be complete and the
applicant shall be notified in writing as to required corrections. Upon
determination that the work has been completed, including the winter
season survivability of all landscape improvements, a notice of the date of
actual completion shall be given to the applicant and appropriate action,
to release or to reduce the amount of the financial guarantee shall be
taken by the Zoning Administrator.
Subd. 10. Minnesota State Building Code. The review and approval of site
improvements pursuant to the requirements of City adopted building and
fire codes shall be in addition to the site plan review process established
under this Section. The site plan approval process does not imply
compliance with the requirements of these building and fire codes.
Subd. 11. Plan Agreements. All site and construction plans officially submitted to the
City shall be treated as a formal agreement between the building contractor
and the City. Once approved, no changes, modifications or alterations shall

APPENDIX A (Design Guidelines) Page A-1
October 25, 2018
APPENDIX A - Design Guidelines
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OVERALL DESIGN STANDARDS
Objectives
The objective for developing design guidelines for the City of Corcoran is to establish:
• A clear definition of urban design objectives that informs citizens, developers, and
decision-makers.
• A tool that designers can use to incorporate general and specific approaches and
techniques in their plans that will achieve City design objectives.
• A basis for uniform and consistent review of development proposals by the City
Council and Planning Commission.
The Corcoran General Design Guidelines should meet the following goals:
Goal 1: Preserve the unique, rural character of Corcoran.
Goal 2: Establish a consistent, high quality baseline design standard for all districts.
Goal 3: Maintain a high quality, harmonious visual environment.
Goal 4: Communicate the community's expectations for new development in Corcoran.
Application
The design guidelines are intended to be applied in all districts where a District Plan has
been developed. These guidelines are designed to be complimentary to the District Plans,
the existing Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Map, and Zoning Ordinances. Illustrations
have been included to further explain the design guideline intent.
Organization
The District Plans and Design Guidelines begin with General Design Guidelines which apply
across all districts. This general Section is followed by the District Design Guidelines and
District Plans which are specific to the three districts in the City of Corcoran – Southwest,
Northeast and Southeast. District Design Guidelines are applied in addition to the General
Design Guidelines, and address unique conditions or uses in that District. The Southwest,
Northeast, and Southeast District Plans accompany the Design Guidelines for each District.
These build on the concepts identified in the Comprehensive Plan.
The Southeast District Plan and Design Guidelines also include the Downtown Illustrative
Plan and Downtown Design Guidelines which are also applied in addition to the General
Design Guidelines and the Southeast District Design Guidelines.
APPENDIX A (Design Guidelines) Page A-2
October 25, 2018
GENERAL DESIGN GUIDELINES
Recommendations for Overall Design Standards
General
• All new development should be designed to value, respect and preserve Corcoran’s
identified natural features and resource corridors.
• Rural view sheds and identified view corridors should be preserved and maintained
wherever possible as important contributors to Corcoran’s character.
• All new development should provide for pedestrian as well as vehicle circulation,
and shall create links to existing and proposed sidewalks and trails.
• All new development should be sensitive to existing residences in the design and
location of new uses and buildings with respect to shading, viewsheds, and potential
light and noise pollution. Where necessary, appropriate screening or buffering shall
be provided.
• New business parks should not be designed only for larger businesses, but should
also accommodate the small and mid-sized businesses that enhance Corcoran’s
rural community.
Streets, Public Space and Amenities
• All arterial roads should have a minimum 100-foot setback to preserve a rural road
character. This area shall be maintained as a natural buffer preserving mature trees
and shrubs, with native grasses and wildflowers encouraged.
• Along County Road 116 a rural greenway is proposed with trails and amenities.
New development along this route will be required to continue the greenway
throughout Corcoran based on the City’s design.
• Key intersections have been identified as primary entrances to Corcoran and should
be designed as “gateways” to the City; gateway elements could include open space,
unique landscaping, walls or gates, City identity signage and water features.
• Direct access for new developments should be restricted on Highway 55 and County
Roads 101 and 116; driveways serving only one parcel or use should be prohibited
along these roads.
• Direct access from County Road 30 and the new alignment of County Road 50
should be limited. Driveways serving only one parcel or use are highly discouraged
in along these roads.
APPENDIX A (Design Guidelines) Page A-3
October 25, 2018
• Through roads with connections to existing roads are encouraged; streets with culde-
sacs should be limited.
• All residential development should seek to preserve and maintain some natural
open space; larger developments will be required to designate common areas for
residents shared use and/or to identify and preserve land for a neighborhood park.
Site Planning and Development
• Well-landscaped open areas should be provided at the main road entryway to new
developments; gateway or welcoming design elements, including water or
landscape features, signage and lighting are encouraged.
• Preserve and maintain identified natural resource areas, existing healthy areas of
native vegetation, mature trees, wetlands, ponds, and other natural features to the
extent possible; design which harmonizes more groomed and landscaped areas with
more natural landscape is encouraged.

• Site design that integrates identity signage and lighting into the landscape is
encouraged.
• Provide for both private and common or public open spaces; connections from open
spaces to existing or proposed trails and sidewalk networks are encouraged.
• Limit parking provided between buildings and the main road; distribute parking
around the building, especially to the side and back of buildings.
• Parking areas should be well-landscaped and screened from the street; larger
parking areas should be planned with internal landscaping and divided into smaller
areas where possible.
• Buildings should be oriented to minimize views of service areas, loading docks and
equipment from the street and other developments; these views can be buffered
with a combination of landscaping and screening; trash areas should not be visible
from the street; where this is not possible they must be fully screened and buffered
to mitigate the noise and visual impacts.

• Stormwater ponds, dry ponds and other stormwater management or holding areas
shall be designed to be attractive in both flooded and dry conditions; use of native
plants for filtration around pond and wetlands is encouraged.
• Sustainable design approaches to site and landscape design, especially for storm
water management and water shed quality is encouraged.
• All landscaping shall preserve and enhance natural features (such as wetlands,
drainage ways, mature stands of trees, and the like), enhance architectural features,
strengthen vistas and important amenities and provide shade.
Architecture
• Buildings should be constructed and maintained for permanence and longevity –
durable, maintainable materials should be used; temporary buildings, metal sheds,
etc. shall not be permitted except when allowed as accessory buildings.
• Buildings should be designed to relate well to the existing environment, both
natural and man-made, and consider context in massing, materials, style and color.
• Design of the landscape and hardscape should be coordinated and harmonious with
the building design and materials.
• Multi-family buildings should be designed to provide both private and common
outside space and units with terraces, balconies or other private exterior space are
encouraged. Orientation of building and unit entrances, windows, garages, etc.
should be considered for visual and acoustic privacy.
• Buildings should be oriented and designed to consider sun and shade, wind
exposure and snow drifting to avoid creating icy or dangerous conditions.
Swales planted as a rain garden; plants
and soil provide filtration

• Building entries should be visible from the main street or entry route, and
distinguished from the building façade; entrance areas should be well lit, covered or
protected from weather, and include significant glazing and glass doors where the
public will be entering buildings.
• Buildings should be designed with quality materials on all sides; all facades shall be
articulated with a variety of materials, glazing or other details to add visual interest,
although the front façade may have a unique design or more significant glazing; long
blank exterior surfaces shall be avoided.

District Design Guidelines
District Descriptions and Recommendations for District Specific Design Standards
District Plan follows:
SOUTHWEST DISTRICT DESIGN GUIDELINES
The Southwest District offers Corcoran the opportunity to establish a “gateway” to the City
on State Highway 55 at County Road 19. Development in this district should be of the type
and quality that will add significant value for the City. The District Plan calls for high
quality business parks along Highway 55 and County Road 19, with well-landscaped
setbacks and buffers. The presence of a major natural resource corridor creates the
opportunity for mixed residential development offering a mix of housing types and
densities while preserving significant natural features.
Site Development
• Site design and landscaping should be designed to work with the existing
topography of this area, preserving the rolling hills and natural view corridors.
• Commercial areas should be designed as high quality business parks, with
appropriate office, commercial and light industrial uses.
• New residential development should include a range of housing types (townhouses
as well as single-family attached and detached) and densities.
• New residential development should reserve land for a neighborhood park as well
as “natural open space”; these spaces should be linked to the trail system.
Streets and Public Amenities
• The intersection of County Road 19 and State Highway 55 should be developed as a
“gateway” to the City of Corcoran with appropriate open space and gateway
elements, such as identity signage, lighting, landscape and water features. The
design should express the unique character of Corcoran’s rural community.
• Driveways and other direct access from new developments to State Highway 55
shall not be permitted. New access roads shall be provided for access to properties
that currently front the highway.
• Access shall be from a new road network, for both business park and residential
uses, with connections to existing roads; cul-de-sacs are discouraged.

District Design Guidelines
Descriptions and Recommendations for District Specific Design Standards
District Plan follows:
NORTHEAST DISTRICT DESIGN GUIDELINES
At one of the major entrances to the City of Corcoran, the Northeast District Plan
establishes a gateway to the community that reflects the City’s rural character. The plan
offers opportunities for expanded tax base, jobs and services by taking advantage of Maple
Grove’s nearby higher density development. The primary entry into the Northeast District
is County Road 30, where a mixed-use PUD (planned unit development) will combine a mix
of low and medium density residential with mixed-use commercial, including
neighborhood retail, service retail, commercial and office uses. The edge of the district
along County Road 101 is planned primarily for high quality business parks, with some
destination commercial or retail uses closer to the County Road 30 intersection.
General Site Development
• The commercial area along County Road 101 should be designed as high quality
business parks, with appropriate office, commercial and light industrial uses.
• Retail uses should be limited to the commercial area indicated near the County Road
101 and 30 intersection or included within the County Road 30 mixed-use PUD area.
• Within the PUD, residential development should provide for life-cycle housing for
empty nesters, retirees, and first-time home buyers with a range of housing types
(condominiums, townhouses, and single-family attached) and densities.
Streets, Trails, Parks and Public Amenities
• County Road 30 is a major entry point into the City of Corcoran, which warrants a
unique design treatment as it meets County Road 101; this intersection should be
developed as a “gateway” with significant landscaped open space and appropriate
entry elements; the design should express the unique character of Corcoran.
• County Road 30 from County Road 116 to County Road 101 should be developed as
a green corridor with landscaped setback, center boulevard and other
enhancements that will express a sense of entry while maintaining an open, rural
road character.
• Enhancements at the intersection of County Roads 116 and 30 should be designed
similar to major County Road 116 intersections in the downtown and southeast
district.
APPENDIX A (Design Guidelines) Page A-13
October 25, 2018
• The County Road 116 rural greenway should continue north through this district,
with trail connections to new civic or community spaces as well as retail or
destination uses within the PUD.
• Mixed commercial-retail within the PUD should be designed around public or
common areas that are linked by trails or sidewalks. The design should also include
sidewalks and trails to connect neighborhood retail and public spaces to the
adjacent residential neighborhoods.
• Mixed-use and new residential development within the PUD should include a
designated neighborhood park in addition to natural open space (woods, wetlands,
meadows, etc.).
• The planned extension of County Road 117 to County Road101 should be planned
and designed in a way that is sensitive to existing residential uses in that area.
Direct access for new developments should be limited on County Roads 101, 116 and 30.
Future plans for access on these roads should balance traffic demand and future
development.

Overview | 5
In 2015, the City of Corcoran, in partnership with Hennepin County, began work to update the
existing design guidelines and master plan for the Southeast District. The Corcoran Southeast
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
other changes needed to implement the City’s Vision.
The Southeast District is the historic heart of the City. The intersection of County Road 10
and County Road 116 is a historic crossroads and this area is home to the existing city
hall, St. Thomas Catholic Church and the existing business park. The Southeast District is
also beginning to see the residential development that has long been anticipated with the
development of Lennar’s “Ravinia” neighborhood. The Town Center (including the Downtown
Core????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
commercial with a mix of low, medium and higher density residential. The planned development
is balanced by extensive open space and natural resources, including two golf courses (Rush
Creek & Shamrock), Lions Park, Corcoran Community Park, the City Hall park and the Rush
Creek corridor.
Purpose
The primary purpose of Corcoran Southeast District Plan and Design Guidelines is to set
basic parameters, describe preferences and illustrate design intent. These guidelines serve
as principles within which creative design can and should occur – there is no one solution, but
many options that meet the basic requirements of this document.

zoning district in which the development is located and these Design Standards will provide an
additional layer of standards.
New residential development should provide for the full range of life cycle housing, offering
choices of housing types at low, medium and higher densities.
Within the Southeast District, the combination of site and building design should provide
a visual cue that this is a unique place. For single family, twin and townhome structures,
architecture styles including: Agrarian Contemporary, Farmhouse, and Arts & Crafts - Prairie are
encouraged, as is the use of regional building materials and native plants. Development in this
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
8 | District Principles
Agrarian Contemporary
Agrarian Contemporary style homes rely on simple forms with strong roof lines and inviting front
porches. This style is a clean, crisp, more contemporary version of the Agrarian Rural style.
Typical style elements include:
• Form and Roof
• Simple roof design, front to back gable or side to side
• 5:12 to 12:12 roof pitches
• Overhang eaves
• Walls and Windows:
• Horizontal or board and batten siding, stucco or a combination
• Symmetrical placement and distinct fenestration rhythms
• Square, circular or 2:1 proportioned vertical rectangular windows with grid
patterns
• Details
• Porches with simple columns, trim and railings
• Minimal door and window trim detailing
• Dormers, cupolas, shutters, exposed rafter tails
District Principles | 9
Farmhouse
Farmhouse style is comfortable and practical. It is a hybrid of elements
brought together by regional craftsmen and traditions of the early 20th
century. Typical style elements include:
• Form and Roof
• Two story
• Asymmetrical, angular design with tall proportions.
• Gable roof
• 8:12 or greater roof pitch
• Overhang eaves
• Wood or asphalt shingled roof

layout
• Tall rectangular windows with large panes
• Details
• Decorative braces and brackets
• ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
• Corbels and gable trusses
• Wrap porches
• Geometric patterns
• Embellished porch railings
10 | District Principles
Arts & Crafts - Prairie
Prairie Style is truly American, derived by Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis
Sullivan. Typical style elements include:
• Form and Roof
• Low pitched roof with wide overhanging eaves
• Massive square porch supports
• Two stories with one story porches or wings
• ??????????????????????????????????????????????????
• 3-1/2:12 or greater roof pitch
• Hipped roof
• Walls and Windows:
• Horizontal windows, sometimes wrapping around
corners
• Tall casement windows
• Geometric patterns of small-pane windows
• Details

without overloading the existing transportation network. Current plans to reroute County Roads
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
County Road 116 will continue to be the central route through the Southeast District, but
improvements are planned for where County Road 116 passes through the Town Center. As
improvements are made to this road, emphasis should be placed on creating a pedestrian-
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
gateway elements and landscaping at key intersections will serve that purpose. The County
Road 116 corridor should be designed with green boulevards on both sides, with particular
attention given to the east side of the road where a linear park with off-road trail is planned.
Where County Road 116 passes through the Town Center, this road should shift to the east
to allow for a center landscaped boulevard and other enhancements that will express a sense
of Town Center identity. The intersections of County Road 116 and Larkin Road (new County
Road 50), and County Road 116 and City Hall Drive (proposed new road just south of City Hall)
mark the entry points into this area, and the start of the proposed boulevard. The design of
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
to work with Hennepin County to ensure future improvements are consistent with City’s vision
as well as the County policy related to Complete Streets. As part of this vision, the city will look
for opportunities to provide grade-separated pedestrian crossings in addition to the at-grade
crossings.
The existing road network should be maintained as a continuous network, with new connections
where needed. Cul-de-sacs are strongly discouraged in the Town Center. Cul-de-sacs should
be avoided throughout the Southeast District in favor of connecting streets that will facilitate
resilient multi-modal routes within the district.
The Southeast District has six main types of streets which are described and illustrated on the
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
economically viable Southeast District.
Street Connectivity. A connected network
of streets provides system resiliency and greater
capacity with the same lane miles. Top: Connected
Network is preferred. Bottom: Sparse Hierarchy with
cul-de-sacs is not desirable.

Parkway Street. This tree lined street has a 72-foot wide right-of-way
and a center median with trees. The median may have turf or perennials and
shrubs depending on the surrounding context. Parkways at the entrance to a
neighborhood or district are logical places for upgrading the median plantings to
perennials and shrubs with trees. In special cases, the median may be depressed
and function as a stormwater amenity. In this case, upgraded plantings are
advised. The City Engineer may reduce or eliminate on-street parking for this street
type outside the Town Center depending on the surrounding context.
Bikeway Street. The Bikeway also has a 72-foot wide right-of-way, but the
section is allocated differently. Instead of a center median, as in the Parkway, a
bikeway allocates bike lanes on the outside of the drive lanes. The City Engineer
may reduce or eliminate on-street parking for this street type outside the Town
Center depending on the surrounding context.

for window shopping, furnishings, pedestrian level lighting, overstory trees and
planters.
Main Street Pedestrian Realm. The pedestrian realm on Main Street
is 16-feet wide from back of curb to building face. Amenities supportive of the
building uses are encouraged including: patio seating, benches, bicycle racks, litter
receptacles, and planter pots with seasonal displays. Infrastructure like pedestrian
level lighting, street trees in landscaped boulevards are also appropriate.

Connector Street. The Connector Street has a 60-foot right-of-way and
prioritizes movement across the community. Setbacks vary by district, but the
frontage is consistently a sidewalk in the throughway and a turf boulevard with
regularly spaced overstory and tall ornamental trees.
Local Street. The Local Street has a 50-foot right-of-way with parking on one
side and serves the movement needs of neighborhood residents. Setbacks vary
by district, but the frontage is consistently a sidewalk in the throughway and a turf
boulevard with regularly spaced overstory and tall ornamental trees. The drive lane
near the curb is slightly wider to accommodate vehicular buffer space.

Street typology in this appendix does not
take the place of the standards found in
the Corcoran Comprehensive Plan and
Subdivision Ordinance, but is intended to
supplement that information with a more
detailed description of the street design in this
district.
The developer shall be responsible for
construction of all streetscape improvements
along adjacent streets. These improvements
include all hardscape, landscape and site
amenities, such as trails, sidewalks, benches,
bike racks, street trees and plantings.
Frontage (space between the back of curb
and the right-of-way line) can be divided into
two zones: the throughway and pedestrian
buffer.
Throughway is foremost the accessible
route for pedestrians. Once the needs for ADA
accessibility are met, the remaining width is
based on the needs of the frontage. An urban
frontage with shopping and many pedestrians
requires a wider throughway to allow for
window shopping, couples walking side-byside,
strollers and the like.
Pedestrian Buffer is the space between
the throughway and the back of curb. It will
also vary in width depending on the needs of
the adjacent land uses. In active urban areas,
the pedestrian buffer includes patio tables,
pedestrian lighting, street trees, planters and
all the amenities that support the streetscape
character. In single family residential
neighborhoods, the pedestrian buffer is
generally tree lined with turf or plantings
tended by residents.

Landscaping and Screening
Site design and landscaping should be designed to work with the existing topography of the
area, preserving the rolling hills, Rush Creek natural resources corridor, woods and wetlands,
and natural viewsheds and corridors.
Landscape screens with berms, hedgerows, and a variety of deciduous and coniferous native
trees and shrubs should be incorporated to minimize undesirable views from the public realm.
Signage and Gateways
Signage should be designed as an integral part of the building and site design and shall comply
with the requirements of Chapter 84 of the City Code.
Include gateway signage at key intersections along County Road 116 and the Town Center.
Incorporate landscaping, lighting and hardscape to anchor the gateway’s visual presence.
Gateways. City Center Drive, Main Street and

Stormwater Management
Water features and drainage systems are essential components of development in the
Southeast District. A mix of ponds, fountains and other water elements provide focal
amenities and year round activities within the framework of an environmentally responsible,
visually pleasing strategy to manage stormwater. Each site has a responsibility to utilize best
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
compliance with City and Elm Creek Watershed Management Commission standards. Water
and landscape should be utilized within multipurpose areas that accommodate both active and
passive recreational use – the following examples illustrate only a few of many possibilities:
1. Pervious pavements, underground storage and other creative techniques should be
used to BMP standards, particularly in the Town Center where more density is expected.
2. Green architecture, expressed through green roofs, gray water recycling and other
techniques should be included to reduce the impact of new development on stormwater
systems

creative ways to integrate wet landscapes with active, urban spaces.
Stormater Management. Stormwater
management infrastructure can take a variety of
forms. A hard working below ground system can be
topped by a parking lot, streetscape or even a planted
swale. These examples of stormwater infrastructure

Parks, Trails and Public Space
The linear park (A) should continue north and south through the town
center on the East side of County Road 116, with trail connections
to new civic and community spaces and uses. Safe, convenient
pedestrian crossings are a priority within the entire Southeast District.
New public spaces, parks, and common greens or open space
should be linked to other community parks and open space with trail
connections to the existing and proposed City parks and trail system.
The only active park currently in the Southeast District is Corcoran
Community Park (E). This park currently shares space with the
Rockford School facilities on the adjacent parcel. The park will likely
change over time as the school property is developed and road
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
an important park in the City system and priority should be given to
ensuring strong bike and pedestrian connections to this park and other
planned parks in the district. A second City park is being developed on
the City Hall property and could be expanded to take advantage of the
woodland area on the east side of the City Hall property.
A new Town Square (B) is planned in the Downtown Core. The Town
Square will serve as a social center for the community, suitable for
concerts and celebrations, but also as a place to enjoy the scenes of
downtown. Picnic tables for lunch, benches for people watching, the
Town Square will be a public space to support a bustling downtown.
Two small neighborhood parks (C & D) are also planned in the Town
Center, one each to the north and south of the Downtown Core. These
parks will include walking trails and playgrounds. The neighborhood
park on the north is nestled in an existing woodland, and will provide
interesting walking trails, connecting to City Hall, ample shade, and an
opportunity for an exercise circuit (Par Course) for the adjacent senior
housing development. The southern neighborhood park is perched
on a terrace above the wetland and offers great views across the
landscape. A playground and trails through the wetland prairie will offer
birdwatching and contemplation.
All three parks will be developed when the adjacent property is platted.
Other parks are proposed in the Southeast District in the Ravinia
neighborhood and near Blue Bonnet Drive.

22 | District Principles
Public green space, within close proximity to homes
and businesses, is a vital part of a healthy community.
A Town Square is meant to serve as a community
gathering place for celebrations throughout the
seasons. This example from Burnsville is a modern
destination surrounded by civic, retail and residential
uses.
Temporary winter uses like a small ice rink could
double the value of a bandshell or picnic pavilion
when considered as a warming house in the cold
season. Olympic Plaza in Whistler below creates an
irregular shaped rink for casual and family use.

minute walk, 1/4 or 1/2 mile radius, is one common
way to consider walkability. Within the Southeast
District, there are intended to be a high number of
parks, retail uses and residential units within that
walkable range.

03 Healthy Communities
While developing these guidelines, the City of Corcoran was mindful of how community design
impacts the health of the people who live, work, play, learn and worship in the city. Communities
around the country are increasingly aware of the impact that land-use and transportation
have on people’s ability to be active and access healthy food. We also know that a lack of
physical activity, combined with diet, is one of the leading factors behind the increase in chronic
diseases, such as heart disease and type II diabetes.
Sidewalks, trails, bike lanes and parks all provide opportunities for people to be physically
active, both recreationally and by incorporating activity into their daily routines. Mixed-use and
higher density developments also encourage people to be active by making it easier to bike
and walk to destinations rather than driving. When developing the plan and design guidelines
for the Southeast District (including the Town Center and the Downtown Core), we looked at the
following considerations:
• An integrated transportation network: Streets connecting residential areas to
the Downtown Core are safe, appealing and accessible to people walking and biking, as
well as people driving motor vehicles. A combination of off-road and on-street bike and
pedestrian facilities are included to give people safe and convenient options for active
transportation.
• Accessible destinations and inviting design: Housing, retail and other
destinations are located in or near the downtown to invite walking by creating pleasant and
safe routes.
• Green space: A new Town Square and neighborhood park create additional
opportunities for physical activity and promotes social connectedness.

Overview
The Town Center is the walkable traditional neighborhood supporting the Downtown Core. The
Town Center is bound by City Hall on the north, Shamrock Golf Course on the south, County
Road 116 on the west and Maple Hill Road on the east. The Town Center is intended to support
the Downtown Core through walkable blocks, a variety of housing types and densities, and a
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
have additional design guidelines.
All development within the Southeast District will be based on an integrated transportation
network that connects residential neighborhoods with the existing business park on the west
side of County Road 116 and the Downtown Core on the east side of County Road 116. A
combination of off-road and on-street bike and pedestrian facilities are included to give
residents and visitors safe and convenient options for active transportation as an option to
driving.
Special emphasis will be placed on providing accessible destinations and inviting design.
Housing, retail and other destinations are located in or near the Downtown Core to invite
walking by creating pleasant and safe routes within the Town Center. A Town Square, City Hall
Park and two small Neighborhood Parks create additional opportunities for physical activity and
social connectedness.
Uses within the Town Center include: mixed use, public/semi-public, and mixed residential. The
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

05 Downtown Core
Overview
The Downtown Core is the commercial and
civic heart of Corcoran. It is bound by 78th
Avenue on the north, 76th Avenue on the
south, County Road 116 on the west and Oak
Lane on the east. This district is the six block
Main Street area as shown on the Downtown
Core master plan. It is intended to offer
residents and visitors a central community
place to serve their daily commercial and
personal service needs, and to gather with
their neighbors for civic celebrations and
social events.
Through these guidelines, the Downtown
Core will focus public and private investments
in a smaller geographic area to support a
critical mass of high quality development and
public realm amenities.
Design requirements in this section are in
addition to criteria set in the Downtown Mixed
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
prevail.
Vision
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
the community. A mix of restaurants, shops,
and services will make it possible to meet
daily needs all within a walkable area of the
city. This pedestrian scale, with a cohesive
building and landscape appearance, will
identify this area as uniquely Corcoran.
Downtown Core Objectives:
1. Downtown Core maintains the unique
heritage and history of Corcoran.
2. Downtown Core is where the
community gathers.
3. Downtown Core provides safe,
convenient access for pedestrians,
bicycles and vehicles.
4. Downtown Core provides the daily
retail and service needs for the
community.
5. Downtown Core is a mix of
businesses, public spaces and
residential neighborhoods that are
connected by complementary design
elements and streetscapes.
6. Downtown Core is a destination for
the region.
Site Development
Destination retail, restaurant and
entertainment uses, particularly mixed with
other synergistic uses, are encouraged.
Development should be appropriate for a
traditional downtown area, with mixed-use
buildings combining retail, commercial, and
multi-family residential uses.
Buildings - Placement, Massing
and Height
The area and setback requirements shall

that additional standards shall be required for
the Downtown Core as noted elsewhere in
this document.
Height. Buildings are required to be a
minimum of two stories in the Downtown
Core. Stepping portions of upper stories back
from the line of the front façade to provide
areas for outdoor terraces and rooftop patios
is encouraged.
38 | Downtown Core
Streetscape
Trees and plantings
Overstory trees should be placed with regularity along street frontages in order to create dapple
shade within 10-15 years. Space and placement of trees, lighting and signage should be
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Furnishings
Main Street is designed as a traditional downtown main street, lined with street trees and
planters, pedestrian level lighting, and furnishings including benches and trash receptacles.
These elements shall also occur within the Town Center, to a lesser extent.
Outdoor Dining
Pavement widths are wider in the Downtown Core than in other areas of the in order to
support the widest variety of streetscape amenities. Outdoor dining shall be permitted through
the Downtown Core and shall be placed in the pedestrian buffer area of the sidewalk section.
Awnings
Where awnings are used, canvas, fabric or vinyl awnings are preferable. If glass or metal
awnings are employed, they shall closely complement the building’s architectural character
and aesthetic. The bottom of a window awning shall be set at least seven feet above the public
sidewalk. Back lighted vinyl awnings and canopy signs shall not be used.

Sidewalks and Boulevards
County Road 116 and Main Street in the
Downtown Core warrants a unique design
treatment. This intersection will be developed
as the entry into the Downtown Core with
appropriate identity elements. The County
Road 116 linear park will offer trails through a
landscaped open space, which extends into
the Downtown Core and greater Town Center.
The City will continue to work with Hennepin
County to ensure that the ultimate design
of County Road 116 respects the City’s
intention to develop a district that is safe and
accessible for all modes of transportation,
including walking and biking.
Parking
1. No parking spaces shall be located
on corner lots at the point of street
intersections.
2. No parking spaces shall be located
between the immediate front of the
principal structure and the abutting front
lot line.

Implementation | 43
05 Implementation
Introduction
The design guidelines provide distinct strategies for guiding form and appearance. This
vision will take several years to implement. Successful implementation will require consistent
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
design guidelines will not succeed without the cooperation and commitment of landowners,
development interests, and the rest of the community.
Changes to the Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Map
The Corcoran Southeast District Plan and Design Guidelines suggest changes to the City’s
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
guidelines.
Design Review
The design guidelines will be administered by staff as part of the development review process.
Staff will incorporate design review to ensure compliance with the design guidelines as a
standard step in the development review process

construct, install, operate, repair, maintain, remove or relocate facilities in the city.
DIRECTOR. The Director of Public Works, equivalent position at the city, or designated
representative.
FACILITIES. Telecommunications equipment of any kind, including but not limited to audio,
video, paging, facsimile or similar service, not governed by M.S. Chapter 238, including all

equipment of all kinds, and any necessary appurtenances owned, leased or operated by a
company on, over, in, under across or along public ground.
PUBLIC GROUND. Highways, roads, streets, alleys, public ways, utility easements and
public grounds in the city.
PERMIT PROCEDURE.
(A) Permit required. A company may not construct, install, repair, remove or relocate
facilities, or any part thereof, in, on, over, under or along public ground without first obtaining a
permit from the city.
(B) Application. Application for a permit is made to the Director.
(C) Issuance of permit. If the Director determines that the applicant has satisfied the
requirements of this chapter the Director may issue a permit to the company. An applicant may
contest a permit denial or the conditions of approval by written notice to the Clerk-Treasurer
requesting a City Council review within 14 days of the Director's actions under this chapter within
45 days of the City Clerk-Treasurer's receipt of the contest notice. Nothing in this chapter
precludes the city from requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in
addition to the issuance of a permit set forth herein.
(D) Permit fee. The application must be accompanied by the permit fee set by the City Council
by resolution.
(E) Security for completion of work. Prior to commencement of work, the company must
deposit with the city security in the form of certified check, letter of credit or construction bond,
in a sufficient amount as determined by the Director for completion of the work. The securities
will be held until the work is completed, plus a period of months thereafter to guarantee that
111-2
restoration work has been satisfactorily completed. Upon application of the company providing
the information as the Director may require, if two or more work projects are to be constructed
during a calendar year, the Director may accept, in lieu of separate security for each project, a
single security for multiple projects in a form and amount as determined, in the discretion of the
Director, to be sufficient to assure completion of all projects which may be in progress at any one
time during that calendar year and to guaranty that restoration work will be satisfactorily
completed. The security will then be returned to the company with interest, if required by law,
and then interest at the applicable statutory rate.
(F) Inspection of work. When the work is completed the company must request an inspection
by the Director. The Director will determine if the work has been satisfactorily completed and
provide the company with a written report of the inspection and approval.
RESTORATION AND RELOCATION.
(A) Restoration. Upon completion of the work, the company must restore the general area of
the work, including paving and its foundations, to the same condition that existed prior to
commencement of the work and must exercise reasonable care to maintain the same condition for
two years thereafter. The work must be completed as promptly as weather permits. If the company
does not promptly perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and
material, and restore the public ground to the same condition, the city may put it in the same
condition at the expense of the company. The company must, upon demand, pay to the city the
direct and indirect cost of the work done for or performed by the city, including, but not limited
to, the city's administrative costs. To recover its costs, the city will first draw on the security posted
by the company and then recover the balance of the costs incurred from the company directly by
written demand. This remedy is in addition to any other remedies available to the city.
(B) Company initiated relocation. The company must give the city written notice prior to the
company initiated relocation of facilities. A company-initiated relocation must be at the company's

(C) City required relocation. The company must promptly and at its own expense, with due
regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently relocate its facilities whenever the city
requires the relocation.
(D) Relocation where public ground vacated. The vacation of public ground does not deprive
the company of the right to operate and maintain its facilities in the city. If the company initiates
the vacation proceedings, the company must pay the relocation costs. If the city or other persons
initiate the vacation proceedings, the company must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise
agreed to by the city, company and other persons.

under the permit. The notice of default must be in writing and specify the provisions of the permit
under which the default is claimed and state the grounds of the claim. The notice must be served
on the company by personally delivering it to an officer thereof at its principal place of business
in Minnesota or by certified mail to that address.
(B) City action on default. If the company is in default in the performance of the work
authorized by the permit, the city may, after the above notice to the company and failure of the
company to cure the default, take the action as may be reasonably necessary to abate the condition
caused by the default. The company must reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs,
including costs of collection and attorney fees incurred as a result of the company default. The
security posted under 111.02 (E) will be applied by the city first toward payment for the
reimbursement.
INDEMNIFICATION.
(A) Scope. The company will indemnify, keep and hold the city, its elected officials, officers,
employees and agents free and harmless from any and all claims and actions on account of injury
or death or persons or damage to property occasioned by the construction, installation,
maintenance, repair, removal, relocation or operation of the facilities affecting public ground,
unless the injury or damage is the result of the negligence of the city, its elected officials,
employees, officers or agents. The city will notify the company of claims or actions and provide
a reasonable opportunity for the company to accept and undertake the defense.
(B) Claim defense. If a claim or action is brought against the city under circumstances where
indemnification applies, the company, at its sole expense, shall defend the city if written notice of
the claim or action is given to the company within a period wherein the company is not prejudiced
in the defense of the claim or action by lack of the notice. If the company undertakes the defense,
the company shall have complete control of the claim or action, but it may not settle without the
consent of the city, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third
parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the city. In defending any
action on behalf of the city, the company is entitled to assert every defense or immunity that the
city could assert on its own behalf.
CONDITIONS OF USE.
(A) Use of public ground. Facilities must be located, constructed, installed, maintained or

shall give the city 45 days advanced written notice of the company's proposed location of facilities
within the public ground. No later than 45 days after the city's receipt of the company's written
notice the city will notify the company in writing of the city's acceptance or rejection of the
proposed location. If the city rejects the company's proposed location, the city shall propose
alternative locations. The city does not waive or forfeit its right to reject the location of facilities
by failure to respond within 45 days.
(C) Emergency work. A company may open and disturb the surface of public ground without
a permit where an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of its facilities. In such event,
the company must request a permit not later than the second working day thereafter and comply
with the applicable conditions of the permit. In no event, may the company undertake an activity
which will result in the closing of a street or alley without prior notification to the city.
(D) Street improvements, paving or resurfacing. The city will give the company written notice
of plans for improvements where permanent paving or resurfacing is involved. The notice must
contain:
(1) The nature and character of the improvements;
(2) The streets upon which the improvements are to be made;
(3) The extent of the improvements, the time when the city will start the work; and
(4) If more than one street is involved, the sequence in which the work is to proceed.
(E) Company protection of facilities. The company must take reasonable measures to prevent
the facilities from causing damage to persons or property. The company must take reasonable
measures to protect its facilities from damage that could be inflicted on the facilities by persons,
property or the elements. The company must take protective measures when the city performs
work near the facilities.
(F) Prior service connections. In cases where the city is undertaking the paving or resurfacing
of streets and the facilities are located under the street, the company may be required to install
service connections prior to the paving or resurfacing if it is apparent that service will be required
during the five year period following the paving or resurfacing.
111-5

to the effective date of this chapter. A company is not required to pay the difference between the
permit fee of a previously obtained permit and the equivalent newly obtained permit under this
chapter. All other provisions of this chapter apply to existing facilities.

with all of the requirements of this company.

owns in the property.

dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and put the Public Ground in the said condition, the
City shall have, after demand to Company to cure and the passage of a reasonable
period of time following the demand, but not to exceed five days, the right to make the
restoration of the Public Ground at the expense of Company. Company shall pay to the
City the cost of such work done for or performed by the City. This remedy shall be in
addition to any other remedy available to the City for noncompliance with this

the Company deems necessary at Company expense.
F. Mapping Information. The Company must promptly provide complete and accurate
mapping information for any of its Gas Facilities in accordance with the

permits for, or inspection of, Company's plans or work.
B. Defense of City. In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances where
this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its sole cost and expense shall defend
the City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Company within a
period wherein Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. If Company is required
to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company
may not settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or
immunity otherwise available to the City. The Company, in defending any action on
behalf of the City, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that
the City could assert in its own behalf This franchise agreement shall not be interpreted to
constitute a waiver by the City of any of its defenses of immunity or limitations on
liability under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 466.

CHANGE IN FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity of this Ordinance.
Any governmental unit succeeding the City shall, without the consent of Company, succeed to
all of the rights and obligations of the City provided in this Ordinance.
FRANCHISE FEE.
A. Form. During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in addition to permit fees
being imposed or that the City has a right to impose, the City may charge the Company a
franchise fee. The fee may be (i) a percentage of gross revenues received by the
Company for its operations within the City, or (ii) a flat fee per customer based on
metered service to retail customers within the City or on some other similar basis, or (iii)
a fee based on units of energy delivered to any class of retail customers within the
corporate limits of the City. The method of imposing the franchise fee, the percentage of
revenue rate, or the flat rate based on metered service may differ for each customer class
or combine the methods described in (i) - (iii) above in assessing the fee. The City shall
seek to use a formula that provides a stable and predictable amount of fees, without
placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage. If the Company claims that the City
required fee formula is discriminatory or otherwise places the Company at a competitive
disadvantage, the Company shall provide a formula that will produce a substantially
similar fee amount to the City and reimburse the City's reasonable fees and costs in
reviewing and implementing the formula. The City will attempt to accommodate the
Company but is under no franchise obligation to adopt the Company-proposed franchise
fee formula and each review will not delay the implementation of the City-imposed fee.
B. Separate Ordinance. The franchise fee shall be imposed by separate ordinance duly
adopted by the City Council, which ordinance shall not be adopted until at least thirty (30)
days after written notice enclosing such proposed ordinance has been served upon the
Company. The fee shall become effective sixty (60) days after written notice
enclosing such adopted ordinance has been served upon the Company by certified mail.
C. Condition of Fee. The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be effective against
the Company unless it lawfully imposes a fee of the same or substantially similar
amount on the sale of gas energy within the City by any other gas energy supplier,
provided that, as to such supplier, the City has the authority or contractual right to require a
franchise fee or similar fee through a previously agreed upon franchise.
D. Collection of Fee. The franchise fee shall be payable not less than quarterly during
complete billing months of the period for which payment is to be made. The franchise fee
formula may be changed from time to time, however, the change shall meet the same
notice requirements and the fee may not be changed more often than annually. Such fee
shall not exceed any amount that the Company may legally charge to its customers prior to
payment to the City. Such fee is subject to subsequent reductions to account for
uncollectibles and customer refunds incurred by the Company. The Company agrees to
112-6
make available for inspection by the City at reasonable times all records necessary to
audit the Company's determination of the franchise fee payments.
E. Continuation of Franchise Fee. If this franchise expires and the City and the Company
are unable to agree upon terms of a new franchise, the franchise fee, if any being imposed by
the City at the time this franchise expires, will remain in effect until a new franchise is
agreed upon. However, in no event shall this franchise fee continue for more than one year
after expiration of the 20-year term set forth in Section 112.20(A).
ABANDONED FACILITIES.
The Company shall comply with City ordinances, Minnesota Statutes, Section 216D.01 et seq_
and Minnesota Rules Part 7819.3300, as they may be amended from time to time. The
Company shall maintain records describing the exact location of all abandoned and retired
Facilities within the City, produce such records at the City's request and comply with the
location requirements of Section 216D.04 with respect to all Facilities, including abandoned
and retired Facilities.
PROVISIONS OF ORDINANCE.
A. Severability. Every section, provision, or part of this Ordinance is declared separate from
every other section, provision, or part; and if any section, provision, or part shall be
held invalid, it shall not affect any other section, provision, or part. Where a provision
of any other City ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this Ordinance, the
provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail.
B. Limitation on Applicability. This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between
the City and Company as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any
way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to
constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one
or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person
not a party hereto.
AMENDMENT PROCEDURE.
Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the agreement be amended.
This Ordinance may be amended at any time by the City passing a subsequent ordinance declaring
the provisions of the amendment, which amendatory ordinance shall become effective upon the
filing of Company's written consent thereto with the City Clerk within 60 days after the effective
date of the amendatory ordinance.

LOCATION, OTHER REGULATIONS.
3.1 Location of Facilities. Electric Facilities shall be located, constructed, and
maintained so as not to interfere with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along and over
Public Ways and so as not to disrupt normal operation of any City Utility System or street lighting
or traffic signal system of the City. Electric Facilities shall be located on Public Grounds as
determined by the City. Company's construction, reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance,
location and relocation of Electric Facilities shall be subject to any permit requirements authorized
in a separate ordinance and other reasonable regulations of the City, consistent with authority
granted the City to manage its Public Ways and Public Grounds under state law, to the extent not
inconsistent with a specific term of this franchise agreement. Company may abandon underground
Electric Facilities in place, provided at City’s request, Company at its own expense, removes
abandoned metal conduits or concrete encased conduit or other Facilities interfering with a City
improvement project, but only to the extent such conduit is uncovered as part of the City’s
improvement project.
3.2 Street Openings. Company shall not open or disturb the surface of any Public
Way or Public Ground for any purpose without first having obtained a permit from the City, if
required by a separate ordinance for which the City may impose a reasonable fee, subject to the
provisions of Section 9. Permit conditions imposed on Company shall not be more burdensome
than those imposed on other utilities for similar facilities or work. Company may, however, open
and disturb the surface of any Public Way or Public Ground without a permit if (i) an emergency
exists requiring the immediate repair of Electric Facilities and (ii) Company gives telephone, email
or similar notice to the City before, if reasonably possible, commencement of the emergency
repair. Within two business days after commencing the repair, Company shall apply for any
required permits and pay any required fees.
3.3 Restoration. After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any Public Way,
Company shall restore the Public Way in accordance with Minnesota Rules, Part 7819.1100 and
applicable City ordinances to the extent consistent with law. Company shall restore the Public
Ground to as good a condition as formerly existed, and shall maintain the surface in good condition
for six months thereafter, but shall have no obligation to water any grass or other vegetation
thereon. All work shall be completed as promptly as weather permits and if Company shall not
promptly perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and
put the Public Ground in the said condition the City shall have, after demand to Company to cure
and the passage of a reasonable period of time following the demand, but not to exceed five days,
the right to make the restoration of the Public Ground at the expense of Company. Company shall
pay to the City the cost of such work done for or performed by the City. This remedy shall be in
addition to any other remedy available to the City for noncompliance with this Section.
113-4
3.4 Performance Security. City hereby waives any requirement, in the normal course of
Company operations, for Company to post a construction performance bond, certificate of
insurance, letter of credit or any other form of security or assurance that may be required under a
separate existing or future ordinance of the City, of a person or entity obtaining the City’s
permission to install, replace or maintain facilities in a Public Way or the Public Ground.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City reserves the right to require a performance bond for new
installation, replacement, or repairs, when the Company’s completion of its work is required in
order for the City to proceed with its work for constructing a public improvement to the Public
Way.
3.5 Shared Use of Poles. Company shall make space available on its poles or towers
for City fire, water utility, police or other City facilities whenever such use will not interfere with
the use of such poles or towers by Company, by another electric utility, by a telephone utility, or
by any cable television company or other form of communication company. In addition, the City
shall pay for any added cost incurred by Company because of such use by City.
3.6 Avoid Damage to Electric Facilities. Nothing in this Ordinance relieves any
person, including Company, from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to
avoid damaging Electric Facilities or other persons or property while performing any activity.
3.7 Notice of Improvements to Streets. The City must give Company reasonable
written Notice of plans for improvements to Public Ways where the City has reason to believe that
Electric Facilities may affect or be affected by the improvement. The Notice must contain: (i) the
nature and character of the improvements, (ii) the Public Ways upon which the improvements are
to be made, (iii) the extent of the improvements, (iv) the time when the City will start the work,
and (v) if more than one Public Way is involved, the order in which the work is to proceed. The
Notice must be given to Company a sufficient length of time, considering seasonal working
conditions, in advance of the actual commencement of the work to permit Company to make any
additions, alterations or repairs to its Electric Facilities Company deems necessary.
3.8 Mapping Information. Company must promptly provide mapping information
for any of its underground Electric Facilities in accordance with Minnesota Rules Parts 7819.4000
and 7819.4100.

applicable ordinance of the City relating to relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ways to the
extent consistent with Minnesota Rules, Part 7819.3100 and applicable law.
4.2 Relocation in Public Grounds. The City may require Company at Company’s
expense to relocate or remove its Electric Facilities from Public Ground upon a finding by City
that the Electric Facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment to the existing or
proposed public use of the Public Ground. Such relocation shall comply with applicable city
ordinances consistent with law.
113-5
4.3 Projects with Federal Funding. Relocation, removal, or rearrangement of
any Electric Facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through City of a federallyaided
highway project shall be governed by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes Section 161.46,
as supplemented or amended. It is expressly understood that the right herein granted to Company
is a valuable property right. City shall not order Company to remove or relocate its facilities
without compensation when a Public Way is vacated, improved or re-aligned because of a renewal
or a redevelopment plan which is financially subsidized in whole or in part by the Federal
Government or any agency thereof, unless the reasonable Non-betterment Costs of such relocation
are paid to Company. The City is obligated to pay Company, however, only for those portions of
its relocation costs for which City has received federal funding specifically allocated for relocation
costs in the amount requested by the Company.
4.4 No Waiver. By entering this or any prior franchise agreement with the City,
Company does not waive its rights under an easement or prescriptive right or State or County
permit.
TREE TRIMMING.
Unless otherwise provided in any permit or other reasonable regulation required by the City
under separate ordinance, Company may trim all trees and shrubs in the Public Ways and
Public Grounds of City to the extent Company finds necessary to avoid interference with the
proper construction, operation, repair and maintenance of any Electric Facilities installed
hereunder, provided that Company shall save the City harmless from any liability arising
therefrom.
INDEMNIFICATION.
6.1 Indemnity of City. Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the City from
any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned by the
construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, the issuance of permits, or the operation of the
Electric Facilities located in the Public Ways and Public Grounds. The City shall not be
indemnified for losses or claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or claims
arising out of or alleging the City's negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or inspection of,
Company’s plans or work.
6.2 Defense of City. In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances
where this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its sole cost and expense shall defend the
City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Company within a period wherein
Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. If Company is required to indemnify and
defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company may not settle such litigation
without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section
is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City and
Company, in defending any action on behalf of the City, shall be entitled to assert in any action
every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf. This franchise agreement
shall not be interpreted to constitute a waiver by the City of any of its defenses of immunity or
limitations on liability under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 466.
113-6
VACATION OF PUBLIC WAYS.
The City shall give Company at least two weeks prior written notice of a proposed vacation
of a Public Way. Except where required solely for a City improvement project, the vacation of
any Public Way, after the installation of Electric Facilities, shall not operate to deprive Company
of its rights to operate and maintain such Electric Facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating
the same first paid to Company. In no case, however, shall the City be liable to Company for
failure to specifically preserve a right-of-way, under Minnesota Statutes, Section 160.29. In
accordance with Minnesota Rules, Part 7819.3200, if the City’s order directing vacation of the
Public Way does not require relocation of the Company’s Electric Facilities to prevent interference
with a current public improvement, the vacation proceedings shall not be deemed to deprive
Company of its right to continue to use the right-of-way of the former Public Way for its Electric
Facilities installed prior to such order of vacation.
CHANGE IN FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity of this
Ordinance. Any governmental unit succeeding the City shall, without the consent of Company,
succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the City provided in this Ordinance.
FRANCHISE FEE.
The City at the time of adopting this franchise agreement does not desire to require that
Company collect a franchise fee from its customers in the City. At a future date during the term
of this franchise agreement, the City may determine that it desires Company to collect a
franchise fee. If so, the City may give Company Notice to amend this franchise agreement to
authorize collection of a franchise fee by separate ordinance in an amount and upon such terms
and conditions as Company at that time is willing to incorporate in its electric franchise
agreements with other cities of the second, third or fourth class in the seven-county metropolitan
area. Upon receipt of such Notice Company shall negotiate in good faith with City to so amend
this franchise agreement.
PROVISIONS OF ORDINANCE.
10.1 Severability. Every section, provision, or part of this Ordinance is declared
separate from every other section, provision, or part; and if any section, provision, or part shall be
held invalid, it shall not affect any other section, provision, or part; provided, however, if any
provision is held invalid, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to substitute, to the extent
reasonably possible, amended provisions that validly carry out the primary purpose of the invalid
provisions. Where a provision of any other City ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this
Ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail.
113-7
10.2 Limitation On Applicability. This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement
between the City and Company as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any
way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any
such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof,
or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto.
AMENDMENT PROCEDURE.
Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the agreement be
amended. This Ordinance may be amended at any time by the City passing a subsequent ordinance
declaring the provisions of the amendment, which amendatory ordinance shall become effective
upon the filing of Company’s written consent thereto with the City Clerk after City council
adoption of the amendatory ordinance.
PREVIOUS FRANCHISES SUPERSEDED.
This franchise supersedes and replaces previous franchises granted to the Company or its
predecessors. Upon Company acceptance of this franchise under Section 2.2, the previous
franchise shall terminate.

CHAPTER 114: TOBACCO REGULATIONS
PURPOSE
Because the City of Corcoran recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years purchase or
otherwise obtain, possess, and use tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco-related devices, and
such sales, possession, and use are violations of both State and Federal laws; and because studies,
which are hereby accepted and adopted have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they
have reached the age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years without
having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking and because smoking has
been shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently place a financial
burden on all levels of government, this Chapter shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession,
and use of tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco-related devices for the purpose of enforcing and
furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal
use of tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco-related devices, and to further the official public

CHAPTER 115: ADULT ENTERTAINMENT
FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
Studies conducted by the Minnesota Attorney General, the American Planning Association, and
cities such as St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Hopkins, Minnesota; Ramsey,
Minnesota; Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California; and Seattle,
Washington, have studied the impacts that adult establishments have in those communities. These
studies have concluded that adult establishments have adverse impacts on the surrounding
neighborhoods. These impacts include increased crime rates, lower property values, increased
transience, neighborhood blight and potential health risks. Based on these studies and findings,
the City Council concludes:
a. Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set forth above.
b. The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish if adult establishments
are governed by geographic, licensing and health requirements.
c. It is not the intent of the City Council to prohibit adult establishments from having a reasonable
opportunity to locate in the City of Corcoran.
d. Minnesota Statutes, Section 432.357 and Section 412.221 allow the City to adopt regulations
to promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of residents.
e. The public health, safety, morals, and general welfare will be promoted by the City adopting
regulations governing adult establishments.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE OF CONDUCT
The City Council of the City of Corcoran makes the following findings regarding the need to
regulate commercial premises, buildings, and structures that are conducive to the spread of
communicable disease of danger to persons in order to further the substantial interest of public
health:
a. The experience of other cities establishes that certain commercial premises, buildings, and
structures, or parts thereof, by reason of the design and use of such premises, buildings, or
structures, are conducive to the spread of communicable disease of danger to persons
frequenting such premises, buildings, or structures, as well as to the general public, and that
the risk of spreading infectious and contagious diseases can be minimized by regulating such
commercial premises, buildings, and structures.
b. The experience of other cities where such commercial premises, buildings, and structures are
present indicates that the risk of spreading the sexually transmitted disease of Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is increased by the presence of such premises, buildings
and structures, because the design or use of such premises, buildings, and structures, or parts
thereof can facilitate high-risk sexual conduct.
c. Medical publications of the Center for Disease Control of the United States Department of
Health and Human Services indicate that the sexually transmitted disease of AIDS is currently
irreversible and uniformly fatal. Medical research has further established that the risk factors
for obtaining or spreading AIDS are associated with high-risk sexual conduct.
d. Certain commercial premises, buildings, and structures, or parts thereof, by reason of their
design and use, are conducive to high-risk sexual conduct, and hence the spread of
communicable disease, and that the risk of spreading infectious and contagious diseases can
be minimized by regulating these commercial premises, buildings and structures.
e. The public health, safety, morals, and general welfare will be promoted by the City adopting
regulations governing commercial premises, buildings and structures conducive to high-risk
sexual conduct.
f. The purpose of these regulations is to prescribe regulations governing commercial premises,
buildings, and structures that are conducive, by virtue of design and use, to high-risk sexual
conduct, which can result in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases to persons frequenting
such premises, buildings and structures.

it to be a public health hazard and public health nuisance and will:
1. Notify the manager, owner, or tenant of the hazardous site that the Public Health Official
has reasonable belief that the premises, building or structure is a hazardous site as defined
herein;

determination as to the existence of such hazardous site. If the manager, owner, or
tenant of the premises does not request a hearing within ten (10) days of the date of the
last warning notice, the Public Health Official will then cause the premises to be posted
with a warning advising the public that the premises have been declared a hazardous
site and the Public Health Official will cause orders to be issued to the manager, owner,
or tenant of the premises constituting the hazardous site to take specified corrective
measures to prevent high-risk sexual conduct from taking place within the premises.
b. If the manager, owner, or tenant of the premises requests a hearing, the
hearing will be held before the Public Health Official or the Public Health Official’s
appointee at a date not more than 30 days after demand for a hearing. After considering
all evidence, the Public Health Official or the Public Health Official’s appointee will
make a determination as to whether the premises constitute a hazardous site, as defined
herein, and issue a decision based upon all hearing evidence presented. If the Public
Health Official or the Public Health Official’s appointee makes a determination that
the premises constitute a hazardous site, the Public Health Official will then issue
orders to the manager, owner, or tenant of the premises to take corrective measures to
prevent high-risk sexual conduct from taking place within the premises and cause the
premises to be posted with a warning advising the public that the premises have been
declared a hazardous site.
c. If, within 30 days after issuance of the orders to the manager, owner, or
tenant of the hazardous site, the Public Health Official determines that such corrective
measures have not been undertaken, the Public Health Official:
1. May order the abatement of the hazardous site as a public nuisance, which may be
enforced by mandatory or prohibitory injunction in a court of competent
jurisdiction; or
2. May secure a court order for the closure of the premises constituting the hazardous
site until the premises, building, or structure is in compliance with all provisions of
this code.

EXCESSIVE FALSE ALARMS
PURPOSE
The City finds that the occurrence of false alarms is a threat to the public health and safety by
causing the unnecessary mobilization of emergency personnel and their diversion from other
locations or activities in which assistance may be needed. Many false alarms are caused by
equipment that is improperly installed or inadequately maintained or by inadvertent activation of
a system by a person legitimately on the premises. The City also recognizes that persons
suspecting the existence of an emergency should seek assistance immediately. In order to
balance these goals, the City seeks to encourage proper use and maintenance of alarm systems
and the implementation of sound security practices.
DEFINITIONS
For the purpose of this section of the municipal code, certain words or terms are defined as
follows:
ALARM SYSTEM means any equipment or device, designed or intended to signal the presence
of an emergency, such as a fire, unauthorized intrusion, crime in progress, or medical
emergency.
ALARM USER means the individual, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company or
organization of any kind occupying the premises where an alarm system is maintained. If the
occupant cannot be readily determined, the term “alarm user” means the owner of the premises
as determined by the real estate records of Hennepin County.
FALSE ALARM means the activation of an alarm system when a condition requiring emergency
fire, police, or ambulance response does not in fact exist and which is caused by mechanical
failure or malfunction; improper installation or maintenance; negligent use or maintenance of the
alarm system; or by the actions of a person or persons legitimately on the premises. Activations
caused by utility mishaps, unusual or unforeseen weather or climatic conditions, or other
circumstances reasonably beyond the control of the alarm user shall not constitute false alarms.
130-7
FALSE ALARM FEE
Any alarm user who incurs more than three (3) false alarms for police/fire emergencies at a
single address within any twelve (12) month period shall be required to pay a false alarm fee to
the City. The fee schedule shall be established by the City Council. The responding fire or
police department shall file a written report of each false alarm with the City Clerk/Treasurer.
Upon receipt of a report prepared by the responding Fire or Police Chief at a particular address
or premises, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall notify the alarm user of the provisions of this
ordinance and any fees due. If the alarm user is a tenant, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall also send
a copy of the notice to the property owner. The alarm user shall have ten days after receipt of the
notice to pay the fee required by this ordinance.
ASSESSMENT
On or about November 1 of each year, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall calculate the total of unpaid
false alarm fees attributable to each lot or property. After notice and hearing, the City Council
may levy unpaid fees against the properties as special assessments and administrative costs and
the City Clerk/Treasurer shall certify the same to the County Auditor for collection along with
taxes payable the following year.
