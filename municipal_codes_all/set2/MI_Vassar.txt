PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City 
of Vassar, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through 
July 8, 1985, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is 
included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note 
indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use 
of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 
1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

CODE INDEX

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under 
several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still 
others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item 
in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Allen Z. Paul, Supervising Editor, and Robert 
MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given 
to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Brian M. Kischnick, City Manager, for his cooperation and 
assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the 
publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily 
accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's 
affairs.

authorized or directed by the council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive 
permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement 
and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that 
they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become 
obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been 
inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in

(b) ?In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be 
excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c) ?When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or 
organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in 
ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to 
embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1) ?Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2) ?Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the 
Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;

numbers; 
(4) ?Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this 
article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting 
section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of 
the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5) ?Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance 
sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the 
meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the 
Code. 


Sec. 1-14. - Enforcement official/agent. 
    If sections of this Code do not directly name a city official who is responsible for carrying out 
enforcement provisions, the city council may direct any one of its employees, officers or other agency to 
perform the stated enforcement provisions. 


Sec. 1-15. - Conflicting regulations. 
    Where there is a difference or conflict between other provisions of this Code, or those contained in 
lawfully adopted county, state, city, federal or other governmental agency rules, regulations, ordinances 
or laws, the most liberal interpretation of the most restrictive or the one imposing the most desirable 
standard shall prevail. 


Sec. 1-16. - Notice. 
    Notice regarding sidewalk repairs, sewer or water connections, dangerous structures, abating 
nuisances or any other act, the expense of which if performed by the city may be assessed against the 
premises under the provisions of this Code, shall be served: 
(1) ?By delivering the notice to the owner personally or by leaving the same at his residence, office 
or place of business with some person of suitable age and discretion; 
(2) ?By mailing such notice by certified or registered mail to such owner at his last known address; 
or 
(3) ?If the owner is unknown, by posting such notice in some conspicuous place on the premises for 
five days. 
No person shall interfere with, obstruct, mutilate, conceal or tear down any official notice or placard 
posted by any city officer, unless permission is given by such officer to remove such notice. 


Sec. 1-17. - General penalty. 
(a) ?Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this Code for any particular provision or section, 
every person convicted of a violation of any provision of this Code, or any rule, regulation or order 
adopted or issued in pursuance thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500.00 and 
costs of prosecution or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or by both such fine, costs and 
imprisonment in the discretion of the court. Each act of violation and every day upon which any such 
violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b) ?The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the 
amendment of any section of this Code whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory 
ordinance. 
(c) ?The penalty shall be in addition to the abatement of the violating condition, any injunctive relief, or 
revocation of any permit or license. 
(d) ?The sanction for a violation which is a municipal civil infraction shall be a civil fine in the amount as 
provided by this Code or any ordinance, plus any costs, damages, expenses and other sanctions, as 
authorized under chapter 87 of Act No. 236 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1961 (MCL 600.101 et 
seq., MSA 27A.101 et seq.), as amended, and other applicable laws. 
(1) ?Unless otherwise specifically provided for a particular municipal civil infraction violation by this 
Code or any ordinance, the civil fine for a violation shall be not less than $50.00, plus costs and 
other sanctions, for each infraction. 
(2) ?Increased civil fines may be imposed for repeated violations by a person of any requirement or 
provision of this Code or any ordinance. As used in this section, the term "repeat offense" 
means a second (or any subsequent) municipal civil infraction violation of the same requirement 
or provision committed by a person within any six-month period, unless some other period is 
specifically provided by this Code or any ordinance, and for which the person admits 
responsibility or is determined to be responsible. Unless otherwise specifically provided by this 
Code or any ordinance for a particular municipal civil infraction violation, the increased fine for a 
repeat offense shall be as follows: 
a. ?The fine for any offense which is a first repeat offense shall be no less than $250.00, plus 
costs. 
b. ?The fine for any offense which is a second repeat offense or any subsequent repeat 
offense shall be no less than $500.00, plus costs. 
(e) ?A violation includes any act which is prohibited or made or declared to be unlawful or an offense by 
this Code or any ordinance; and any omission or failure to act where the act is required by this Code 
or any ordinance. 
(f) ?Each day on which any violation of this Code or any ordinance continues constitutes a separate 
offense and shall be subject to penalties or sanctions as a separate offense. 
(g) ?In addition to any remedies available at law, the city may bring an action for an injunction or other 
process against a person to restrain, prevent, or abate any violation of this Code or any city 
ordinance.

plan, for adequate and convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, access of firefighting apparatus, 
recreation, light and air and for the avoidance of congestion of population, including minimum width 
and area of lots. Such regulations may include provisions as to the extent to which streets and other 
ways shall be graded and improved and to which water and sewer and other utility mains, piping or 
other facilities shall be installed as a condition precedent to the approval of the plat. The regulations 
or practice of the planning commission may provide for a tentative approval of the plat previous to 
such installation. Any such tentative approval shall be revocable and shall not be entered on the plat. 
In lieu of the completion of such improvements and utilities prior to the final approval of the plat, the 
planning commission may accept a bond with surety to secure to the city the actual construction and 
installation of such improvements or utilities at a time and according to specifications fixed by or in 
accordance with the regulations of the planning commission. The city shall have the power to 
enforce such bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies.

that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand. The applicant for the planning 
commission's approval may waive the requirement of this section and consent to an extension of such 
period. The grounds for disapproval of any plat shall be stated upon the records of the planning 
commission. Any plat submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name and address of a 
person to whom notice of a hearing shall be sent. No plat shall be acted on by the planning commission 
without affording a hearing thereon. Notice shall be sent to the address by registered mail of the time and

to the owners of land immediately adjoining the platted land, as their names appear upon the plats in the 
county treasurer's office and their addresses appear in the directory of the city, or on the tax records of 
the city or county. Every plat approved by the planning commission shall, by virtue of such approval, be 
deemed to be an amendment of or an addition to or a detail of the city plan and a part thereof. Approval 
of a plat shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the public of any street or other 
open space shown upon the plat. The planning commission may, from time to time, recommend to the 
council amendments of the zoning ordinance or map, or additions thereto to conform to the planning 
commission's recommendations for the zoning regulations of the territory comprised within approved 
subdivisions. The planning commission shall have the power to agree with the applicant upon use, height, 
area or bulk requirements or restrictions governing buildings and premises within the subdivision, 
provided such requirements or restrictions do not authorize the violation of the then effective zoning 
ordinance of the city. Such requirements or restrictions shall be stated upon the plat prior to the approval 
and recording thereof and shall have the same force of law and be enforceable in the same sanctions and 
penalties and subject to the same power of amendment or repeal as though set out as a part of the 
zoning ordinance or map of the city.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 


Sec. 42-31. - Purpose and intent of article. 
    It is the purpose and intent of this article to promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the 
people of the city and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding conditions by restricting or 
prohibiting certain uses dangerous to health, safety and welfare within designated floodprone areas; to 
require uses vulnerable to floods to be protected against flood damage at the time of construction; to 
control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, drains or devices; to control the filling, 
grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; to prevent or 
regulate the construction of flood barriers which may unnaturally divert floodwaters or increase flood 
hazards to other lands; to protect life and health; to minimize the expenditure of public funds for flood 
control projects or flood relief efforts; to minimize prolonged business interruptions; to minimize damage 
to public facilities and utilities including, but not limited to, gas mains, electric power lines, cable TV, 
telephone and sewer lines, water mains, streets, bridges and public buildings; to maintain a stable tax 
base by providing for sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize 
future flood blight areas; to ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is within a floodprone 
area; to define a floodplain management zone; and to provide for a system of permit fees for enforcement 
of this article. 
(Ord. No. 58O, art. I, 8-28-89; Amd. of 4-5-04) 


Sec. 42-32. - Floodplain management zone. 
    The floodplain management zone shall be defined by reference to the 100-year base flood elevation 
designated by FEMA, so represented by the flood hazard boundary map H-01, as amended. Such map is 
hereby made a part of this article. The floodway map of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is 
floodway map 01-F. Such map is made a part of this article. The flood insurance study and flood 
insurance rate map dated July 2, 2004, for the city shall be the official map for determinations and 
regulation pursuant to this article. 
(Ord. No. 58O, art. III, 8-28-89; Ord. of 7-19-99; Amd. of 4-5-04) 


Sec. 42-33. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed 
to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the building official's interpretation of any provision of this 
article or a request for a variance. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given 
year as defined by FEMA or its successors. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not 
limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling, 
remodeling or construction. 
    Flood or flooding means a general or temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of 
normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland waters or the unusual and rapid accumulation of 
runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of the city, dated July 2, 2004, on which 
FEMA or its successors has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium 
zones applicable to the community. 
    Floodplain management zone means those areas designated on the flood insurance rate map 
(FIRM) dated July 2, 2004, in zones labeled A, AE, AH, A0 and A99. Floodway means the channel of a 
river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the 
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one-tenth of a foot. 
    New construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the 
effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. New construction shall include 
substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of 
construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the building 
permit date. 
    Start of construction means the issuance of a building permit from the city or a soil erosion and 
sedimentation permit. Start of construction includes substantial improvement and means the date the 
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or 
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above the ground, including a gas or 
liquid storage facility and a manufactured home. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of 
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or 
repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage 
occurred. For the purposes of this definition substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first 
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that 
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either any 
project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code 
specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, or any alterations of a structure 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article which permits 
construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would result in 
unnecessary hardship.

Sec. 42-60. - Variance procedures. 
    Whenever a proposed developer alleges that the building official has erred in his interpretation of this 
article or believes strict enforcement of the provisions of this article would constitute an unnecessary 
hardship without further benefiting the intent and purpose of this article, upon written request given to the 
building official the developer may seek relief in the form of a variance in the building official's 
determination from the building board of appeals. 
(Ord. No. 580, art. V, § 5, 8-28-89; Amd. of 4-5-04) 


Sec. 42-61. - Building board of appeals procedures.

conditions to the approval of a variance as it deems appropriate for the enhancement of the purposes of 
this article. Variances shall not, however, be issued within the designated floodway if any increase in 
flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. Variances may be issued only after a 
determination that the variance to be issued is the minimum necessary to afford relief or that the building 
official erred in his interpretation of this article. Variances may be issued only after a showing of good and 
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to 
the applicant, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, 
additional threats to public safety, public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the 
public or conflict with existing laws, statutes or ordinances.

    According to chapter 44, section 60.6(a).5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, any applicant to 
whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that: 
(1) ?The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in 
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of 
insurance coverage; and 
(2) ?Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. 
(Ord. No. 58O, art. V, § 8, 8-28-89; Ord. of 7-19-99; Amd. of 4-5-04) 


Sec. 42-64. - Interpretation of article. 
    In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be considered as minimum 
requirements, liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal 
any powers granted under state statute or local ordinances. Whenever this article shall be in conflict or 
overlap another statute or ordinance, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

Sec. 42-87. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas requiring the issuance of a floodplain management permit, under authority of Act No. 451 
of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1994 (MCL 324.101 et seq., MSA 13A.10l et seq.), as amended, which 
prohibits habitation within the floodway, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1) ?Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential 
structure shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to or above one foot 
above the base flood elevation. 
(2) ?Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, 
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including the 
basement, elevated to or above one foot above the base flood elevation or, together with 
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be fioodproofed so that below one foot above the base 
flood level the structure is watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of 
water, and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and 
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A licensed professional engineer or architect shall 
certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. 
(3) ?Floodways. Since the floodway is extremely hazardous due to the velocity of floodwaters which 
carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, encroachments, including fill, new 
construction, and other developments, unless certified by a professional licensed engineer as 
providing for no increase in flood levels, shall be prohibited. Residential structures in the 
floodway shall be deemed nonconforming in accordance with ch. 86-523, city zoning ordinance. 
(4) ?Attached garages. Attached garages may be approved as a variance by the building board of 
appeals. Attached garages are to be treated the same as an enclosure below the lowest 
elevated floor of a building. The lowest floor of the garage does not have to be considered the 
lowest floor of the residence if it was used solely for parking, building access or incidental 
storage, and meets the following criteria: 
a. ?No machinery or equipment which services a building, such as furnaces, air conditioners, 
heat pumps, hot water heaters, washers, dryers, elevator lift equipment, electrical junction 
and circuit breaker boxes, and food freezers, is permitted below the base flood elevation. 
b. ?All interior wall, floor and ceiling materials located below the base flood elevation must be 
unfinished and resistant to flood damage. 
c. ?The walls of any enclosed area below the base flood elevation must be constructed in a 
manner to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement of the structure, and be 
equipped with permanent vents, valves, or other openings to permit the automatic entry 
and exit of flood waters. 
d. ?If laundry equipment or a workshop were placed in an attached garage, it would no longer 
be used for parking, building access or storage, and the floor of the garage would have to

the premises served and collected and returned in the same manner as other city taxes are certified, 
assessed, collected and returned.

addition to the right of the city to proceed as provided in this article.

Sec. 62-2. - Initiation of special assessment projects. 
(a) ?Proceedings for the making of public improvements within the city may be commenced by resolution 
of the council, on its own initiative or by an initiatory petition signed by property owners whose 
aggregate property in the special assessment district was assessed for more than 50 percent of the 
total assessed value of the privately owned real property located therein, in accordance with the last 
proceeding general assessment roll; provided, however, that in the case of special assessments for 
paving or similar improvements which are normally assessed on a frontage basis against abutting 
property, such petitions shall be signed by the owners of more than 50 percent of the frontage of 
property to be assessed. 
(b) ?Such petitions shall contain, in addition to the signatures of the owners, a brief description of the 
property owned by the respective signers thereof. 
(c) ?Such petitions shall be verified by the affidavit of one or more of the owners or by some persons

Sec. 62-3. - Survey and report. 
    Before the council shall consider the making of any local or public improvement, the proposed 
improvement shall be referred by resolution to the city manager directing him to prepare a report which 
shall include necessary plans, profiles, specifications and estimates of cost; an estimate of the life of the 
improvement; a description of the assessment districts and such other pertinent information as will permit 
the council to decide the cost, extent, and necessity of the improvement proposed and what part or 
proportion thereof should be paid by special assessments upon the property especially benefited; and 
what part, if any, should be paid by the city at large. The council shall not determine to proceed with the 
making of any local or special improvement until such report of the city manager has been filed, nor until 
after a public hearing has been held by the council for the purpose of hearing objections to the making of 
such public improvement. 
(Code 1983, § 1.113) 


Sec. 62-4. - Cost of condemned property to be added. 
    Whenever any property is acquired by condemnation, or otherwise, for the purpose of any special

to the cost of such special improvement. 
(Code 1983, § 1.114) 


Sec. 62-5. - Determination on the project. 
    After the city manager has presented the report required in section 62-3 for making any local or 
public improvement, as requested in the resolution of the council, and the council has reviewed such 
report, a resolution may be passed determining the necessity of the improvement; setting forth the nature 
thereof; prescribing what part or proportion of the cost of such improvement shall be paid by special 
assessment upon the property especially benefited, determination of benefits received by affected 
properties and what part, if any, shall be paid by the city at large; designating the limits of the special 
assessment district to be affected; designating whether to be assessed according to frontage or other 
benefits; placing the complete information on file in the office of the clerk where the same may be found 
for examination; and directing the clerk to publish a notice of public hearing on the proposed 
improvement, at which time and place opportunity will be given interested persons to be heard. Such 
notice shall be made by one publication in a newspaper published or circulated within the city at least one 
week prior to the holding of the hearing. Such notice shall also be given to each owner of or party 
interested in property to be assessed, whose name appears upon the last local tax assessment records, 
by mailing by first class mail addressed to such owner or party at the address shown on the tax records, 
at least ten days before the date of such hearing. The last local tax assessment records means the last 
assessment roll for ad valorem purposes which has been reviewed by the local board of review, as 
supplemented by any subsequent changes in the names or the addresses of such owners or parties 
listed thereon. The hearing required by this section may be held at any regular, adjourned or special

owners of more than 50 percent of the frontage to be assessed for any such improvement shall object in 
writing to the proposed improvement, the improvement shall not be made by proceedings authorized by 
this chapter without a four-fifths vote of the members of the council. 
(Code 1983, § 1.116) 


Sec. 62-7. - Hearing on necessity. 
    At the public hearing on the proposed improvement all persons interested shall be given an 
opportunity to be heard, after which the council may modify the scope of the public improvement in such a 
manner as it shall deem to be in the best interest of the city as a whole; provided, however, that if the 
amount of work is increased or additions are made to the district, then another hearing shall be held 
pursuant to notice prescribed in section 62-5. If the determinations of the council shall be to proceed with 
the improvement, a resolution shall be passed approving the necessary profiles, plans, specifications, 
assessment district and detailed estimates of cost, and directing the assessor to prepare a special 
assessment roll in accordance with the council's determination and report the same to the council for 
confirmation. Such resolution shall set forth the nature of the improvement, designate the limits of the 
special assessment district to be affected, prescribe what part or portion of the cost of such improvement 
shall be paid by special assessment upon the property benefited, and what part (if any) shall be paid by 
the city at large, specify the manner and method of paying for or financing the same in each case and 
determine whether the cost of the improvement shall be spread upon a special assessment roll before or 
after the improvement has been completed. 
(Code 1983, § 1.117) 


Sec. 62-8. - Special assessment roll. 
(a) ?Upon receiving such order and directions, the assessor shall make out an assessment roll, entering 
and describing therein all the lots, premises and parcels of land to be assessed, with the names of 
the persons if known, chargeable with the assessment thereof, and shall levy thereon and against 
such persons the amount to be assessed, in the manner directed by the council. In all cases where 
the ownership of any description is unknown, the assessor shall, in lieu of the name of the owner, 
insert "unknown," and, if by mistake or otherwise, any person shall be improperly designated as the 
owner of any lot, parcel of land or premises, or if the same shall be assessed without the name of the 
owner, or in the wrong name, such assessment shall not, for any such cause, be vitiated, but shall, in 
all respects, be valid upon and against such lot, parcel of land or premises as though assessed in 
the name of the proper owner, and when the assessment roll shall have been confirmed, be a lien on 
such lot, parcel of land or premises, and collected as in other case. 
(b) ?The amount spread in each case shall be based upon the detailed estimate of the city manager as 
approved by the city council. 
(Code 1983, § 1.118) 


Sec. 62-9. - Deviation from plans and specifications. 
    No deviation from original plans or specifications as adopted, materially increasing the cost, shall be 
permitted by any officer or employee of the city without the authority of the council by resolution. A copy 
of the resolution authorizing such changes or deviation shall be certified by the clerk and attached to the 
original plans and specifications on file in his office. 
(Code 1983, § 1.119) 


Sec. 62-10. - Limitations on preliminary expenses. 
    No contract or expenditure except for the cost of preparing necessary profiles, plans, specifications 
and estimates of cost shall be made for the improvement until special assessments to defray the costs of 
the same shall have been levied. 
(Code 1983, § 1.120) 


Sec. 62-11. - Assessor to file assessment roll. 
    When the assessor shall have completed such assessment roll, he shall certify and file the

Sec. 62-12. - Review of special assessment roll; objections to be placed in writing. 
    Upon receipt of such special assessment roll, the council, by resolution, shall accept such 
assessment roll and order it to be filed in the office of the clerk for public examination; shall fix the time 
and place the council will meet to review such special assessment roll; and direct the clerk to publish a 
notice of a public hearing for the purpose of giving an opportunity for interested persons to be heard. 
Such notice shall be made by one publication at least one week prior to the holding of the hearing. Such 
notice shall also be given to each owner of or party interested in property to be assessed, whose name 
appears upon the last local tax assessment records, by mailing by first class mail addressed to such 
owner or party at the address shown on the tax records at least ten days before the date of such hearing. 
The last local tax assessment record means the last assessment roll for ad valorem tax purposes which 
has been reviewed by the local board of review as supplemented by any subsequent changes in the 
names or the addresses of such owners or parties listed thereon. The hearing required by this section 
may be held at any regular, adjourned or special meeting of the council. At this meeting all interested 
persons or parties shall present in writing their objections, if any, to the assessments against them. The 
assessor shall be present at every meeting of the council at which a special assessment roll is to be 
reviewed. 
(Code 1983, § 1.122) 


Sec. 62-13. - Changes and corrections in assessment roll. 
    The council shall meet at the time and place designated for the review of such special assessment 
roll and, at such meeting, or a proper adjournment thereof, shall consider all objections thereto submitted, 
in writing. The council may correct the roll as to any special assessment description of any lot or parcel of 
land or other errors appearing therein; or it may, by resolution, annul such assessment roll and the same 
proceedings shall be followed in making a new roll as in the making of the original roll. If after hearing all 
objections, and making a record of such changes as the council deems justified, the council determines it 
is satisfied with the special assessment roll, and that assessments are in proportion to benefits received, 
it shall thereupon pass a resolution reciting such determinations, confirming such roll, placing it on file in 
the office of the clerk and directing the clerk to attach his warrant to a certified copy within ten days, 
therein commanding the assessor to spread the various sums and amounts appearing thereon on a 
special assessment roll or upon the tax rolls of the city for the full amounts or in annual installments as 
directed by the council. Such roll shall have a date of confirmation endorsed thereon and shall from that 
date be final and conclusive for the purpose of the improvement to which it applied, subject only to 
adjustment to conform to the actual cost of the improvement, as provided in section 62-20. 
(Code 1983, § 1.123) 


Sec. 62-14. - Special assessments; due date. 
    All special assessments, except such installments as the council shall make payable at a future time 
as provided in this chapter, shall be due and payable upon confirmation of the special assessment roll. 
(Code 1983, § 1.124) 


Sec. 62-15. - Annual installments; when due. 
    The council may provide for the payment of special assessments in annual installments. Such 
annual installments shall not exceed 20 in number, the first installment being due each time after 
completion of the project for which the special assessment is made as the council shall determine. 
Interest shall be charged on all deferred installments at the market rate, payable annually. 
(Res. No. 31A, 3-26-90) 


Sec. 62-16. - Collection from assessment roll. 
    When any special assessment shall be confirmed, and the council shall direct the assessment so 
made in the special assessment roll to be collected directly therefrom or from the general tax rolls, the city 
clerk shall attach his warrant to a certified copy of the special assessment roll, therein commanding the 
city treasurer to collect from each of the persons assessed in such roll the amount of money assessed to 
and set opposite his name therein, and in case any person named in the roll shall neglect or refuse to pay 
his assessment upon demand, then to levy and collect the assessment by distress and sale of the goods 
and chattels of such person and return the roll and warrant, together with his doings thereon, within 60 
days from the date of such warrant. 
(Code 1983, § 1.126) 


Sec. 62-17. - Collection by treasurer. 
    Upon receiving the assessment roll and warrant, the city treasurer shall proceed to collect the 
amounts assessed therein. If any person shall neglect or refuse to pay his assessment upon demand, the 
treasurer may seize and levy upon any personal property found within the city, or elsewhere within the 
county, belonging to such person, and sell the same at public auction, first giving six days' notice of the 
time and place of such sale, by posting such notice in three of the most public places in the city or 
township where such property may be found. The proceeds of such sale, or so much thereof as may be 
necessary for that purpose, shall be applied to the payment of the assessment, and a percentage of five 
percent upon the amount of the assessment for the costs and expenses of such seizure and sale, and the 
surplus, if any, shall be paid to the person entitled thereto. 
(Code 1983, § 1.127) 


Sec. 62-18. - Delinquent special assessments. 
    Special assessments and all interest and charges thereon, from the date of confirmation of the roll, 
shall be and remain a lien upon the property assessed of the same character and effect as the lien 
created by general law for state and county taxes, and by the city Charter for city taxes, until paid. From 
such date after confirmation, as shall be fixed by the council, the same collection fee, penalties and 
interest shall be paid on delinquent special assessments and upon delinquent installments of such special 
assessments as are provided by the Charter to be paid on delinquent city taxes. In case any assessment 
or any part thereof shall remain unpaid on the first Monday of May following the date when the same shall 
become delinquent, the assessment shall be reported unpaid by the treasurer to the council, and such 
delinquent assessments, together with all accrued interest shall be transferred and reassessed on the 
next annual city tax roll in a column headed "special assessments" with a penalty of four percent upon 
such total amount added thereto, and when so transferred and reassessed upon such tax roll shall be 
collected in all respects as provided for the collection of city taxes. 
(Code 1983, § 1.128) 


Sec. 62-19. - Assessment for abating hazards and nuisances. 
    If it shall become necessary to abate a hazard or nuisance as described in section 7.9 of the Charter 
of the city, the council shall determine what amount or part of each such expense shall be charged, and 
the person, if known, against whom and the premises upon which, the same shall be levied as a special 
assessment; and as often as the council shall deem it expedient, it shall require all of the several amounts 
so reported and determined, and the several lots or premises and the persons chargeable therewith 
respectively to be notified by the clerk either by registered mail sent to their last known address as shown 
on the assessment roll of the city or by publication. Such notice shall state the basis of the assessment, 
the cost thereof, and shall give a reasonable time, which shall not be less than 30 days, in which payment 
shall be made. In all cases where payment is not made within the time limit, the nonpayment shall be 
reported by the clerk to the assessor who shall spread such amounts against the several persons or 
descriptions of real property chargeable therewith on the next roll for the collection of city taxes. 
(Code 1983, § 1.129) 


Sec. 62-20. - Additional assessment; refunds. 
    When any special assessment roll shall prove insufficient to meet the costs of the improvement for 
which it was made, the council may make an additional pro rata assessment, but the total amount 
assessed shall not exceed the value of benefits received by any lot or parcel of land. Should the 
assessment prove larger than necessary to five percent or less, the council may place the excess in the 
city treasury; if more than five percent, then the excess shall be refunded pro rata according to 
assessments. In either case, the council may provide by resolution that the amount of any such excess 
may be allowed as a credit on the last installment where such installment still remains unpaid at the time 
the final cost of the improvement is determined. 
(Code 1983, § 1.130) 


Sec. 62-21. - Additional procedures. 
    In case where the provisions of this chapter may prove to be insufficient to carry into full effect the 
making of any special assessment, the council shall provide by ordinance any additional steps or 
procedures required. 
(Code 1983, § 1.131)

Sec. 72-22. - Preamble 
    It is acknowledged that it is a proper public purpose of the state and its political subdivisions to 
provide housing for its citizens of low to moderate income and to encourage the development of such 
housing by providing for a service charge in lieu of property taxes in accordance with the State Housing 
Development Authority Act of 1966 (1966 PA 346, as amended, MCLA § 125.1401 et seq.). The city is 
authorized by this act to establish or change the service charge to be paid in lieu of taxes by any or all 
classes of housing exempt from taxation under this act at any amount it chooses not to exceed the taxes 
that would be paid but for this act. It is further acknowledged that such housing for persons of low to 
moderate income is a public necessity, and as the city will be benefited and improved by such housing, 
the encouragement of the same by providing certain real estate tax exemption for such housing is a valid 
public purpose; further, that the continuance of the provisions of this article for tax exemption and the 
service charge in lieu of taxes during the period contemplated in this article are essential to the

county road commission having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and load is unlawful 
may require the driver to stop and submit to a weighing of the vehicle by either portable or stationary 
scales approved and sealed by the department of agriculture as a legal weighing device, and may 
require that the vehicle be driven to the nearest weighing station of the state transportation 
department for the purpose of allowing an officer or agent of the state transportation department or 
county road commission to determine whether the conveyance is loaded in conformity with this 
article. 
(b) ?Shifting or removal of load; impounding vehicle for nonpayment of fines and costs; lien; appearance 
before judge or magistrate; powers of agents of highway department or county road commission. 
When the officer or agent, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that the weight is unlawful, 
the officer or agent may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing 
until that portion of the load is shifted or removed as necessary to reduce the gross axle load weight 
of the vehicle to the limit permitted under this chapter. All material unloaded as provided under this 
subsection shall be cared for by the owner or operator of the vehicle at the risk of the owner or 
operator. A judge or magistrate imposing a civil fine and costs under this section which are not paid 
in full immediately or for which a bond is not immediately posted in double the amount of the civil fine 
and costs shall order the driver or owner to move the vehicle at the driver's own risk to a place of 
safekeeping within the jurisdiction of the judge or magistrate, inform the judge or magistrate in writing 
of the place of safekeeping, and keep the vehicle until the fine and costs are paid or sufficient bond 
is furnished or until the judge or magistrate is satisfied that the fine and costs will be paid. The officer 
or agent who has determined, after weighing a vehicle and load, that the weight is unlawful may 
require the driver to proceed to a judge or magistrate within the county. If the judge or magistrate is 
satisfied that the probable civil fine and costs will be paid by the owner or lessee, the judge or 
magistrate may allow the driver to proceed, after the load is made legal. If the judge or magistrate is 
not satisfied that the owner or lessee, after a notice and a right to be heard on the merits is given, will 
pay the amount of the probable civil fine and costs, the judge or magistrate may order the vehicle to 
be impounded until trial on the merits is completed under conditions set forth in this section for the 
impounding of vehicles after the civil fine and costs have been imposed. Removal of the vehicle, and 
forwarding, care, or preservation of the load shall be under the control of and at the risk of the owner 
or driver. Vehicles impounded shall be subject to a lien, subject to a prior valid bona fide lien of prior 
record, in the amount of the civil fine and costs and if the civil fine and costs are not paid within 90 
days after the seizure, the judge or magistrate shall certify the unpaid judgment to the city attorney, 
who shall proceed to enforce the lien by foreclosure sale in accordance with procedure authorized in 
the case of chattel mortgage foreclosures. When the duly authorized agent of the state transportation 
department or county road commission is performing duties under this chapter, the agent shall have 
all the powers conferred upon peace officers by the general laws of this state. 
(c) ?Penalty for weight violation. An owner of a vehicle or a lessee of the vehicle of an owner-operator, 
or other person, who causes or allows a vehicle to be loaded and driven or moved on a highway, 
when the weight of that vehicle violates section 74-163 is responsible for a civil infraction and shall 
pay a civil fine in an amount equal to $0.03 per pound for each pound of excess load over 1,000 
pounds when the excess is 2,000 pounds or less; $0.06 per pound of excess load when the excess 
is over 2,000 pounds but not over 3,000 pounds; $0.09 per pound for each pound of excess load 
when the excess is over 3,000 pounds but not over 4,000 pounds; $0.12 per pound for each pound 
of excess load when the excess is over 4,000 pounds but not over 5,000 pounds; $0.15 per pound 
for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 5,000 pounds but not over 10,000 pounds; 
and $0.20 per pound for each pound of excess load when the excess is over 10,000 pounds. 
However, the court shall have discretionary power as to the amount of the civil fine within the 
schedule provided in this subsection and may impose the civil fine provided in section 907(3) of the 
state vehicle code for a civil infraction where, at the time of the violation, either the motor vehicle, 
motor vehicle and semitrailer, or trailer did not exceed the total weight which would be lawful for each 
unit by a proper distribution of the load upon the various axles supporting each unit. 
(d) ?Failure to stop at or avoidance of weight scales; penalty. A driver or owner of a vehicle, truck or 
truck tractor, truck or truck tractor with other vehicles in combination, or special mobile equipment 
who knowingly fails to stop at or who knowingly bypasses any scales or weighing station is guilty of a 
misdemeanor. 
(e) ?Use of duly marked vehicle by agent. An agent or authorized representative of the state 
transportation department or a county road commission shall not stop a truck or vehicle in movement 
upon a road or highway within the state for any purpose, unless the agent or authorized 
representative is driving a duly marked vehicle, clearly showing and denoting the branch of 
government represented. 
(f) ?Failure to stop vehicle when requested to. A driver or owner of a vehicle who knowingly fails to stop 
when requested or ordered to do so by a police officer, or a duly authorized agent of the state 
transportation department, or a representative or agent of a county road commission, authorized to

than a full billing period shall be billed and paid on a prorated basis. There shall be no proration of 
rates for metered premises which are connected to the sewer system for less than a full billing 
period.

as needed by the city council by resolution. 
(i) ?Nonwater users and dischargers. Should any customer be connected to the city sanitary sewer 
systems, but use no city water, and should that customer discharge no industrial or commercial 
process water to the sanitary sewers, then that customer shall be charged the same rate charged to 
residential customers. 
(j) ?Rate setting. The city council shall, from time to time, establish by resolution any administrative 
charges, capital charges, service charges, debt service charges, special charges and any other type 
of fee or charge related to the connection to, or use of, the sewer treatment process and distribution 
system. 
(k) ?Free service. No free service shall be provided to anyone served by the sewer system, and there

ARTICLE XI. - PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 


Sec. 86-371. - Intent of article; minimum requirements. 
(a) ?The intent of this article is to provide a degree of flexibility in regard to the use, area, height, bulk 
and placement regulations for relatively large-scale developments which qualify as planned unit 
developments. These may include, but are not limited to, housing developments, shopping centers, 
industrial districts, office districts, and medical and educational complexes. 
(b) ?A development may be of such large size as to justify permitting certain incidental uses not normally 
permitted in the zoning district. Permitting these uses as special exceptions can in certain cases 
increase convenience, be compatible with the overall character of the district, and not be injurious to 
the adjoining properties. 
(c) ?A planned unit development shall be considered a unique use of land which, although comprised of 
numerous structures of varying types, shall be accorded regulatory treatment under this chapter as a 
single entity. Subject to the foregoing statements of intent for this article, the board of appeals may, 
upon application, approve a planned unit development through issuance of a special exception 
permit. Within each planned unit development the use, area, height, bulk and placement regulations 
of the zoning district may be modified; provided, however, that such modifications shall comply with 
the provisions of this article and the standards established in article XIII of this chapter. While it is the 
intent of this article to promote diverse and innovative design, and it is to be anticipated that each 
planned unit development will possess a unique and distinctive design, all planned unit 
developments shall promote the spirit and intent of this chapter, as well as the public health, safety 
and welfare, and each shall be given equal regulatory consideration, recognizing the principles of 
due process, in accord with the procedures specified in this article and the procedures required for 
approval of special exceptions. 
(d) ?A planned unit development must constitute a land area of at least 20 acres to be occupied by 
principal buildings with more than 25,000 square feet of usable floor area. The development shall be 
designed as an entity, intended to be substantially completed within three years if less than 50 acres, 
and five years if more than 50 acres. 
(e) ?All planned unit developments in RA-1, RA-2 and RA-3 districts shall be in compliance with the 
following regulations: 
(1) ?A maximum of ten percent of the total developed area may be utilized for uses that are 
permitted in the B-1 and B-2 business districts. 
(2) ?A maximum of five percent of the total developed area may be utilized for industrial uses that 
are permitted in I-1 light industrial district and which are deemed compatible pursuant to this 
chapter, with the residential character of the planned unit development. 
(3) ?No business or industrial use or any building devoted primarily to a commercial or industrial 
use shall be built or established prior to the residential buildings or uses which it is developed or 
intended to serve. 
(4) ?The minimum area, dimensions and setbacks of individual buildings and lots may be reduced, 
provided the total number and density of dwellings shall be increased by no more than 20 
percent greater than that which would ordinarily result under the district regulations. Land 
accruing from reduction in lot requirements shall be laid out, developed and perpetually 
reserved for open space, recreational and conservation purposes. 
(5) ?A minimum of 20 percent of the land developed in any residential planned unit development 
shall be reserved for common open space and noncommercial recreational facilities for the 
residents and users of the area being developed. 
(6) ?A maximum of 15 percent of the total developed area may be utilized for multiple-family 
residential use. 
(7) ?The minimum yard setbacks along the perimeter of the planned unit development shall be 
equal to the setback requirements of the existing districts of RA-1, RA-2, and RA-3. 
(Ord. of 5-6-02) 


Sec. 86-372. - Criteria of determination. 
    The planning commission in determining its recommendation for approval or disapproval and the 
board of appeals in determining its approval or disapproval of the proposed planned unit development 
shall determine and report that the proposal meets, in addition to the specifications of section 86-372 and 
this article, the following requirements: 
(1) ?A planned unit development proposal shall comply with the intent and purposes of this article. 
(2) ?A planned unit development proposal shall promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
(3) ?A planned unit development proposal shall:

b. ?Be of a population density which will not overburden existing or immediately projected 
schools, parks, roadways, public utilities and other public facilities; 
c. ?Incorporate a transportation pattern consistent and complementary with existing and 
immediately projected transportation systems in the city; 
d. ?Be designed in a manner to ensure healthful living conditions and adequate light, air and 
accessibility for fire and police and recreation needs for the inhabitants and users of the 
development, as well as adjacent residents; and 
e. ?Be compatible with the objectives and specific elements of the general development plan 
officially adopted by the city.

the main building or the setback required in section 86-127 or this section, whichever is greater. 
(3) ?The side yard abutting upon a street shall not be less than ten feet when there is a common 
rear yard relationship in such block and a common side yard relationship with the block directly 
across the common separating street. In the case of a rear yard abutting a side yard of an 
adjacent lot, the side yard abutting a street shall not be less than the required minimum front 
yard of the district. 
(4) ?The minimum floor area per dwelling unit shall be:

ARTICLE XV. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS 


Sec. 86-521. - Conflicting regulations. 
    Wherever any provision of this chapter imposes more stringent requirements, regulations, 
restrictions or limitations than are imposed or required by the provisions of any other law or ordinance, 
then the provisions of this chapter shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other law or ordinance 
impose more stringent requirements than are imposed or required by this chapter, then the provisions of 
such ordinance shall govern. 
(Ord. of 5-6-02) 


Sec. 86-522. - Scope of chapter. 
    No building or structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be erected, constructed or altered and 
maintained, and no new use or change shall be made or maintained of any building, structure or land, or 
part thereof, except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. of 5-6-02) 


Sec. 86-523. - Nonconforming lots, nonconforming uses of land, nonconforming structures, and 
nonconforming uses of structures and premises. 
(a) ?Intent. Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted 
there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful 
before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted 
under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these 
nonconformities to continue until they are removed. It is further the intent of this chapter that 
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for 
adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. Nonconforming uses are 
declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A 
nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be 
extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or premises of 
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a 
nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing 
in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of 
any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of the 
ordinance from which this chapter is derived and upon which actual building construction has been 
carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction 
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or 
demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, 
such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that 
work shall be carried on diligently. 
(b) ?Nonconforming lots of record. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the 
effective date of the adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, 
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter. This provision shall apply 
even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally 
applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying 
to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is 
located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the board of appeals. 
If two or more vacant lots or combinations of vacant lots and portions of vacant lots with continuous 
frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage (February 13, 1978) or amendment 
of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and 
area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this 
chapter, and no portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes 
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of 
any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this 
chapter. 
(c) ?Nonconforming uses of land (or land with minor structures only). Where at the time of passage of 
this chapter (February 13, 1978) lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the 
regulations imposed by this chapter, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise 
lawful, provided: 
(1) ?No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater 
area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption (February 13, 1978) or 
amendment of this chapter. 
(2) ?No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or 
parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption (February 13, 
1978) or amendment of this chapter. 
(3) ?If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than one 
year, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter 
for the district in which such land is located. 
(4) ?No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this chapter shall be erected in 
connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
(d) ?Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption 
(February 13, 1978) or amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this 
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot or other 
requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains 
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1) ?No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its 
nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its 
nonconformity. 
(2) ?Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by 
any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it 
shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
(3) ?Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter 
conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(e) ?Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination. If a lawful use of a 
structure, or of a structure and land in combination exists at the effective date of adoption (February 
13, 1978) or amendment of this chapter, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of 
this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the 
following provisions: 
(1) ?No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is 
located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered 
except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
(2) ?Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were 
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption (February 13, 1978) or 
amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such 
building. 
(3) ?If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and 
premises, may as a special exception be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that 
the board of appeals, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find 
that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing 
nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the board of appeals may require appropriate 
conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this chapter. 
(4) ?Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is 
superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and 
the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(5) ?When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is 
discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-year 
period (except when government action impeded access to the premises), the structure, or 
structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the 
regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(6) ?When nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal 
or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction 
for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage or dilapidation to an extent of more than 
50 percent of the replacement cost at time of destruction. 
(f) ?Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a 
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, 
or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not 
exceeding 20 percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or 
nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing 
when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. If a nonconforming structure or portion of a 
structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of 
repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by 
reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in 
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Nonconforming porches built 
within the required setback of a dwelling unit are exempt from the provisions of this section provided 
such porches are reconstructed in the current layout and with the same dimensions. Nothing in this 
chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building 
or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon 
order of such official. 
(g) ?Class A nonconforming uses or structures. It is recognized that the continuation of certain 
nonconformities may be appropriate. To address these circumstances, the zoning ordinance 
establishes procedures to allow the planning commission to designate specific nonconforming uses 
or structures as "Class A." 
(1) ?Effect of Class A designation. 
a. ?Class A nonconforming uses may be reestablished if the housing structure is damaged or 
destroyed. 
b. ?Class A nonconforming uses may be reestablished when otherwise meeting the standards 
for abandonment of the use. The Class A nonconforming use may not be reestablished if it 
is replaced with a conforming use. 
c. ?Class A nonconforming uses, structures housing nonconforming uses and nonconforming 
structures may be repaired and maintained. 
d. ?Class A nonconforming structures may be rebuilt if the structure is damaged or destroyed. 
e. ?Rights granted nonconforming uses and structures listed above are contingent on 
compliance with any standards imposed by the Planning Commission as part of the Class 
A designation, including compliance with any approved site plan. 
(2) ?Class A designation process. 
a. ?An applicant for Class A designation shall submit an application and a fee of $250.00 to the 
city manager or their designee. 
b. ?Notice of a public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the 
city at least 15 days before the date of the public hearing and mail such notice to all 
persons to whom real property is assessed within three hundred (300) feet of the property. 
c. ?The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the Class A designation. 
d. ?The planning commission shall approve with conditions or deny the request for Class A 
designation. 
e. ?The planning commission may impose conditions on an approval. The condition may 
include compliance with a site plan of the site. 
(3) ?Standards for approval of Class A designation. In order to approve a use for Class A 
designation the use or structure must have been lawful at its inception. In addition, the following 
criteria shall be used by the planning commission in evaluating a use to determine if 
continuation of the use or structure would be appropriate: 
a. ?Continuance of the use or structure does not significantly depress property values of 
nearby properties. 
b. ?Continuance of the use or structure would not be contrary to the public health, safety or 
welfare or the spirit of this chapter. 
c. ?No useful purpose would be served by strict application of the provisions of this chapter 
with which the use or structure does not conform. 
d. ?The property cannot be reasonable used as currently zoned. 
(4) ?Revocation of Class A designation. 
a. ?Revocation of a Class A designation may be initiated by the city manager or their designee 
or the planning commission. 
b. ?Revocation of Class A designation shall comply with the procedures outlined in subsection 
86-523(g)(2), Class A designation process. 
c. ?Class A designation may only be revoked if the nonconforming use or structure violated a 
condition of approval. 
All nonconforming uses or structures not designated Class A shall be Class B nonconforming uses or 
structures. Class B nonconforming uses and structures shall comply with all the provisions of section 86-
523. 
(h) ?Uses under special exception provisions not nonconforming uses. Any use which is permitted as a 
special exception, in a district under the terms of this chapter, shall not be deemed a nonconforming 
use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use. 
(i) ?Change of tenancy or ownership. There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of 
any existing nonconforming uses of land, structures and premises, provided there is no change in 
the nature or character of such nonconforming uses. 
(Ord. of 5-6-02; Ord. No. 2014-08, 8-4-14) 


Sec. 86-524. - Accessory buildings. 
    Accessory buildings, except as otherwise permitted in this chapter, shall be subject to the following 
regulations: 
(1) ?Where the accessory building is structurally attached to a main building, it shall be subject to, 
and must conform to, all regulations of this chapter applicable to the main building. 
(2) ?Buildings accessory to residential buildings shall not be erected in any required yard, except a 
rear yard. 
(3) ?Buildings accessory to residential buildings not exceeding one story or 14 feet in height may 
occupy not more than 25 percent of a required rear yard, plus 40 percent of any nonrequired 
rear yard, provided that in no instance shall the accessory building exceed the ground floor area 
of the main building. 
(4) ?No detached building accessory to a residential building shall be located closer than ten feet to 
any main building nor shall it be located closer than three feet to any side or rear lot line. In 
those instances where the rear lot line is coterminous with an alley right-of-way, the accessory 
building shall not be closer than one foot to such rear lot line. In no instance shall an accessory 
building be located within a dedicated easement right-of-way. 
(5) ?No detached accessory building in RA-1, RA-2, RM-1, RM-2, and O-S districts shall exceed 
one story or 14 feet in height. Accessory buildings in all other districts may be constructed to 
equal the permitted maximum height of structures in such districts, subject to the board of 
appeals review and approval. 
(6) ?When a building accessory to a residential building is located on a corner lot, the side lot line of 
which is substantially a continuation of the front lot line of the lot to its rear, such building shall 
not project beyond the front yard setback required on the lot in the rear of such corner lot. A 
building accessory to a residential building shall in no case be located nearer than ten feet to a 
street right-of-way line. 
(Ord. of 5-6-02) 


Sec. 86-525. - Required off-street parkingGenerally. 
    Off-street parking required in conjunction with all land and building uses shall be provided as 
prescribed in this section: 
(1) ?The minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall be determined in accordance with this 
section. For uses not specifically mentioned in this section, off-street parking requirements shall 
be established by the zoning administrator from requirements for similar uses. 
(2) ?Any area once designated as required off-street parking shall never be changed to any other 
uses unless and until equal required facilities are provided elsewhere. Off-street parking existing 
at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived in connection with the 
operation of an existing building, shall not be reduced to an amount less than would be required 
in this section for such building or use. 
(3) ?Two or more buildings or uses may collectively provide the required off-street parking, in which 
case the required number of parking spaces shall not be less than the sum of the requirements 
for the several individual uses computed separately. However, in cases of dual functioning of 
off-street parking where operating hours do not overlap, the board of appeals may grant a 
special exception based on the peak hour demand. 
(4) ?Required off-street parking shall be for the use of occupants, employees, visitors and patrons, 
and shall be limited in use to motor vehicles. The storage of merchandise, motor vehicles for 
sale or the repair of vehicles is prohibited. Off-street parking, whether public or private, for 
nonresidential uses shall be either on the same lot or within 300 feet of the building it is 
intended to serve, measured from the nearest point of the building to the nearest point of the 
off-street parking lot, without crossing any major street. 
(5) ?When units or measurements determining the number of required parking spaces result in the 
requirements of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half shall be 
disregarded, and fractions over one-half shall require one parking space. 
(6) ?The minimum number of off-street parking spaces by type of use shall be determined in 
accordance with the following schedule: 
Off-street parking tables by use and number of minimum spaces per unit of measure.

Sec. 86-526. - SameSpace layout, standards, construction and maintenance. 
    Wherever the off-street parking requirements in section 86-525 require the building of an off-street 
parking facility such off-street parking lots shall be laid out, constructed and maintained in accordance 
with the following standards and regulations: 
(1) ?No parking lot shall be constructed unless and until a permit therefor is issued by the zoning 
administrator. Application for a permit shall be submitted in such form as may be determined by 
the zoning administrator, and shall be accompanied with two sets of plans for the development 
and construction of the parking lot showing that the provisions of this section will be fully 
complied with. 
(2) ?Plans for the layout of off-street parking facilities shall be in accord with the following minimum 
requirements:

(3) ?All spaces shall be provided adequate access by means of maneuvering lanes. Backing 
directly onto a street shall be prohibited. 
(4) ?Adequate ingress and egress to the parking lot by means of clearly limited and defined drives 
shall be provided for all vehicles. Ingress and egress to a parking lot lying in an area zoned 
other than single-family residential use shall not be across land zoned for single-family 
residential use. 
(5) ?All maneuvering lane widths shall permit one-way traffic movement, except that the 90-degree 
pattern may permit two-way movement. 
(6) ?Each entrance and exit to and from any off-street parking lot, located in an area zoned for other 
than single-family residential use, shall be at least 25 feet distant from any adjacent property 
located in any single-family residential district. 
(7) ?All driveways within residential zoned districts shall be located at least three feet from the lot 
line. 
(8) ?Where the next zoning district is designated as a residential district, a continuous chain link 
fence or greenbelt strip shall be provided on all sides contiguous to the residential district. The 
greenbelt strip shall include landscape materials of shrubs and trees that will result in 
substantial screening of the parking lot and vehicles from the abutting residential districts. 
(9) ?The entire parking area, including parking spaces and maneuvering lanes, required under this 
section shall be provided with asphaltic or concrete surfacing in accordance with specifications 
approved by the planning commission. The parking area shall be surfaced within one year of 
the date the permit is issued. Off-street parking areas shall be drained so as to dispose of all 
surface water accumulated in the parking area in such a way as to preclude drainage of water 
onto adjacent property or toward buildings, and plans shall meet the approval of the planning 
commission. The planning commission may waive the requirement for asphaltic or concrete 
surfacing if they determine that crushed limestone would be consistent with the use, would be 
consistent with the character of the surrounding area and would not cause a nuisance due to 
dust, ponding water or tracking of mud onto public streets for no more than a 48-month period. 
In granting the waiver the planning commission may impose conditions necessary to ensure 
that the proposed parking lot meets these standards. 
(10) ?All lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area shall be so installed as to be confined 
within and directed onto the parking area only. 
(11) ?The zoning board of appeals, upon application of the property owner to the building inspector, 
may modify the fence or greenbelt requirements pursuant to this chapter where it is shown that 
under such unusual and unique circumstances, no good purpose would be served by such 
requirements. 
(Ord. of 5-6-02; Ord. No. 2012-03, 9-4-12) 


Sec. 86-527. - Off-street loading and unloading. 
    On the same premises with every building, structure, or part thereof, involving the receipt or 
distribution of vehicles or materials or merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained on the lot, 
adequate space for standing, loading and unloading in order to avoid undue interference with public use 
of dedicated rights-of-way. Such space shall be provided as follows: 
(1) ?All spaces shall be provided as required in section 86-446 noted after minimum rear yards, 
except as provided for I districts in this section. 
(2) ?All spaces shall be laid out in the dimension of at least ten by 50 feet, or 500 square feet in 
area, with clearance of at least 14 feet in height. Loading dock approaches shall be provided 
with a pavement having an asphaltic or Portland cement binder so as to provide a permanent, 
durable and dustless surface. All spaces in I districts shall be provided in the following ratio of 
spaces to floor area:

Sec. 86-528. - Uses not otherwise included within a specific use district. 
    Because the uses referred to in this section possess unique characteristics, making it impractical to 
include them in a specific use district classification, they shall be permitted by the board of appeals under 
the conditions specified, and after a public hearing. These uses require special consideration since they 
service an area larger than the city and require sizeable land areas, creating problems of control with 
reference to abutting use districts. Reference to those uses falling specifically within the intent of this 
section is as follows: 
(1) ?Trailer coach parks. Trailer coach parks shall only be permitted within the I-1 districts and only 
on parcels not isolated or surrounded on more than three abutting sides by the I-1 district. A 
trailer coach park shall be located along the I-1 district edge, wherein such district abuts an RM-
1 district, and the trailer coach park shall have one entire side abutting the RM-1 district. Trailer 
coach parks shall be further subject to the following requirements and conditions: 
a. ?In a trailer coach park, no structure shall exceed a height of 25 feet or two stories. 
b. ?The trailer coach park shall be permitted on parcels of five acres or more. 
c. ?An open area shall be provided on each trailer coach lot to ensure adequate natural light 
and ventilation to each trailer coach and to provide sufficient area for outdoor uses 
essential to the occupants of the trailer coach. Trailer coach lots shall average not less 
than 3,000 square feet in area exclusive of drives, open space in the trailer court or other 
open areas not specifically for trailer coach occupancy. The minimum width for trailer 
coach lots shall be 35 feet. 
d. ?No trailer coach shall be located closer than 25 feet from any building within the court or 
any property line bounding the court. No building or trailer coach shall be located closer 
than 25 feet from any public street right-of-way nor less than 40 feet from any major arterial 
street. 
e. ?The trailer court site shall be enclosed by a masonry wall four feet eight inches high 
adjacent to all abutting properties and public right-of-way. The wall shall be located within 
the trailer court site. 
f. ?Each trailer coach site shall have the following minimum yard requirements: 
Side yard ..... ten feet 
Rear yard ..... eight feet 
Front yard ..... ten feet 
g. ?The trailer court shall have direct access to a major arterial street by directly abutting 
thereon. 
h. ?Trailer coach lots shall abut a service drive. All service drives shall have widths as 
scheduled in subsection (1)j of this section and shall be designed and graded for proper 
drainage according to standard road building practice, and be approved by the city 
engineer prior to opening of the trailer court. All service drives shall be constructed of 
concrete of 8-6-8 M.S.H. grade A 3,500 pound concrete within one year after the issuance 
of a permit. A cash security guaranteeing monies for such work will be issued to the city in 
the amount of a bona fide bid from parties performing such work. 
i. ?Trailer courts shall provide an approved entrance road not less than 30 feet wide, also 
contingent upon city engineer and county road commission approval. 
j. ?Schedule of service drive widths: 
1. ?One-way traffic street with no parking, minimum 16 feet. 
2. ?Two-way traffic street with no parking, minimum 24 feet. 
3. ?One-way traffic street with parallel parking one side, minimum 22 feet. 
4. ?Two-way traffic street with parallel parking one side, minimum 30 feet. 
5. ?One-way traffic street with parallel parking two sides, minimum 32 feet. 
6. ?Two-way traffic street with parallel parking two sides, minimum 40 feet. 
k. ?Parking spaces on service drives shall be clearly marked. 
l. ?All service drives shall be provided with curbs and gutters and be properly drained. 
m. ?The trailer court shall be designed to provide a concrete walk at least 36 inches wide from 
the entrance of the park to all trailer coach sites and all required service facilities. 
n. ?Streetlights and yardlights sufficient to permit safe movement of vehicles and pedestrians 
at night shall be provided, and shall be so located and shaded as to direct the light away 
from adjacent properties. 
o. ?Two concrete automobile parking spaces shall be required for each trailer site. One such

with other underground utilities. All telephone and electrical facilities shall be constructed in 
accordance with standards of construction approved by the state public service 
commission. 
r. ?All trailer court development shall further comply with state law. 
s. ?There shall not be less than 360 square feet of floor space within each trailer coach for the 
first two occupants, and an additional 100 square feet of floor space for each occupant 
over two. 
t. ?There shall be provided for each trailer court a recreation area equal in size to at least 200 
square feet per mobile home site. Such recreation area shall be no longer than 1½ times 
its width. Such area shall be graded, developed, sodded and maintained by the 
management, so as to provide recreation for the residents of the trailer court. 
u. ?The front yard, and any side yard adjacent to a street shall be landscaped within one year, 
and the entire trailer court shall be maintained in a good, clean, presentable condition at all 
times. 
v. ?No business of any kind shall be conducted in any trailer court except for separate, 
permanent structures which contain facilities such as the management's office, laundry and 
dry cleaning facilities or similar uses which are designed to serve only the residents of the 
trailer court. 
w. ?There shall be no storage of any kind under trailer coaches unless skirted. 
x. ?All fences, other than the greenbelt surrounding the court, shall be uniform in height, and 
shall not exceed 30 inches in height, and shall be constructed in such a manner as to 
provide firefighters access to all sides of each trailer coach. 
y. ?Trailer coach sites shall be provided with a concrete apron of not less than ten feet wide by 
50 feet long and six inches in depth. 
z. ?Prior to the issuance of a permit for construction on a trailer court site, a site plan shall be 
submitted to the planning commission for approval and in accordance with the following: 
1. ?Every site plan submitted to the planning commission shall be in accordance with the 
requirements of this chapter. No site plan shall be approved until such plan has been 
reviewed by the building department, fire department, police department and city 
engineer, for compliance with the standards of their respective departments. 
2. ?The following information shall be included on the site plan: 
i. ?Legal description of site. 
ii. ?A scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet. 
iii. ?The area of the site in acres. 
iv. ?Date, north point and scale. 
v. ?The dimensions of all lot and property lines, showing the relationship of the 
subject property to abutting properties. 
vi. ?The location of all existing and proposed structures on the subject property and 
all existing structures within 100 feet of the subject property. 
vii. ?The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed service drives, 
sidewalks, parking areas, greenbelts and individual trailer coach sites. 
viii. ?The location and right-of-way widths of all abutting streets and alleys. 
ix. ?The names and addresses of the architect, planner, designer, engineer or 
person responsible for the preparation of the site plan. 
3. ?In the process of reviewing the site plan, the planning commission shall consider: 
i. ?The location and design of driveways providing vehicular ingress to and egress 
from the site, in relation to streets giving access to the site, and in relation to 
pedestrian traffic. 
ii. ?The traffic circulation features within the site and location of automobile parking 
areas, and may make such requirements with respect to any matter as will 
ensure safety and convenience of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic within the 
site and in relation to access streets, and satisfactory and harmonious 
relationships between development on the site and existing and prospective 
development of contiguous land and adjacent neighborhoods. 
Actual construction of the trailer court shall be in accordance with the site plan. 
(2) ?Outdoor theaters. Because outdoor theaters possess the unique characteristics of being used 
only after darkness and since they develop a concentration of vehicular traffic in terms of 
ingress and egress from their parking area, they shall be permitted in B-2 districts only when the 
site in question abuts an I-1 district. Outdoor theaters shall further be subject to the following 
conditions: 
a. ?The proposed internal design shall receive approval from the zoning administrator as to 
adequacy of drainage, lighting and other technical aspects. 
b. ?Points of ingress and egress shall be accessible to the outdoor theater from abutting major 
thoroughfares of 120-foot right-of-way or greater, and shall not be accessible from any 
residential street.

space. No vehicle shall be permitted to wait or stand within a dedicated right-of-way. 
(Ord. of 5-6-02) 


Sec. 86-529. - Performance standards. 
    No use otherwise allowed shall be permitted within any district which does not conform to the 
following standards of use, occupancy and operation, which standards are hereby established as the 
minimum requirements to be maintained within such area: 
(1) ?Smoke. It shall be unlawful for any person to cause or permit to be discharged into the 
atmosphere from any single source of emission, smoke of a density equal to or darker than no. 
2 of the Ringelmann chart except: 
a. ?Smoke of a density equal to but not darker than no. 2 on the Ringelmann chart may be 
emitted for not more than three minutes in any 30-minute period. 
b. ?Smoke of a density equal to but not darker than no. 3 of the Ringelmann chart may be 
emitted for not more than three minutes in any 60-minute period, but such emissions shall 
not be permitted on more than three occasions during any 24-hour period. 
Method of measurement. For the purpose of grading the density of smoke, the Ringelmann 
chart, as now published and used by the United States Bureau of Mines, which is hereby made 
a part of this chapter, shall be the standard. However, the umbrascope readings of smoke 
densities may be used when correlated with the Ringelmann chart. 
(2) ?Dust, dirt and fly ash. No person shall operate or cause to be operated, maintained or cause to 
be maintained, any process for any purpose, or furnace or combustion device for the burning of 
coal or other natural or synthetic fuels, without maintaining and operating, while using such 
process or furnace or combustion device, recognized and approved equipment means, 
methods, devices or contrivance to reduce the quantity of gasborne or airborne solids or fumes 
emitted into the open air, which is operated in conjunction with such process, furnace or 
combustion device so that the quantity of gasborne or airborne solids shall not exceed 0.20 
grains per cubic foot of the carrying medium at a temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Method of measurement. For the purpose of determining the adequacy of such devices, these 
conditions are to be conformed to when the percentage of excess air in the stack does not 
exceed 50 percent at full load. The foregoing requirement shall be measured by the ASME Test 
Code for dust-separating apparatus. All other forms of dust, dirt and fly ash shall be completely 
eliminated insofar as escape or emission into the open air is concerned. The building inspector 
may require such additional data as is deemed necessary to show that adequate and approved 
provisions for the prevention and elimination of dust, dirt and fly ash have been made. 
(3) ?Open storage. The open storage of any industrial equipment, vehicles and all materials, 
including wastes, shall be screened from public view, from a public street and from adjoining 
properties by an enclosure consisting of a wall not less than the height of the equipment, 
vehicles and materials stored. Whenever such open storage is adjacent to a residential zone in 
either a front, side or rear lot line relationship, whether immediately abutting or across a right-of-
way from such zone, there shall be provided an obscuring masonry wall or wood fence of at 
least six feet in height. 
(4) ?Glare and radioactive materials. Glare from any process (such as or similar to arc welding, or 
acetylene torch cutting) which emits harmful ultraviolet rays shall be performed in such a 
manner as not to be seen from any point beyond the property line, and as not to create a public 
nuisance or hazard along lot lines. Radioactive materials and wastes, and including 
electromagnetic radiation such as X-ray machine operation, shall not be emitted to exceed 
quantities established as safe by the U.S. Bureau of Standards, when measured at the property 
line. 
(5) ?Fire and explosive hazards. The storage and handling of flammable liquids, liquefied petroleum 
gases, and explosives shall comply with the state rules and regulations, as established by state 
law. 
(6) ?Noise. Objectionable sounds, including those of an intermittent nature, shall be controlled so as 
not to become a nuisance to adjacent uses. 
(7) ?Odors. Creation of offensive odors shall be prohibited. 
(Ord. of 5-6-02) 


Sec. 86-530. - Plant materials. 
    Whenever in this chapter a greenbelt or planting is required, it shall be planted within six months 
from the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and shall thereafter be reasonably maintained

Sec. 86-531. - Signs. 
(a) ?Intent. The purpose of this article is to regulate signs and protect the public safety, health and 
welfare; minimize the quantity and size of signs to reduce visual clutter, motorist distraction, and loss 
of visibility; preserve property values and enhance the visual appearance and quality of life within the 
city. The requirements contained herein are intended to be content neutral. The following objectives 
are accomplished by making the minimum amount of regulations necessary concerning the size, 
placement, construction, illumination and other aspects of signs in the city in order to: 
(1) ?Protect the public right to receive messages and other types of information protected by the 
First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
(2) ?Maintain and improve the image of the city by encouraging signs of consistent size which are 
compatible with and complementary to related buildings and uses and have a balanced 
relationship with their surroundings. 
(3) ?Prevent off-premise signs from conflicting with other land uses. 
(4) ?Eliminate potential conflicts between business signs and traffic control signs, which could 
create confusion and hazardous consequences and have a negative impact on traffic safety and 
visual appearance. 
(5) ?Prevent signs that are potentially dangerous to the public due to structural deficiencies or 
disrepair and will conceal or obscure signs of adjacent uses. 
(b) ?Signs not requiring a permit. A sign of the following type shall be permitted on all parcels in the city 
without the issuance of a sign permit, subject to all other requirements of this article: 
(1) ?Device signs. Permanent signs on vending machines, ATM's, gas station pumps, or other 
containers indicating only the contents or purpose of such devices, provided that the sign area 
of each device shall not exceed three square feet and there are no more than one sign per 
device. 
(2) ?Directional signs. All directional signs required for the purpose of orientation, when established 
by the city, county, state or federal government, shall be permitted in all use districts. 
(3) ?Flags. Flags provided there shall be no more than three flags per lot, the maximum size of 
each flag shall be 50 square feet, and the flag poles comply with relative height limitations. The 
flag of the United States and the State of Michigan are permitted without the limitations included 
in this subsection. 
(4) ?Employment signs. "Help wanted" signs soliciting employees for the place of business where 
posted, provided that the maximum area for all such signs shall not exceed six square feet,

square feet in area, indicating the name of the occupant. For structures other than dwelling 
units, one identification sign not exceeding ten square feet, except a church bulletin board, not 
exceeding 18 square feet. 
(8) ?Incidental signs. Small signs, emblems, or decals informing the public of goods, facilities, or 
services available on the premises. The total of all such incidental signs shall not exceed two 
square feet.

(2) ?Poster panel (sandwich board, A-frames) signs. Poster panel signs may be placed only within 
the B-1 central business and B-2 general business districts at the public entrances to retail, 
personal service or restaurant businesses, on either private property or the public sidewalk, 
subject to the following requirements: 
a. ?Clearance for pedestrians. The sign shall be located a minimum of three feet from the edge 
of the curb and must be located so that at least a four-foot wide sidewalk is maintained 
between the sign and the building wall for pedestrian traffic flow and safety. 
b. ?Number. There shall be only one sign permitted for each building address for which there is 
provided a separate entrance, regardless of the number of tenants in the building. 
c. ?Storage. Each sign shall be placed outside only during the hours when the business is 
open to the general public, and shall be stored indoors at all other times. Any sign which is 
found to be not in compliance with this requirement may be confiscated by city code 
enforcement officials. A second violation will result in loss of the sign permit for a period of 
one year. 
d. ?Hazard. A portable sidewalk sign shall not occupy or obstruct the use of any fire lane or 
required off-street parking. Any sign which creates a visual or safety hazard may be 
ordered to be removed by the police chief. 
e. ?Maintenance. All sign frames shall be constructed of a weather-proof material and shall be 
kept in good repair. 
f. ?Businesses not fronting on Huron Ave./M-15. Directional poster panel signs for downtown 
businesses not fronting on Huron Ave./M-15 are permitted to be placed on Huron Ave./M-
15 corners subject to the following provisions: 
1. ?One directional sidewalk sign is allowed per corner, representing multiple businesses 
if necessary. 
2. ?The sign shall be placed in a location that does not interfere with other signage or 
features in the vicinity. 
3. ?No sign above a height of 30 inches from the established street grades shall be 
permitted within the triangular area formed at the intersection of any street right-of-
way lines by a straight line drawn between such right-of-way lines at a distance along 
each line of 25 feet from their point of intersection. 
4. ?All other provisions of the sign ordinance shall be complied with. 
g. ?Quality. Hand-lettered or stenciled sign faces are prohibited, with the exception of 
restaurant daily specials. All sign faces shall be professionally created in conformance with 
the specifications for sidewalk signs adopted by the city downtown development authority. 
(d) ?Prohibited signs.

section, except as provided hereafter: 
1. ?There shall be not more than one sign. 
2. ?Maximum height shall be six feet. 
In the case of such signs in non-residential zoning districts, the signs must comply with the 
requirements for the district in which they are located. 
(g) ?General requirements for all signs. 
(1) ?Illumination. All illumination shall be concentrated on the area of the sign or landscape feature 
so as to prevent glare upon the street or adjacent property. No sign shall be illuminated by other 
than electrical means or devices, and wiring shall be installed in accordance with the National 
Electrical Code. Any signs shall be of a wattage of not to exceed 60 watts per bulb. No lights 
shall be permitted in excess of 60 watts per bulb and in no instance shall such light be located 
as to be hazardous to traffic. 
(2) ?Obstructions to doors, windows and fire escapes. No sign shall be erected or maintained so as 
to prevent free ingress or egress from any door, window or fire escape. No sign of any kind shall 
be attached to a stand pipe or fire escape. 
(3) ?Signs not to construct a traffic hazard. No sign shall be erected at the intersection of any 
streets in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear vision or at any location where, by reason 
of the position, shape or color, it may interfere with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with 
any authorized traffic sign, signal or device, or which makes use of the words "Stop," "Look," 
"Danger" or any word, phrase, symbol or character in such manner as to interfere with, mislead 
or confuse traffic. 
(4) ?Clear vision area. No sign above a height of 30 inches from the established street grades shall 
be permitted within the triangular area formed at the intersection of any street right-of-way lines 
by a straight line drawn between such right-of-way lines at a distance along each line of 25 feet 
from their point of intersection 
(5) ?Face of sign shall be smooth. No nails, tacks or wires shall be permitted to protrude from the 
front of any sign. This shall not exclude, however, the use of block letters, electrical reflectors, 
or other devices which may extend over the top and in front of the advertising structure. 
(6) ?Measuring sign height. 
a. ?The permitted height of all signs supported by the ground shall be measured from the level 
of the ground, finished surface, adjacent to the sign. 
b. ?Sign height shall not be measured from an area of the ground that has been built-up or 
constructed in a manner that would have the effect of allowing a higher sign height than 
permitted by these regulations (e.g. the height of signs erected on a berm shall be 
measured from the finished grade adjacent to the berm.) 
 
(7) ?Measuring sign area. 
a. ?Sign area shall be measured as the square footage of the sign face and any frame or other 
material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate it from the 
background against which it is placed. 
b. ?When a sign consists solely of lettering or other sign elements printed, painted or mounted 
on a wall of a building without any distinguishing border, panel or background, the 
calculation for sign area shall be measured by enclosing the most protruding edges of the 
sign elements within a parallelogram or rectangle. 
 
The area of a double-faced sign such as a pole/pylon or monument sign shall be computed using only 
one face of the sign provided that: 1) the outline and dimensions of both faces are identical, and 2) the 
faces are back to back so that only one face is visible at any given time. 
(h) ?Legal nonconforming signs. 
(1) ?Any sign existing at the time of adoption of these regulations which does not comply with all 
provisions shall be considered a legal non-conforming sign and may be permitted to continue if 
the sign is properly maintained and not detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the 
community. 
(2) ?Nothing shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any portion of a sign 
declared unsafe by the city manager or their designee. Such signs may be improved only to the 
extent that such improvement does not exceed 50 percent of the current market value of the 
existing sign structure. 
(3) ?Subject to exceptions below, any legal non-conforming signs may be continued in operation 
and maintained after the effective date of these regulations provided that the signs shall not be: 
a. ?Structurally altered so as to extend their useful life; 
b. ?Expanded; 
c. ?Relocated; 
d. ?Re-established after damage of more than 50 percent of the value at the time of such 
damage or destruction; 
e. ?Modified in any way that would increase the degree of nonconformity of such sign. 
(4) ?Abandonment or obsolescence of a nonconforming sign shall terminate immediately the right to 
maintain such a sign. 
a. ?An obsolete sign and its supporting structure shall be removed by the property owner or 
lessee of the premises upon which the sign is located when the business which it 
advertises is no longer conducted on the premises within ten days after written notice from 
the city manager or their designee. 
b. ?A sign which is in conformity with the other provisions of these regulations may remain in 
place if such sign is obscured by the use of a blank panel attached within the frame of the 
sign and shall be permitted to remain for a period not to exceed 120 days. 
c. ?Where a successor to an inactive business agrees, within 30 days of the date of written 
notice by the city manager or their designee, to maintain the sign as provided for by these 
regulations, this removal requirement shall not apply, provided that the existing sign and 
structure conforms to all current sign requirements. 
(5) ?All portable signs, except those specifically permitted by these regulations, that exist on the 
effective date of these regulations, shall be removed immediately upon the enactment of these 
regulations. 
(6) ?Any illegal non-conforming signs that exist on the effective date of these regulations shall be 
removed immediately upon the enactment of these regulations and shall be replaced by signs 
that conform to these regulations. 
(i) ?Administration. 
(1) ?No sign, permanent or temporary, shall be erected, structurally altered or relocated, except as 
otherwise provided in these regulations, without review and approval from the city zoning 
administrator. Signs within the DDA district shall also require review and approval by the DDA. 
(2) ?Application. The application, on a form provided by the city, shall contain the proposed location 
of the sign, the name and address of the sign owner and of the sign erected, the name and 
address of the owner of the business and of the property if different from that of the sign owner, 
drawings and/or sketches showing the design and location of the sign, the estimated cost of 
construction and any other information as the city may require to ensure compliance with these 
regulations and with other ordinances of the city. 
(3) ?Permit required. For all signs requiring a permit, a sign permit application shall be applied for 
with the city. The city will approve a sign permit application that clearly conforms to the 
requirements of these regulations. If the sign is situated in the public right-of-way, the applicant 
must obtain a license from the city and must possess adequate liability insurance. 
(4) ?Fees. All permit fees for signs shall be as established by the city. 
(5) ?Nullification. A sign permit shall become null and void if the work for which the permit was 
issued has not been completed within 12 months after the date of the permit. 
(6) ?Exceptions. The following shall not require a sign permit: 
a. ?The changing of the advertising copy or message on an approved painted or printed sign, 
on a theater marquee and on similar approved signs which are specifically designed for the 
use of replaceable copy. 
b. ?Painting, repainting, cleaning or other normal maintenance or repair of a sign or a sign 
structure, unless a structural change is made. 
(j) ?Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the city manager or their designee in

Sec. 86-534. - Walls, greenbelt and landscaping. 
(a) ?For those use districts where an obscuring wall, greenbelt or landscaping is required, there shall be 
provided and maintained on those sides abutting or adjacent to a residential district an obscuring 
wall, fence, greenbelt or landscaped area as required in this subsection:

districts. 
(c) ?Wall and fence requirements may be substituted with greenbelt/landscaping strips consisting of 
shrubbery, trees and other plant items designed to obscure the use from the abutting residential 
district. The zoning administrator shall determine the sufficiency of such greenbelt/landscaping 
screening matter pursuant to the guidelines of this chapter. 
(d) ?Such walls and screening barrier shall have no openings for vehicular traffic or other purposes, 
except as otherwise provided in this chapter and except such openings as may be approved by the 
zoning administrator. All walls required in this section shall be constructed of materials approved by

not larger than 64 square inches, and provided that the openings shall be so spaced as to maintain 
the obscuring character required. 
(e) ?The board of appeals may waive or modify the requirements of this section where cause can be 
shown that no good purpose would be served, and provided that in no instance shall a required wall 
or greenbelt strip be permitted to be less than four feet in height.

determine the location of property lines. The zoning administrator may require proof that 
property lines have been established prior to issuance of a fence permit. The city shall not

height above grade, except that such restrictions shall not apply to clear vision fences. Such 
sight zones shall be determined as follows:

Sec. 86-613. - Appeal. 
(a) ?An appeal may be taken to the board of appeals by any person, or by any officer, department, board

time as shall be prescribed by the board of appeals by general rule, by filing with the zoning 
administrator and with the board of appeals a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds of such 
appeal. The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the board all of the papers constituting 
the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in 
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board of 
appeals, after notice of appeal has been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate 
a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings 
shall not be stayed, otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court of record. 
(b) ?The board shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal and give due 
notice thereof to the parties, and shall render a decision on the appeal without unreasonable delay.

forthwith pay over to the city treasurer to the credit of the general fund of the city. 
(Ord. of 5-6-02) 


Sec. 86-615. - Jurisdiction. 
    The zoning board of appeals shall not have the power to alter or change the zoning district 
classification of any property, nor to make any change in the terms of this chapter, but does have power 
to act on those matters where this chapter provides for an administrative review, interpretation, exception 
or conditional approval permit and to authorize a variance as defined in this section and the laws of the 
state. Such powers include: 
(1) ?Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that 
there is an error in any order, requirement, permit, decision or refusal made by the zoning 
administrator or any other administrative official in carrying out or enforcing any provisions of 
this chapter. 
(2) ?Variance. To authorize, upon an appeal, a variance from the strict applications of the provisions 
of this chapter where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape or area of a 
specific piece of property at the time of enactment of this chapter, or by reason of exceptional 
topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions or other extraordinary or 
exceptional conditions of such property, the strict application of the regulations enacted would 
result in peculiar or exceptional practical difficulties to, or exceptional undue hardship upon the 
owner of such property, provided such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the 
public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this chapter. In 
granting a variance, the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, 
character and other features of the proposed uses as it may deem reasonable in furtherance of 
the purpose of this chapter. In granting a variance, the board shall state the grounds upon which 
it justifies the granting of a variance. 
(3) ?Special exception approval. To hear and decide in accordance with the provisions of this 
chapter, requests for exceptions, for interpretations of the zoning map, and for decisions on 
special exception situations on which this chapter specifically authorizes the board to pass. Any 
special exception approval shall be subject to such conditions as the board may require to 
preserve and promote the character of the zone district in question and otherwise promote the 
purpose of this chapter, including the following: 
a. ?Interpret the provisions of this chapter in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose 
of the plan, as shown upon the zoning map fixing the use districts, and made a part of this 
chapter, where street layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout shown on 
such zoning map. 
b. ?Permit the erection and use of a building or use of premises for public utility purposes, 
upon recommendation of the planning commission. 
c. ?Permit the modification of the automobile parking space or loading space requirements 
where, in the particular instance, such modification will not be inconsistent with the purpose 
and intent of such requirements. 
d. ?Permit such modification of the height and area regulations as may be necessary to secure 
an appropriate improvement of a lot which is of such shape, or so located with relation to 
surrounding development or physical characteristics, that it cannot otherwise be 
appropriately improved without such modifications. 
e. ?Permit temporary buildings and uses for periods not to exceed two years in undeveloped 
sections of the city and for periods not to exceed six months in developed sections. 
f. ?Permit, upon proper application, the following character of temporary use, not otherwise 
permitted in any district, not to exceed 12 months with the granting of 12-month extensions 
being permissible: uses which do not require the erection of any capital improvement of a 
structural nature. The board of appeals, in granting permits for such temporary uses, shall 
do so under the following conditions: 
1. ?The granting of the temporary use shall in no way constitute a change in the basic 
uses permitted in the district nor on the property wherein the temporary use is 
permitted. 
2. ?The granting of the temporary use shall be granted in writing, stipulating all conditions 
as to time, nature of development permitted and arrangements for removing the use 
at the termination of such temporary permit. 
3. ?All setbacks, land coverage, off-street parking, lighting and other requirements to be 
considered in protecting the public health, safety, peace, morals, comfort, 
convenience and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city shall be made at the 
discretion of the board of appeals. 
4. ?In classifying uses as not requiring capital improvement, the board of appeals shall 
determine that they are either demountable structures related to the permitted use of 
the land; recreation developments such as, but not limited to golf-driving ranges and 
outdoor archery courts; or structures which do not require foundations, heating 
systems or sanitary connections. 
5. ?The use shall be in harmony with the general character of the district. 
6. ?No temporary use permit shall be granted without first giving notice to owners to 
adjacent property of the time and place of a public hearing to be held as further 
provided for in this chapter. 
g. ?Permit modification of wall requirements, greenbelt, and landscape screening only when 
such modification will not adversely affect or be detrimental to surrounding or adjacent 
development. 
(4) ?Determinations by board. In consideration of all appeals and all proposed variations to this 
chapter the board shall, before making any variations from the chapter in a specific case, first 
determine that the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to 
adjacent property, or unreasonably increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the 
danger of fire or endanger the public safety, or unreasonably diminish or impair established 
property values within the surrounding areas, or in any other respect impair the public health, 
safety, comfort, morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the city. The concurring vote of three 
members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirements, decision, or 
determination of the zoning administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon 
which it is authorized by this chapter to render a decision. Nothing contained in this section shall 
be construed to give or grant to the board the power or authority to alter or change this chapter 
or the zoning map, such power and authority being reserved to the mayor and the city council in 
the manner provided by law.

such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the 
powers of the zoning administrator from whom the appeal is taken. 
(Ord. of 5-6-02) 


Sec. 86-617. - Notice. 
    The board shall make no recommendation except in a specific case and after a public hearing 
conducted by the board. It shall, by general rule or in specific cases, determine the interested parties 
who, in the opinion of the board, may be affected by any matter brought before it, which shall in all cases 
include all owners of record of property and the occupants of all single-family and multifamily dwellings 
within 300 feet of the premises in question. Such notices shall be delivered personally or by mail 
addressed to the respective owners at the address given in the last assessment roll. If the tenant's name 
is not known, the term "occupant" may be used. The board may require any party applying to the board 
for relief to give such notice to other interested parties as it shall prescribe. 
(Ord. of 5-6-02) 


Sec. 86-618. - Order period of validity. 
(a) ?No order of the board permitting the erection of a building shall be valid for a period of longer than 
one year, unless a building permit for such erection or alteration is obtained within such period and 
such erection or alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of 
such permit. 
(b) ?No order of the board permitting a use of a building or premises shall be valid for a period longer 
than one year unless such use is established within such period; provided, however, that where such

force and effect if a building permit for such erection or alteration is obtained within such period, and 
such erection or alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of 
such permit.

CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE - ORDINANCES 
This table gives the location within this Code of those ordinances adopted since the 1983 Code, 
as updated through July 8, 1985, which are included herein. Ordinances adopted prior to such 
date were incorporated into the 1983 Code, as supplemented. This table contains some 
ordinances which precede July 8, 1985, but which were never included in the 1983 Code, as 
supplemented, for various reasons. Ordinances adopted since July 8, 1985, and not listed herein, 
have been omitted as repealed, superseded or not of a general and permanent nature.
