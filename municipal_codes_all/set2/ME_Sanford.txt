AERONAUTICAL USE  All activities that involve or are directly related
to the operation of aircraft, including activities that make the operation of
aircraft possible and safe. Services located on the Airport that are directly
and substantially related to the movement of passengers, baggage, mail,
and cargo are considered aeronautical uses.
AERONAUTICAL USERS  Individuals or businesses providing services
involving operation of aircraft or flight support directly related to aircraft
operation are considered to be aeronautical users.

by the dynamic action of air on its surfaces, especially powered airplanes,
gliders, and helicopters.
AIRPORT  The Sanford Seacoast Regional Airport (SFM), Sanford, Maine.

COMMERCIAL OPERATOR SUBLESSEE  Any person or entity which has
entered into a sublease with a commercial operator and who fulfills the
appropriate requirements of the appropriate FBO category or other specific
requirements included in an operating rights agreement. By fulfilling said
requirements, a commercial tenant lessee may qualify to engage in any

impact the neighborhood surrounding the property on which the chickens
are kept.

minimum penalty for failure to correct such significant code
violation after written notice by the City to do so is $500 per day,

specific violation other than a violation described in Subsection
A(2) is $100 per day, and the maximum penalty is $2,500 per day.
(4) In addition to penalties, the violator may be ordered to correct or
abate the violations. When violations occur in a shoreland area, as
defined in the Code, or when the court finds that the violation was
willful, the violator shall be ordered to correct or abate the
violation unless the abatement or correction results in:
(a) A threat or hazard to public health or safety;
(b) Substantial environmental damage; or
(c) A substantial injustice.
(5) If the City is the prevailing party in any legal action to enforce this
chapter, the municipality must be awarded reasonable attorney
fees, expert witness fees and costs, unless the court finds that
special circumstances make the award of these fees and costs
unjust.
(6) In setting a penalty, the following shall be considered:
(a) Prior violations by the same party;
(b) The degree of environmental damage that cannot be abated or
corrected;
(c) The extent to which the violation continued following a City
order to stop; and
§ 90-3 EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT § 90-3
27:93
§ 90-4. Fees for reinspection.
Following the issuance of a notice of violation and an order to correct
violations, the Building Official will reinspect once for no fee in order
to determine whether the violations have been fixed in compliance with
this chapter. If the violations have not been fixed in compliance with this
chapter, the violator shall be assessed a fee as set forth in the fee schedule
for each subsequent reinspection.35 Failure to pay the assessment for
reinspection shall create a lien on the property of the violator and lien shall
be collected and enforced pursuant to the General Provisions of this Code.
(d) The extent to which the City contributed to the violation by
providing the violator with incorrect information or by failing
to taken timely action.

violation or judgment against the same party within the past two
years for a violation of the same law or ordinance.
(8) If the economic benefit resulting from the violation exceeds the
applicable penalties under this section, the maximum penalty
under this subsection may not exceed an amount equal to twice the
economic benefit, which includes, but is not limited to, the cost
avoided or enhanced value accrued at the time of the violation as a
result of the violator's noncompliance with the applicable legal
requirements.
(9) In addition to the other penalties in this section, the Building
Official may suspend a contractor's, owner's, or developer's right to
obtain building permits or work on any project in the City if the
Building Official determines that a contractor's, owner's, or
developer's violation or violations of any provision in this chapter or
Code create such a threat to life or safety that a structure must be
posted against occupancy or that the violation or violations render
a structure uninhabitable. The suspension authorized by this
subsection shall be lifted when the Building Official determines
that the violation or violations have been fixed.
(10) Penalties assessed pursuant to this section shall be paid to the City
of Sanford.

A. When Town ordinance, the National Fire Prevention Code, or other
regulation requires that a building or structure be equipped with a fire
alarm, such system shall include approved supervisory equipment
which shall transmit an alarm to an approved receiver. Such
supervision shall be by connection to a private alarm station that has
been approved as a fire alarm monitoring service by Underwriters'
Laboratories, Inc., and accepted by the Sanford Fire Department Office
of the Fire Marshal. (NFPA 72)
B. The time required from initiation of the fire alarm to receipt of alarm by
the Fire Department shall not exceed 180 seconds, total.
A. False fire alarms disrupt the community, cause complacency and
business down time due to evacuations, and divert responders away
from genuine emergencies, which could potentially lead to loss of life
and property. The main reason for false alarms in the City of Sanford is
lack of maintenance to the alarm systems. This section will hold
property owners accountable for the maintenance of their alarm
systems. This section will not pertain to actual alarms that operated
correctly for proper reasons.

§ 132-1. Purpose.
The Town Council has determined that graffiti creates a visual blight and
adversely affects the enjoyment and value of property. When graffiti is
allowed to remain on property and is not promptly removed, it invites
additional graffiti and may encourage criminal activity or lead to nuisance
conditions. This chapter is intended to deter graffiti, to provide mechanisms
for prompt removal of graffiti, and to establish penalties for graffiti.
§ 132-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

ARTICLE I
Road Impact Fees
[Adopted 1-2-2008]
§ 136-1. Purpose.
§ 136-2. Legislative findings.
The Town Council of Sanford, Maine, finds, determines and declares as
follows:
A. The purpose of this article is to raise funds and deposit them into trust
accounts to help to pay the costs for future roadway improvements at
identified locations. The proposed improvements have been determined
to be necessary to provide capacity to accommodate new traffic
generated by new development projects in the Town of Sanford. This
article will help to assure that each new development pays a
proportionate share of the cost of improvements based upon the
development's use of the new roadway capacity.
B. This article imposes an impact fee on land development requiring
review under the Town's Subdivision Ordinance51 or site plan review
under the Town's Zoning Ordinance52 for providing new roads and
related facilities necessitated by new development that impacts traffic
in the Town as defined herein. This article also imposes impact fees on
all new development or redevelopment that requires the issuance of a
building permit by the Town and that generates new traffic within the
Town of Sanford.
C. This article also provides for the placement of impact fee revenue into
road impact fee trust accounts established for that purpose and for the
administration of the Road Impact Fee Article, including the
expenditure of funds derived from road impact fees and the refunds of
unexpended funds.
D. These fees shall be assessed as a flat rate on developments that
generate fewer than 20 peak hour trips in the p.m. peak hour. The
calculation of the number of p.m. peak hour trips shall be performed in
accordance with the provisions of this article. Flat rate fees shall be
credited equally to all existing traffic impact fee trust fund accounts.
E. All new development or redevelopment that generates more than 20
peak hour trips in the p.m. peak hour shall be required to submit a
traffic study to the Town Engineer as the basis for the impact fee
calculation.
A. The Town must expand its road system in order to provide adequate
levels of service in Town if new development that affects traffic within

§ 136-3. Title; statutory authority; applicability.
the Town is to be accommodated safely and without decreasing current
levels of service. This must be done to promote and protect the public
health, safety and welfare;
B. The State of Maine has authorized municipalities to adopt impact fees
for various purposes, including the construction of off-site capital
improvements, such as roads and traffic control devices pursuant to
30-A M.R.S.A. § 4354;
C. The imposition of impact fees is a preferred method of insuring that
new development bears a proportionate share of cost of capital
investments necessary to accommodate such development.
D. New development frequently generates additional traffic, necessitating
the acquisition of rights-of-way, road construction and road
improvements;
E. The fees established by § 136-6 hereof are derived from, are based
upon, and do not exceed the costs of providing additional rights-of-way,
road construction and road improvements necessitated by the traffic
generated by new developments for which the fees are levied.
F. The reports entitled "Traffic Impact Fee Study Sanford, Maine," dated
April 2, 2007, and "Sanford Traffic Impact Fee Study - Flat Fee Method
Summary," dated August 12, 2007, set forth in more detail a reasonable
methodology and analysis for the determination of the impact of new
development on the need for and costs of additional rights-of-way, road
construction and road improvements in the Town.
A. Title. This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Sanford Road
Impact Fee Ordinance."

§ 136-4 SANFORD CODE § 136-5
132:176
§ 136-6. Calculation.
The impact fee is structured to be in proportion to the development project's
share of the infrastructure costs necessitated by the development and as
enabled by Title 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4354. The process for this impact fee
calculation is as follows:
the scope of the development, prepared by a registered professional
engineer with significant experience in traffic engineering and to be
paid for by the developer. This traffic analysis shall be reviewed and
approved by the Town Engineer (with or without consultation with
the Town's consulting traffic engineer) and shall be incorporated into
the review and approval of a development project by the Planning
Board, Site Plan Review Committee, or Planning and Code Enforcement
Department when applicable. Proposed developments that will
generate not more than 20 p.m. peak hour trips shall be assessed
impact fees based upon the table in § 136-6E of this article.
C. No extension of a building permit or extension of an application
pending before the Planning Board or Site Plan Review Committee,
issued before the effective date of this article, for any activity requiring
payment of an impact fee pursuant to this article shall be granted
unless and until the road impact fee hereby required shall have been
paid or said amount is agreed to be paid by the developer.
A. As per § 136-5 above, a traffic analysis shall be conducted by a
registered professional engineer with significant experience in traffic
engineering in order to determine the traffic impact, and requisite
impact fee total, as measured by additional vehicle trips to be
generated by a development project that pass through the impact fee
study area in the p.m. peak commuter hour.
B. The impact fee calculation for individual development projects within
the Town of Sanford shall use generally accepted standards, such as the
most current Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation
Handbook of traffic generation data or estimates from field
measurements or data collected at similar development types, and shall
be based on the p.m. peak commuter hour of traffic (between 3:00 p.m.
and 6:00 p.m. on a weekday).
C. The costs assigned to trips shall be based upon a fee per new trip (a.k.a.
primary trip) to be generated by a development project that passes
through the impact fee study area during the p.m. peak commuter hour.
Other types of traffic associated with a development project, such as
the capture of trips passing a site (a.k.a. pass-by trips) or trips in the
area that are rerouted (a.k.a. diverted trips) shall not be utilized in the
assessment of the fee.
D. The fee determination shall be based on the following:
§ 136-5 GRAFFITI § 136-6
132:177
(1) The total cost of the roadway infrastructure improvements within
the impact fee study area to be funded from this Impact Fee Article

(e) Route 109/Route 4: $600,000.
(2) The total additional (bidirectional) vehicle capacity to be fostered
by the roadway infrastructure improvement equal approximately
the following trip ends in the p.m. peak commuter hour of traffic.
(a) Route 109/Route 99: 2,318.
(b) Route 109/Jagger Mill Road: 1,614.
(c) Route 4/Jagger Mill Road: 2,630.
(d) Route 4/School Street: 1,791.
(e) Route 109/Route 4: 2,301.
(3) Each additional trip generated by new development projects will
benefit from the capacity increases noted in Subsection D(2) above
and will utilize one trip end of that additional capacity.
(4) The fee per trip, therefore, shall be as noted below:
(a) Route 109/Route 99: $591.
(b) Route 109/Jagger Mill Road: $1,013.

$2,100,000 of which the Town must raise $600,000 through
impact fees.)
E. Smaller developments.
(1) Developments on parcels not requiring subdivision or site plan
review or that generate fewer than 20 peak hour trips shall pay a
fee per trip based upon the following table:

satisfactory to the Town Council.
B. Construction of capital improvements.
(1) Credit for construction of capital improvements shall be given only:
(a) Where the Town and the developer agree in writing that it

either unreliable or inaccurate.
(2) Upon final determination of all credits, the Town shall provide the
developer with a letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount
of the credit, the reason for the credit, and the legal description or
other adequate description of the development to which the credit
may be applied. The developer must sign and date a duplicate copy
of such letter or certificate indicating his/her agreement to the

Board, based upon the scope of the development approved by the
Planning Board and/or DEP and the value of the capital improvements
actually constructed. Credit shall be given only to the extent that the
traffic impact of the proposed development, as determined at the time
of construction, does not exceed the impacts anticipated by the
subdivision or site review approval. The developer shall have the
burden of establishing the cost of capital improvements constructed.
F. Any claim for credit must be made prior to the time for payment of
impact fees. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.
G. Credits shall not be transferred from one project or development to
another without the approval of the Town Council.

§ 149-1.11. Inspections.
As a condition of granting a license, unless otherwise specified, an
inspection may be required. Submission of a license application shall
constitute permission for entry and inspection. The Inspection Team, which

and the Code Enforcement Department, may inspect every facility to be

(1) Don disposable boot covers, gowns, gloves, and hairnets if provided
by the facility operator.

gun, and a two-way communication device. The

access and direct feedback to allow the inspection to take place
without requiring the Inspection Team to enter areas of the facility
that are sensitive to potential contamination.
C. If the Inspection Team observes violations, modifications of the facility
which required a permit which was not obtained, or cannot
satisfactorily conduct the inspection through remote observation then

ARTICLE II
Mental Health and Abuse Clinics; Outpatient Addiction Treatment
Clinics
[Adopted 11-25-2008;53 amended in its entirety by the City Council
7-19-2016 by Order No. 16-61.10]
§ 149-2.1. Purpose and findings.
A. The City Council finds that an outpatient addiction treatment clinic can
be a valuable component of our health-care system if operated by
qualified and responsible operators and subject to reasonable
regulations to assure effective operation. The City Council also
recognizes the importance of appropriately siting clinics in order to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare. This requires restricting
the proximity of clinics to schools, child-care providers, public parks
and playgrounds, and other locations where children and young adults
may frequent. It requires siting in locations accessible by public
transportation, zoned to assure the compatibility of other allowed uses
in the zone with and to such clinics, and selected to assure the personal
safety and privacy of the patients and clients of such clinics. In addition,
the City and private interests have devoted substantial resources and
made significant efforts to attract retail and commercial development
into the downtown sections of Sanford and the Village of Springvale,
and location of a clinic in these areas may conflict with this
development plan.
B. The City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the City to
protect areas where efforts are currently being made to stimulate new
business investment, and encourage focused and planned economic
growth, which includes the areas identified above. The location of
outpatient addiction treatment clinics in these areas could detract from
these efforts without benefiting the patients and clients of such
facilities. Proper locating shall also avoid adverse law enforcement
impacts and the overburdening of police and rescue resources while at
the same time protect the personal privacy, convenience, and interests
of the patients and clients of such facilities. The City Council finds that
with the reasonable and necessary location restrictions listed herein
and in the City's Land Use Code, there remain sufficient suitable areas
within the City to site mental health and abuse centers, including
outpatient addiction treatment clinics. Licensing of these facilities shall
enhance community relations with the providers of such clinics,
establish lines of communications with operators of the facilities, and
provide for periodic review of and reasonable control over their
operations. Licensing of these facilities is appropriate and consistent
with the City's policies and practices to review and license business

restrictions and performance standards listed in the Chapter 280,
Zoning, there remain sufficient suitable areas within the City to site
medical marijuana production facilities. Licensing of these facilities
shall provide for periodic review of and reasonable control over their
practices to ensure that life safety concerns are addressed. Licensing is

§ 149-6.2. Purpose. [Amended 5-1-2018 by Order No. 18-184-0155]
The purpose of this article is to protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the people of the City by establishing a program to identify,
register, inspect to minimum standards and determine the actions the
owners will take to return vacant buildings to suitable or proper use or
occupancy, or securing or demolishing such vacant and abandoned
buildings. This article is intended to prevent or mitigate dangers to health,
safety, and welfare, promote responsible management, provide a safe
neighborhood for residents, safeguard property values, expedite building
repairs, and provide for prompt contact with owners or managers by police,
fire, and code enforcement when issues or emergencies develop.
§ 149-6.3. Definitions.
The following words and terms, when used in this article, have the following
meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Terms not defined
in this article, which are defined in articles adopted by reference, have the
meanings ascribed to them as stated in those articles.

because of inadequate maintenance or dilapidation, is a nuisance or is
dangerous to life or property, and causes neighboring properties to
suffer from stagnant or declining property value. The use and
maintenance of property in such condition and manner endangers the
public safety and health, constitutes an unreasonable use and
conditions to the annoyance, discomfort, and repose of a considerable

ARTICLE I
Nuisance Control and Abatement
[Adopted 8-2-2016 by Ord. No. 16-101.06]
§ 183-1. Statutory authority; administration and enforcement;
severability.
§ 183-2. Purpose.
The City finds that because most odorous pollutants have a complex
chemical composition and may elicit a broad spectrum of responses by the
receptors, special methods must be employed in their measurement and
characterization. Although analytical data are more precise and may be
useful in identifying a source, it is the human response or the sensory data
that is most critical in determining the necessary degree of odor control.
Analytical data may be used to specify permissible emission levels from
a source, but sensory data must be employed to assess the impact in the
surrounding community. The latter is the City's primary concern.
§ 183-3. Objectionable odor determination.
An odor will be deemed objectionable and is a public nuisance when any of
the following occurs:
A. Authorization. This article is adopted pursuant to 30-A M.R.S.A. § 3001
and the City's Home Rule Powers as provided for in Article VII-A of the
Maine Constitution and Title 30-A M.R.S.A. §§ 2101 through 2109 and
in accordance with the authority of the City to seek judicial remedies in
order to protect the inhabitants of the City, the City as a municipal
corporation, and individual residents of the City as provided for by the
laws of the State of Maine, including, but not limited to 17 M.R.S.A.
§§ 2702, 2705 and 2706; 30-A M.R.S.A. § 2002 and at common law.
B. Administration and enforcement. The Code Enforcement Officer of the
City of Sanford shall administer and enforce this article.
C. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
portion of this article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional
by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not
affect the validity of the remaining portions.
A. Creates a public nuisance at common law; or
B. The erection, continuance or use of any building or place for the
exercise of trade, employment or manufacture which, by noxious
exhalations or offensive smells, become injurious and dangerous to the
health, comfort or property of individuals or the public; or
C. All members of a panel consisting of the Code Enforcement Department
and four residents of the City, appointed by the Mayor to assist the Code
§ 183-1 LITTERING § 183-3
153:281
§ 183-4. Compliance required; applicability.
No odor source, land use, facility, or activity shall be exempt from complying
with the odor management standards contained in this article, Chapter 149,
Licensing, and Chapter 280, Zoning, because of grandfathering or because
of being an existing use, facility, or activity at the time the standards were
enacted. The odor standards apply to all existing and future odor sources,
land uses, facilities, and activities in the City, except as otherwise provided
herein.
§ 183-5. Observation procedures.
Odor observation shall be undertaken to arrive at a determination that an
objectionable odor exists, shall be at or beyond the property line or at or
near places where people live or work.
§ 183-6. Enforcement.
In the event that the Code Enforcement Department receives complaints
that smells or odors are detectable beyond the property line, the following
process shall be used to correct the odor problem:
Enforcement Department in investigating complaints and who are not
aggrieved by the source, determine following concurrent, personal
observation, that the odor at the property line of the source based on
City Tax Maps or elsewhere in the City is objectionable, taking into
account its nature, concentration, location, and duration and are able
to identify the source.
A. Within seven days of receiving a complaint, the Code Enforcement
Department shall investigate the property to assess the situation and
discuss odor compliance with the business operator, including but not
limited to asking the business operator what is being done to mitigate
odors. If the Code Enforcement Department detects odor beyond the
property lines and/or the operator indicates that odor management
provisions described in its Operations Manual and Safety Plan
described in Chapter 280, Zoning are not being followed, the Code
Enforcement Department shall provide verbal notice of violation to the
operator and instructions to comply with odor management provisions
and require the operator to notify the Code Enforcement Department of
conformance within 10 days.
B. If complaints persist and/or the Code Enforcement Department
continues to observe an odor issue, the Code Enforcement Department
shall assemble the panel authorized as described above to investigate
the complaints. If the Code Enforcement Department and the panel
observe odor issues after the ten-day period as described above, the
Code Enforcement Department shall notify the operator of violation in
writing and require notification of conformance within 10 days.
§ 183-3 SANFORD CODE § 183-6
153:282
C. If complaints persist and/or the Code Enforcement Department and the
panel continue to observe odor issues after the ten-day period
described above, the Code Enforcement Department shall provide a
second written notice of violation, assess a fine for a first violation, as
specified under Chapter 149, and require the operator to prepare an
Odor Control Plan that meets the requirements of § 280-15-10C(6) of
the Zoning Ordinance and submit a written report from a mechanical
engineer or odor management specialist with recommendations for
modification/improvement of the ventilation system within 45 days and
installation of recommendations and notice of compliance within 60
days. The City may use contracted staff and peer review escrow fees to
review an Odor Control Plan under § 280-3-4 of the Zoning Ordinance.
[Amended 2-20-2018 by Order No. 18-115-01]
D. If the operator has not submitted the required report within 45 days, or
if the operator has not submitted evidence of compliance within 60 days
as described above, the Code Enforcement Department shall provide a
third written notice of violation and assess a fine for a second violation,
as specified under Chapter 149.
E. If the operator has not submitted the required report within 60 days as
described above or if the operator has not submitted evidence of
compliance within 75 days, the City Manager shall assess a fine for a
third violation, as specified under the Chapter 149, and temporarily
suspend the business license.
F. If the operator has not submitted the required report within 75 days as
described above or if the operator has not submitted evidence of
compliance within 90 days, the City Manager shall ask the City Council

owners listed in order of their assigned numbers.
A. All roads that serve two or more properties shall be named regardless
of whether the ownership is public or private. "Road" refers to any
highway, road, street, avenue, lane, private way, or similar paved,
gravel, or dirt thoroughfare. "Property" refers to any property on which
a more or less permanent structure has been erected or could be
placed. A road name assigned by the Town of Sanford shall not
constitute or imply acceptance of the road as a public way.

(2) New roads shall not be assigned names that sound similar to
existing or proposed roads. (e.g., Beech Street and Peach Street).
(3) Each road shall have the same name throughout its entire length.
A. Where practicable, numbers shall be assigned every 50 feet along both
sides of the road, with even numbers appearing on the left side of the
road and odd numbers appearing on the right side of the road,
determined by the number origin.
B. The following criteria shall govern, on a prospective basis, the
numbering system:
(1) All number origins shall start from Main Street and work out east
and west or from Route 202 and work out north and south as
appropriate based upon the location and orientation of the road.
Address orientation for new through streets may be configured to
maintain consistency with nearby through streets. The numbering
origin for Main Street shall begin at the Sanford/Shapleigh town
line and proceed to the Sanford/Wells town line. For dead-end
roads and culs-de-sac, numbering shall originate at the intersection
of the adjacent road and terminate at the dead-end or cul-de-sac
terminus. For loop roads that begin and end on the same street,
addressing shall begin from the intersection with the lower address
range.
(2) The number assigned to each structure shall be that of the
numbered interval falling closest to the front door. If the front door
cannot be seen from the main road, the number shall be that of the
interval falling closest to the driveway of said structure.
(3) A structure with one use or occupancy on an individual lot shall
have a separate number for the use or occupancy (e.g., singlefamily
dwelling, restaurant, etc.).
(4) New buildings with two or more residential units shall have a single
numeric street address with individual unit numbers (e.g., 275
Smith Street, Unit 1, Unit 2, Unit 3, etc.). Where individual units
are accessed from an interior hall, the odd unit numbers shall be on
the right side of the hall from the main entrance and even number
units on the left side of the hall from the main entrance.
(5) New nonresidential buildings with separate occupancies shall have
a single numeric street address with individual suite numbers for
each occupancy. The first occupied floor at street level shall use a
100 series, the second occupied level shall use a 200 series, etc.
(e.g., 351 Jones Way, Suite 100, 101, 102, Suite 200, 201). Floors to
be occupied that are below the street level shall use a two-digit
series (e.g., 351 Jones Way, Suite 10, 11, 12). Where individual
suites are accessed from an interior hall, the odd unit numbers

1, Building No. 2, etc.) followed by the unit or suite numbers where
applicable.
(7) The Code Enforcement Officer may deviate from the procedures
provided above when necessary to accommodate unique
circumstances. Such deviation shall be the minimum necessary to
resolve the situation and maintain compliance with § 226-14 above.
A. Number on the structure or residence. Where the residence or
structure is within 50 feet of the edge of the road right-of-way, the
assigned number shall be displayed on the front of the residence or
structure near the front door or entry.
B. Number on the street line. Where the residence or structure is over 50
feet from the edge of the road right-of-way, the assigned number shall
be displayed on a post, fence, wall, mailbox, or on some structure at the
property line on the same side of the road as the residence or structure
next to the access drive to the residence or structure. Where no access
drive exists, the assigned number shall be placed adjacent to the
walkway to the main entrance.
C. Size and color of number. Numbers shall be displayed in a color
(contrasting to background) and size (no less than three inches high)
and shall be located to be visible from the road as required by this
article.
D. The property owner shall be responsible for displaying the assigned
number and shall remove any different number that might be mistaken
for or confused with the number assigned in conformance with this
article.
A. New construction. Whenever any residence or other structure is
constructed or developed, it shall be the duty of the new owner to

such other relief as the court deems proper under 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4452.
A. Purpose and general requirements.
(1) The purpose of this section is to establish standards for traffic
control for all construction projects in the right-of-way. This shall be
required by all individuals, organizations, contractors, or other
entities whose work in or adjacent to public rights-of-way affect or
influence vehicular, pedestrian, or any other passage by the public
through the rights-of-way. Levels of traffic control may vary for
each individual project; however, all construction projects shall be
carried out in accordance with principles outlined in the Manual of
Traffic Control Devices, 2009 or latest edition.
(2) Any and all entities who perform construction, excavation or who
otherwise perform earthwork or otherwise take any action which
would hinder the free passage of vehicles, bicyclists or pedestrians
on any street, sidewalk, or public right-of-way within the City of
Sanford shall obtain a highway excavation permit or lane or
shoulder closure permit to be issued in advance by the Director of
Public Works Director or his or her designee. The fee for the permit
shall be as designated in Chapter 226, Article III.
B. Highway excavation permit application criteria. An application for a
highway excavation permit under this section shall be made upon such
forms as may be developed by the Public Works Director. All
applications under this section shall be filed with the Public Works
Director no less than 24 hours, weekends and holidays excluded, prior
to the commencement of any work or the placement of any obstruction
in the City of Sanford streets or rights-of-way. Exceptions to this delay
may be granted at the discretion of the Public Works Director; however,
the Director may make provision for permits to be granted in
emergency situations under such terms as he or she determines.
C. Authority of the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director, or
his designee, shall have authority to interpret this article and require
any amount of traffic control measures on any project requiring a
highway excavation permit, or other work within a public right-of-way,
in order to provide safety to vehicular traffic, pedestrians, or other
vehicles. The Public Works Director or his designee shall also have the
authority to require any changes or revisions to the approved initial
traffic control provisions or devices, including, but not limited to,
requiring the presence of uniformed police officers, during the project
§ 226-32 SANFORD CODE § 226-33
153:338
as changing conditions and safety concerns warrant. In certain
situations, and at his or her discretion, the Public Works Director may
also allow reduction or relaxation of some criteria described herein.
Any such reduction or relaxation shall not relieve any contractor,
person or entity of their legal responsibilities to protect the public and
any and all property from injury or damage. Failure by the permittee,
contractor, person, or entity to provide such measures to the
satisfaction of the Public Works Director may result in enforcement
action as indicated herein.
D. Traffic control and safety plan.
(1) In addition to the requirements of Chapter 226, Article III,
§ 226-28D, all applicants for a public highway excavation permit
shall provide a traffic control and safety plan ("the plan") for review
and approval by the Director of Public Works or designees. The
plan shall demonstrate the measures to be employed to control
vehicular traffic and protect pedestrians, bicyclists, people in
handicapped devices and the public in general. The plan shall be a
hard copy document and may consist of a narrative and sketches,
aerial photograph sketches, or a diagram showing the signage,
barricades, channelization devices, such as barrels or cones,
positions of flaggers, and other devices to be used. The narrative
shall include a plain statement of what actions will be taken by the
permittee to protect personal safety and property which could be
affected by the work to be performed under the permit.
(2) Elements of the plan, and implementation of the plan or any
possible variations of the plan in the field, shall be in conformance
with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control and Devices, latest
edition (hereinafter, "MUTCD"). Unless otherwise allowed by the
Public Works Director, all applications under this article shall be

rights-of-way; except, however, the Director of Public Works shall
make provision for permits to be granted in emergency situations
under such terms as determined by him or her.
(3) The permittee shall in general maintain safe crossings for two lanes
of vehicle traffic at all street intersections where possible and safe
crossings for pedestrians. The contractor or entity shall provide
traffic control such that no traffic crosses a roadway center line, or
creates a dangerous condition at a street intersection.
Channelization devices, such as cones and signs for traffic
direction, may be employed to alter locations of the two travel lanes
and create a temporary center line if this is proposed in the plan or
allowed by the Director of Public Works or his designee. If any

crossings shall be maintained for vehicles and for pedestrians. It
shall be the duty of every permittee cutting, performing excavation,
§ 226-33 LITTERING § 226-33

approved by the Public Works Director to be considered as being
properly trained and competent. The Public Works Department shall
promulgate and maintain a list of properly trained and competent flag
personnel and/or their companies on file for public view. To be included
on the approved list, written documentation shall be provided by the
flaggers or their companies demonstrating the individuals' training and
experience. Applicants for highway excavation permits shall choose
flagging personnel from this list, or shall provide documentation of
other flaggers they wish to employ as properly trained and competent
flaggers.
F. Requirements for maintaining two-way traffic.
(1) As determined by the Public Works Director, whenever necessary to
protect personal safety and property, including, but not limited to,
cases where vehicular traffic crosses or is likely to cross over any
roadway center line, any permittee under this article may be
required to retain the services of either uniformed police officers or
properly trained and competent flaggers as defined herein. Within
the traffic control and safety plan, the permittee shall also indicate
locations for any other protective or channelization devices, such
as barriers, traffic cones, direction signs, advance warning signs,
or other measures as may be required by the Public Works Director.
(2) Unless it is demonstrated to his or her satisfaction that two-way
traffic can be allowed in both directions at the same time, the
Public Works Director may permit an entity to temporarily reduce
the number of travel lanes to a single lane, provided that properly
trained and competent flaggers are used to direct and control
traffic. Detours shall be allowed only with the approval of the Public
Works Director. All traffic control methods and devices shall comply
with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, latest edition.
G. Uniformed police officers required. Pursuant to the traffic control
standards established herein, all individuals, organizations,
contractors, or other entities, to include work performed by or under
contract with the City, the Sanford Water District or the Sanford
Sewerage District, any permit issued pursuant to this section may
require the use of uniformed police officers under the following
circumstances:
(1) The Public Works Director or his designee determines that
circumstances exist creating a public safety concern such that the
use of uniformed police officers shall be required. The Public Works
§ 226-33 SANFORD CODE § 226-33
153:340
Director shall obtain the conferment of the Chief of Police or
Assistant Chief of Police in evaluating the need for uniformed police
details or any additional traffic control to provide acceptable public
safety measures.
(2) If the Public Works Director and Chief of Police or Assistant Chief of
Police deem it necessary to protect public safety, a police traffic
detail in conformance with Sanford Police Department standards
shall be required on the following streets: Main Street, Lebanon
Street, Washington Street, Cottage Street, High Street, School
Street, Oak Street, Pleasant Street, River Street, and Route 4.
Other roads may be added to this list. The decision on whether a
uniformed police officer detail is required shall be made by the
Public Works Director, who may consult with and receive advice
from the Sanford Police Chief or Assistant Police Chief.
(3) If the Public Works Director in conferment with the Chief of Police
or Assistant Chief of Police deems it necessary to protect public
safety, a police traffic detail will be required for any traffic control
activities within an intersection controlled by a traffic signal device
when not operational, unless the intersection is adequately
controlled using properly trained and competent flaggers and the
traffic control measures meet all standards within the latest edition
of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. In such cases, if
he or she determines that public safety is still not adequate at the
intersection, the Public Works Director may require that uniformed
police officers are necessary for additional safety.
(4) All costs for police details that occur on any construction project in
public ways shall be subject to Sanford Police Department policies
and procedures.
H. City held harmless. All entities initiating and performing the earthwork
project in the City of Sanford, whether or not in compliance with the
conditions of the highway excavation permit shall bear all risk and
responsibility for incidents and occurrences within the duration of said
projects. The City of Sanford shall be held harmless for all events and
claims arising from said projects.
I. Enforcement.
(1) The City of Sanford shall make such inspections for all working
projects as are reasonably necessary in the enforcement of this
article. The City shall have the authority to promulgate and cause
to be enforced such rules, policies, and regulations as may be
reasonably necessary to enforce and carry out the intent of this
article.
(2) If, in their judgment, the Director of Public Works, Chief of Police or
Assistant Chief of Police observe a project in a public way, or
crossing a public way, that is out of compliance with the traffic and
safety plan or otherwise unreasonably jeopardizing public safety,
§ 226-33 LITTERING § 226-33
153:341
the Public Works Director, Chief of Police or Assistant Chief of
Police shall carry out one or more of the following procedures:
(a) Carry out or arrange for a stop-work order for the project until
traffic control is effectively brought into compliance.
(b) Issue a written or verbal warning to the responsible permittee,
contractor, person or entity stating that the project needs to
comply with this article to avoid a stop-work order, including, if
necessary, additional traffic control and safety measures to be
employed.
(c) Direct that the project's traffic control will require uniformed
police officers in accordance with this article and the Sanford
Police Department's practices and procedures. The entity or
contractor shall be solely responsible for fees assessed for the
presence of uniformed police officers. Utilization of police
officers shall not relieve any other traffic control requirements
required by this article.
(3) Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of
a violation and subject to a fine of not more than $500.

City's judgment, to repair any damage to the way or bridge
which may reasonably result from the applicant's use of same.
(2) Even if the municipal officers make the foregoing findings, they
need not issue a permit if they determine the applicant's use of the
way or bridge could reasonably be expected to create or aggravate
a safety hazard or cause substantial damage to a way or bridge
maintained by the municipality. They may also limit the number of
permits issued or outstanding as may, in their judgment, be
necessary to preserve and protect the highways and bridges.
(3) In determining whether to issue a permit, the municipal officers
shall consider the following factors:

(d) The cost and availability of materials and equipment for
repairs;
(e) The extent of use by other exempt vehicles; and
(f) Such other circumstances as may, in their judgment, be
relevant.
(4) The municipal officers may issue permits subject to reasonable
conditions, including but not limited to restrictions on the actual
load weight and the number or frequency of vehicle trips, which
shall be clearly noted on the permit.
F. Administration and enforcement. This section shall be administered and
may be enforced by the municipal officers or their duly authorized
designee (such the Director of Highways or Director of Public Works).
G. Penalties. Any violation of this section shall be a civil infraction subject
to a fine of not less than $250 nor more than $1,000. Each violation
shall be deemed a separate offense. In addition to any fine, the

Ch. 193.
§ 256-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of
the public by regulating yard sales and flea markets so as to prevent the
disturbance or disruption of the residential and retail environment present
throughout the City.
§ 256-2. Applicability.
This chapter does not prohibit isolated or casual sales of personal items by
individuals of households to other individuals of households.
A. A yard sale is a method by which a resident or homeowner may sell or
dispose of unwanted items of tangible personal property and
correspondingly provide an opportunity for other persons to purchase
bargains.
B. Unregulated allowances of yard sales in the City present an opportunity
for abuse in that some persons may be conducting business activities
under the guise of having a yard sale.
C. Nonregulated and recurring yard sales and flea markets cause
annoyances to citizens in the City and congest the City's streets.
D. Nonregulated yard sales and flea markets can impact businesses with
fixed places of business.

flooding, causing serious damages to properties within these areas.
Relief is available in the form of flood insurance as authorized by the
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. Therefore, the Town of Sanford,
Maine has chosen to become a participating community in the National
Flood Insurance Program, and agrees to comply with the requirements
of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended)
as delineated in this chapter.
B. It is the intent of the Town of Sanford, Maine to require the recognition
and evaluation of flood hazards in all official actions relating to land use
in the floodplain areas having special flood hazards.
C. The Town of Sanford has the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures to reduce future flood losses pursuant to 30-A
M.R.S.A. §§ 3001 - 3007, 4352, 4401 - 4407, and Title 38 MRSA, Section
440.
D. The National Flood Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid
Act, provides that areas of the Town of Sanford having a special flood
hazard be identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood
hazard areas. This chapter establishes a Flood Hazard Development
Permit system and review procedure for development activities in the
designated flood hazard areas of the Town of Sanford, Maine.

may grant a variance from the requirements of this chapter consistent with
state law and the following criteria:
A. Variances shall not be granted within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.
B. Variances shall be granted only upon:
(1) a showing of good and sufficient cause; and,
(2) a determination that should a flood comparable to the base flood
occur, the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, public expense, or
create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and,
(3) a showing that the issuance of the variance will not conflict with
other state, federal or local laws or ordinances; and,
(4) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
undue hardship, which in this sub-section means:
(a) that the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return
unless a variance is granted; and,
(b) that the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances
of the property and not to the general conditions in the
neighborhood; and,
(c) that the granting of a variance will not alter the essential
character of the locality; and,
(d) that the hardship is not the result of action taken by the
applicant or a prior owner.
C. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
D. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use provided that:
(1) other criteria of this § 265-9 and § 265-6K are met; and

and,
§ 265-9 SANFORD CODE § 265-9
252:452
(2) the proposed repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
F. Any applicant who meets the criteria of § 265-9A through E shall be
notified by the Zoning Board of Appeals in writing over the signature of
the Chairman of the Zoning Board of Appeals that:
(1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in greatly increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25) per
one hundred dollars ($100) of insurance coverage;
(2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property; and,
(3) the applicant agrees in writing that the applicant is fully aware of
all the risks inherent in the use of land subject to flooding, assumes
those risks and agrees to indemnify and defend the municipality
against any claims filed against it that are related to the applicant's
decision to use land located in a floodplain and that the applicant
individually releases the municipality from any claims the applicant
may have against the municipality that are related to the use of
land located in a floodplain.

§ 270-8. Zones and Official Moreland Zoning Map.
§ 270-9. Interpretation of zone boundaries.
A. Zones. The area of the Town subject to the provisions of this chapter
shall be divided into two shoreland zones, the boundaries of which
intentionally embrace and overlay parts of other official zones of the
Town of Sanford.
(1) Resource Protection Zone. The standards of the Resource
Protection Zone apply to all areas designated as "Resource
Protection" on the Official Shoreland Zoning Map.
(2) Shoreland Overlay Zone. The standards of the Shoreland Overlay
Zone apply to all other shoreland areas not included within the
Resource Protection Zone.
(3) The Shoreland Overlay Zone includes two development zones.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, development in the
General Development Shoreland Zone 1 and General Development
Shoreland Zone 2, shall conform to the standards of the Shoreland
Overlay Zone.
(a) General Development Shoreland Zone 1
(b) General Development Shoreland Zone 2
B. Official Shoreland Zoning Map. The areas to which this chapter is
applicable are shown on the Official Shoreland Zoning Map which is
made a part of this chapter.
C. Certification of Official Shoreland Zoning Map. The Official Shoreland
Zoning Map shall be certified by the attested signature of the Town
Clerk and shall be located in the Code Enforcement Office.
D. Changes to the Official Shoreland Zoning Map. If amendments, in
accordance with § 270-7, are made in the zone boundaries or other
matter portrayed on the Official Shoreland Zoning Map, such changes
shall be made on the Official Shoreland Zoning Map within 30 days
after the amendment has been approved by the Commissioner of the
Department of Environmental Protection.
A. Unless otherwise set forth on the Official Shoreland Zoning Map, zone
boundary lines are property lines, the center lines of streets, roads and
rights-of-way, and the boundaries of the shoreland areas as defined
herein. Where uncertainty exists as to the exact location of zone
boundary lines, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be the final authority
as to location.
B. When there is any question as to the location of the boundary of the
Resource Protection Zone or Shoreland Overlay Zone, including the
accuracy of mapped wetlands or mapped floodplains, the location shall
be established by field determination. When a field determination of the
§ 270-8 WOOD, SALE OF § 270-9
252:463
§ 270-10. Land use requirements.
§ 270-11. Nonconformance.
boundary has been made by the Town, this determination shall
supersede any mapped or written description of the boundary. Any
property owner may submit evidence to assist the Town in determining
the appropriate location for the boundary.
A. Except as hereinafter specified, no building, structure or land shall
hereafter be used or occupied and no building or structure or part
thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, expanded, moved, or
altered and no new lot shall be created except in conformity with all of
the regulations herein specified for the zone in which it is located,
unless a variance is granted.
B. Any use permitted in an underlying zone, as specified in Chapter 280,
Zoning, of the Town Code, shall be permitted in the Shoreland Overlay
Zone unless specifically excluded by this chapter.
C. All such uses shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter,
including the performance standards of § 270-14.
D. All use of land within the Resource Protection Zone shall be in
conformance with the requirements of this chapter.
E. Where any conflict exists between the requirements of this chapter and
Chapter 280, Zoning, the more restrictive provision shall apply.
A. Purpose. It is the intent of this chapter to promote land use
conformities, except that nonconforming conditions that existed before
the effective date of this chapter or amendments thereto shall be
allowed to continue, subject to the requirements set forth in this
section. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a non-conforming
condition shall not be permitted to become more non-conforming. The
nonconformance provisions of this section shall apply to structures,
uses, and lots within the Resource Protection and Shoreland Overlay
Zones notwithstanding the nonconformance provisions of Article VII of
Chapter 280, Zoning.
B. General.
(1) Transfer of ownership. Nonconforming structures, lots, and uses
may be transferred and the new owner may continue the
nonconforming use or continue to use the nonconforming structure
or lot, subject to the provisions of this chapter.
(2) Repair and maintenance. This chapter allows, without a permit, the
normal upkeep and maintenance of nonconforming uses and
structures including repairs or renovations that do not involve
expansion of the nonconforming use or structure, and such other
§ 270-9 SANFORD CODE § 270-11
252:464
changes in a nonconforming use or structure as federal, state, or
local building and safety codes may require.
C. Nonconforming structures.
(1) Expansions.
(a) A nonconforming structure may be added to or expanded after
obtaining a permit from the same permitting authority as that
for a new structure, if such addition or expansion does not
increase the nonconformity of the structure and is in
accordance with subsections (b) and (c) below.
(b) Legally existing non-conforming principal and accessory
structures that do not meet the water body, tributary stream,
or wetland setback requirements may be expanded or altered
as follows, as long as all other applicable standards contained
in this chapter are met.
[1] Expansion of any portion of a structure within 25 feet,
horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a
water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland
is prohibited, even if the expansion will not increase
nonconformity with the water body, tributary stream or
wetland setback requirement.
[2] Expansion of an accessory structure that is located closer
to the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary
stream, or upland edge of a wetland than the principal
structure is prohibited, even if the expansion will not
increase nonconformity with the water body or wetland
setback requirement.
[3] For structures located less than 75 feet, horizontal
distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body,
tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland, the
maximum combined total floor area for all portions of
those structures within that 75-foot distance is 1,000
square feet, and the maximum height of any portion of a
structure that is within 75 feet, horizontal distance, of a
water body, tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland
is 20 feet or the height of the existing structure, whichever
is greater.
[4] For structures located less than 100 feet, horizontal
distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond
classified as GPA or a river flowing to a great pond
classified as GPA, the maximum combined total floor area
for all portions of those structures within that 100-foot
distance is 1,500 square feet, and the maximum height of
any portion of a structure that is within 100 feet,
horizontal distance, of a great pond is 25 feet or the height
§ 270-11 WOOD, SALE OF § 270-11
252:465
of the existing structure, whichever is greater, except that
any portion of those structures located less than 75 feet,
horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of
a water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a
wetland must meet the floor area and height limits of
§ 270-11.C(1)(b)[3]. For the purposes of § 270-11.C(1)(b),
a basement is not counted toward floor area.
(c) Whenever a new, enlarged, or replacement foundation is
constructed under a non-conforming structure, the structure
and new foundation must be placed such that the setback
requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as
determined by the Planning Board or its designee, basing its
decision on the criteria specified in § 270-11.C(2). Relocation,
below. If the completed foundation does not extend beyond the
exterior dimensions of the structure and the foundation does
not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three
additional feet, as measured from the uphill side of the
structure, it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the
structure.
(2) Relocation.
(a) A nonconforming structure may be relocated within the
boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located
provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback
requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by
the Planning Board or its designee, and, provided that if the
use is not connected to the public sewerage system, the
applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage
disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the
State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules (Rules),
or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the
law and said Rules. In no case shall a structure be relocated in
a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming.
(b) In determining whether the building relocation meets the
setback to the greatest practical extent, the Planning Board or
its designee shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the
land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of other
structures on the property and on adjacent properties, the
location of the septic system (if any) and other on-site soils
suitable for septic systems, and the type and amount of
vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation.
(c) When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or
wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure, the
Planning Board shall require replanting of native vegetation to
compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In addition, the area
from which the relocated structure was removed must be
§ 270-11 SANFORD CODE § 270-11
252:466
replanted with vegetation. Replanting shall be required as
follows:
[1] Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be
replanted with at least one native tree, three feet in height,
for every tree removed. If more than five trees are planted,
no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the
number of trees planted. Replaced trees must be planted
no further from the water or wetland than the trees that
were removed. Other woody and herbaceous vegetation,
and ground cover, that are removed or destroyed in order
to relocate a structure must be re-established. An area at
least the same size as the area where vegetation and/or
ground cover was disturbed, damaged, or removed must
be reestablished within the setback area. The vegetation
and/or ground cover must consist of similar native
vegetation and/or ground cover that was disturbed,
destroyed or removed.
[2] Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel
the original location of the structure shall be replanted
with vegetation which may consist of grasses, shrubs,
trees, or a combination thereof.
(3) Reconstruction or replacement.
(a) Any nonconforming structure other than a dock or float which
is located less than the required setback from a water body,
tributary stream, or wetland and which is removed, or
damaged or destroyed, regardless of the cause, by more than
50% of the market value of the structure before such damage,
destruction or removal, may be reconstructed or replaced
provided that a permit is obtained within 18 months of the date
of said damage, destruction, or removal, and provided that
such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the
water body, tributary stream or wetland setback requirement
to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning
Board in accordance with the purposes of this chapter. In no
case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to
increase its nonconformity. If the reconstructed or replacement
structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any
larger than the original structure, except as allowed pursuant
to § 270-11.C(1)(a) above, as determined by the nonconforming
floor area and volume of the reconstructed or
replaced structure at its new location. If the total amount of
floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated
or reconstructed beyond the required setback area, no portion
of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or
constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new
structure. When it is necessary to remove vegetation in order
§ 270-11 WOOD, SALE OF § 270-11
252:467
to replace or reconstruct a structure, vegetation shall be
replanted in accordance with § 270-11.C(2) above.
(b) When the nonconforming structure in above § 270-11.C(3)(a) is
less than 500 square feet in area, the request for
reconstruction or replacement shall be reviewed by the Code
Enforcement Officer instead of the Planning Board. The
reconstruction or replacement shall comply with all other
provisions of § 270-11.C(3)(a) above.
(c) Any nonconforming structure which is located less than the
required setback from a water body, tributary stream, or
wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market
value, or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market
value of the structure, excluding normal maintenance and
repair, may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained
from the Code Enforcement Officer within one year of such
damage, destruction, or removal.
(d) In determining whether the building reconstruction or
replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical
extent, the Planning Board or its designee shall consider, in
addition to the criteria in § 270-11.C(2) above, the physical
condition and type of foundation present, if any.
(4) Replacement of docks and floats. A dock or float which is
nonconforming because of its size or location may be replaced
provided the replacement is no more nonconforming than the
original.
(5) Change of use of a nonconforming structure.
(a) The use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to
another use unless the Planning Board, after receiving a
written application, determines that the new use will have no
greater adverse impact on the water body, tributary stream, or
wetland or on the subject or adjacent properties and resources
than the existing use.
(b) In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the
Planning Board shall require written documentation from the
applicant regarding the probable effects on public health and
safety, erosion and sedimentation, water quality, fish and
wildlife habitat, vegetative cover, visual and actual points of
public access to waters, natural beauty, floodplain
management, archaeological and historic resources, and
commercial fishing activities and other functionally waterdependent
uses.
D. Nonconforming uses.
§ 270-11 SANFORD CODE § 270-11
252:468
(1) Expansions. Expansions of nonconforming uses are prohibited,
except that non-conforming residential uses may, after obtaining a
permit from the Planning Board, be expanded within existing
residential structures or within expansions of such structures as
allowed in § 270-11.C(1)(b) above.
(2) Resumption prohibited. A lot, building or structure in or on which a
nonconforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding one year,
or which is superseded by a conforming use, may not again be
devoted to a nonconforming use except that the Planning Board
may, for good cause shown by the applicant, grant up to a one year
extension to that time period. This provision shall not apply to the
resumption of a use of a residential structure provided that the
structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes
during the preceding five year period.
E. Nonconforming lots.
(1) Nonconforming lots. A nonconforming lot of record as of the
effective date of this chapter or amendment thereto may be built
upon, without the need for a variance, provided that such lot is in
separate ownership and not contiguous with any other lot in the
same ownership and that all provisions of this chapter except lot
area, lot width and shore frontage can be met. Variances relating to
setback or other requirements not involving lot area, lot width or
shore frontage shall be obtained by action of the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
(2) Contiguous built lots.
(a) If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in a single or joint
ownership of record at the time of adoption of this chapter, and
if all or part of the lots does not meet the dimensional
requirements of this chapter, and if a principal use or structure
exists on each lot, the nonconforming lots may be conveyed
separately or together, provided that the State Minimum Lot
Size Law (12 M.R.S.A. §§ 4807-A through 4807-D) and the
State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are
complied with.
(b) If two or more principal uses or structures existed on a single
lot of record on the effective date of this chapter, each may be
sold on a separate lot provided that the above-referenced law
and rules are complied with. When such lots are divided, each
lot thus created must be as conforming as possible to the
dimensional requirements of this chapter as determined by the
Planning Board.
(3) Contiguous lots, vacant or partially built.
(a) When two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in single or
joint ownership of record at the time of or since adoption or
§ 270-11 WOOD, SALE OF § 270-11
252:469

amendment of this chapter or any time thereafter, if any of
these lots do not individually meet the dimensional
requirements of this chapter or subsequent amendments, and
if one or more of the lots are vacant or contain no principal
structure, the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to
meet the dimensional requirements of this chapter.
(b) This provision shall not apply to two or more contiguous lots, at
least one of which is nonconforming, owned by the same
person or persons on the effective date of this chapter or any
time thereafter, and recorded in the registry of deeds if the lot
is served by a public sewer or can accommodate a subsurface
sewage disposal system in conformance with the State of
Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules and:
[1] Each lot contains at least 100 feet of shore frontage and at
least 20,000 square feet of lot area; or
[2] Any lots that do not meet the frontage and lot size
requirements of § 270-11.E(3)(b)[1] are reconfigured or
combined so that each new lot contains at least 100 feet of
shore frontage and 20,000 square feet of lot area.
A. Land uses allowed within the Resource Protection Zone are shown in
Table 1, Land Uses in the Shoreland Zone.92 Table 1 also shows those
uses allowed within the Shoreland Overlay Zone. Such uses are allowed
only if they are allowed in both the Shoreland Overlay Zone and the
underlying zones.
B. All land use activities, as indicated in Table 1, Land Uses in the
Shoreland Zone, shall conform with all of the applicable land use
standards in § 270-13 and shoreland performance standards in
§ 270-14.93 The zone designation for a particular site shall be
determined from the Official Shoreland Zoning Map.
A. All land use activities within the Shoreland Overlay Zone shall conform
to the development controls of Chapter 280, Zoning, Article XI for the
zone in which such activity is located.
B. Lots located in the Shoreland Overlay Zone and the Resource
Protection Zone shall have the following minimum shore frontage
requirements:
(1) Residential: 200 feet per dwelling unit

shall conform to the following standards:
(2) Public and Private Recreational uses: 200 feet per use
(3) Commercial, Industrial, Governmental, or Industrial per principal
structure: 300 feet
C. Land below the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge
of a wetland and land beneath roads serving more than two lots shall
not be included toward calculating minimum lot area.
D. Lots located on opposite sides of a public or private road shall be
considered each a separate tract or parcel of land unless such road was
established by the owner of land on both sides thereof after September
22, 1971.
E. The minimum width of any portion of any lot within 100 feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge
of a wetland shall be equal to or greater than the shore frontage
requirement for a lot with the proposed use.
F. If more than one residential dwelling unit, principal governmental,
institutional, commercial or industrial structure or use, or combination
thereof, is constructed or established on a single parcel, all dimensional
requirements shall be met for each additional dwelling unit, principal
structure, or use.
A. Principal and accessory structures.
(1) All new principal and accessory buildings and structures in the
Resource Protection zone shall be set back at least 250 feet,
horizontal distance, from rivers with undeveloped shoreline and
from freshwater wetlands and great ponds which are rated medium
to high value except for structures, roads, parking spaces or other
regulated objects specifically allowed in that zone in which case the
setback requirements specified in § 270-14.A(2) below shall apply.
(2) All new principal and accessory buildings and structures in the
Shoreland Overlay Zone shall be set back at least 75 feet,
horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of great

Recreational Area to the northerly side of the School Street
Bridge in Sanford, including the General Development
Shoreland zones 1 and 2, shall have a minimum setback of 25
feet.
(d) In addition, the water body, tributary stream, or wetland
setback provision shall neither apply to structures which
require direct access to the water body or wetland as an
operational necessity, such as piers, docks and retaining walls,
nor to other functionally water-dependent uses.
(e) On a non-conforming lot of record on which only a residential
structure exists, and it is not possible to place an accessory
structure meeting the required water body, tributary stream or
wetland setbacks, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue a
permit to place a single accessory structure, with no utilities,
for the storage of yard tools and similar equipment. Such
accessory structure shall not exceed 80 square feet in area nor
eight feet in height, and shall be located as far from the
shoreline or tributary stream as practical and shall meet all
other applicable standards, including lot coverage and
vegetation clearing limitations. In no case shall the structure
be located closer to the shoreline or tributary stream than the
principal structure.
(f) Principal or accessory structures and expansions of existing
structures which are permitted in the Resource Protection, and
Shoreland zone, shall not exceed 35 feet in height. This
provision shall not apply to structures such as transmission
towers, windmills, antennas, and similar structures having no
floor area.
(3) The lowest floor elevation or openings of all buildings and
structures, including basements, shall be elevated at least one foot
above the elevation of the 100-year flood, the flood of record or, in
the absence of these, the flood as defined by soil types identified as
recent flood-plain soils. Accessory structures may be placed in
accordance with the standards of Chapter 265, Floodplain
Management, and need not meet the elevation requirements of this
paragraph.
(4) The total footprint area of all structures, parking lots and other
non-vegetated surfaces within the Resource Protection Zone shall
not exceed 20% of the lot or a portion thereof located within the
shoreland zone, including land area previously developed. Within
the Shoreland Overlay Zone, the total footprint area of all
structures, parking lots and other non-vegetated surfaces shall not
exceed 20% of the lot or a portion thereof, including land area
previously developed, with the following exceptions:
§ 270-14 SANFORD CODE § 270-14

(5) Retaining walls that are not necessary for erosion control shall
meet the structure setback requirement, except for low retaining
walls and associated fill provided all of the following conditions are
met:
(a) The site has been previously altered and an effective vegetated
buffer does not exist;
(b) The wall(s) is(are) at least 25 feet, horizontal distance, from
the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or
upland edge of a wetland;
(c) The site where the retaining wall will be constructed is legally
existing lawn or is a site eroding from lack of naturally
occurring vegetation, and which cannot be stabilized with
vegetative plantings;
(d) The total height of the wall(s), in the aggregate, are no more
than 24 inches;
(e) Retaining walls are located outside of the 100-year floodplain
on rivers, streams, coastal wetlands, and tributary streams, as
designated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
(FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps, or the flood of record, or in the absence of these, by soil
types identified as recent flood plain soils.
(f) The area behind the wall is revegetated with grass, shrubs,
trees, or a combination thereof, and no further structural
development will occur within the setback area, including
patios and decks; and
(g) A vegetated buffer area is established within 25 feet,
horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water
body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland when a
natural buffer area does not exist. The buffer area must meet
the following characteristics:
[1] The buffer must include shrubs and other woody and
herbaceous vegetation. Where natural ground cover is

setback requirements for structures for the zone in which such
areas are located. The setback requirement for parking areas
serving public boat launching facilities shall be no less than 50 feet,
horizontal distance, from the shoreline or tributary stream if the
Planning Board finds that no other reasonable alternative exists
further from the shoreline or tributary stream.
(2) Parking areas shall be adequately sized for the proposed use and
shall be designed to prevent stormwater runoff from flowing
directly into a water body, tributary stream or wetland and where
feasible, to retain all runoff on-site.
(3) The amount of parking and design of parking facilities shall comply
with Chapter 280, Zoning.
G. Roads and driveways. The following standards shall apply to the
construction of roads and/or driveways and drainage systems, culverts
and other related features within Resource Protection and Shoreland
Overlay Zones in addition to the requirements set forth in Chapter 275,
Subdivision of Land:
(1) Roads and driveways shall be set back at least 100 feet, horizontal
distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified
GPA or river that flows to a great pond classified GPA, and 75 feet,
horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of other water
bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland unless
no reasonable alternative exists as determined by the Planning
Board. If no other reasonable alternative exists, the road and/or
driveway setback requirement shall be no less than 50 feet,
horizontal distance, upon clear showing by the applicant that
appropriate techniques will be used to prevent sedimentation of
the water body, tributary stream or wetland. Such techniques may
include, but are not limited to, the installation of settling basins
and/or the effective use of additional ditch relief culverts and
turnouts placed so as to avoid sedimentation of the water body,
tributary stream, or wetland.
(a) On slopes of greater than 20%, the road and/or driveway
setback shall be increased by 10 feet, horizontal distance, for
each five percent increase in slope above 20%.
(b) § 270-14.G(1) does not apply to approaches to water crossings
nor to roads or driveways that provide access to permitted
structures and facilities located nearer to the shoreline due to
an operational necessity, excluding temporary docks for
recreational uses. Roads and driveways providing access to
permitted structures within the setback area shall comply fully
with the requirements of § 270-14.G(1) except for that portion
§ 270-14 WOOD, SALE OF § 270-14
252:477
of the road or driveway necessary for direct access to the
structure.
(2) Existing public roads may be expanded within the legal road rightof-
way regardless of their setback from a water body, tributary
stream or wetland.
(3) New roads and driveways are prohibited in a Resource Protection
Zone except that the Planning Board may grant a permit to
construct a road or driveway to provide access to permitted uses
within the zone. A road or driveway in a Resource Protection Zone
may also be approved by the Planning Board upon a finding that no
reasonable alternative route or location is available outside the
zone. When a road or driveway is permitted in a Resource
Protection Zone, the road and/or driveway shall be set back as far
as practicable from the normal high-water line of a water body,
tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland.
(4) Road and driveway banks shall be no steeper than a slope of two
horizontal to one vertical, and shall be graded and stabilized in
accordance with the provisions for erosion and sedimentation
control contained in § 270-14.P.
(5) Road and driveway grades shall be no greater than 10% except for
segments of less than 200 feet.
(6) In order to prevent road and driveway surface drainage from
directly entering water bodies, tributary streams or wetlands,
roads and driveways shall be designed, constructed, and
maintained to empty onto an unscarified buffer strip at least 50 feet
plus two times the average slope in width between the outflow
point of the ditch or culvert and the normal high-water line of a
water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland. Surface
drainage which is directed to an unscarified buffer strip shall be
diffused or spread out to promote infiltration of the runoff and to
minimize channelized flow of the drainage through the buffer strip.
(7) Ditch relief (cross drainage) culverts, drainage dips and water
turnouts shall be installed in a manner effective in directing
drainage onto unscarified buffer strips before the flow gains
sufficient volume or head to erode the road, driveway, or ditch. To
accomplish this, the following shall apply:
(a) Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and associated water
turnouts shall be spaced along the road or driveway at
intervals no greater than indicated in the following table:
§ 270-14 SANFORD CODE § 270-14
252:478
Grade
(percent)
Spacing
(feet)
0 to 2 250
3 to 5 200 to 135
6 to 10 100 to 80
11 to 15 80 to 60
16 to 20 60 to 45
21 plus 40
(b) Drainage dips may be used in place of ditch relief culverts only
where the grade is 10% or less.
(c) On sections having slopes greater than 10%, ditch relief
culverts shall be placed at approximately a 30 degree angle
downslope from a line perpendicular to the center line of the
road or driveway.
(d) Ditch relief culverts shall be sufficiently sized and properly
installed in order to allow for effective functioning, and their
inlet and outlet ends shall be stabilized with appropriate
materials.
(8) Ditches, culverts, bridges, dips, water turnouts and other storm
water runoff control installations associated with roads and
driveways shall be maintained on a regular basis to assure effective
functioning.
H. Signs. Signs shall conform to the standards of Chapter 280, Zoning.
I. Storm water runoff.
(1) All new construction and development shall be designed to
minimize storm water runoff from the site in excess of the natural
predevelopment conditions. Where possible, existing natural runoff
control features, such as berms, swales, terraces and wooded
areas, shall be retained in order to reduce runoff and encourage
infiltration of storm waters.
(2) Storm water runoff control systems shall be maintained as
necessary to ensure proper functioning.
J. Septic waste disposal. All subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be
installed in conformance with the State of Maine Subsurface
Wastewater Disposal Rules, and the following:
(1) clearing or removal of woody vegetation necessary to site a new
system and any associated fill extensions shall not extend closer
than 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line
of a water body or the upland edge of a wetland, and
§ 270-14 WOOD, SALE OF § 270-14
252:479
(2) a holding tank is not allowed for a first-time residential use in the
shoreland zone.
K. Essential services.
(1) Where feasible, the installation of essential services shall be limited
to existing public ways and existing service corridors.
(2) The installation of essential services, other than road-side
distribution lines, is not allowed in a Resource Protection Zone,
except to provide services to a permitted use within said zone, or
except where the applicant demonstrates that no reasonable
alternative exists. Where allowed, such structures and facilities
shall be located so as to minimize any adverse impacts on
surrounding uses and resources, including visual impacts.
L. Mineral exploration and extraction. Mineral exploration to determine
the nature or extent of mineral resources shall be accomplished by
hand sampling, test boring, or other methods which create minimal
disturbance of less than 100 square feet of ground surface. A permit
from the Code Enforcement Officer shall be required for mineral
exploration which exceeds the above limitation. All excavations,
including test pits and holes, shall be immediately capped, filled or
secured by other equally effective measures to restore disturbed areas
and to protect the public health and safety. Mineral extraction may be
allowed subject to the provisions of § 280-91 of Chapter 280, Zoning,
and the following additional standards:
(1) A reclamation plan shall be filed with, and approved, by the
Planning Board before a permit is granted. Such plan shall describe
in detail procedures to be undertaken to fulfill the requirements of
§ 270-14.L(4) below.
(2) No part of any extraction operation, including drainage and runoff
control features, shall be permitted within 100 feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond classified
GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA and within 75
feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of any other
water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland.
Extraction operations shall not be permitted within 50 feet,
horizontal distance, of any property line without written permission
of the owner of such adjacent property.
(3) Within 12 months following the completion of extraction operations
at any extraction site, which operations shall be deemed complete
when less than 100 cubic yards of materials are removed in any
consecutive twelve-month period, ground levels and grades shall
be established in accordance with the following:
(a) All debris, stumps, and similar material shall be removed for
disposal in an approved location or shall be buried on-site. Only
materials generated on-site may be buried or covered on-site.
§ 270-14 SANFORD CODE § 270-14
252:480
(b) The final graded slope shall be a slope of 2 1/2:1 or flatter.
(c) Topsoil or loam shall be retained to cover all disturbed land
areas, which shall be reseeded and stabilized with vegetation
native to the area. Additional topsoil or loam shall be obtained
from off-site sources if necessary to complete the stabilization
project.
(4) In keeping with the purposes of this chapter, the Planning Board
may impose such conditions as are necessary to minimize the
adverse impacts associated with mineral extraction operations on
surrounding uses and resources.
M. Agriculture.
(1) All spreading of manure shall be accomplished in conformance with
the Manure Utilization Guidelinespublished by the Maine
Department of Agriculture on November 1, 2001, and the Nutrient
Management Law (7 M.R.S.A. §§ 4201-4209).
(2) Manure shall not be stored or stockpiled within 100 feet, horizontal
distance, of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great
pond classified GPA, or within 75 feet, horizontal distance, of other
water bodies, tributary streams, or wetlands. All manure storage
areas within the Resource Protection or Shoreland Overlay Zones
must be constructed or modified such that the facility produces no
discharge of effluent or contaminated storm water.
(3) Agricultural activities involving tillage of soil greater than 40,000
square feet in surface area within the Resource Protection or
Shoreland Overlay Zones shall require a Conservation Plan to be
filed with the Code Enforcement Officer. Nonconformance with the
provisions of said plan shall be considered to be a violation of this
chapter.
(4) There shall be no new tilling of soil within 100 feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond classified
GPA; within 75 feet, horizontal distance, from other water bodies;
or within 25 feet, horizontal distance, of tributary streams and
freshwater wetlands. Operations in existence on the effective date
of this chapter and not in conformance with this provision may be
maintained.94
(5) Newly established livestock grazing areas shall not be permitted
within 100 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line
of a great pond classified GPA; within 75 feet, horizontal distance,
of other water bodies; or within 25 feet, horizontal distance, of
tributary streams and freshwater wetlands. Livestock grazing
associated with ongoing farm activities and which is not in
conformance with the above setback provisions may continue,
94.Editor's Note: See 38 M.R.S.A. § 480-A et seq.
§ 270-14 WOOD, SALE OF § 270-14
252:481
provided that such grazing is conducted in accordance with a
Conservation Plan.
N. Timber harvesting.
(1) In a Resource Protection Zone abutting a great pond, timber
harvesting shall be limited to the following:
(a) Within the strip of land extending 75 feet, horizontal distance,
inland from the normal high-water line there shall be no timber
harvesting, except to remove safety hazards.
(b) Beyond the 75-foot strip referred to in § 270-14.N(1)(a) above,
timber harvesting is permitted in accordance with
§ 270-14.N(2) below, except that in no case shall the average
residual basal area of trees over 4 1/2 inches in diameter at
4 1/2 feet above ground level be reduced to less than 30 square
feet per acre.
(2) Except in areas as described in § 270-14.N(1) above, timber
harvesting shall conform to the following provisions:
(a) Selective cutting of no more than 40% of the total volume of
trees four inches or more in diameter measured at 4 1/2 feet
above ground level on any lot in any ten year period is
permitted. In addition:
[1] Within 100 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal highwater
line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing
to a great pond classified GPA and within 75 feet,
horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of other
water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a
wetland, there shall be no clear-cut openings and a welldistributed
stand of trees and other vegetation, including
existing ground cover, shall be maintained.
[2] At distances greater than 100 feet, horizontal distance, of
a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great
pond classified GPA and greater than 75 feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high-water line of other water
bodies or the upland edge of a wetland, harvesting
operations shall not create single clear-cut openings
greater than 10,000 square feet in the forest canopy.
Where such openings exceed 5,000 square feet they shall
be at least 100 feet apart. Such clear-cut openings shall be
included in the calculation of total volume removal. For the
purposes of these standards, volume may be considered to
be equivalent to basal area.
(b) Timber harvesting operations exceeding the 40% limitation in
§ 270-14.N(2)(a) above may be allowed by the Planning Board
upon a clear showing, including a forest management plan
§ 270-14 SANFORD CODE § 270-14
252:482
signed by a Maine licensed professional forester, that such
an exception is necessary for good forest management and
will be carried out in accordance with the purposes of this
chapter. The Planning Board shall notify the Commissioner of
the Department of Environmental Protection of each exception
allowed within 14 days of the Planning Board's decision.
(c) No accumulation of slash shall be left within 50 feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body. In all
other areas slash shall either be removed or disposed of in such
a manner that it lies on the ground and no part thereof extends
more than four feet above the ground. Any debris that falls
below the normal high-water line of a water body or tributary
stream shall be removed.
(d) Timber harvesting equipment shall not use stream channels as
travel routes except when:
[1] Surface waters are frozen; and
[2] The activity will not result in any ground disturbance.
(e) All crossings of flowing water shall require a bridge or culvert,
except in areas with low banks and channel beds which are
composed of gravel, rock or similar hard surface which would
not be eroded or otherwise damaged.
(f) Skid trail approaches to water crossings shall be located and
designed so as to prevent water runoff from directly entering
the water body or tributary stream. Upon completion of timber
harvesting, temporary bridges and culverts shall be removed
and areas of exposed soil revegetated.
(g) Except for water crossings, skid trails and other sites where
the operation of machinery used in timber harvesting results in
the exposure of mineral soil shall be located such that an
unscarified strip of vegetation of at least 75 feet, horizontal
distance, in width for slopes up to 10% shall be retained
between the exposed mineral soil and the normal high-water
line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland. For each 10%
increase in slope, the unscarified strip shall be increased by 20
feet, horizontal distance. The provisions of this subsection
apply only to a face sloping toward the water body or wetland;
provided, however, that no portion of such exposed mineral soil
on a back face shall be closer than 25 feet, horizontal distance,
from the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge
of a wetland.
O. Clearing or removal of vegetation for activities other than timber
harvesting.
§ 270-14 WOOD, SALE OF § 270-14
252:483
(1) In a Resource Protection Zone abutting a great pond, there shall be
no cutting of vegetation within the strip of land extending 75 feet,
horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line, except
to remove safety hazards. Elsewhere, in any Resource Protection
Zone the cutting or removal of vegetation shall be limited to that
which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that zone.
(2) Except in areas as described in § 270-14O(1) above, and except to
allow for the development of permitted uses, within a strip of land
extending 100 feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal
high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a
great pond classified GPA and 75 feet, horizontal distance, from any
other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a
wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be preserved as follows:
(a) There shall be no cleared opening greater than 250 square feet
in the forest canopy (or other existing woody vegetation if a
forested canopy is not present) as measured from the outer
limits of the tree or shrub crown. However, a footpath not to
exceed six feet in width as measured between tree trunks and/
or shrub stems is allowed provided that a cleared line of sight
to the water through the buffer strip is not created.
(b) Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed
provided that a well-distributed stand of trees and other
natural vegetation are maintained.
[1] For the purposes of § 270-14.O(2)(b), a "well-distributed
stand of trees" adjacent to a great pond classified GPA or a
river or stream flowing to a great pond classified GPA,
shall be defined as maintaining a rating score of 24 or
more in each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular (1,250 square
feet) area as determined by the following rating system:
Diameter of Tree at 4 1/2 feet
Above Ground Level
(inches) Points
2 to less than 4 1
4 to less than 8 2
8 to less than 12 4
12 or greater 8
[2] Adjacent to other water bodies, tributary streams, and
wetlands, a "well-distributed stand of trees" is defined as
maintaining a minimum rating score of 16 per 25-foot by
50-foot rectangular area.
[3] As an example, adjacent to a great pond, if a 25-foot by
50-foot plot contains four trees between two and four
§ 270-14 SANFORD CODE § 270-14
252:484
inches in diameter, two trees between four and eight
inches in diameter, three trees between eight and twelve
inches in diameter, and two trees over twelve inches in
diameter, the rating score is: (4 x 1) + (2 x 2) + (3 x 4) + (2
x 8) = 36 points. Thus, the 25-foot by 50-foot plot contains
trees worth 36 points. Trees totaling 12 points (36 - 24 =
12) may be removed from the plot provided that no cleared
openings are created.
[4] The following shall govern in applying this point system:
[a] The 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular plots must be
established where the landowner or lessee proposes
clearing within the required buffer;
[b] Each successive plot must be adjacent to, but not
overlap a previous plot;
[c] Any plot not containing the required points must have
no vegetation removed except as otherwise allowed by
this chapter;
[d] Any plot containing the required points may have
vegetation removed down to the minimum points
required or as otherwise allowed by this chapter;
[e] Where conditions permit, no more than 50% of the
points on any 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular area may
consist of trees greater than 12 inches in diameter.
[5] For the purposes of § 270-14.O(2)(b) "other natural
vegetation" is defined as retaining existing vegetation
under three feet in height and other ground cover and
retaining at least five saplings less than two inches in
diameter at 4 1/2 feet above ground level for each 25-foot
by 50-foot rectangle area. If five saplings do not exist, no
woody stems less than two inches in diameter can be
removed until five saplings have been recruited into the
plot.
[6] Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than 40%
of the total volume of trees four inches or more in diameter
measured at 4 1/2 feet above ground level may be removed
in any ten-year period.
(c) In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing
vegetation under three feet in height and other ground cover,
including leaf litter and the forest duff layer, shall not be cut,
covered, or removed, except to provide for a footpath or other
permitted uses as described in § 270-14.O(2) and
§ 270-14.O(2)(a) above.
§ 270-14 WOOD, SALE OF § 270-14
252:485
(d) Pruning of tree branches on the bottom 1/3 of the tree is
allowed.
(e) In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation, when the
removal of storm-damaged, diseased, unsafe, or dead trees
results in the creation of cleared openings, these openings
shall be replanted with native tree species unless existing new
tree growth is present.
(3) § 270-14.O(2) does not apply to those portions of public
recreational facilities adjacent to public swimming areas as long as
cleared areas are limited to the minimum area necessary.
(4) At distances greater than 100 feet, horizontal distance, from a
great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond
classified GPA and 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal
high-water line of any other water body, tributary stream, or the
upland edge of a wetland, there shall be allowed on any lot, in any
ten year period, selective cutting of not more than 40% of the
volume of trees four inches or more in diameter measured 4 1/2
feet above ground level. Tree removal in conjunction with the
development of permitted uses shall be included in the 40%
calculation. For the purposes of these standards, volume may be
considered to be equivalent to basal area. In no event shall cleared
openings for any purpose, including but not limited to, principal
and accessory structures, driveways, lawns, and sewage disposal
areas, exceed in the aggregate 25% of the lot area within the
shoreland zone or 10,000 square feet, whichever is greater,
including land previously cleared.
(5) Legally existing nonconforming cleared openings may be

Administrative Procedures
[Amended 1-18-2005]
§ 275-7. Planning Board procedures; agenda for meetings.
To establish an orderly, equitable, and expeditious procedure for reviewing
subdivisions and to avoid unnecessary delays in processing applications
for subdivision review, the Board shall adopt Planning Board procedures
governing the handling of application submissions, including the
establishment of a submittal deadline for being placed upon the Board's
agenda. The Planning Director shall prepare a written agenda for each
regularly scheduled meeting. The agenda shall be prepared in advance
of the meeting, distributed to the Board members and any applicants
appearing on the agenda, and posted at the municipal offices. Except for
good cause shown and as otherwise permitted by law, the Board shall take
no action on any application not appearing on the Board's written agenda.
§ 275-8. Application and development review fees.
A. Application fees. Each application requires the payment of a
nonrefundable application fee. These fees vary based upon the type of
application. They are itemized in the chart included at the end of this
chapter.
B. Development review fee. The Town may use contracted staff such as the
Town Engineer or Town Attorney or outside consultants to review those
aspects of a subdivision proposal that are outside of the expertise of
Town staff. The cost of this outside review shall be borne by the
applicant. To cover the cost of this outside review, an applicant shall
deposit a development review fee with the Planning Department at the
time of the submission of an application. The Planning Department shall
maintain a project account for each application showing the amounts of
the deposits and the charges incurred for review of the subdivision
proposal. The initial deposit for an application is shown on the chart
included at the end of this chapter. If the amount initially deposited in
the project account is drawn down by 75% or more, the Planning
Department shall notify the applicant and require that an additional
amount equal to 50% of the initial deposit be submitted. The
Department shall continue to notify the applicant and require additional
deposits as needed. The applicant may also be required, as a condition
of approval, to post additional amounts to cover the cost of construction
compliance review. No certificates of occupancy are to be issued until
all outstanding fees have been paid. Any balance in the account
remaining after a decision on the final acceptance of the project by the
Planning Director, Town Engineer and Code Enforcement Officer shall
be returned to the applicant. Payment of this fee may not be waived.
Further, payment of the fee shall be deemed a cost of review and shall
not be contingent on plan approval. Any individual or firm who has an
outstanding review account balance is not eligible to submit a new site
§ 275-7 WOOD, SALE OF § 275-8

ARTICLE IV
Preapplication Procedures
§ 275-9. Purpose.
The purpose of the preapplication process is for the applicant to present
general information regarding the proposed subdivision to the staff and
Board and receive the staff's and Board's comments prior to the expenditure
of substantial sums of money on surveying and engineering by the
applicant.
§ 275-10. Activities.
The preapplication phase consists of the following four activities:
§ 275-11. Preapplication conference and site inspection.
§ 275-12. Classification of subdivision.
Within 10 days of the preapplication conference and site inspection, the
Planning Director shall tentatively classify the subdivision as a minor or
major subdivision and advise the applicant of this determination. The
Planning Board shall review the classification of the project when it first
considers the application and shall determine if it is a major or minor
subdivision. The classification may later be revised if the scope of the
project changes.
A. A preapplication conference and site inspection.
B. The classification of the project.
C. The determination of the contour interval.
D. The submission and review by the Board of a site inventory and
analysis.
A. All applicants for subdivision review shall schedule a preapplication
conference with the Planning Director. The purpose of this activity is to
familiarize the applicant with the Town's procedures and requirements
and to familiarize the Town's representatives with the nature of the
project. Such review shall not cause the plan to be a pending
application or proceeding under 1 M.R.S.A. § 302. No decisions relative
to the plan shall be made at this meeting.
B. The preapplication conference shall be held by the Planning Director.
The Planning Director may ask other Town staff, such as the Town
Engineer and a representative of the Planning Board, to participate in
the preapplication conference if warranted by the scale and/or nature
of the proposal. As part of the meeting, the Town representative(s) and
the applicant may visit the proposed site. At this meeting, the applicant
shall be prepared to discuss his/her plans for the development in a
general nature.
§ 275-9 WOOD, SALE OF § 275-13
252:515
§ 275-13. Contour interval.
Within 10 days of the tentative classification of the project by the Planning
Director, the Town Engineer shall inform the applicant in writing of the
required contour interval on the preliminary plan, or final plan in the case of
a minor subdivision. The applicant may appeal the Engineer's determination
to the Planning Board by filing a written request with the Planning Director.
This request will be considered by the Planning Board at the next meeting
at which the application is considered.
§ 275-14. Site inventory and analysis procedures.
A. After the preapplication conference has been held, the applicant must
submit a site inventory and analysis for Planning Board review. The
Planning Board may waive this requirement or reduce the amount of
information required for the revision of previously approved plans and
for minor subdivisions involving fewer than five lots. The Board may
waive or reduce the requirements only if the Board finds that the
analysis provided by this process is not necessary due to the scale of the
project. Unless waived by the Board, this review must be completed
prior to the preparation and submission of a subdivision application and
supporting documentation. The Board shall review the site inventory
and analysis with the applicant and shall authorize the submission of
the formal application when the site analysis phase is complete. The
site inventory and analysis shall be submitted to the Planning Director.
B. Upon receipt of a site inventory and analysis, the Planning Director
shall give the applicant a dated receipt. Within 10 days of the receipt of
a site inventory and analysis submission, the Planning Director shall
review the material and determine whether the submission is complete.
If the submission is determined to be incomplete, the Planning Director
shall notify the applicant in writing of this finding, shall specify the
additional material required to make the submission complete, and
shall advise the applicant that the application will not be considered by
the Board until the additional information is submitted. These steps,
except the notification requirements, shall be repeated until the
application is found to be complete. When the submission is determined
to be complete, the Planning Director shall notify the applicant in
writing of this finding, place the item on the agenda for review by the
Planning Board, and distribute copies of the submission to the members
of the Site Plan Review Committee for their review.
C. The Planning Board may hold an on-site inspection of the site to review
the existing conditions, field verify the information submitted, and
investigate the development proposal. The Board may schedule this
visit either before or after the first meeting at which the inventory and
analysis are considered. The Board may decide not to hold an on-site
inspection. If a review is pending during a period when there is snow
cover, the deadline by which the Planning Board shall take final action
on the site inventory and analysis may be extended, which extension
§ 275-13 SANFORD CODE § 275-14
252:516
§ 275-15. Site inventory and analysis submission requirements.
The site inventory and analysis are intended to provide the applicant, the
Planning Board, and the staff with a better understanding of the site and
the opportunities and constraints imposed on its use by both the natural
and built environment. It is anticipated that this analysis will result in a
subdivision plan that reflects the conditions of the site; those areas most
suitable for the proposed use will be utilized, while those that are not
suitable or present significant constraints will be avoided to the maximum
extent possible. Therefore, the submission requirements provide that the
applicant submit basic information about the site and an analysis of that
information. The site inventory and analysis submission must contain, at a
minimum, the following information:
shall not exceed 30 days after the Board is able to conduct an on-site
inspection.
D. Within 60 days of the Planning Director finding that the site inventory
and analysis submission is complete, the Board shall complete its
review of the submission and notify the applicant in writing of its
findings.
E. The review of the site inventory and analysis shall be informational and
shall not result in any formal approval or disapproval of the project. The
Board shall review the submission to determine if the information
provides a clear understanding of the site and identifies opportunities
and constraints that help determine how it should be used and
developed. The Board shall also consider any input received from
members of the staff. The outcome of the review process shall be the
identification by the Board of the issues and constraints that must be
addressed in the formal subdivision application. The Board shall also
act on any requests for waivers at this time.
A. The names, addresses, and phone numbers of the record owner and the
applicant.
B. The names and addresses of all consultants working on the project.
C. Evidence of right, title, or interest in the property.
D. The appropriate application fee.
E. Fifteen copies of an accurate scale inventory plan of the parcel at a
scale of not more than 50 feet to the inch showing as a minimum:
(1) The proposed name of the development, North arrow, date, and
scale.
(2) The boundaries of the parcel based upon a standard boundary
survey prepared by a registered land surveyor and giving the
bearings and distances of all property lines.
(3) The relationship of the site to the surrounding area.
§ 275-14 WOOD, SALE OF § 275-15
252:517
(4) The topography of the site at an appropriate contour interval
depending on the nature of the use and character of the site (in
many instances, submittal of the U.S.G.S. ten-foot contours will be
adequate).
(5) The major natural features of the site and within 500 feet of the
site, including wetlands, streams, ponds, floodplains, groundwater
aquifers, significant wildlife habitats or other important natural
features (if none, so state).
(6) Existing buildings, structures, or other improvements on the site (if
none, so state).
(7) Existing restrictions or easements on the site (if none, so state).
(8) The location and size of existing utilities or improvements servicing
the site (if none, so state).
(9) The soils on the site through a Class C medium-intensity soil survey.
(10) Any potential sources of fire protection water supply within 1/2
mile of the site, including public water mains, existing fire ponds,
or possible sources of water supply.
F. Fifteen copies of a site analysis plan at the same scale as the inventory
plans (see Subsection E above) highlighting the opportunities and
constraints of the site. This plan should enable the Planning Board to
determine: which portions of the site are unsuitable for development or
use; which portions of the site are unsuitable for on-site sewage
disposal if public sewerage is not available; which areas of the site have
development limitations (steep slopes, soil constraints, aquifers,
wetlands, wildlife habitat, floodplains, drainage, etc.) that should be
addressed in the subdivision plan; which areas of the site may be
subject to off-site conflicts or concerns (noise, lighting, traffic, etc.); and
which areas are well suited for the proposed use.
G. Fifteen copies of a narrative describing the existing conditions of the
site, the proposed development, and the constraints and opportunities
created by the site. This submission should include a narrative
description of the existing road system that will provide access to the
project and any issues related to traffic capacity, safety, sight distances,
or other traffic considerations together with any preliminary studies
done relative to the site, including wetland delineations, traffic studies,
market studies, or other information that will help the Board
understand the project.
H. Fifteen copies of a conceptual plan, drawn at the same scale as the site
analysis plan, showing the anticipated road layout and major
development features or, if the subdivision is classified as a minor
subdivision, a sketch plan, drawn at the same scale as the site analysis
plan, showing the tentative layout of lots and roads.

Minor Subdivision
§ 275-16. General provisions.
The Board may require that a minor subdivision comply with some or all
of the submission requirements for a major subdivision. The additional
information may be required when the Planning Board finds it necessary
to decide if the criteria for approval from 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4404 or the
standards from Article X of these regulations have been met.
§ 275-17. Procedure.
A. Within six months after the classification of the project as a minor
subdivision and the review or waiver of the site inventory and analysis
by the Board, the applicant shall submit an application for approval of a
final plan. Applications shall be submitted to the Planning Department.
Failure to submit the application within six months shall require
resubmission of the inventory and analysis to the Board. The final plan
shall reflect the opportunities and constraints identified in the site

shall institute proceedings to have the plan stricken from the records of
the Registry of Deeds.
D. The approval by the Board of a subdivision plan shall not be deemed to
constitute or be evidence of any acceptance by the municipality of any
street, easement, or other open space shown on such plan. When a
park, playground, or other recreation area shall have been shown on
the plan to be dedicated to the municipality, approval of the plan shall
not constitute an acceptance by the municipality of such areas. The
Board shall require the plan to contain appropriate notes to this effect.
The Board may also require the filing of a written agreement between
the applicant and the Town Council covering future deed and title
dedication and provision for the cost of grading, development,
equipment, and maintenance of any such dedicated area.
E. Failure to initiate construction of the subdivision within five years of the
date of approval and signing of the plan shall render the plan null and
void unless the applicant has requested in writing and received an
extension and has provided for the continuation of any performance
guarantees for the period of the extension prior to the expiration of the
five-year period. Upon determining that a subdivision's approval has
expired under this subsection, the Board shall have a notice placed in
the Registry of Deeds to that effect.

[1] Any part of the subdivision is located over a mapped sand
and gravel aquifer;
[2] The subdivision has an average density of more than one
dwelling unit per 100,000 square feet; or
[3] In other cases where site considerations or development
design indicates greater potential of adverse impacts on
groundwater quality, such as extensive areas of shallow to
bedrock soils, cluster developments in which the average
density is less than one dwelling unit per 100,000 square
feet but the density of the developed portion is in excess of
one dwelling unit per 80,000 square feet, or the use of
shared or common subsurface wastewater disposal

projects involving 40 or more parking spaces or projected to
generate more than 400 vehicle trips per day based upon the ITE
Trip Generation Manual. The traffic impact analysis shall be
prepared by a registered professional engineer with experience in
traffic engineering. The analysis shall indicate the expected
average daily vehicular trips, peak hour volumes, access conditions
at the site, distribution of traffic, types of vehicles expected, effect
upon the level of service of the street giving access to the site and
neighboring streets which may be affected, and recommended
improvements to maintain the desired level of service on the
affected streets.
(5) If the proposed subdivision is in the direct watershed of a great
pond and does not require a DEP stormwater permit and therefore
qualifies for the simplified review procedure as described in
§ 275-47A(2), the plan, if required, shall indicate the location and

shall institute proceedings to have the plan stricken from the records of
the Registry of Deeds.
E. The approval by the Board of a subdivision plan shall not be deemed to
constitute or be evidence of any acceptance by the municipality of any
street, easement, or other open space shown on such plan. When a
park, playground, or other recreation area shall have been shown on
the plan to be dedicated to the municipality, approval of the plan shall
not constitute an acceptance by the municipality of such areas. The
Board shall require the plan to contain appropriate notes to this effect.
The Board may also require the filing of a written agreement between
the applicant and the Town Council covering future deed and title
dedication and provision for the cost of grading, development,

catch basins or other means of channeling surface water within the
subdivision and over other properties. Whenever elements of the storm
drainage system are not within the right-of-way of a public street and
the facilities will not be offered to the Town for acceptance as public
facilities, perpetual easements not less than 30 feet in width shall be
provided to the municipality allowing maintenance and improvement of
the system. If there are elements of the stormwater system serving
more than one lot that require future maintenance to remain effective
that are located outside of the right-of-way of a proposed public street,
the Planning Board may require that the applicant offer to give these to
the Town with a condition of approval that the Town be permitted to
assess the lot owners on a pro rata basis for the costs of the future
maintenance of these stormwater facilities. A note relative to this
condition of approval shall appear on the approved plan and an
indication of the condition of approval shall be placed in the deed of
each lot subject to the condition. When an offer of dedication is
required by the Planning Board, the applicant shall be responsible for
the maintenance of these stormwater facilities until they are accepted
by the Town.

reasonably expected to occur in the neighborhood. If the Board determines
that there are inadequate recreational facilities and open space to serve the
proposed development, the provisions for recreational or open space use
shall depend on the proposed lot sizes within the subdivision. If the average
lot size is less than 20,000 square feet, the equivalent of an area equal to at
least 10% of the total area of the subdivision shall be provided for recreation
and open space. If the average lot size is 20,000 square feet or more, the
equivalent of an area equal to at least 5% of the site shall be provided.
§ 275-47. Phosphorus impacts on great ponds.
A. This requirement can be met through the following methods:
(1) The applicant may propose to dedicate land to the Town that is
shown in the Comprehensive Plan or Open Space Plan as being
desired for recreational or open use in accordance with Subsection
B; or
(2) The applicant may propose to make a payment in lieu of dedication
of land in accordance with Subsection C.
B. If the applicant proposes to dedicate land:
(1) The land proposed for dedication must be approved as being
suitable for municipal recreation and/or open space use by the
Director of Public Works.
(2) The size of the area proposed to be dedicated shall be equal to or
greater than the required area set forth above.

proposed to be dedicated.
(b) An offer of dedication.
(4) Prior to the consideration of the dedication by the Town Council,
the applicant shall prepare, at his/her cost, the necessary deeds
and other paperwork in form satisfactory to the Town's Attorney.
C. If the applicant proposes to make a payment in lieu of dedication, the
payment shall be calculated based on the percentage of land that would
be required to be provided and the projected market value of that land
in its predevelopment, unimproved state at the time of the subdivision
as determined by the Municipal Tax Assessor. The payment in lieu of
dedication shall be deposited into a municipal open space or outdoor
recreation facility acquisition or improvement fund and may be used
only for the purpose of acquiring, improving or developing open space
or recreation facilities that will benefit the area of the community in
which the proposed subdivision is located.

buffer strips which are located on Hydrologic Soil Group D
soils and within 250 feet of the great pond or a tributary, or
which are located on slopes over 20%, shall include the
following:
[1] Buffers shall be inspected annually for evidence of erosion
or concentrated flows through or around the buffer. All
eroded areas must be seeded and mulched. A shallow
stone trench must be installed as a level spreader to
distribute flows evenly in any area showing concentrated
flows.
[2] All existing undergrowth (vegetation less than four feet
high), forest floor duff layer, and leaf litter must remain
undisturbed and intact, except that one winding walking
path, no wider than six feet, is allowed through the buffer.
This path shall not be a straight line to the great pond or

ARTICLE XI
Design Guidelines
§ 275-49. Intent.
This article provides design guidelines which, if followed, will result in
meeting the appropriate performance standards of Article X. Compliance
with these guidelines shall be considered evidence of meeting those
standards. Proposed subdivisions not in compliance with the design
guidelines of this article may be considered, but the applicant shall provide
clear and convincing evidence that the proposed design will meet the
performance standard(s) and the statutory criteria. In all instances, the
burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to present adequate information
to demonstrate that all performance standards and statutory criteria for
approval have been or will be met.
§ 275-50. Sufficient water.
A. Well construction. Wells shall not be constructed within 100 feet of the
edge of the pavement of any street, if located downhill from the street,
or within 50 feet of the edge of the pavement of any street, if located
uphill of the street. This restriction shall be included as a note on the
plan and included in deed restrictions for the affected lots.
B. Fire protection.
(1) If fire hydrants connected to a public water supply system are
provided, they shall be located in accordance with the standards of
the Sanford Water District and the Fire Department, and each
location shall be approved in writing by the Fire Chief or his
designee.
(2) If fire hydrants are not provided and the Planning Board
determines that a fire protection water supply is needed, a
minimum storage capacity of 10,000 gallons plus additional storage
of 2,000 gallons per lot or principal building or such other amount
as required by the Fire Chief shall be provided. Where fire ponds
are proposed for water storage, the capacity of the pond shall be
calculated based on the lowest projected water level less an
equivalent of three feet of ice. A detailed plan of the required pond,
dry hydrant, piping, and/or access road shall be submitted as part
of the application. The Town Engineer and Fire Chief shall approve
the design of all storage facilities. Subject to the review and
approval of the Sanford Fire Marshal, individual fire suppression
systems may be utilized for fire protection. [Amended 7-18-2006]
(3) Hydrants or other provisions for fire protection water supply shall
meet the specifications of the Fire Department and NFPA 1231. The
design of hydrants shall be approved by the Fire Chief or his
designee. The minimum pipe size connecting dry hydrants to ponds
or underground storage shall be six inches.

252:565
§ 275-51. Traffic conditions.
(4) Where a dry hydrant or other water source is not within the rightof-
way of a proposed or existing public street, an easement shall be
provided to the Town for access to, maintenance, and use of the dry
hydrant or reservoir. A suitable accessway to the hydrant or other
water source shall be constructed by the applicant. It shall be built
to standards approved by the Town Engineer and the Fire Chief.
Individual property owners and/or homeowner associations shall be
responsible for the maintenance of the fire protection system.
[Amended 7-18-200697]
A. Access control.
(1) Where a subdivision abuts or contains a principal arterial as
identified by § 280-75 of Chapter 280, Zoning, no new residential
lot shall have vehicular access directly onto the arterial street
unless the Planning Board waives this requirement in accordance
with § 280-75B of Chapter 280, Zoning. This requirement shall be
noted on the plan and in the deed of any lot adjacent to a principal
arterial.
(2) Where a lot has frontage on two or more streets, the access to the
lot shall be provided across the frontage and to the street where
there is lesser potential for traffic congestion and for hazards to
traffic and pedestrians. This restriction shall appear as a note on
the plan and as a deed restriction for the affected lot.
B. Subdivision access design. Streets, private roads, or common drives
that provide access to a subdivision shall conform to the following
standards. When the access to a subdivision is a street, the street
design and construction standards of Subsection C below shall also be
met. Where there is a conflict between the standards in this subsection
and the standards of Subsection C, the stricter or more stringent shall
apply.
(1) General. Access design shall be based on the estimated volume
using the access classification defined below. Traffic volume
estimates shall be as defined in the Trip Generation Manual, 1997
Edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers.
(a) Low-volume residential access: any access to a residential
subdivision with 50 or fewer vehicle trips per day.
(b) High-volume residential access: any access to a residential
subdivision with more than 50 vehicle trips per day.
97.Editor's Note: This ordinance also deleted original § 12.1B(5), which immediately followed
this subsection.
§ 275-50 SANFORD CODE § 275-51
252:566
(c) Commercial access: any street or drive providing access to a
nonresidential use or subdivision or to a project with a mix of
residential and nonresidential uses.
(2) Sight distances. Streets and other accesses shall be located and
designed in profile and grading to provide adequate sight distance
measured in each direction. Sight distances shall be measured
from the driver's seat of a vehicle standing on that portion of the
exit with the front of the vehicle a minimum of 10 feet behind the
curbline or edge of shoulder, with the height of the eye 3.5 feet, to
the top of an object 4.25 feet above the pavement. The required
sight distances are listed by road width and for various posted
speed limits.
(a) Two-lane roads. A minimum sight distance of 10 feet for each
mile per hour of posted speed limit shall be maintained or
provided.
(b) Four-lane roads. The sight distances provided below shall be
maintained or provided. These standards are based on
passenger cars exiting from accesses onto four-lane roads and
are designed to enable exiting vehicles:
[1] Upon turning left or right, to accelerate to the operating
speed of the street without causing approaching vehicles
to reduce speed by more than 10 miles per hour; and
[2] Upon turning left, to clear the near half of the street
without conflicting with vehicles approaching from the
left.

(3) Vertical alignment. Accesses shall be designed to prevent surface
water from draining across the intersection. Accesses shall slope
upward or downward from the gutter line at a maximum slope of
3% for at least 75 feet. The maximum grade over the entire length
shall not exceed 10%. Accesses shall be flat enough to prevent the
dragging of any vehicle undercarriage.
(4) Access layout and design. The layout and design of the intersection
of a proposed street or other access with an existing or proposed
public street shall be appropriate for the anticipated use and traffic
§ 275-51 WOOD, SALE OF § 275-51
252:567
volume. Any access with a peak hour traffic volume of more than
100 passenger car equivalent trips shall be designed based on
a site-specific traffic analysis prepared by a traffic engineer. Any
access with 100 or fewer peak hour trips shall conform to the
following standards:
(a) Width. The width of the access shall be the minimum necessary
to serve the proposed use and anticipated traffic volume. The
width of the street or other access at the intersection or curb
cut shall not exceed the following:
[1] Low-volume residential: 20 feet.
[2] High-volume residential: 26 feet.
[3] Commercial (two-way): 30 feet.
[4] Commercial (with median/divider): 20 feet each side.
(b) Curb radii. Curb radii shall reflect the anticipated volume of
use (as determined by the ITE Trip Generation Manual), the
type of vehicles that will use the access, and the environment
in which the access is located. Curb radii for low-volume
residential accesses should be a maximum of 15 feet in built-up
areas and 20 feet in suburban and rural areas. Curb radii for
high-volume residential accesses or commercial accesses
should be a maximum of 30 feet in built-up areas and a
maximum of 40 feet in suburban and rural areas.
(c) Planning Board modification. The Planning Board may allow
greater access widths or larger curb radii if necessary for
safety or to accommodate turning lanes or truck traffic.
(d) Skew angle. The skew angle shall be as close to 90° as
possible, but in no case shall the angle be less than 60°.
(5) Access location and spacing.
(a) Minimum corner clearance. Corner clearance shall be
measured from the point of tangency of the corner to the point
of tangency of the access. In general the maximum practical
corner clearance should be provided based on site constraints.
Minimum corner clearances are listed in the following table,
based upon access volume and intersection type.

(b) Access spacing. Accesses and street intersections shall be
separated from adjacent accesses, streets, and property lines
as indicated in the following table in order to allow major
through routes to effectively serve their primary function of
conducting through traffic. This distance shall be measured
from the access point of tangency to the access point of
tangency for spacing between accesses and from the access
point of tangency to a projection of the property line at the
edge of the roadway for access spacing to the property line.

materials matching the street curbing. Sloped curbing is
required around all raised channelization islands or medians.
(b) All accesses shall be paved with bituminous concrete pavement
within the street right-of-way. All commercial accesses,
regardless of access volume, shall be paved with bituminous
concrete pavement or other paving material approved by the
Director of Public Works within 30 feet of the street right-ofway.
(c) In addition, all other aspects of access construction shall
comply with the provisions of § 280-76C(4) of Chapter 280,
Zoning.
C. Street design and construction standards.
(1) General requirements.
(a) The Board shall not approve any subdivision plan unless
proposed streets are designed in accordance with the
specifications contained in these regulations. Approval of the
final plan by the Board shall not be deemed to constitute or be
evidence of acceptance by the municipality of any street or
easement.
(b) Applicants shall submit to the Board, as part of the final plan,
detailed construction drawings showing a plan view, profile,
and typical cross section of the proposed streets and existing
streets within 300 feet of any proposed intersections. The plan
view shall be at a scale of one inch equals no more than 50 feet.
The vertical scale of the profile shall be one inch equals no
more than five feet. The plans shall include the following
information:
[1] Date, scale, and North arrow, indicating magnetic or true
North.
[2] Intersections of the proposed street with existing streets.
[3] Roadway and right-of-way limits, including edge of
pavement, edge of shoulder, sidewalks, and curbs.
[4] Kind, size, location, material, profile, and cross section of
all existing and proposed drainage structures and their
location with respect to existing natural waterways and
proposed drainageways.
[5] Complete curve data for all horizontal and vertical curves.

(c) Where the applicant proposes improvements within existing
public streets, the proposed design and construction details
shall be approved in writing by the Town Engineer or the
Maine Department of Transportation, as appropriate.
(d) Where the subdivision streets are to remain private roads, the
following notes shall appear on the recorded plan:
[1] The Town of Sanford shall not be responsible for the
maintenance, repair, plowing, or similar services for the
private way(s) shown on this plan.
[2] Any private way shown on this plan shall not be accepted
as a public street by the Town of Sanford unless the way
complies with the standards for public streets (including
right-of-way width) existing at the time acceptance is
requested.
(2) Street design standards.
(a) These design guidelines shall control the roadway, shoulders,
curbs, sidewalks, drainage systems, culverts, and other
appurtenances associated with the street. These guidelines
shall be met by all streets within a subdivision, unless the
applicant can provide clear and convincing evidence that an
alternate design is good engineering practice and will meet the
performance standards of Article X.
(b) Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is definitely placed with the
municipality.
(c) Adjacent to areas zoned and designed for commercial use, or
where a change of zoning to a zone which permits commercial
uses is contemplated by the municipality, the street right-ofway
and/or pavement width shall be increased on each side by
half of the amount necessary to bring the road into
conformance with the standards for commercial streets in
these regulations.
(d) Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street (not
meeting the right-of-way width requirements of the standards
for streets in these regulations), or when the Comprehensive
Plan indicates plans for realignment or widening of a road that
would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the
§ 275-51 SANFORD CODE § 275-51
252:572
plan shall indicate reserved areas for widening or realigning
the road marked "Reserved for Road Realignment (Widening)
Purposes." Land reserved for such purposes may not be
included in computing lot area or setback requirements of
Chapter 280, Zoning. When such widening or realignment is
included in the municipality's capital investment plan, the
reserve area shall not be included in any lot but shall be
reserved to be acquired by the municipality or state.
(e) Any subdivision containing more than 15 dwelling units shall
have at least two street connections with existing public
streets, streets shown on an Official Map, or streets on an
approved subdivision plan for which performance guarantees
have been filed and accepted. Any street with an average daily
traffic of 200 trips per day or more shall have at least two
street connections leading to existing public streets, streets
shown on an Official Map, or streets on an approved
subdivision plan for which performance guarantees have been
filed and accepted.
(f) The design standards of Table 1 and the typical cross sections
in Appendix A 98 shall apply according to street classification.
The urban classifications shall apply in those areas designated
as growth areas in the Comprehensive Plan. The rural
classifications shall apply in those areas designated as rural in
the Comprehensive Plan. In addition, private ways shall
conform to the standards of § 280-85 of Chapter 280, Zoning.
(g) The center line of the roadway shall be the center line of the
right-of-way.
(h) Dead-end streets.
[1] In addition to the design standards in Table 1, dead-end
streets shall be constructed to provide a cul-de-sac
turnaround or other turnaround approved by the Director
of Public Works. Where a turning circle is used, it shall
meet the following requirements for radii:
[a] Property line: 85 feet.
[b] Outer edge of pavement: 75 feet.
[c] Inner edge of pavement: 50 feet.
[2] The Planning Board may require larger radii for turning
circles on a commercial street. The island in the circle
shall be landscaped in a manner requiring low
maintenance. Where the turning circle is in a wooded area
98.Editor's Note: Table 1 is included at the end of this chapter. Appendix A is on file at the
Town Clerk's office.
§ 275-51 WOOD, SALE OF § 275-51
252:573
prior to development, a stand of trees shall be maintained
within the center of the circle if possible. The Board shall
require the reservation of a twenty-foot easement in line
with the street to provide continuation of pedestrian traffic
or utilities to the next street. The Board may also require
the reservation of a fifty-foot easement in line with the
street to provide continuation of the road where future
subdivision is possible. If a hammerhead or "T" turnaround
is approved, no driveways shall enter onto the turnaround.
A dead-end street shall be limited to a maximum of 15
dwelling units (not including corner lots that gain their
access from another street). The length of a dead end
shall not exceed 1,500 feet. The Planning Board may waive
these requirements if the applicant demonstrates that:
[a] No other reasonable access exists; or
[b] The shape or configuration of the parcel makes a
longer dead end necessary for the reasonable
development of the property.
(i) Grades, intersections and sight distances.
[1] Grades of all streets shall conform in general to the
terrain, so that cut and fill are minimized while
maintaining the grade standards above.
[2] All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves
in order to provide the following minimum stopping sight
distances based on the street design speed:
Design Speed
(miles per hour)
20 25 30 35
Stopping sight
distance (feet)
125 150 200 250
[3] Stopping sight distance shall be calculated with a height of
eye at 3 1/2 feet and the height of object at two feet.
[4] Cross (four-cornered) street intersections shall be avoided
insofar as possible, except as shown on the Comprehensive
Plan or at other important traffic intersections.
(j) Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed within all subdivisions
within areas designated as growth areas in the Comprehensive
Plan. Sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of the street
where sidewalks are required. The Planning Board may permit
sidewalks on one side of the street or may waive the
requirement for sidewalks if the Board finds that there are
adequate alternative provisions for pedestrians outside of the
§ 275-51 SANFORD CODE § 275-51
252:574
right-of-way or that the scale of the project makes sidewalks
unnecessary on one or both sides. Where sidewalks exist
adjacent to a proposed subdivision outside of growth areas,
sidewalks shall be installed connecting to existing sidewalks.
Where installed, sidewalks shall meet these minimum
requirements:
[1] Location. Sidewalks shall be located adjacent to the curb.
[2] Sidewalk construction. Portland cement concrete
sidewalks shall be provided in all areas where sidewalks
are required and shall comply with the following
standards. The Planning Board may approve the use of
alternative materials with the approval of the Director of
Public Works. The applicant shall be responsible for
demonstrating that the alternative material is an
acceptable equivalent.
[a] The subbase aggregate shall be no less than 12 inches
thick after compaction.
[b] The 4,000 psi Portland cement concrete shall be
reinforced with six-by-six-inch square No. 6 welded
wire mesh or fiber reinforcement.
[c] The sidewalk shall be no less than four inches thick.
The depth shall be increased to six inches under
driveways.
[d] Handicapped access ramps shall be provided at all
intersections and other pedestrian crossings.
(k) Curbs shall be installed wherever a sidewalk is provided and in
other areas as needed to control stormwater drainage or
vehicle movement. The curb shall be a cast-in-place concrete
curb that is monolithic with the sidewalk. The specified
traveled way width shall be measured between the curbs.
(3) Street construction standards. Streets shall be constructed to the
following standards. For any aspect of construction not covered by

not been constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications filed
as part of the application, he or she shall so report in writing to the Director
of Public Works, Planning Director, Town Manager, and the applicant or
builder. The Town Manager shall take any steps necessary to preserve the
Town's rights.
§ 275-69. Improvements guaranteed.
Performance guarantees shall be tendered for all improvements required
to meet the standards of these regulations and for the construction of
the streets, stormwater management facilities, public sewage collection or
disposal facilities, public water systems, and erosion and sedimentation
control measures.

any cross-examination that is required for a full and true disclosure of
the facts.
G. Public record of deliberations. The transcript or tape recording of
testimony, if such a transcript or tape recording has been prepared by
the Zoning Board of Appeals, and the exhibits, together with all papers
and requests filed in the proceeding, constitute the public record. All
decisions become a part of the record and shall include a statement of
findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis for the findings
and conclusions, upon all the material issues of fact, law or discretion
presented and the appropriate order, relief or denial of relief. Notice of

taken on that reconsideration shall occur and be completed within 30
days of the date of the vote on the original decision. The Zoning Board
of Appeals may conduct additional hearings and receive additional
evidence and testimony as provided in this section.
I. Appeal of Zoning Board of Appeals actions. Any party may take an
appeal, within 45 days of the date of the vote on the original decision, to
Superior Court from any order, relief or denial in accordance with the
§ 280-6-3 SANFORD CODE § 280-6-3
252:634
§ 280-6-4. Powers and duties.
Appeals shall lie from the decision of the Code Enforcement Officer to the
Zoning Board of Appeals and from the Zoning Board of Appeals to the
Superior Court according to the provisions of Maine law. The Zoning Board
of Appeals shall have only the powers and duties listed below, except when
this chapter provides jurisdiction to hear other matters:
Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 80B. This time period may be
extended by the Court upon motion for good cause shown. The hearing
before the Superior Court shall be without a jury.
A. Administrative appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to
hear and decide where it is alleged there is an error in any order,
requirement, decision or determination made by the Code Enforcement
Officer in the enforcement of this chapter. The action of the Code
Enforcement Officer may be modified or reversed by the Zoning Board
of Appeals by concurring vote of a majority of the members present and
voting.
B. Dimensional variance appeals.
(1) The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to hear and decide, in
accordance with the criteria of Article VIII, upon appeal, in specific
cases where a relaxation of the terms of this chapter would not be
contrary to the public interest and owing to conditions peculiar to
the property which are not the result of the actions of the applicant.
(2) As used in this chapter, a dimensional variance is authorized only
for height, area, size of structure or size of yards or open spaces.
C. Use variance appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to
hear and decide, upon appeal, in specific cases where a relaxation of
the terms of this chapter would not be contrary to the public interest
and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property which are not
the result of the actions of the applicant, a literal enforcement of this
chapter would result in unnecessary or undue hardship. A financial
hardship shall not constitute grounds for granting a variance. The
crucial points of variance are undue hardship and unique physical
circumstances applying to the property. A variance is not justified
unless both elements are present in the case.
D. Shoreland zoning appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to
hear and decide appeals relating to the administration and enforcement
of Chapter 270, Shoreland Zoning.

ARTICLE VII
Nonconformance
§ 280-7-1. Intent; transfer of ownership; maintenance.
§ 280-7-2. Nonconforming structures.
A. Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to promote land use conformities,
except that nonconforming conditions that existed before the effective
date of this chapter shall be allowed to continue, subject to the
requirements set forth in this article.
B. Transfer of ownership. Nonconforming structures, lots, and uses may
be transferred, and the new owner may continue the nonconforming
use or continue to use the nonconforming structure or lot, subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
C. Repair and maintenance. This chapter allows, without a permit, the
normal upkeep and maintenance of nonconforming uses and structures,
including repairs or renovations which do not involve expansion of the
nonconforming use or structure, and such other changes in a
nonconforming use or structure as federal, State, or local building and
safety codes may require.
A. Expansions. A structure which does not conform to the dimensional
requirements of the zone in which it is located may be added to or
expanded after obtaining a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer if
such addition or expansion does not increase the nonconformity of the
structure.
B. Relocation.
(1) A nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries
of the parcel on which the structure is located, provided that the
site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the
greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board and
provided that, if the use is not connected to the public sewerage
system, the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface
sewage disposal system meets the requirements of State law and
the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules or that a
new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said
rules. In no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that
causes the structure to be more nonconforming.
(2) In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback
to the greatest practical extent, the Planning Board shall consider
the size of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil
erosion, the location of other structures on the property and on
adjacent properties, the location of the septic system, if any, and
other on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type and
amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation.

252:637
§ 280-7-3. Nonconforming uses.
§ 280-7-4. Nonconforming lots.
C. Reconstruction or replacement.
(1) Any nonconforming structure which is located less than the
required setback from the property line and which is removed or
damaged or destroyed may be reconstructed or replaced, provided
that a permit is obtained within one year of the date of said
damage, destruction, or removal and provided that such
reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the setback
requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the
Planning Board in accordance with the purposes of this chapter. In
no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to
increase its nonconformity.
(2) In determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement
meets the setback to the greatest practical extent, the Planning
Board shall consider, in addition to the criteria in § 280-7-2B, the
physical condition and type of foundation present, if any.
D. Change of use of a nonconforming structure.
(1) The use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to
another use unless the Planning Board, after receiving a written
application and holding a public hearing, determines that the new
use will have no greater adverse impact on the subject or adjacent
properties and resources than the existing use.
(2) In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the
Planning Board shall require written documentation from the
applicant regarding the probable effects on public health and
safety, erosion and sedimentation, and water quality.
A. Expansions. A use which is nonconforming in the zone in which it is
located may be expanded by a total of not more than 30% of the gross
floor area existing as of the date of adoption of this provision. The
expansion may occur at one time or incrementally, but in no case shall
the cumulative total of additional floor area exceed the thirty-percent
limit.
B. Resumption prohibited. A lot, building or structure in or on which a
nonconforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding one year, or
which is superseded by a conforming use, may not again be devoted to a
nonconforming use.
A. A nonconforming lot of record as of the effective date of this chapter or
amendment thereto may be built upon, without the need for a variance,
provided that such lot is in separate ownership and not contiguous with
any other lot in the same ownership and that all provisions of this
chapter, except lot size and frontage, can be met. Variances relating to
§ 280-7-2 SANFORD CODE § 280-7-4
252:638
setback or other requirements not involving lot size or frontage shall be
obtained by action of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
B. Contiguous built lots.
(1) If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in a single or joint
ownership of record at the time of adoption of this chapter, and if
all or part of the lots do not meet the dimensional requirements of
this chapter, and if a principal use or structure exists on each lot,
the nonconforming lots may be conveyed separately or together,
provided that the State Minimum Lot Size Law104 and Subsurface
Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied with.
(2) If two or more principal uses or structures existed on a single lot of
record on the effective date of this chapter, each may be sold on a
separate lot, provided that the above-referenced law and rules are
complied with. When such lots are divided, each lot thus created
shall be as conforming as possible to the dimensional requirements
of this chapter as determined by the Planning Board.
C. Contiguous lots, vacant or partially built. When two or more contiguous
lots or parcels are in single or joint ownership of record at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter or any time thereafter, if any of
these lots do not individually meet the dimensional requirements of this
chapter or subsequent amendments, and if one or more of the lots is
vacant or contains no principal structure, the lots shall be combined to
the extent necessary to meet the dimensional requirements of this
chapter; provided, however, that any two or more contiguous lawful lots
of record as of November 21, 1995, and located in the Rural Residential
or Rural Mixed Use Zones shall not be required to be combined
pursuant to this subsection.

Variances and Appeals
§ 280-8-1. Standards for granting dimensional and use variances.
A. In accordance with 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4353, except as provided in 30-A
M.R.S.A. § 4353(4-A) or § 280-8-1B, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
grant a dimensional or use variance only when strict application of this
chapter to the petitioner and the petitioner's property would cause
undue hardship. The term "undue hardship" as used in this subsection
means:
(1) The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a
variance is granted;
(2) The need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the
property and not to the general condition in the neighborhood;
(3) The granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of
the locality; and
(4) The hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a
prior owner.
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a variance from the lot area and
setback dimensional standards of this chapter when strict application of
this chapter to the petitioner and the petitioner's property would cause
a practical difficulty and when certain conditions set forth in this
subsection exist.
(1) As used in this subsection, "practical difficulty" means that the
strict application of this chapter to the property precludes the
ability of the petitioner to pursue a use permitted in the zoning
district in which the property is located and results in significant
economic injury to the petitioner.
(2) To approve a dimensional variance as permitted in this subsection,
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall find that the following conditions
exist:
(a) The need for the variance is due to the unique circumstances of
the property and not to the general condition of the
neighborhood;
(b) The granting of the variance will not produce an undesirable
change in the character of the neighborhood and will not
unreasonably detrimentally affect the use or market value of
abutting properties;
(c) The practical difficulty is not the result of action taken by the
petitioner or prior owner;
§ 280-8-1 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-8-1
252:641
§ 280-8-2. Appeal procedure.
(d) No other feasible alternative to a variance is available to the
petitioner;
(e) The granting of the variance will not unreasonably adversely
affect the natural environment; and
(f) The property is not located in whole or in part within the
shoreland areas as described in 38 M.R.S.A. § 435.
A. Filing of appeal. In all cases, a person aggrieved by a decision of the
Code Enforcement Officer shall commence his or her appeal within 30
days after a decision is made by the Code Enforcement Officer. The
appeal shall be filed with the Zoning Board of Appeals on forms
approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals, and the aggrieved person
shall specifically set forth on the form the grounds for the appeal.
B. Hearing and notification.
(1) In the case of appeals involving space and bulk regulations, uses,
shoreland zoning, or administrative interpretation, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall notify, by mail, the applicant and the owners
of property abutting the property for which an appeal is taken, at
least 10 days in advance of the hearing, of the nature of the appeal
and of the time and place for the public hearing thereon.
(2) The owners of property shall be considered to be those against
whom taxes are assessed. Failure of any property owner to receive
a notice of public hearing shall not necessitate another hearing or
invalidate any action by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(3) Following the filing of an appeal, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
hold a public hearing on the appeal within 30 days. The Zoning
Board of Appeals shall notify the applicant, at least 10 days in
advance, of the time and place of the hearing and shall publish
notice of the hearing at least 10 days in advance in a newspaper of
general circulation in the area.
C. Hearing procedures.
(1) At any hearing, a party may be represented by agent or attorney.
Hearings shall not be continued to other times except for good
cause.
(2) The Zoning Board of Appeals may request the Code Enforcement
Officer or his or her designated assistant to attend hearings and/or
present to the Zoning Board of Appeals all plans, photographs, or
other materials the Zoning Board of Appeals deems appropriate for
an understanding of the appeal.
(3) The appellant's case shall be heard first. To maintain orderly
procedure, each side shall proceed without interruption. Questions

certificate indicating the name of the current property owner, identifying
the property by reference to the last recorded deed in its chain of title
and indicating the fact that a variance, including any conditions on the
variance, has been granted and the date of the granting shall be prepared
in recordable form. This certificate shall be recorded by the applicant in the
York County Registry of Deeds within 90 days of the date of the final written
approval of the variance or the variance is void. The variance is not valid
until recorded as provided in this section. For the purpose of this section,
the date of the final written approval shall be the date stated on the written
approval.

of Appeals, the Code Enforcement Officer shall immediately issue a
building permit in accordance with the conditions of approval.

chapter secured by a vote of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall expire if
the work or change is not substantially completed within 18 months of
the date on which the appeal is granted, unless such time limit is
extended by vote of the Zoning Board of Appeals in response to a
written request of the applicant.

of such lines is inaccurately represented on the Zoning Maps or tax
maps.
C. Boundaries indicated as approximately following municipal limits shall
be construed as following municipal limits.
D. Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to

Management, and shall comply with the additional requirements of that
chapter.
§ 280-10-4. Contract zoning.
A. Contract zoning authorized. Pursuant to 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4352(8),
contract zoning is hereby authorized for development where, for
reasons such as the unusual nature or unique location of the
development proposed, the City Council, exercising its sole and
exclusive judgment as the legislative body of the City, finds it necessary
or appropriate to impose, by agreement with the property owner or
otherwise, certain conditions or restrictions not generally applicable to
other properties similarly zoned. All rezoning under this section shall
establish rezoned areas that are compatible with the existing and
permitted uses within the original zones. Nothing in this section shall
authorize a rezoning, or an agreement to change or retain a zone, that
is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
B. Relationship to shoreland zoning. A parcel rezoned under this section
may include land areas subject to Chapter 270, Shoreland Zoning, but
any provision of a contract zoning amendment adopted by the City
Council that removes or modifies any restrictions or limitations
imposed by Chapter 270 shall not take effect until approved by the
Commissioner of Environmental Protection as required by 38 M.R.S.A.
§ 438-A(3), as may be amended from time to time.
C. Conceptual sketch plan.
(1) A person wishing to propose contract zoning under this section
may, prior to filing an application, submit a conceptual sketch plan
to the Site Plan Review Committee, together with a sketch plan
review fee in such amount as the City Council may from time to
time establish by City Council order. The conceptual sketch plan
submission shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
(a) A map showing existing and proposed zoning district lines.
(b) The address or exact location of the request, including the
Assessor's map references for the property to be rezoned.
(c) The name, address and telephone number of the property
owner and of the applicant, if the applicant is not the owner.
(d) Evidence of the applicant's right, title or interest in the
property.
(e) A site analysis that describes the major features of the
property, allowing the Site Plan Review Committee to make an
§ 280-10-3 SANFORD CODE § 280-10-4
252:648
informed judgment about how it will be used. Section 275-15,
as may be amended from time to time, shall be used as a
guideline for preparation of the site analysis.
(f) A conceptual development plan showing the approximate
layout of all buildings, structures, streets, driveways, parking
areas and other significant improvements to be constructed on
or above the surface of the ground plus any proposed open
spaces, conservation areas, buffer areas or other features of
the development, but it is not required to show subsurface
infrastructure installations, building plans, engineering plans
or other details which would be required for a subdivision plan
or site plan.
(g) A statement describing the existing use of the property and the
proposed new use and development and describing how the
proposed contract zone will be consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan, shall be consistent with existing and
permitted uses within the existing zoning district classification
of the property, and shall have beneficial effects on the City as
a whole which would not result if the property were developed
under the existing zoning district classification.
(2) Such sketch plan review by the Site Plan Review Committee will
not be binding on the applicant or the City but is intended to permit
informal evaluation of the proposed rezoning before formal
application to the Planning Board. The sketch plan review fee is
nonrefundable.
D. Application procedures.
(1) Application. Notwithstanding § 280-10-4A, any proposal to amend
the Official Zoning Map of the City through the establishment of a
contract zone shall be filed with the Planning Board. A contract
zone application shall be in writing in such form as prescribed by
the City and shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
(a) All of the information required to be submitted for the
conceptual sketch plan review.
(b) A proposed contract zoning agreement which complies with
the requirements of this section.
(c) Any other information requested by the Planning Department
and/or the City Engineer.
(d) A nonrefundable application fee in such amount as the City
Council may from time to time establish by City Council order.
(2) Fees. Any request for contract zoning shall be accompanied by a
filing fee established by the City Council and administered in
§ 280-10-4 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-10-4
252:649
conformance with § 280-3-4. [Amended 12-20-2016 by Order
No. 16-158.07]
E. Public hearing.
(1) The Planning Board shall conduct a public hearing prior to any
property being rezoned under this section. Notice of this hearing
shall be posted in the City Clerk's office at least 13 days prior to
each public hearing and shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation within the City at least two times, the date of
the first publication to be at least 12 days prior to the hearing.
(2) Notice shall also be sent to the owner or owners of the property to
be rezoned and to the owners of all property abutting the property
to be rezoned and to the owners of all property located within 500
feet of the property to be rezoned at their last known addresses.
Notice shall also be sent to a public drinking water supplier if the
area to be rezoned is within its source water protection area. This
notice shall contain a copy of the proposed conditions and
restrictions, with a map indicating the property to be rezoned.
F. City Council action on contract zoning request.
(1) If the City Council approves a request for contract zoning, the City
Council shall simultaneously approve an agreement setting forth
the conditions and restrictions to apply to the property, including
time limits for compliance with all conditions and restrictions. Such
agreement shall include a provision granting the City the power to
enforce all conditions and restrictions, both through enforcement
action pursuant to this chapter and through legal action for specific
performance. The rezoning shall not be effective until the
agreement is executed, delivered to the City Council and recorded
by the applicant at the York County Registry of Deeds. If the
agreement is not recorded at the York County Registry of Deeds
within 30 days after the City Council approves the request for
rezoning, then the approval shall become void and the rezoning
shall not take effect, but the City Council may extend the recording
period for an additional 30 days if the request for extension is made
prior to the expiration of the original thirty-day period.
(2) The conditions and restrictions set forth in the agreement shall run
with the land and bind all future owners of the land and any other
person who claims an interest in the property and may be removed
only by subsequent action of the City Council expressly removing,
relieving or discharging one or more of the specific conditions or
restrictions. If the conditions and restrictions are not fulfilled or
complied with within the specified time limits, the City Council may,
after review by the Planning Board, extend the time limits or may
initiate a rezoning to the original zoning district classification or to
another zoning district classification. The City Council may require
a bond, escrow agreement, irrevocable letter of credit, or other
§ 280-10-4 SANFORD CODE § 280-10-4
252:650
surety in such amount as is approved by the City Manager as being
reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the conditions
or restrictions required by the rezoning and, where necessary to
ensure continued compliance, may require such surety to remain
in effect after occupancy of rezoned property. Such surety shall
be posted before the agreement is recorded at the York County
Registry of Deeds.
G. Land use reviews.
(1) Where site plan or subdivision review is required for the use
proposed in the rezoning request, the Planning Board may conduct
the site plan or subdivision review concurrently with its review of
the request for rezoning, and the public hearing required by
§ 280-10-4E may be conducted simultaneously with a public
hearing conducted as part of site plan or subdivision review. If the
Planning Board determines that the proposed development meets
such land use approval standards, the Planning Board shall grant
preliminary, provisional approval to the plans, subject to enactment
of the contract zoning amendment by the City Council. The
Planning Board shall also advise the applicant of any changes or
revisions to the proposed contract zoning agreement necessary to
conform to the Planning Board's preliminary approval of the plan.
(2) After the contract zoning agreement is recorded in the York County
Registry of Deeds, the Planning Board shall complete its final site
plan review of the development proposal and final subdivision
review, if required. In the case of a subdivision, the Planning Board
shall adopt as its findings under 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4404(9) and
Chapter 275, Subdivision of Land, the findings made by the City
Council regarding consistency with the Comprehensive Plan.
(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where the
development proposed in a request for contract zoning is designed
to be constructed in phases and the Planning Board concludes that
it would be impractical to require preliminary subdivision and/or
site plan review and approval of all phases before approval of the
contract zoning amendment, the Planning Board, in its discretion,
may waive the provisions of this section requiring the Planning
Board to approve a preliminary plan before the City Council takes
final action on the contract zoning amendment, but only with
respect to phases subsequent to the first phase of the development
to be constructed. If the Planning Board grants such a waiver, the
City shall include a phasing schedule in the contract zoning
agreement, specifying the dates for completion of the subdivision
and/or site plan review, and may reserve in the contract zoning
agreement the right of the City Council to review the plans for
subsequent phases prior to their construction.
H. Contract zoning agreement.
§ 280-10-4 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-10-4
252:651
(1) Conditions and restrictions imposed under the authority of this
section shall relate only to the physical development and operation
of the property and may include, by way of example:
(a) Limitations on the number and types of uses permitted;
(b) Restrictions on the scale and density of development;
(c) Specifications for the design and layout of building and other
improvements, including landscaping;
(d) Schedules for commencement and completion of construction;

required by the development;
(h) Provisions for enforcement and remedies for breach of any
condition or restriction; and
(i) Provisions for reservation or dedication of land for public
purposes.
(2) The City Council may impose conditions under this section that are
more restrictive than the applicable requirements of this chapter.
I. No rights created before City Council vote. The submission of a request
for contract zoning under this section, the payment of application fees,
or the expenditure of funds by the applicant in presenting such a
request shall not create any vested rights in the application. The
availability of contract zoning under this section shall not be construed
as creating any entitlement to approval of any request. The decision
whether or not to rezone remains committed to the City Council,
exercising its sole and exclusive judgment as the legislative body of the
City.
J. Time period for renewal of contract zoning request. No proposal to
amend the Official Zoning Map under this section shall be entertained
within one year from the date of denial of the same request.

Conditional Uses
§ 280-13-1. Purpose and definition.
§ 280-13-2. Conditional use approval required.
§ 280-13-3. Administrative procedures.
A. The purpose of this article is to establish the procedures and standards
to enable the City to review applications for conditional use permits.
B. A conditional use is a use that the City has determined to be generally
appropriate within a zone but that has the potential for creating undue
or unusual impacts on the public health, safety, and welfare,
surrounding properties, the natural environment, or on municipal
services and therefore requires case-by-case review and approval in
accordance with the provisions of this article.
A. A building, structure, or parcel of land may be used for a conditional
use if:
(1) The use is specifically listed as a conditional use in the zone; and
(2) Conditional use approval is granted by the Planning Board.
B. Any project involving the establishment of a new conditional use or the
construction or expansion of a building for a conditional use shall obtain
site plan approval by the Planning Board in accordance with Article
XVI.

church, school, family child-care, child-care center or nursery
school or public park or playground.
(2) No clinic may be located within the bounds of the following
revitalization and/or growth areas: Sanford Downtown, Lafayette
Circle and Springvale Village.
B. Neighborhood compatibility standards. No approval shall be
recommended if the Planning Board finds that the granting of the
license will violate one or more of the following neighborhood
compatibility standards:
(1) Neither the proposed use nor the proposed site on which the use
will be located is of a character such that the use will have
significant adverse impact on the value or quiet possession of
surrounding properties. The Planning Board shall not find that this
standard is satisfied unless:
§ 280-13-3 SANFORD CODE § 280-13-4
252:686
(a) The size of the proposed use is comparable to the size of
surrounding uses;
(b) The amount and type of traffic to be generated, hours of
operation, expanse of pavement, and the number of parking
spaces are comparable to surrounding uses;
(c) The generation of noise, dust, odor, vibration, glare, smoke,
litter and other nuisances is comparable to that generated by
surrounding uses;
(d) The impact of the use on the quality and quantity of
groundwater available to abutting properties is comparable to
that for surrounding uses;
(e) Unusual physical characteristics of the site, including size and
shape of the lot, topography, and soils, do not aggravate
adverse impacts upon surrounding properties.
(2) Vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation to, from, into and
within the site will be safe, and no public way will be overburdened
or made hazardous as a result of the new use and/or development
of the property.
(a) The Planning Board may not find that this standard has been
satisfied unless:
[1] Vehicular access to the site will be on roads which have
adequate capacity to accommodate the additional traffic
generated by the development. "Adequate capacity"
means that: Intersections on major access routes to the
site within a one-half-mile radius of any entrance road will
function after development, at a minimum, at Level of
Service C, as defined in Maine Department of
Transportation regulations, 17-229 C.M.R. Ch. 305, Rules
and Regulations Pertaining to Traffic Movement Permits
(2,000); or
[2] If any such intersection is functioning at a Level of Service
D, as defined in Maine Department of Transportation
regulations Chapter 305, cited above, or lower prior to the
development, the project will not reduce the current level
of service.
(b) The Planning Board may recommend approval of an
application not meeting this requirement if the applicant
demonstrates that a public agency has committed funds to
construct the improvements necessary to bring the level of
service to said standard, or the applicant will assume financial
responsibility for the improvements necessary to bring the
level of service to said standard and will guarantee the

driveways, entrances or proposed streets to meet the standards set
forth in §§ 280-14-4, 280-14-5, and 275-35 and 275-51.
(4) Adequate facilities are present to assure the safety of pedestrians
passing by or through the site.
(5) Municipal or other facilities serving the proposed use will not be
overburdened or made hazardous. The Planning Board shall not
find that this standard is satisfied unless:
(a) The capacity of sewerage and water supply systems is
adequate to accommodate the proposed use;
(b) The capacity of the storm drainage system is adequate to
accommodate the proposed use; and
(c) The ability of the Fire Department to provide necessary
protection services to the site and development is adequate.
(6) The soils on the proposed site shall have adequate capacity and
stability to support all loadings, including fill, developed by the
proposed use, and the use will not cause unreasonable soil erosion
or reduction in the capacity of the land to hold water to the extent
that a dangerous or unhealthy condition may result on the site or
the land of abutters. In considering whether this standard is
satisfied, the Planning Board shall take into account the elevation
of the site and surrounding properties above sea level, its relation
to floodplains, the slope and vegetation of the land and their effects
on drainage.
(7) The design of the proposed structures with respect to materials,
scale and massing shall be compatible with existing structures
within 500 feet of the site in areas where the existing structures are
of a similar scale and architectural treatment.
C. Screening requirements. All clinics shall be required to erect and
maintain opaque fencing to provide an effective visual screen at least
six feet in height, to be located along side and rear property lines that
abut properties in residential use. Said fencing is intended to screen the
clinic entrance and parking lot from ordinary view from all directly
adjoining properties.
A. The Planning Board shall approve a conditional use application, or
approve it with conditions, if it makes a positive finding, based on the
information presented, that the proposed use, with any conditions
attached, meets the following standards:
§ 280-13-4 SANFORD CODE § 280-13-5
252:688
(1) The proposed use will not place a burden on municipal services
which, due to its location or the characteristics of the site or
proposed development, is significantly greater than the burden that
would result from similar uses in other situations;
(2) The proposed use will not create hazards to vehicular or pedestrian
traffic on the roads and sidewalks serving the proposed use as
determined by the size and condition of such roads and sidewalks,
lighting, drainage, intensity of use by both pedestrians and
vehicles, and the visibility afforded to pedestrians and the
operators of motor vehicles;
(3) The proposed use will not cause water pollution, sedimentation, or
erosion, contaminate any water supply or reduce the capacity of
the land to hold water so that a dangerous, aesthetically
unpleasant, or unhealthy condition may result;
(4) The proposed use will not create unhealthful conditions because of
smoke, dust, or other airborne contaminants;
(5) The proposed use will not create nuisances to neighboring
properties because of odors, fumes, glare, hours of operation,
noise, vibration or fire hazard, or unreasonably restricted access of
light and air to neighboring properties;
(6) The proposed location for the use has no peculiar physical
characteristics due to its size, shape, topography, or soils which will
create or aggravate adverse environmental impacts on surrounding
properties;
(7) The proposed use has no characteristics that are atypical of the
general category of use that will depreciate the economic value of
surrounding properties; and
(8) If located in the Shoreland Overlay Zone, the proposed use will not
result in damage to spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life, bird and
other wildlife habitat; will conserve shoreland vegetation; will
conserve visual points of access to waters as viewed from public
facilities; will conserve actual points of access to waters; will
conserve natural beauty; and will avoid problems associated with
floodplain development and use.
B. Nonprofit service organization. In addition to the requirements of this
section and any other applicable section of the City's ordinances, the
minimum parcel size for this use is 10 acres.
C. Horse shows. In addition to the requirements of this section and any

ARTICLE XIV
General Standards
Note: General standards apply to activities which do not require site plan,
subdivision, or Planning Board approval.
§ 280-14-1. Conformance required.
The use of land, buildings, and structures shall conform to the following
general standards as applicable.
§ 280-14-2. Relationship of buildings to lots.
Every building hereafter erected shall be located on a lot as defined in
§ 280-2-2. In no case shall there be more than one principal residential
building and its accessory buildings on one lot, except in the case of projects
such as multiple dwelling or building developments intended and designed
to be managed as a unit on an unsubdivided lot.
§ 280-14-3. Access of lots to streets.
No building shall be erected on a lot unless the lot has frontage on a street
as defined in § 280-2-2.
§ 280-14-4. Creation of lots along arterials.
The following limitations shall apply to the creation of all new lots on all
land located adjacent to Route 4, Route 109, Route 202, Route 11A and
Route 224.
A. Access to new residential lots. Any new residential lots created adjacent
to the principal arterials listed above shall be divided so that vehicular
access to the lot is obtained from a local or collector street rather than
the arterial. Access to the new lots shall be obtained from any local or
collector street, a street in an approved subdivision, or a private way
approved by the Planning Board. This requirement shall apply to any
new lot whether or not the lot is part of a subdivision.
B. Waiver of the access limitation for new lots.
(1) The Planning Board may waive the access limitation provisions of
this subsection when there are unique conditions which make
access, other than from the arterial impractical. The Planning
Board may grant a waiver only if one of the following conditions is
met:
(a) There is too little road frontage to reasonably allow for the
creation of a local street, and there will be no further
subdivision of the parcel; or
§ 280-14-1 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-14-4
252:693
§ 280-14-5. Curb cuts and driveways.
(b) The shape or physical condition of the parcel does not permit
access to or the creation of a local street, and there will be no
further subdivision of the parcel.
(2) The owner of the lot seeking a waiver shall make a written request
to the Planning Board setting forth how the project conforms to the
above criteria.
C. Existing lots. Any lot of record existing as of the date of the adoption of
this section shall be permitted one vehicular access point to a principal
thoroughfare, notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, unless
such lot also has frontage on a local street.
A. Curb cut permit required. No person may build or construct a driveway
which provides an access to a public street without first obtaining a
curb cut permit from the Code Enforcement Officer. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall refer all permit applications to the City
Engineer for review. If the City Engineer finds that the application
meets the requirements of § 280-14-5B and C, the City Engineer shall
approve the curb cut and notify the Code Enforcement Officer to issue
the permit. Such permits shall be issued only to the property owner or
to the person having an option or lease on the property in question. If
the work authorized by a curb cut permit has not been completed within
12 months of the date of issuance, the permit shall be null and void.
B. Curb cut limitations.
(1) Each single-family and/or multifamily residential lot fronting on an
arterial or collector street shall be entitled to one curb cut, and no
more.
(2) The number of curb cuts allowed for any lot fronting on an arterial
or collector street that is used for institutional, retail, commercial,
service, or industrial use shall be determined based upon the
amount of its street frontage. The following curb cut standards
shall apply for these types of uses:
Feet of Street
Frontage Number of Curb Cuts
0 to 199 1
200 plus 2
(3) The Planning Board may waive these limitations if it finds that the
characteristics of the site and/or use necessitates additional curb
cuts and that the additional curb cuts can be provided without
affecting public safety.
§ 280-14-4 SANFORD CODE § 280-14-5
252:694
(4) Drive-up or drive-through windows, when allowed by the Planning
Board, will be designed such that there will be no direct access,
including entrances or exits, to Routes 4, 109, 202, 11A, and 224.
C. Curb cut requirements.
(1) Location. All curb cuts shall be located to minimize the impact on
traffic safety and flow at least 25 feet from the point of tangency of
streets as shown on the diagram in § 280-14-10B. For lots fronting
on arterial or collector streets, a curb cut may not be located less
than 50 feet from the point of tangency of streets at any
unsignalized intersection or less than 100 feet from the point of
tangency of streets at any signalized intersection.
(2) Width.
(a) The width of curb cuts shall conform to the following
standards:
[1] Single-family residential use: maximum 20 feet.
[2] Multifamily residential use: maximum 26 feet.
[3] Commercial use: maximum 26 feet.
[4] Industrial use: maximum 30 feet.
(b) The Planning Board or Site Plan Review Committee may allow
wider access drives if necessary to accommodate turning lanes
or the anticipated volume of traffic as part of site plan review.
(3) Separation.
(a) Within the Urban Compact Zone as defined in 23 M.R.S.A.
§ 754(2)(A), as may be amended from time to time, the distance
between curb cuts shall be 50 feet from the edge of each curb
cut. Outside of the Urban Compact Zone, for lots fronting on
arterial or collector streets, the minimum allowable distance
between the center lines of each curb cut shall be at least 50
feet.
(b) The Planning Board or Site Plan Review Committee may
approve applications for curb cuts that do not meet the
minimum standards if one or more of the following
circumstances is demonstrated:
[1] The development proposal reduces the number of curb
cuts that exist within the minimum separation distance;
[2] The proposal consolidates curb cuts for one or more
abutting lots; or
[3] The speed limit and sight line distance permit safe siting of
the curb cut.

252:695
§ 280-14-6. Development of rear lots.
A rear lot is a lot which is located to the rear of another lot or lots which
front on a street as defined in this chapter. A rear lot existing as of the date
of adoption of this section may be used for uses allowed within the zone in
which it is located, provided that:
(c) Notwithstanding the existence of one or more of these
circumstances, the minimum separation standard of 20 feet
from edge to edge shall apply.
(4) Construction standards. Curb cuts shall be constructed in
accordance with a plan approved by the City Engineer and shall
meet the following standards:
(a) A permanent surface of asphalt or concrete shall be used for
the finished surface within the street right-of-way lines for all
curb cuts constructed for commercial or industrial uses.
(b) The existing grade of sidewalks which are crossed by curb cuts
shall be maintained so as to provide a safe area for people to
walk. Such sidewalks may be required to be reconstructed to
withstand expected traffic loads.
(c) Where the positioning of curb cuts requires the location,
removal, or installation of drainage facilities, such relocation,
removal, or installation shall be done in accordance with traffic
safety and drainage standards, as authorized by the City
Engineer. The City Engineer shall consider the effect of the
change on adjacent and downgrade properties, and the
potential for and probable impact of increased erosion and/or
flooding caused by pertinent factors relative to human and/or
environmental health and safety.
(d) The cost of curb cuts shall be borne by the applicant.
(e) All curb cuts which are constructed within the State right-ofway
shall conform to all provisions and regulations set forth by
the Maine Department of Transportation as well as the
provisions of this chapter. In the case of contradictory
regulations, the most restrictive prevail.

Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, the following structural
elements may project into a required setback as set forth below:
E. The rear lot shall meet all requirements of the zoning district, other
than minimum frontage. For the purpose of setback requirements, the
setback line of such lots is deemed to be the prescribed setback
distance from the deepest rear property line of the lot or lots between
said rear lot and the nearest street.
A. A cornice, eave, or canopy or other similar architectural features, but
not including a bay window, may project up to two feet into required
setbacks.
B. A fire escape may project up to four feet into required setbacks.

as to maintain the existing relationship to the property line.
§ 280-14-6 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-14-7
252:697
§ 280-14-8. Structures permitted above height limits.
Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, roof structures for the
housing of elevators, stairways, tanks, fans, or other building operating
equipment; fire or parapet walls; skylights; steeples; flagpoles; chimneys;
smokestacks; domestic radio or television masts; and water tanks or silos
F. Facilities for handicapped access, including ramps, lifts, and elevators,

specified in the zone in which they are located.
§ 280-14-9. Temporary activities and events.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, temporary uses of a
community or nonprofit nature, such as festivals, fairs, carnivals, and
similar events, may be permitted in any zone by vote of the City Council, as
long as such temporary use is not contrary to the objectives of this chapter.
A vote by the City Council allowing such temporary use shall not be deemed
a change in the zoning and shall apply to the specific event or activity only
for its stated duration.
§ 280-14-10. Required sight lines.
The purpose of this provision is to maintain a clear line of sight for drivers of
vehicles at street and driveway intersections. This requirement shall apply
to buildings, structures, fences, signs, landscaping or other elements.
A. Within the Urban Zone, no visual obstruction that interferes with a
vehicle operator's line of sight shall be located within the triangular
area created by measuring 10 feet back from the point of intersection of
the travel way of two streets or a street and a driveway and connecting
these points.
B. In other zones, no visual obstruction shall be located within the
triangular area created by measuring 25 feet back from the point of
intersection of the travel way of two streets or a street and a driveway.

§ 280-14-12. Off-street parking.
C. Existing trees shall not be considered to be visual obstructions, nor
shall objects located within 30 inches of the ground or located more
than six feet above the ground. Any landscaping within this area shall
be maintained so that a clear line of sight is retained at all times.
A. Applicability. Off-street parking shall be provided for all new
construction, expansion, and change of use in accordance with the
requirements and standards of this section.
B. Minimum requirements for off-street parking. Off-street parking shall
be considered an accessory use when required or provided to serve any
legal use located in any zone. An off-street parking space shall be a
minimum of nine feet wide by 18 feet long and may be open or covered.
Access to individual parking spaces shall be unobstructed except for
parking for residential uses. Parking for single- and two-family
dwellings may be arranged in a stacked layout so that access to one
space is over another. Stacked parking may also be used for multifamily
residential uses if the parking spaces are assigned to units and the
access to one unit's parking space is not obstructed by the parking
space of another unit. In order to determine compliance with this
section, the Code Enforcement Officer shall require a plan showing the
§ 280-14-10 SANFORD CODE § 280-14-12
252:700
physical layout of all required off-street parking areas. Any change in
the evidence or conditions upon which the plan is approved shall nullify
such approval.
(1) Parking shall be provided on the lot occupied by the use for which
the parking is required or on an adjacent lot owned or controlled by
such use. In addition, uses located within the Urban Zone may
provide all or part of the required off-street parking through any of
the following:
(a) Private off-street parking located on another lot that is located
within 1,000 feet of the subject lot and that is controlled by
long-term lease or ownership by the proposed use.
(b) Off-street parking shared with other uses located within 1,000
feet of the subject lot, provided that the Planning Board or Site
Plan Review Committee finds that there is adequate parking
capacity to meet the parking requirements of all uses sharing
the parking due to variation in the time of parking demand
and/or anticipated use of parking to access multiple uses in a
single trip, and that the shared parking is controlled through a
leasehold or other enforceable agreement. The Planning Board
or Site Plan Review Committee may allow off-site parking to be
more than 1,000 feet from the site if it finds that the distance is
reasonable given the nature of the proposed use.
(c) For nonresidential uses, off-street parking located in a
municipal parking lot provided by the City, subject to the
Planning Board or Site Plan Review Committee finding that
there is adequate available parking to meet the needs of the
use based on the parking standards of this chapter. The
Planning Board or Site Plan Review Committee may allow legal
on-street parking to be used to meet the parking requirement
of a nonresidential use in the Urban and Industrial
Redevelopment Zones if it finds that this parking can
reasonably be expected to be available for customers of the use
and is located within close proximity of the use.
(2) Where multiple use of a lot occurs, off-street parking shall be
provided for each use in accordance with this section. Where the
applicant can demonstrate and document nonconflicting periods of
use, shared use of parking spaces may be permitted by the
Planning Board or Site Plan Review Committee.
(3) Travel and queuing aisles associated with off-street parking, drivein
facilities and motor vehicle fuel pumps shall be provided and
shall not interfere with the use of or be part of the required offstreet
parking.

252:701
(a) The following minimum number of spaces, rounded up to the
nearest whole number, shall be provided and maintained for
each use on a lot, including each use within all buildings. The
Planning Board or Site Plan Review Committee may reduce the
required parking:
[1] For reuse of an existing building by up to 30%. In granting
a reduction, the Planning Board or Site Plan Review
Committee shall find that the reduction will not create or
worsen parking problems in the neighborhood and that the
required number of spaces cannot be reasonably
accommodated on the lot; or
[2] For new or existing buildings, if the applicant
demonstrates to the Planning Board or Site Plan Review
Committee that proposed parking is adequate for the use
based on national or regional parking demand studies such
as those published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers or
by data on actual parking demand for similar uses in
similar situations and/or consideration of the availability of
parking demand management programs that reduce the
demand for on-site parking.
(b) The maximum number of employees scheduled during peak
demand/shift shall be used in calculating the number of
required parking spaces when employee is referenced in the
list below. Gross floor area shall be used in calculating the

ARTICLE XV
Performance Standards
Note: Performance standards apply to activities which do not require site
plan, subdivision, or Planning Board approval.
§ 280-15-1. Groundwater protection standards.
A. Applicability. The general provisions of this section apply to all land
uses, including storage of hazardous materials, new construction,
structural alteration, and substantial change in use, occurring in the
City. Additional standards and requirements apply in areas delineated
as Public Water Supply Protection Districts.
B. Delineation of the Public Water Supply Protection Districts.
(1) Public Water Supply Protection Districts shall be delineated on
copies of the Assessor's maps and shall be titled "Public Water
Supply Protection Districts Map: City of Sanford." This map shall
be deemed an integral part of this chapter and shall be maintained
on file in the Code Enforcement Office.
(2) The Public Water Supply Protection Districts shall operate as
overlay districts. If there is any conflict between the provisions of
the Public Water Supply Protection Districts and other sections of
this chapter, the more restrictive provision shall apply.
(3) The Public Water Supply Protection Districts are comprised of
areas in and around Water District well fields and in the Branch
Brook Aquifer where aquifer recharge occurs. Regulatory
standards apply to the following districts:
(a) District 1, as delineated on the official Public Water Supply
Protection Districts Map, consists of the New Dam Well, the
Eagle Drive 1 Well, the Eagle Drive 2 Well, and the Branch
Brook Aquifer.
(b) District 2, as delineated on the official Public Water Supply
Protection Districts Map, consists of the Old Mill Road Well,
the Route 109 at Sam Allen Road Well, Bernier Road Well, and
the Country Club No. 2 Well.
(c) District 3, as delineated on the official Public Water Supply
Protection Districts Map, consists of the Cobb 1 Well, the Cobb
2 Well, and the Main Well Field.
(4) Each area is further defined by two distinct zones delineated by the
hydraulic travel time to a wellhead. These zones designate different
levels of wellhead protection:
§ 280-15-1 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-15-1
252:713
(a) Zone A, as delineated on the official Public Water Supply
Protection Districts Map, consists of the area in which it would
take a leachable material introduced into the groundwater 200
days or less to reach a public water supply. The travel time
boundary of this zone is based on the length of time viruses
present in the wastewater can survive in the soil. Zone A is
therefore an area regulated for sanitary purposes.
(b) Zone B, as delineated on the official Public Water Supply
Protection Districts Map, consists of the areas from which it
would take a leachable material 200 to 2,500 days of travel
time to reach a public water supply. This zone is regulated to
reduce the risk of contamination of the groundwater supply
from land use activities that pose a major threat.
(c) Hydraulic travel times are the most commonly used
instruments for defining an area of groundwater protection.
Zones A and B have been mapped accordingly around existing
and proposed public water supply well fields and aquifers to
protect the health and safety of the public as well as maintain
the integrity of the groundwater resource.
(5) If any portion of a parcel is located in Zone A and/or Zone B, all of
the land located in Zone A shall be governed by the regulations for
Zone A, and all of the land located in Zone B shall be governed by
the regulations for Zone B.
(6) The delineation of all districts and Zones A and B may be revised
only by amendment to the Public Water Supply Protection Districts
Map in accordance with the provisions of § 280-4-2.
(7) If there are questions as to the location of the district or zone
boundaries, the location shall be determined in accordance with
provisions of § 280-9-3.
C. General performance standards. All use of land, buildings, and
structures in the City shall comply with the following standards:
(1) Sites at which hazardous materials are stored, used or generated
shall be designed to prevent spills and discharges to the surface of
the ground, groundwater, lakes, streams, rivers or wetlands.
(2) Areas and facilities for loading and unloading hazardous materials
and polluting materials shall be designed and constructed to
prevent discharge or runoff to groundwater.
(3) Facilities shall be designed so that all stored, spilled or leaked
hazardous materials are contained on site.
(4) Secondary containment for aboveground areas where hazardous
materials are stored or used shall be provided.
§ 280-15-1 SANFORD CODE § 280-15-1
252:714
(5) Existing and new storage tanks shall meet all State and federal
requirements.
(6) Outdoor storage of hazardous materials shall use product-tight

F. Water supply protection permit required. Any use of the land,
construction or alteration of a building or structure, change in the
occupancy of a building, or modification of existing industrial
processing or storage facilities which increases the volume or changes
the type of hazardous materials present on a site shall be permitted
within the Public Water Supply Protection Districts only after the
issuance of a water supply protection permit in accordance with
§ 280-15-1G.
G. Water supply protection permit procedures. The Code Enforcement
Officer is authorized to review applications for and issue water supply
protection permits for any activities covered by this section that do not
trigger site plan review under this chapter. Prior to issuing a permit, the
Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the abutters of the property and
their right to review and provide written comments on the application.
The Code Enforcement Officer shall not issue the permit until at least
five business days after the mailing of notices to the abutters. For
activities requiring a water supply protection permit and/or site plan
review, the water supply protection permit shall be considered as part
of the site plan review process described in Article XVI.
H. Compliance with the requirements of § 275-42.
§ 280-15-1 SANFORD CODE § 280-15-1

J. Notification requirement. Within 60 days of the adoption of this section,
the Planning Director shall notify the owners of all parcels within a
Public Water Supply Protection District of the adoption of these
provisions and the importance of compliance with the requirements and
shall provide them with a copy of the performance standards and other
requirements.
A. The area of the site stripped of existing vegetation at any given time
shall be minimized. Stripping of the site shall be phased where practical
so that areas are revegetated and permanently stabilized before
additional areas are stripped of existing vegetation.
B. Not more than 35% of the total vegetated area of a lot may be covered
by impervious surfaces, including buildings, structures, and paved or
gravel surfaces, unless the owner of the parcel demonstrates that such
development will be carried out in accordance with the best
management practices as set forth in "Stormwater Management for
Maine: Best Management Practices," published by the Maine
Department of Environmental Protection, as may be amended from
time to time.
C. Any area of disturbed ground resulting from construction or similar
activities shall be either temporarily or permanently stabilized by use of
riprap, seed, mulch, or other ground cover within one week from the
time it was actively worked.
D. Vegetated buffer strips at least 25 feet wide shall be maintained
adjacent to waterways, drainage ditches, and swales. Waterways,
ditches, and swales shall be revegetated prior to September 15.

§ 280-15-1 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-15-2
252:717
§ 280-15-3. Industrial performance standards.
All uses involving the manufacturing or processing of materials or products
shall conform to the following standards:
G. The Planning Board may require that projects classified as major
developments under this chapter conduct an analysis of nutrient export
levels and incorporate nutrient loading control devices such as
sedimentation/retention ponds, infiltration systems, wet ponds, swales,
or flow strips if necessary to reduce the level of nutrient export to
acceptable levels. This analysis shall be carried out in accordance with
"Phosphorous Control in Lake Watersheds: A Technical Guide for
Evaluating New Developments," published by the Maine Department of
Environmental Protection, as may be amended from time to time. If the
phosphorous method requires removal of more than 75% of the
increase in phosphorous load to meet the phosphorous export limit, the
Planning Board may increase the limit to a level obtainable through onsite
use of best management practices as identified in the Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual.
H. If the project is classified as a major site plan and is in the watershed of
a great pond phosphorus impacts will be managed in compliance with
the relevant requirements of §§ 275-47 and 275-60.
A. Storage of derelict vehicles or equipment. No derelict vehicles or
equipment shall be stored on the site unless they are enclosed within a
secure area and screened from view from public streets and adjacent
properties.
B. Vibration. Equipment and other activities shall not produce vibration
measured at the lot line which is perceptible without instruments. In no
case shall vibration at the lot line exceed 0.003 of one inch.
C. Odors and air quality. No offensive, harmful, or noxious odors shall be
emitted that create a public nuisance or hazard beyond the lot line of
the parcel, an adjoining unit, building, or property, documented by
multiple complaints. All facilities shall have a properly designed and
maintained ventilation and air filtration system which takes into
consideration the square footage and number of elements in the
industrial process. Smoke, debris, dust, fluids, and other substances
shall be managed in compliance with Maine Department of
Environmental Protection Regulations Chapter 110, Ambient Air
Quality Standards. Filters shall be checked every six months and shall
be replaced as needed or based on the manufacturer's recommended

D. Electromagnetic interference. No electromagnetic interference shall be
permitted that does not conform to State and federal standards.
E. Lights. No lights used in the industrial process or on the site of the
industrial process shall produce pollution, glare, or brightness that
§ 280-15-2 SANFORD CODE § 280-15-3
252:718
§ 280-15-4. Residential cluster development standards.
would create a public nuisance or hazard. All lights shall be shielded
and oriented such that they shall not extend beyond the property lines.
All power sources, electrical fixtures, and electrical conveyances shall
be installed, connected, and maintained in conformance with the City's
building, electrical, fire, and other health safety and technical codes,
including but not limited to Chapter 90, Building Construction, and

Knox-Box® of an approved type listed in accordance with UL 1037 shall
be installed in an accessible location to provide access in the event of an
emergency.
A. Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to allow for contemporary
concepts of housing development where variations of design may be
allowed. The Planning Board may approve residential cluster
developments as an alternative to conventional subdivisions. The
Planning Board may approve subdivisions as residential cluster
developments in which the size of individual lots is less than that
normally required by this chapter, provided that a sufficient area of the
total parcel being developed is reserved as permanent open space.
Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter relating to
dimensional requirements, the Planning Board, in reviewing and
approving proposed residential cluster developments, may modify
provisions related to dimensional requirements to permit innovative
approaches to housing and environmental design in accordance with
the following standards. This section is not to be construed as granting
variances to relieve hardship.
B. Basic requirements for cluster developments.
(1) Cluster development shall meet all requirements for subdivision
approval and shall be in conformance with a site plan for its overall
development.
(2) Each lot or building shall be an element of an overall plan for site
development. When the development consists of the creation of
§ 280-15-3 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-15-4
252:719
lots, the plan shall establish a building envelope for each lot that
identifies the area within which the buildings will be located. When
the development involves the construction of buildings on a single
parcel, the plan shall show the location of each building.
(3) The total residential density may be no greater in a cluster
development than is normally permitted in the zone in which the
development is proposed.
(4) Residential cluster developments in accordance with this section
are allowed in all residential zones.
(5) Only those residential uses allowed in a zone are allowed in a
residential cluster development. In addition, in the Rural
Residential and Rural Mixed Use Zones, newer mobile homes, as
defined in this chapter, may be allowed on a slab-type foundation,
provided that the individual mobile home sites or lots are rented
and not sold.
(6) A cluster development may have no fewer than five dwelling units.
C. Dimensional requirements.
(1) Individual lot sizes may be less than that required in the zone in
which the cluster development is located, provided that the amount
of land by which the lot is reduced is reserved as open space.
Within the Rural Residential and Rural Mixed Use Zones, individual
lots may be as small as 20,000 square feet, provided that the soils
are adequate to support a lot of that size. In other zones, the area of
individual lots may be reduced by up to 50%.
(2) Other lot dimensional requirements may be reduced as follows:
(a) Lot frontage: 50% of that required in the zone.

area may be wetland and/or slopes greater than 15%.
(2) The open space shall be dedicated to the recreational amenity and
environmental enhancement of the development, shall protect
natural resources, and shall be recorded as such. For the purpose
of these provisions, open space means an area that is:
§ 280-15-4 SANFORD CODE § 280-15-4
252:720
(a) Not encumbered in any way by a principal structure;
(b) Not devoted to use as a roadway, road right-of-way, parking lot,
or sidewalk;

(e) Ownership by a private party for agricultural or other natural
resource use, provided that permanent restrictions are in place
to provide for its continued use for this purpose.
(4) Any subdivision proposed under this section shall specify the
ownership, use, management, and person responsible for
maintenance of all common areas and facilities. The Planning
Board shall approve the arrangements for the ownership, control,
and maintenance of the common open space as part of the approval
of a final subdivision plan. No changes in the use or management of
the common open space shall be made without Planning Board
approval.
(5) Any common open space or facility not retained by a private owner
shall be maintained by a homeowners' association unless and until
it is transferred in its entirety to the City or a recognized
conservation organization, and until the transfer actually is
completed. The formation and incorporation by the developer of a
homeowners' association shall be accomplished prior to final
subdivision approval. Covenants for mandatory membership in the
association shall be approved by the Planning Board and included
§ 280-15-4 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-15-4

E. Design standards. In addition to other standards of this chapter and of
Chapter 275, Subdivision of Land, the following design standards shall
apply to cluster developments:
(1) Priorities for layout of lots and open space. The Planning Board
shall find that individual building lots/sites are laid out and open
space preserved to achieve the following objectives, as applicable.
Where the Planning Board finds that objectives conflict, the
objectives shall be achieved in the order listed:
(a) Where on-site wastewater disposal is to be used, it will be
located on suitable soils for subsurface wastewater disposal.
(b) The layout preserves, as part of the required open space,
environmentally sensitive areas, such as wetlands, steep
slopes, floodplains, wildlife habitat rated by the Maine
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife as high value, and
unique natural features.
(c) The design maximizes, as part of the required open space, the
amount of contiguous, usable area for agriculture or woodlot
production.
(d) The layout preserves cultural features of the rural landscape,
such as stone walls, tree lines, and important or unique
structures.
(e) The layout maximizes, as part of the required open space, the
amount of undisturbed, contiguous wildlife habitat, including
habitat that may not be rated as high by the Maine Department
of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.
(f) Where the development abuts a body of water, the design
includes, as part of the required open space, a minimum of
25% of the shoreline.
§ 280-15-4 SANFORD CODE § 280-15-4
252:722
(g) The layout encourages buildings to be located within
woodlands or along the edges of open fields adjacent to
woodlands.
(h) The layout provides for buildings in locations least likely to
block or interrupt scenic vistas, as seen from the public
roadway.
(i) The design maximizes open space that is usable for outdoor
recreation.
(j) Each house lot has direct access to the open space, which
means that the owner of one house lot does not have to cross
another's house lot to reach the open space.
(k) The layout minimizes the length of roadways, public utility
lines, and other infrastructure within the proposed
development.
(l) The design provides planting, landscaping, fencing, and
screening to buffer the development from, and integrate it
with, the character of any surrounding development.
(2) Vehicular access, street layout and construction.
(a) All vehicular access to buildings and lots shall be from a street
within the development and not from an existing public road.
(b) All streets, roads, access drives, and parking areas shall be
designed to harmonize with the topographic and natural
features of the site. The road network shall provide for
vehicular and pedestrian safety, all-season emergency access,
snow storage, delivery and collection services, and potential
connections to abutting land.
(c) Streets shall be designed and constructed in conformance with
Chapter 275, Subdivision of Land.
(3) Buffering. A cluster development shall be buffered from a street or
road, other than the street or road serving individual lots in the
development, or from any abutting single-family dwelling lot, by a
distance equal to two times the normal minimum setbacks required
for the zone. This buffer shall be established and maintained with a
screen to provide an effective visual barrier from the ground to a
height of at least 10 feet. This screen may be composed of a
landscaped earth berm, planted evergreen bushes and trees, or
existing evergreen bushes and trees, or a combination of such
features.
(4) Utilities. Utilities shall be installed underground wherever
possible. Transformer boxes, pumping stations, and meters shall be
located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous to the public.

City where newer mobile homes are allowed under § 280-15-5B so
long as it complies with all design criteria applicable to newer
mobile homes, including but not limited to a pitched, shingled roof,
exterior siding which is residential in appearance and located on a
permanent foundation; provided, however, that the Zoning Board of
Appeals may, upon written request by the owner of said home,
grant a waiver from said design standards upon the owner's
showing of economic circumstances that would cause compliance
with said design standards to have the practical effect of
preventing said home's relocation within the City; and
(2) No manufactured home shall be prohibited solely on the basis of its
date of manufacture or failure to comply with the National
Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of
1974.

structurally capable of safely supporting the tower and its
accompanying equipment.
E. Abandonment.
(1) It shall be the responsibility of the owner of a tower to notify the
Code Enforcement Officer of the date of abandonment or cessation
of use of the tower within one month from the date of such
abandonment or cessation. If the owner shall fail to give the notice
required by this subsection, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
make a determination of such date, which determination shall be
conclusive as to such date.
(2) In the case of an abandoned tower, it shall be removed by the
owner of the tower within one year of its abandonment or cessation
of use. Abandoned structures associated with abandoned towers
shall also be removed. If the owner of the abandoned tower fails to
remove the tower, the owner of the property on which the tower is
located shall be responsible for its removal.
F. Collocation.
(1) Tower applicants shall send written notice by prepaid first class
United States mail to all other telecommunication tower owners
and licensed telecommunication providers in the proposed

capabilities in an effort to encourage tower collocation. An
application for a new tower shall provide evidence that existing or
previously approved towers cannot accommodate the
telecommunications equipment, including but not limited to
antennas and cables, planned for the proposed tower. Such
evidence would be:
(a) Planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
existing and approved towers, considering the existing and
planned use of those towers, and existing and approved towers
cannot be reinforced to accommodate planned or equivalent
equipment at a reasonable cost, as defined below;
(b) Planned equipment will cause radio wave frequency
interference with other existing or planned equipment for that
tower, and the interference cannot be prevented at a
reasonable cost, as defined below;
(c) Existing or approved towers do not have space on which
planned equipment can be placed so it can function effectively
and at least in parity with other similar equipment in place or
approved; or
(d) Other reasons that make it impracticable to place the
equipment planned by the applicant on existing and approved
towers.
§ 280-15-9 SANFORD CODE § 280-15-9
252:732
(2) Shared use shall be conditioned on the applicant's agreement to
pay a reasonable fee and costs of adapting existing facilities to the
proposed use.
(a) Such costs shall be pertinent to the southern Maine market
area.
(b) These may include but not be limited to reasonable costs for
reinforcing the tower or structure, for preventing radio wave
frequency interference, and other changes reasonably
required to accommodate shared use.
(c) The fee and costs for shared use are unreasonable, among
other reasons, if they exceed the cost of the proposed tower.
(3) If the Planning Board determines that telecommunications
equipment proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on
an existing or approved tower, each tower so found is presumed
unable to accommodate similar equipment that may be proposed in
the future.
(4) A proposal to construct a new tower taller than 100 feet shall
include evidence that it can structurally support a minimum of
three antenna arrays.
(5) The Planning Board may require evidence of structural support to
accommodate additional arrays for non-monopole towers.
G. Interest of telecommunication entity. A proposal to construct a tower
shall include evidence that a telecommunication or other entity
proposes to locate on or use the tower.
H. Lighting. A tower shall be lighted only if it is required by a federal or
State agency or if the Planning Board finds that lighting of the tower is
needed due to its location with respect to the Airport, its height or other
safety considerations with respect to airport operations.
I. Security. The base of the tower shall be made nonaccessible to
unauthorized persons by the installation of a fence designed to deter
such access.
J. Nonconformance. Towers existing before the effective date of this
chapter which do not comply with these performance standards or with
the use or dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which they
are located may continue to be used. The addition, removal, or
relocation of telecommunication antennas on such towers shall not
constitute the expansion or enlargement of the nonconforming use and
does not require review by the Planning Board, provided that the total
height of the tower, including attached devices, is not increased.

Zone, except for a single-family home or demolition of an existing structure,
shall require review and recommendation to the Planning Board, Site Plan
Review Committee, Planning Director, and/or Code Enforcement Officer by
the Design Review Committee.
(9) The City may use contracted staff and peer review escrow fees to
review an Odor Control Plan under § 280-3-4. [Added 2-20-2018
by Order No. 18-115-01]
(10)No medical marijuana shall be grown, cultivated, processed, and/or
stored within a common area or limited common area of the
property.
(11)No medical marijuana qualifying patients shall obtain medical
marijuana directly from the medical marijuana production facility,
except as otherwise allowed under the Maine Medical Use of
Marijuana Act and Rules. The medical marijuana production facility
may include an office space within the same structure for the
purposes of consulting with and distributing medical marijuana to
qualifying patients if offices are allowed in the zoning district and if
the facility meets all public safety, public access, parking, and other
requirements of City codes. This office space shall not qualify as a
medical marijuana dispensary as defined in the Maine Medical Use
of Marijuana Act and Rules. This limitation is not intended to limit
production operations in one unit with potential retail sales of
marijuana paraphernalia in another separate unit, as long as retail
sales are allowed in the zone in which the property is located and
the two facilities operate as separate legal entities.
(12) A medical marijuana production facility shall comply with the
industrial performance standards in this chapter.
(13) A medical marijuana production facility shall not dispose of
marijuana waste and/or residue from the growth, cultivation,
processing, and storage of medical marijuana in an unsecured
waste receptacle not in its possession and control.
(14) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 1 M.R.S.A. § 302, this
chapter applies to any application relating to the establishment or
operation of a medical marijuana production facility, whether or not
such application had become a pending proceeding as defined in 1
M.R.S.A. § 302 prior to the enactment of this chapter.
A. Intent. This section provides design standards which, if followed, will be
considered evidence of meeting the appropriate performance standards
of Article XVI, Site Plan Review, and Chapter 275, Subdivision of Land.
Proposed site plans, subdivisions, and exterior improvements and/or
§ 280-15-10 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-15-11
252:739
changes not in compliance with the design standards of this section
may be considered, but the applicant shall have the burden of proof
to provide clear and convincing evidence that demonstrates it is not
possible to comply with the standards, the proposed design shall meet
the intent of the standards to the greatest extent practicable, and all
other zoning, subdivision, and building standard codes, and statutory
criteria shall be met.
B. Design districts defined.
(1) In the Sanford Downtown Design District Overlay Zone and the
Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone, design standards
apply to new development, redevelopment, and change of use. The
two Design Districts are defined on a map in the Planning Office.
These areas are on well-traveled routes most often seen by the
public, where it is crucial to ensure that nonresidential
development is in keeping with the character of the District
Overlay Zones.
C. Sanford Downtown Design District Overlay Zone.
(1) Background. The focus of Sanford Downtown has shifted over time,
toward an increased emphasis on serving a wider range of
commercial activities and an increasing residential population.
Sanford Downtown is evolving into a year-round destination. The
success of much of Sanford's Downtown business district depends
on the success of the visitor experience. That is why all aspects of
development in Sanford Downtown shall be designed for both
function and aesthetics. These design standards are intended to
help the owner, developer, architect, and other consultants
understand the basic design goals set for development in the
Sanford Downtown Design District Overlay Zone and provide the
City with a yardstick against which new projects can be measured.
Applicants are invited to submit creative and imaginative projects
which build on these standards and contribute to the overall form
and character of Sanford's Downtown.
(2) Objectives.
(a) Sanford Downtown Design District Overlay Zone offers visitors
a focal point for services aimed at both visitors, residents and
workers of the surrounding area. Sanford Downtown design
standards are intended to promote the characteristic qualities
of its historic setting. The following objectives shall be
considered in all new development:
[1] Insist on a high standard of urban design, architecture and
landscape architecture for the downtown area, in order to
make it attractive to visitors, residents and workers alike.
§ 280-15-11 SANFORD CODE § 280-15-11
252:740
[2] Respond to the existing and future needs and interests of a
broad range of visitors, residents and workers through the
four seasons.
[3] Preserve, where possible, and supplement the existing
natural landscape. Abundant landscaping and floral
displays are particularly important in the summer and fall
months.
[4] Use design elements that are cohesive with the City's
natural setting and desired architectural character yet still
express individuality.
[5] Create an atmosphere in the Sanford Downtown Design
District Overlay Zone that is open and friendly, that caters
to pedestrians by providing open space amenities,
including but not limited to outdoor seating areas, activity
areas, site features.
[6] Accommodate New England climatic conditions.
[7] Encourage building design and orientations that maximize
views and sunlight.
[8] Make preserving the historic character of the Sanford
Downtown Design District Overlay Zone a priority.
[9] Encourage building design and site planning that ensures
logical and functional patterns for the three levels of
traffic: pedestrian, automobile, and service and delivery.
[10] Insist on building design that reflects the community's
desire for human scale, in terms of building placement,
height, proportion, site features, roof shapes and building
materials. The design standards are not intended as a
blueprint for design approval; rather they outline the
important elements and features which shall be
considered in designing or modifying the building, site or
subdivision.
(b) Note that these design standards do not negate or overrule the
City's building codes. Applicants shall review the design
standards and meet with the Planning Director at the outset of
the design process to discuss the design objectives/issues for
each property in Sanford's Downtown, if appropriate.
D. Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone.
(1) Introduction.
(a) Purpose. The purpose of these design standards is to provide a
tool to preserve the village character of Springvale and respect
its sense of history for generations to come. These standards
§ 280-15-11 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-15-11
252:741
are intended to ensure that new, expanded, and rehabilitated
development is designed and built in a manner compatible
with the character of Springvale Village in terms of scale,
aesthetic, and visual effect. They are meant to lead to the
construction and layout of buildings and site improvements
that are appropriate to their surroundings and to the
Springvale Village, by helping property owners, developers,
contractors and other professionals understand the community
values which their designs shall satisfy to be acceptable to the
City.
(b) The focus of these design standards is to maintain and
improve, where appropriate, the visual and aesthetic character
of the Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone, as
related to site layout, and improvement, architecture, and
design of properties. Design review does not encompass all
elements of zoning, subdivision, or building code review. The
City's zoning, subdivision and building code review processes
cover other performance standards, including but not limited
to traffic, utilities, and environmental impacts, pertaining to
nonresidential development.
(2) Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone general standards.
(a) Character. These design standards are a tool to help ensure
future development and alterations to existing development
are in keeping with the character of the Springvale Village
Design District Overlay Zone. Development shall maintain or
improve the visual and aesthetic character of the Springvale
Village Design District Overlay Zone.
(b) Context. A building's or site's context is important to gauging
appropriate design. A building or site shall conform to the
Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone design
standards and shall not appear out of place compared to
abutting properties, buildings or the surrounding
neighborhood. This is an important standard to consider, even
though it may be difficult to quantify.
(c) Existing structures.
[1] These standards also apply to the renovation or
construction of existing buildings and/or sites within the
Springvale Village Design District Overlay District.
[2] For existing structures:
[a] Historic or original architectural elements, including
but not limited to doors, windows, dormers, porches,
balconies, and decorative features, such as cornices,
columns, pediments, and railings, shall be retained to
the extent possible. Alterations shall be carried out in
§ 280-15-11 SANFORD CODE § 280-15-11
252:742
a way that does not damage or hide these elements.
New architectural elements shall match the old in
design, color, texture, and, where possible, material;
and
[b] Architectural elements that falsify or confuse the
history of a building shall be avoided. Replacement of
original elements shall be substantiated by
documentary and physical evidence. Building owners
should find early photographs of their building to best
identify its true historic style. These photographs can
provide visual evidence of existing or preexisting
architectural elements. Property owners are
encouraged to consult with the Historical Society or
Planning Department about the building and proposed
modifications.
(d) Additions.
[1] Historically, a house was expanded incrementally as a
family's space requirements grew. Over several
generations, additions were added in a manner that was
consistent with what had come before but reflective of its
own period. Additions shall be designed so that the
character of the existing building is not radically changed,
obscured, damaged, destroyed, or rendered subordinate to
the addition.
[2] Additions shall:
[a] Be differentiated from the existing building with
techniques, including but not limited to set backs or
offsets from the existing wall plane;
[b] Not obstruct the visual integrity of the original
structure;
[c] Be in harmony with the original in size, scale, style
and materials; and
[d] Be located where least visible from public view.

Garbage and recycling storage areas shall be enclosed and
hidden from public view and/or screened by fences and plants
compatible with the architecture of structures on and in the
vicinity of the site. Containers shall be made of durable
materials and shall be easily accessible to garbage trucks.
Adequate ventilation shall be provided.
(b) Sanford Downtown Design District Overlay Zone additional
servicing standards.

connection between the building, parking, and the street.
Connections to adjacent sites or developments shall be
provided where appropriate.
(b) Asphalt surfaces shall predominant for sidewalks in the
Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone, but brick,
pavers, stamped concrete, stone, and other materials shall be
considered to add character or to prevent cracks or shifting
bricks/blocks from becoming eyesores or safety hazards.
(6) Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone additional fence
standards.
(a) Traditional materials, including but not limited to wood, castor
wrought-iron, or stone, shall be recommended. Metal or
vinyl fencing that looks like traditional wood or iron fencing
may be an acceptable alternative. Chain-link fencing is not
appropriate and detracts from the character of the Springvale
Village Design District Overlay Zone.
(b) When a fence is proposed in front of a building, it shall be open
and low, not exceeding 42 inches in height, so as not to block
views. Fences shall be compatible with the building and
neighborhood in style and proportion and shall enhance the
streetscape.
(c) More-solid, taller fences are appropriate to provide privacy or
safety but should be located where they have minimal visual
impact appropriate to the structure and surrounding area. Five
to six feet shall be the recommended maximum height.
(d) Wherever fences are located, care shall be taken to modulate
the length so as not to create a visual or pedestrian barrier.
Landscaping shall be considered in combination with fencing
to relieve the visual monotony of a long fence.

neighborhood or district.
[3] Lamps and light bulbs, in general, shall be fully shielded
inside the fixture so that the lamp/bulb itself is not visible
from adjacent buildings, or by pedestrians, and/or
motorists. A carriage-lamp-style light shall have glass
translucent enough to reduce glare.
[4] Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone uplighting
and facade lighting standards.
[a] Uplighting to highlight facades, signs, fountains,
waterfalls, and landscaping shall be minimized to
reduce glare and light pollution. Lighting of building
facades and significant natural features shall be done
judiciously, perhaps limited to special buildings or
features that have architectural or cultural
significance or character.
[b] For signage, lighting from the ground shall be
adequately shielded such as with landscaping.

that provide varying degrees of shade and sun at ground level.
§ 280-15-11 SANFORD CODE § 280-15-11
252:752
(e) Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone additional
building mass, scale, and height standards. Two- to three-story
buildings are more traditional in and shall be encouraged in
the Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone.
(2) Architectural style/character standards.
(a) Building designs and treatments that express corporate,
franchise, or trademark identity shall not take precedence over
these design standards; such development shall conform to the
historic, site design, and architectural considerations in these
standards. Corporate or franchise developments shall be
compatible with the visual character of the Sanford Downtown
or Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zones.
(b) Variation in design.
[1] Sanford Downtown Design District Overlay Zone. Although
there is some variation in architectural styles in the
Sanford Downtown Design District Overlay Zone, new
development shall be compatible with the general area.
[2] Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone. Although
there is some variation in architectural styles in the
Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone, new
development should be done in a traditional New England
Village architectural style. See examples in the Planning
Department.
(c) Sanford Downtown Design District Overlay Zone building
design standards.
[1] Sanford Downtown Design District Overlay Zone building
character and scale standards.
[a] Facade design shall display consideration of all sides
of the building.
[b] The scale of a building shall be visually compatible
with its site and neighborhood.
[2] Sanford Downtown Design District Overlay Zone
walkways, entries, and overhangs standards.

convenient and safe access for disabled persons, the
§ 280-15-11 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-15-11
252:753
elderly, baby carriages, and others. Sidewalks and
walkways shall be free of barriers.
[d] All walkways shall be designed to maintain visual
continuity of eave lines, materials at base, soffits,
fasciae, and grade at entry locations. New walkways
shall be fully coordinated with adjoining walkways.
[e] Shop facades shall be designed as individual entities,
to strengthen their character and interest to
pedestrians. Continuous linear shop fronts are
discouraged.
[f] Outdoor display areas shall be identified as part of
applications. Such areas shall not interfere with
pedestrian circulation.
[g] Upper-floor design. Decks, balconies, and porches are
strongly encouraged as they provide sunny, usable
outdoor space and add life and interest to the street.
(d) Architectural details.
[1] Craftsmanship, ornamentation, and architectural details
shall be strongly encouraged. Architectural details shall
include the design features of elements including but not
limited to doors, windows, dormers, porches, balconies,
and decorative details such as cornices, columns,
pediments, railings, and similar features. Large or small,
these details play a key role in defining the style and
character of a building and deserve particular attention
and respect.
[2] Detailing that relates to and reflects the character of the
area shall be encouraged. Vernacular architectural
features help tie together the character of the Sanford
Downtown and Springvale Village Design District Overlay
Zones.
[3] Roof design standards. Roof design is important for snow
management and is a major contributor to design
character. Roofscapes are important design elements that
are viewed by pedestrians. Sloped roofs shed accumulated
snow in avalanche fashion and can be dangerous to
pedestrians below. The design of roofs and pedestrian
areas below them is referred to as snow management and
is discussed in this subsection.
[a] The angle of a sloped roof should be typical of
traditional New England architecture, approximating
a 12:12 pitch. A sloped roof with a flattened pitch is
§ 280-15-11 SANFORD CODE § 280-15-11
252:754
generally not appropriate for the Springvale Village
Design District Overlay Zones.
[b] Sanford Downtown Design District Overlay Zone
additional roof standards.
[i] Roof form shall be modulated and broken up with
the use of dormers or other architectural features.
The ridgeline shall not be continuous but shall be
varied in height or broken with chimneys,
cupolas, towers, or other features.
[ii] Roofs of connected buildings shall be fully
coordinated with adjoining eaves, peaks, gables,
and slopes. Consider the color of neighboring
roofs to create a complementary roof palette:
avoid selecting strongly contrasting colors.
[iii] Roof materials. Consider the effects of climate
and snow management in selecting roofing
materials.
[iv] Roof-mounted equipment shall be concealed.
Satellite dishes, communications antennas and
mechanical equipment shall be planned as part of
the roof so they are concealed from all pedestrian
viewpoints and overlooking development.
[v] Where appropriate in Sanford's Downtown, a flat
roof may be permissible if the building is
multistory and of traditional downtown
architecture and use, including but not limited to
a retail/pedestrian-oriented first floor, office/
residential upper floors, differentiated upper
facade, articulated parapet, and decorative
cornice. Existing buildings of this style shall be
maintained for architectural and/or historic
integrity.
[c] Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone
additional roof standards.
[i] Sloped gable or hip roofs are most appropriate for
the Springvale Village Design District Overlay
Zone. Gambrel, shed, mansard, false mansard, or
flat roofs are not allowed.
[ii] Dormers are an effective way to break up the
mass of a sloped roof and add architectural
interest and are a typical feature of New England
architecture. Dormers shall be of an appropriate
proportion and size relative to the building.
§ 280-15-11 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-15-11
252:755
[4] Street facade standards.
[a] The front facade of both residential and nonresidential
buildings, particularly the main entrance, shall be
oriented to Main Street, or another primary street
frontage if it does not front on Main Street. If an
existing main entrance is not located along the
primary street frontage, the front facade shall be
appropriately designed to contribute to the
pedestrian-friendly character.
[b] For buildings that are sited on a corner lot which
fronts on more than one street, the front facade shall
be oriented toward the primary street frontage, while
a secondary entrance or other appropriate facade
treatment is strongly encouraged for the side street.
[5] Entrance standards.
[a] Principal building entrances shall be accented, and
easily visible from the street to contribute to the
pedestrian-friendly character. This may be achieved
through the design of the doorway and doorway
architectural treatments, by recessing the entry, by
adding a porch or pediment for the front door
providing shelter or by other means to enhance the
entrance.
[b] Service entrances and loading facilities should be
located at the rear or side of structures and screened
from public view. Where buildings face more than one
public street, service and loading circulation shall be
located along secondary streets where appropriate.
Where no off-street options are available, loading and
service entrances located along public streets shall
occupy the minimum space necessary and be
compatible with the other uses of the street, including
pedestrian activities and retail development.
[6] Proportion and spacing of openings, including but not
limited to windows and doors.
[a] Blank exterior walls without doors, windows, or other
architectural features to break up a building's mass
shall be avoided. Street facades in particular shall not
be blank but have an appropriate rhythm of windows
and doors.
[b] Windows and doors shall be appropriately scaled,
vertically oriented, and placed in a regularly spaced
pattern. Symmetry of openings on the street facade is
traditional, though not essential.
§ 280-15-11 SANFORD CODE § 280-15-11
252:756
[c] False windows are discouraged; however, where the
interior layout or function of a building does not
accommodate windows, the judicious use of false
windows may be acceptable. The use of other
architectural or natural elements, including but not
limited to, murals or plantings, which offer vertical
contrast, may be an acceptable alternative, however,
the quality, subject, and maintenance of murals should
be carefully considered.
[7] Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone windows
and window treatment standards.
[a] Avoid modern window styles that are not compatible
with traditional New England architecture.
[b] Square or vertical windows, with divided panes to add
scale to large window openings, are preferred.
[c] The style of window shall be consistent throughout the
building or addition. Visual unity and harmony are
usually achieved when the same window style and
scale is used consistently on all visible facades.
[d] Shutters shall reflect their original use. That is, their
size shall be such that they will cover the entire
window if closed; arched windows shall have arched
shutters. Shutters shall be hung so as to appear
operable, and shutter dimensions shall be based on
window dimensions. The slats shall point up when
shutters are open, and down when closed over the
window.
[e] Awnings shall not detract from the form of the
building or obscure its details. Traditional canvas
awnings shall be encouraged; plastic or metal awnings
shall be discouraged.
[8] Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone porch
standards.
[a] Size, proportions, style, detailing, decorations, and
features such as columns and railings are important
elements of a porch design. Whether on a residential
or nonresidential building, the design shall be
consistent with the architecture and scale of the rest
of the building. Other porches found in the Springvale
Village Design District Overlay Zone should provide
visual guidance for appropriate architectural design
and features.
§ 280-15-11 WOOD, SALE OF § 280-15-11
252:757
[b] Decks and patios shall be located at the rear or side of
a building and, if visible from a public way, shall be
compatible visually with the design of the structure.
Appropriate vegetative screening shall be provided.
[9] Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone exterior
building materials.
[a] Traditional exterior building materials, including
wood clapboard, native stone, or brick, are most
appropriate and strongly encouraged.
[b] Concrete block and metal siding are not allowed; the
use of concrete should be restricted to foundations.
Stucco is not traditional for the Springvale Village
Design District Overlay Zone and is not allowed.
[c] Synthetic or imitation materials, including but not
limited to vinyl siding, may be acceptable if they
replicate traditional materials. As other new materials
are developed that are indistinguishable from natural
or traditional products, they may be considered
favorably.
[10] Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone paint and
exterior color standards.
[a] Traditional New England building colors shall be
strongly encouraged. Bright or electric colors shall
not suitable for siding or trim. Softer or muted colors,
light or dark, tend to be more traditional. Matching
colors with neighboring buildings is not necessarily
encouraged, but choosing a color palate that does not
clash with adjacent buildings is.
[b] A well-selected color palate can greatly enhance a
building's character, in addition to architectural
details. Appropriate accent colors shall be chosen for
the trim, doors, and other architectural elements.
[11] Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone accessory
structure standards.
[a] Accessory structures, including but not limited to a
garage or shed, shall be set back from the street
further than the front facade of the principal structure
so that the principal structure is more prominent.
[b] Adding trim, windows and other architectural details
to accessory structures shall be strongly encouraged
to bring them into scale and visual harmony with the
principal structure. For example, a garage might

17-31.07]
feature the same siding, color scheme and trim, even
window style, as the principal structure.
[12] Springvale Village Design District Overlay Zone gas
station canopy and drive-through standards.
[a] New or replaced canopies over gas pumps shall be
visually sensitive to the neighborhood in color and
design. Use of bright colors shall be discouraged.
Canpony design shall be encouraged to be
architecturally compatible with the principal
structure, if appropriate, and the preferred Springvale
Village Design District Overlay Zone architectural
character described in these standards.
[b] Canopies and drive-throughs shall be aligned to the
building and sited to conform to all other setback and
traffic circulation requirements.
A. Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to regulate solar energy
systems, allow the City to be informed of the placement of solar energy
systems, preserve and protect public health and safety, allow for orderly

AN ACT ESTABLISHING IN THE TOWN OF SANFORD A REPRESENTATIVE
TOWN GOVERNMENT
(Private and Special Laws of 1935, Chapter 72)
Emergency preamble. Whereas, the town of Sanford has a population of approximately
13,000 inhabitants and has approximately 8,000 registered voters on its check list; and
Whereas, the town hall of said town, in which town meetings are held, will admit
approximately 1,000 people at the limit of its capacity; and
Whereas, there is no other public hall in the town of Sanford that will admit a greater
number; and
Whereas, but a small percentage of the voting population can be accommodated at a town
meeting; and
Whereas, the inevitable crowding of the town hall is detrimental to the public health and
safety; and
Whereas, a great many citizens having knowledge of the above conditions refrain from
attending annual town meeting; and
Whereas, a great many citizens are thereby prevented from exercising their legal rights of
attending two meetings and voting therein; and
Whereas, this bill is designed to eliminate the above objectionable condition; and
Whereas, in order for said town to elect town meeting members thereunder at the next
annual town meeting, it is necessary that immediate steps be taken to perform the
requirements of this act; and
Whereas, in the judgment of the legislature, these facts create an emergency within the
meaning of section 16 of Article XXXI of the constitution of the state of Maine, and
requiring the following legislation as immediately necessary for the preservation of the
public peace, health and safety; now, therefore
Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine, as follows:

as to consist of compact and contiguous territory to be bounded so far as possible by the
center line of known streets and ways or by other well defined limits. Their boundaries
shall be reviewed and, if need be, wholly or partially revised, or the number of districts
changed, within the aforesaid limit, by the selectmen, in August 5 years after the next

In addition to other methods established by law for the collection of rates, tolls, rents and
other charges, and without waiver of the right to sue for the same as aforesaid, the lien hereby
created may be enforced in the following manner. The Treasurer, when a rate, toll, rent or other
charge has been committed to him for collection, may after the expiration of three months and
within one year after the date when the same became due and payable, in the case of a person
resident in the district, give or cause to be given to that person, or leave or cause to be left, at

SEWER DISTRICT
thereafter, the Treasurer shall record in the Registry of Deeds of the county in which the
property of that person is located a certificate signed by the treasurer, setting forth the amount
of the rate, toll, rent or other charge, describing the real estate on which the lien is claimed, and
stating that a lien is claimed on the real estate to secure payment of that rate, toll, rent or other
charge, and that a notice and demand for payment of the same has been given or made in
accordance with this section and stating further that the rate, toll rent or other charge remains
unpaid. At the time of the recording of any such certificate in the Registry of Deeds as
heretofore provided, the treasure shall file in the office of the District a true copy of that
certificate, and shall mail a true copy thereof by registered or certified mail to each record
holder of any mortgage on that real estate, addressed to that record holder at his last and usual

shall have priority over all other mortgages, liens, attachments and encumbrances of any nature,
except liens, attachments and claims for taxes, and shall give to the district all the rights usually
possessed by mortgages, except that the district as mortgagee shall not have any right to

months after the date of filing of that certificate in the Registry of Deeds as herein provided, the
mortgage shall be deemed to have been foreclosed and the right of redemption to have expired.
The filing of the certificate in the Registry of Deeds shall be sufficient notice of the existence of
the mortgage hereby provided for. In the event that the rate, toll rent or other charge, with
interest and costs as aforesaid, shall be paid within the period of redemption herein provided
for, the Treasurer of the district shall discharge the mortgage in the same manner as provided
for discharge of real estate mortgages.
SECTION 13-A. ASSESSMENT AGAINST LOT BENEFITED
Where upon petition of the owners or persons in possession of at least 51% of the front
footage of lots or parcels of land to be benefited, the district through its Board of Trustees has
voted to construct and has constructed and completed within its geographical limits, a sanitary
sewerage line together with its appurtenances and connections, being a lateral line or main or
sub-main, so called, and such sanitary sewerage line being where such a line did not previously
exist, the Trustees of said district shall determine what lots or parcels of land have benefited by
such line, together with its appurtenances and connections, and trustees shall then proceed to
cause the whole cost of such construction and completion to be apportioned and assessed upon
the lots or parcels so benefited, whether such parcel or lot is occupied or not, and against the
owner thereof or person in possession.
At the time that construction of such line has been fully completed and all costs therefore
have been submitted to the district, notification of the assessment and the amount thereof shall
be mailed by the district to the owners or persons in possession petitioning for such line or
connecting with such line. Notification of the assessment and the amount thereof shall be
mailed by the district to all other owners or person in possession to be benefited by such line at
such time as such other owners or persons in possession shall make connection therewith.
A291:9 12 - 01 - 2014
SANFORD CODE
In the event that payments of the assessments so made are not paid for a period of 90 days
or more after the notification of such assessment to the owner, or person in possession, then the
provisions of Section 13 shall be applied to the collection of such delinquent assessments.
If petition for construction of a sanitary sewerage line together within its appurtenances
and connections; being a lateral line or a main or a sub-main so called, would in the opinion of
the trustees require the construction of interceptors or trunk lines, the trustees would then cause
the proposed construction of the interceptors or trunk lines to be surveyed by a licensed
engineer and the whole cost of the project would be paid by petitioner.
SECTION 13-B. QUASI-MUNICIPAL CORPORATION

declared to be legal and valid acts and elections, and the title of the Trustees and Officers of the
Sanford Sewerage District to their respective offices if hereby validated.
SECTION 13-D. SEPARABILITY
In the event that any sections or portions of Chapter 169 of the Private and Special Laws
of 1947 or of any Acts amendatory thereof shall be held to be unconstitutional or otherwise
ineffective and null and void by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining sections and
portions thereof shall be separated from those held to be unconstitutional and null and void and
shall continue to be operative.

water on said first day of January. Such orders may be enforced from time to time by any justice of
said supreme judicial court, in term time or in vacation, upon motion of either party, as such justice
may deem reasonable and proper in the premises. At such hearing the justice then sitting may, upon
motion of the petitioner, make all such decrees as he deems reasonable and proper to enable the
petitioner, through its servants and employees, to ascertain the true condition of the mains and pipes
of the said water companies, externally or internally, in the presence of the officers or agents of said
water companies, the entire expense thereof to be borne by said water district. The said appraisers
shall have the power of compelling attendance of witnesses and the production of all books,
accounts and papers pertinent to the issue and necessary for a full understanding by them of the
matter in question and may administer oaths, and any witness or person in charge of such books,
accounts and papers refusing to attend or lo2
 produce the same shall be subject to the same penalties
and proceedings, so on as applicable, as witnesses summoned to attend the supreme judicial court.
Depositions may be taken as in civil actions. The appraisers so appointed shall, after notice and
hearing, fix the valuation of said plants, properties and franchises at what they are fairly and
equitably worth, so that said water companies, their successors or assigns, shall receive just
compensation for all the same. The first day of January, nineteen hundred and thirty, shall be the
date as of which the valuation aforesaid shall be fixed, from which date interest on said award shall
run, and all rents and profits accruing thereafter shall belong to said water district. The report of
said appraisers, or a majority of them, shall be filed in said clerks office, in term time or in
vacation, as soon as may be after their appointment, and such single justice, or, in case of his
inability to act, any justice of said court appointed by the chief justice, may, after notice and
hearing, confirm or reject the same, or recommit it if justice so requires. Upon the confirmation of
said report the court so sitting shall thereupon, after hearing, make final decree upon the entire
matter, including the application of the purchase money and transfer of property, jurisdiction over
which is hereby conferred, and with the power to enforce said decrees as in equity cases. All
findings of fact by said court shall be final, but any party aggrieved may take exceptions as to any
ruling of law-so made, the same to be accompanied by so much of the case as may be necessary to
a clear understanding of the questions raised thereby. Such exceptions shall be claimed on the
docket within ten days after such final decree is signed, entered and filed and notice thereof has
been given to the parties or their counsel, and said exceptions so claimed shall be made up, allowed
and filed within said time unless further time is granted by the court, or by agreement of the parties.
They shall be entered at the next term of the law court to be held after the filing and entry of said
decree and there heard unless otherwise agreed; or the law court for good cause shall order further
time for hearing thereon. Before said plants, properties and franchises are transferred in accordance
with such final decree and before payment therefor, as hereinbefore provided, such justice shall,
