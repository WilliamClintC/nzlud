PREFACE 
This is a compilation of the general ordinances of the Charter Township of Union, Isabella County, Michigan, which includes currently operative ordinances, compiled with all amendments through and including Ordinance No. 1995-4, adopted July 12, 1995. 
The chronological listing of ordinances, including title and location within the compilation, reflects ordinances in force at the time of this compilation, and subsequently adopted, amended or repealed ordinances, thus providing a valuable record of the municipality's ordinance history. Ordinances which are printed in their entirety are classified by subject matter and assigned to one of eleven basic categories. Each of these categories is indicated by a tab. Every ordinance is introduced with a part number, a title concerning the content, the ordinance number, and the adoption date. 
Section headings in boldface type have been provided by the editors, if not supplied in the original copy, to facilitate usage. Sections that are subsequently amended are followed by a history note enclosed in parentheses indicating the ordinance number and adoption date of the amendment. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Cross reference notations are included to provide quick referral to other ordinances and/or sections dealing with similar subjects. 
Running heads at the tops of the pages contain an abbreviated title, the ordinance number and section numbers to provide a guide for locating specific information quickly. The section number appearing in the running head on the left-hand page cites the section material beginning the page; the number on the right-hand page cites the section material concluding the page. 
The exact wording of the ordinances has been preserved. Since ordinances are legal documents, editorial changes in a compilation are minor, limited primarily to correction of obvious typographical errors and resolving, upon specific instructions from the township, any duplications and inconsistencies brought to their attention during the preparation of the proof copy of the compilation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of expression of numbers in text has been imposed. Any textual additions by the editor appear in brackets. 
Numbering system 
Each ordinance is assigned a part number. The part number is used to identify the ordinance primarily for indexing and cross reference purposes. Each succeeding article and/or section deriving from that ordinance will have the same number on the left-hand side of the decimal point. For example, section number 12.004 refers to section 4 of the ordinance assigned to part 12. Part numbers allow for expansion within each of the categories and within the compilation as a whole. 
Index 
The alphabetical index permits easy location of ordinances by subject. Main entries are in all uppercase letters. Under the entry for each ordinance, the catchlines of all sections appear in lowercase, indented and alphabetized. Cross references and additional entries are provided where necessary to direct the user to a particular topic. In preparing the index the proper balance has been achieved between creating an index comprehensive enough to be useful and yet not so detailed that it requires extensive revision each time an ordinance is enacted, repealed, or amended. 
Looseleaf supplements 
Since an ordinance compilation, unlike a bound book, is constantly in a state of evolution, a special feature of this compilation is the looseleaf system of binding. With this system, the compilation can easily be kept up-to-date by submitting copies of new ordinances or amendments as they are enacted. These will then be incorporated by the editor into the compilation, and the appropriate pages will be revised or created for distribution to the holders of copies, with specific instructions for the manner of removing obsolete pages and inserting the current ones. Through regular supplementation, the compilation will continue to remain current and useful.

Sec.

Special regulation is needed to ensure these uses are not concentrated in any one area, thus preventing adverse effects upon the surrounding neighborhood, such as blight and urban deterioration, negative effects on economic development potential, social disorder and crime, negative effects on community standards for aesthetics, the reduction of property values and the subsequent negative impact on the community tax base. The primary objective is to prevent a concentration of these uses by establishing spacing standards and thus ensuring disbursement of these uses throughout the community.  
17.002 - Uses subject to special regulation. 
Sec. (B) The following uses are subject to these controls as follows: 
Group "AS" special regulated uses: 
1.	Adult bookstores.

7.	Health clubs.
8.	Taxi dance halls.
9.	Other uses which provide goods or services which are distinguished or characterized by their emphasis on matters depicting, describing, or relating to "specified sexual activities" or "specified anatomical areas," or which are distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on "specified sexual activities" or "specified anatomical areas."

2.

Sec. (E)

(2)	Relationship to residential areas. The planning commission may waive the locational standard of subsection (D) [17.004], limiting the location of group "AS" uses as they relate to residentially zoned districts, trailer parks, parks, or churches, provided a validated petition requesting such a waiver is presented to the Planning Commission, signed by the owners or purchasers of at least 51 percent of the parcels of land within 500 feet of the proposed location is presented to the Board. In addition to this requirement, the Planning Commission may waive the requirement that any group "AS" use be located no closer than 2,650 feet from schools only if the proponent also demonstrates that school children are not required to pass by the location while walking to or from school. Any petition presented to the Board shall contain, at a minimum, the following:

20.001 - Purpose. 
Sec. I. The purpose of this section is to regulate the location, but not exclude the use and handling of the medical use of marihuana consistent with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act, (MMMA) MCL 333.26421 et seq., by designating the specific locations for the medical use of marihuana. Under no circumstances is the use or handling of marihuana inconsistent with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act permissible in the Charter Township of Union. In creating these regulations, the Charter Township of Union acknowledges that the majority of voters in Michigan have found and declared that medical research has discovered beneficial uses for marihuana in treating or alleviating the pain, nausea, and other symptoms associated with a variety of debilitating medical conditions; that legalizing the medical use of marihuana will have the practical effect of protecting from arrest the vast majority of seriously ill people who have a medical need for that use; and that, although federal law currently prohibits any use of marihuana except under very limited circumstances, states are not required to enforce federal law or prosecute people for engaging in activities prohibited by federal law. 
While the Charter Township of Union defers to these findings, it recognizes that there are some uses which, by their very nature, present the potential for deleterious effects upon adjacent residential and commercial areas. It is the further intent of this Ordinance to comply with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act while protecting the health, safety and welfare of persons in the community and to address and minimize reasonably anticipated secondary effects upon members of the public that would include but are not limited to: danger to law enforcement and other members of the public; increases in criminal activity; and installation of plumbing and electrical facilities that create dangerous conditions. The Charter Township of Union also recognizes that the regulation of the use and handling of marihuana for medical use is necessary to minimize these risks while insuring that marihuana is available to persons registered under the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act.  
20.002 - Definitions. 
Sec. II. As used in this Ordinance, the following words and phrases are defined as follows:

Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the Grantor further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the Grantor or such persons as the Grantor shall designate. It is the purpose of this Ordinance and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible public interest and public purpose in these matters and any franchise issued pursuant to this Ordinance shall be deemed to include this finding as an internal part. Further, it is recognized that cable communications systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the community residents, but can provide a variety of interactive communication services to institutions and individuals. Many of these services involve municipal agencies and other public institutions, by providing governmental, educational, or health care communications. 
For these purposes to the extent practicable, the following goals underlie these regulations contained herein: 
a)	The cable communications system should be capable of accommodating both the present and reasonably foreseeable future communications needs of the community. 
b)	The cable communications system should be improved and upgraded if necessary during the franchise term so that the new facilities necessary for the operation of this system shall be integrated to the maximum extent possible with existing facilities. 
c)	The cable communications system authorized by this Ordinance shall be responsive to the needs and interests of the community, and shall provide a wide diversity of information sources and services to the public.

Franchise agreements shall authorize the use of public easements for the construction and operation of cable communication systems but they shall not convey any property rights to any Grantee. No franchise agreement shall either expressly or impliedly be deemed to restrict the granting of subsequent agreements nor shall any franchise agreement create any right to renewal.

(2)	Each applicant for a franchise to provide cable service shall, in its application, define the initial service area and provide a line extension and drop policy for extending areas outside of the initial service area. 
Upon execution of a franchise agreement, the Grantee shall proceed as soon as may be practical to construct or reconstruct the cable system so as to be in compliance with this Ordinance and any franchise agreement. The failure or neglect to complete construction, reconstruction or maintenance within the allotted time or any extension, shall render any franchise agreement voidable upon written notice from the Grantor of its intention to cancel the contract. 
(3)	Franchise fee. As compensation for the use of the streets, public ways and places, and other facilities, for the construction, operation, maintenance, modification or reconstruction of a cable system, and for the Grantor's costs of maintenance, improvement and supervision thereof, and for the Grantor's costs of establishing and conducting the regulatory activities required by virtue of the granting of a franchise pursuant to this Ordinance, the Grantee shall pay to the Grantor five percent of its annual gross receipts for the term of its franchise agreement or any portion thereof while it is operating a cable system in accordance with this Ordinance. 
a)	The Grantor expressly reserves the right to negotiate a lower percentage fee in any franchise agreement in the event that it determines that such a lower percentage is in the best interest of the community. 
b)	The franchise fee set forth in any franchise agreement shall be due and payable on a monthly basis. The Grantee shall prepare a monthly report stating its gross receipts by revenue category for the immediately preceding month. This gross receipts report shall be submitted to the administrator or the Grantor designee with the franchise fee percentage payment no later than the close of business on the 30th day of the month following the reporting period. 
c)	At the end of any calendar year the franchise fees paid by a Grantee shall be adjusted to account for any under or over payments. In no event shall the franchise fees paid to the Grantor exceed five percent of the gross receipts derived from any 12-month period of operation of the cable system, including the time value of money, which would have lawfully been collected if such fees had been paid per annum in arrears. The Grantee shall be solely responsible for determining the amount of its monthly payments in this regard. To the extent that overpayments occur, any amounts paid in excess of that which was due, shall be deemed to be credited to the following month's payment. The failure to remit the full balance due in any month shall be cured at year end by a complete audit. The Grantee shall submit complete financial statements to the Grantor no later than April 15th of each year of operation, prepared by an independent certified public accountant, detailing its operation by month for the preceding calendar year. Interest on any under paid amounts shall accrue from the date such payments were due until they are paid at the maximum allowable rate under Michigan law.

The Grantor shall notify the Grantee or applicant within 30 days following the receipt of any claim of demand for which the Grantee or applicant would be liable according to its indemnification responsibilities. Any such notice will be given in writing to the person, and at the place, named in the franchise agreement or application for a franchise. 
(5)	Insurance. In order to provide for the general welfare and convenience of the public and to protect the interests of the Grantor, every applicant for a franchise shall indicate its ability to obtain insurance in a form and amount which satisfies this section. 
The Grantor shall not execute a franchise agreement in accordance with this Ordinance unless and until an approved Grantee provides adequate proof of insurance, together with written proof of payment of all such premiums as may be required to put the coverage described in full force and effect, it shall be the duty of every Grantee to file annually with the Grantor proof of insurance coverage including copies of policies. 
a)	Each Grantee shall obtain and shall keep in full force and effect at all times during the term of any franchise agreement or extension thereof, a policy of broad form comprehensive general liability insurance which includes personal injury liability, and blanket contractual liability.

No physical damage insurance shall be required for the distribution system (neither trunk, feeder or drop lines), amplifiers or passive hardware or converters. It shall be the sole responsibility of any Grantee to pay for all premiums due from the coverage outlined in this section. 
c)	Each policy of insurance required by this section shall contain a 90-day cancellation or nonrenewal provision which shall expressly require the carrier to give written notice to the Grantor administrator 90 days prior to cancellation, nonrenewal or material alteration of coverage. 
d)	Any policy of insurance issued pursuant to the requirements of this section, shall only satisfy this Ordinance if it shall be issued by a responsible and nonassessable insurance carrier duly authorized to do business in the State of Michigan, which company must have been rated at least B+ by Best's during each of the preceding five years. 
e)	Nothing in this section shall be construed to excuse a Grantee from the faithful performance of its obligations under any franchise agreement or to limit is liability under any provision of this Ordinance.

2.	Reimbursement of costs borne by the Grantor to correct franchise violations not corrected by the Grantee, after due notice;

a)	The letter of credit shall both contain the following unrestricted endorsement: "The drawee acknowledges that this letter of credit may not be cancelled by the surety under any circumstances without written authorization from the Charter Township of Union." 
The statement of the clerk of the Grantor in the following form, shall be sufficient to draw against the said letter of credit upon presentment: I (We) certify that ____________ now holds a Franchise to operate a cable television system within the Charter Township of Union, and ____________ is now in material breach of its agreements with the Grantor. 
b)	Use of the performance bond and letter of credit. Prior to drawing upon the letter of credit or performance bond for the purpose described in this section, the Grantor shall notify the Grantee in writing that payment is due and the Grantee shall have ten days from the receipt of the written notice to make a full and complete payment. If the Grantee does not, make the payment within ten days, the Grantor may withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and penalties, from the letter of credit or the performance bond.

No later than 30 days after mailing to the Grantee by certified mail notification of a withdrawal pursuant to paragraph B above, the Grantee shall replenish the letter of credit or performance bond in an amount equal to the amount so withdrawn unless Grantee has challenged such withdrawal and/or the basis thereafter. Failure to make timely replenishment of such amount to the letter of credit and/or performance bond shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance. 
(7)	Liquidated damages. In order to facilitate an orderly regulatory framework and to provide for the common interests of the Grantor and the Grantee, any franchise agreement executed pursuant to this Ordinance shall contain negotiated dollar amounts to serve as fixed and liquidated damages for the violation of this Ordinance or of the franchise agreement. The Ordinance violations which are to be specified in detail in the franchise agreement shall be those for which ongoing monitoring and enforcement are unduly burdensome for the Grantor and which are such that it would be impossible to determine the actual dollar value of damage to the Grantor or the public. Similarly the franchise agreement violations which are to be specified for purposes of liquidated damages shall be those which are not ordinarily capable of being cured by compensatory or punitive damages at law. It being the express purpose of this section to identify the common interests of the Grantor and the Grantee in such a way as to forestall resort to termination of the contract as a remedy for material breaches of same or this Ordinance and to thereby protect the investment of the Grantee and to insure continuity of service for the community. 
a)	The liquidated damages specified in a franchise agreement shall serve as the primary pecuniary remedy for the specified violations. However, nothing in this section shall prevent or bar the Grantor from pursuing any remedies at law or in equity where a material breach of a franchise agreement persists notwithstanding the payment of liquidated damages. 
(8)	Regulatory authority. 
a)	Governing requirements. At all times during the term of the franchise, Grantee shall comply with all laws, rules or regulations of the Grantor, state or Federal Government, their regulatory agencies or commissions which are now applicable or may be applicable hereafter to the construction and operation of the cable communications system, including without limitations, all laws, Ordinances, or regulations now in force or hereafter enacted; provided that any law, regulation or Ordinance hereafter enacted shall not materially affect the rights under the franchise.

The Grantee shall comply with new laws and regulations, such as the American with Disabilities Act.

The Grantor, at its option, may notify the Grantee that it wishes to negotiate those provisions which are affected in any way by such modification in regulations or statutory authority. Thereafter, the Grantee shall negotiate in good faith with the community in the development of alternative provisions which shall, to the extent permitted by law, materially maintain the rights of the community as established under the terms of this Ordinance and the franchise. The community shall have the duty, based upon the results of such negotiations, to modify any of the provisions to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the full intent and purpose of this Ordinance and the franchise and the agreement reached in negotiations. 
c)	Reservation of-rights for regulation. The Grantor reserves the right to exercise the maximum plenary authority, as may be lawfully permissible, to regulate the cable communications system, the franchisee and the Grantee.

g)	Expense reimbursement to Grantor. The Grantee shall pay the Grantor a sum of money which will, when added to any application fees received, reimburse all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the granting of an initial franchise, including, but not limited to, consultant fees, attorney's fees, publication fees, travel expenses and all other direct costs.

90.000 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE Ord. No. 1992-9 Adopted: November 11, 1992 
THE TOWNSHIP BOARD OF THE CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF UNION, COUNTY OF ISABELLA, STATE OF MICHIGAN, ORDAINS:  
ARTICLE 1  
90.100 - SHORT TITLE AND GENERAL PROVISIONS 
[Sec. 1.00.] This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Union Township Stormwater Management Ordinance," and shall be referred to as Ordinance No. 1992-9. 
 
90.101 - Statement of findings. 
Sec. 1.01. As a result of the preparation and conclusions of the stormwater management plan, adopted by the Township Planning Commission on September 16, 1992, the Charter Township of Union finds that: 
A.	Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed: (1) increases flood flows and velocities, (2) contributes to erosion and sedimentation, (3) overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, (4) greatly increases the cost of public facilities, (5) hinders control efforts in downstream communities, (6) reduces groundwater recharge, and (7) threatens public health and safety. 
B.	A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of development activities causing accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the people, resources, and environment of the Township. 
C.	The Township Board of the Charter Township of Union further finds that uncontrolled drainage and development of land has a significant adverse impact upon the community. More specifically: 
1.	Stormwater runoff can carry pollutants into receiving water bodies, degrading water quality. 
2.	The increase in nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters, adversely affecting flora and fauna. 
3.	Improperly channeling water increases the velocity of runoff, thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation. 
4.	Siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases their capacity to hold and transport water, interferes with navigation, and harms flora and fauna. 
5.	Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff inhibiting percolation into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge. 
6.	Improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods that occur, endangering property and human life. 
7.	Improperly managed stormwater runoff can interfere with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas, thereby disrupting biological productivity. 
8.	Many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with sound stormwater runoff management practices.  
90.102 - Purpose. 
Sec. 1.02. 
[A.]	The purpose of this Ordinance is to reduce or eliminate the hazards to public health and safety caused by excessive stormwater runoff; to reduce the economic losses to individuals and the community at large; to enhance broader social and economic objectives; and to protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources. The provisions of this Ordinance further supplement ordinances regulating: 
[1.]	The use and development of floodplain and flood-prone lands.
[2.]	The subdivision, layout, and improvement of lands located within the Charter Township of Union. 
[3.]	The development of areas of unique physical characteristics.
[4.]	The excavating, filling, and grading of lots and other parcels or areas.
[5.]	The development of business districts.
[6.]	The construction of buildings and the drainage of the sites on which those structures are located, including parking and other paved areas. 
[7.]	Soil erosion and sedimentation.
[8.]	The design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater drainage facilities and systems.
[9.]	The alteration, filling, and development of wetland areas.
[B.]	The further purpose of this Ordinance shall be:
[1.]	To protect the public health, safety, and welfare by requiring stormwater management whenever new, expanded, or modified developments are proposed. 
[2.]	To promote the most efficient and beneficial uses of land and water resources.
[3.]	To assure that stormwater runoff from development is controlled so that water quality is protected, siltation is minimized, and flooding problems are avoided. 
[4.]	To provide for cost-effective and functionally effective stormwater management and to reduce the need for future remedial projects. 
[5.]	To use the natural drainage system for conveying and receiving stormwater runoff and to minimize the need to construct storm drain pipes. 
[6.]	To encourage multiple-purpose stormwater management that enhances the environmental character of the Charter Township of Union. 
[7.]	To allow wetlands to be used for stormwater detention in selected locations, while ensuring that the natural functions and the quality of wetlands throughout the Township are protected to the maximum feasible extent. 
[8.]	To recognize the private responsibility of incorporating stormwater management systems into the early stages of site planning and design. 
[9.]	To allow for off-site stormwater management under specified conditions.
[10.]	To ensure that all stormwater conveyance and detention facilities will be properly maintained. 
[11.]	To provide penalties for violation of the provisions of this Ordinance. 
90.103 - Authority. 
Sec. 1.03. This Ordinance is adopted in accordance with the Charter Township Ordinance Act of 1947 and the Subdivision Control Act of 1967.  
90.104 - Conflicting ordinances. 
Sec. 1.04. The provisions of the Ordinance shall be deemed as additional requirements to standards required by other ordinances of the Township. In case of conflicting requirements, the most restrictive shall apply.  
90.105 - Separability. 
Sec. 1.05. The provisions and sections of the Ordinance shall be deemed separable and the validity of any portion of this Ordinance shall not affect the validity of the remainder.  
90.106 - Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. 
Sec. 1.06. Permits and approvals issued pursuant to this Ordinance do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance. If more stringent requirements concerning regulation of stormwater or erosion and sedimentation control are contained in the other code, rule, act, or ordinance, the more stringent regulation shall apply.  
90.107 - Regulated activities.

5.	For the 25-year frequency and 24-hour duration storm event, the discharge runoff rate shall not exceed the peak rate of 0.1 cfs per acre for the entire site. Where these standards cannot realistically be achieved, the applicant shall demonstrate that existing higher runoff rates meet the intent and spirit of this Ordinance. 
6.	Unless otherwise approved, stormwater discharge shall be conveyed through swales and vegetated buffer strips so as to decrease runoff velocity, to allow for natural infiltration, to allow suspended sediment particles to settle, and to remove pollutants. 
7.	Watercourses shall not be dredged or cleared of vegetation or deepened, widened, straightened, stabilized, or otherwise altered without applicable permits or approvals from the Township Board and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. If the watercourse is a designated county drain, approval from the Isabella County Drain Commissioner shall be obtained. Any other applicable permit requirements shall also be obtained prior to approval. 
8.	Design criteria, based upon professionally accepted principles, to trap or contain discharge of runoff from any site that may contain oil, grease, toxic chemicals, or other polluting materials shall be incorporated to meet the requirements of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Charter Township of Union. 
9.	Drainage systems shall be designed to protect public health and safety and to be visually attractive. 
10.	Phased development shall provide storage of stormwater for the entire site as part of the initial phase of construction. 
B.	Soil erosion standards: 
1.	Sediment resulting from accelerated soil erosion shall be removed from runoff water before it leaves the site of the development or earth change. 
2.	Surface water must be discharged or conveyed around, through, or from the development or earth change area at a controlled release rate sufficient to prevent erosion. 
3.	If lakes, ponds, rivers, creeks, streams, or other watercourses and wetlands are located on or near the site, erosion control measures that trap sediment shall be encouraged. Other measures may be required if reasonably determined to be necessary to protect a watercourse or wetland. 
4.	The creation or retention of vegetated buffer strips shall be encouraged along the edges of all lakes, ponds, creeks, streams, other watercourses, and wetlands when reasonably determined to be necessary to protect the watercourse. 
C.	Stormwater storage and infiltration structure standards: 
1.	Stormwater storage and/or infiltration structures that protect water quality and minimize flooding shall be required for all developments. Storage facilities may include but are not limited to detention basins, retention basins, infiltration trenches, swales with check dams, and other facilities. 
2.	All detention basins shall be designed to maximize the ability of the basin to hold and trap sediment. The following types of basins, listed in order of preference with "(a)" being the most desirable, meet the requirements of the Charter Township of Union: 
(a)	Infiltration facilities, provided that soils and groundwater conditions are suitable.
(b)	Detention basins with a fixed minimum water elevation between runoff events (wet basins). Wet basins that serve to trap soil particles on site are preferable to dry basins. 
(c)	Detention basins that hold stormwater from the one-year storm event for more than 24 hours before completely draining to become a dry basin (extended detention). 
3.	Detention and retention basins shall be safely and adequately designed to control runoff. Retention and detention basins shall have an overflow system designed to safely control a 100-year frequency storm event. Basins shall be permanently stabilized to minimize erosion. 
4.	Unless a variation is approved, detention and retention basins with banks steeper than one on three (vertical to horizontal) shall not be permitted. 
5.	Detention basins and associated berms and landscaping shall be designed to protect public safety and to be visually attractive (refer to the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service Agricultural Handbook No. 590; PondsPlanning, Design, Construction). 
D.	Discharge of stormwater runoff to wetland standards: 
1.	Stormwater runoff discharged to wetlands must be diffused to nonerosive velocities before it reaches the wetland. 
2.	Wetlands may be used for stormwater detention if the following conditions are met:
(a)	If the provisions of Act 203, the Goemaere-Anderson Wetland Protection Act of Michigan, are met. 
(b)	If the wetland storage or detention area is set back at least 100 feet from the edge of any lake or stream. 
(c)	If the wetland does not have significant wildlife habitat or ecological values that would likely be impaired or destroyed. 
(d)	If the wetland has sufficient holding capacity for stormwater, based upon calculations prepared by the proprietor and reviewed and approved by the township. 
(e)	If adequate on-site sediment control is provided to protect the natural functioning of the wetland. 
(f)	If proper Department of Natural Resources (DNR) permits are obtained.

6.1.13 If the Township permits pre-treatment or equalization of flows, preliminary or pre-treatment shall be provided, at no expense to the Township, as may be necessary to reduce the B.O.D. to 300 mg/l and suspended solids to 350 mg/l or to reduce objectionable characteristics of said effluent to within the maximum limits provided for in Section 6.3 [111.603] hereof, or to control the quantity and rates of discharges of such water or wastes. On direction of the Township, an entity may be required to remove, exclude, or require pre-treatment of any industrial waste, in whole or in part, for any reasons deemed to be in the Township's interest. Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained in satisfactory and effective operation at no expense to the Township. Plans, specifications and any other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary or pre-treatment facilities shall be submitted for approval to the Township and no construction of such facility shall be commenced until said approvals are obtained in writing. The Township may elect to treat industrial waste discharges in excess of normal domestic concentrations on a basis prescribed by written agreement and for an established surcharge to cover the added cost. All such preliminary treatment or pre-treatment shall be in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations and such pre-treatment criteria as are promulgated by the Township. All expenses of Township services necessary to review such preliminary treatment facilities plans and specifications shall be borne by the owner. 
6.1.14 When required by the Township, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install at their cost, a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes, as outlined in Article II, Section 4. [111.601(6.1.4)] 
6.1.15 All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this Ordinance shall be determined in accordance with E.P.A. Regulations, 40 C.F.R. 136, published October 16, 1973 in the Federal Register and the most recent edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage," published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided for, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to public health, safety and welfare. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is sufficient or whether grab sample or samples should be taken. 
6.1.16 No provision contained in this Article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Township and any industrial or commercial firm whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Township for treatment, subject to special payment (surcharge) therefor by the industrial or commercial firm if the sewage treatment facility is capable of removing the waste to meet water quality requirements.

114.008 - Confidential information. 
Sec. 8. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.  
114.009 - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
Sec. 9. The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the WWTP is located, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
A.	Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six- (6) month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
B.	Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six- (6) month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
C.	Any other discharge violation that the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of WWTP personnel or the general public;

E.	Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
F.	Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
G.	Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H.	Any other violation(s) which the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.  
114.010 - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
Sec. 10. 
10.1 Notification of violation. When the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation. 
10.2 Consent orders. The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 10.4 and 10.5 of this ordinance and shall be judicially enforceable. 
10.3 Show cause hearing. The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
10.4 Compliance orders. When the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
10.5 Cease and desist orders. When the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations arc likely to recur, the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
A.	Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B.	Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
10.6 Administrative fines. 
A.	When the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed five thousand ($5,000) dollars. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
B.	Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of $500.00 plus cost and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of seven percent (7%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
C.	Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for (the Superintendent) to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
D.	Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
10.7 Emergency suspensions. The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the WWTP, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
A.	Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the WWTP, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 10.8 of this ordinance are initiated against the user. 
B.	A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections 10.3 or 10.8 of this ordinance. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
10.8 Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in Section 5.6 of this ordinance, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
A.	Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
B.	Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
C.	Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
D.	Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
E.	Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section 2 of this ordinance.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 10.3 of this ordinance why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.  
114.011 - Judicial, enforcement remedies. 
11.1 Injunctive relief. When the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may petition the Circuit Court of Isabella County, Michigan through the Township's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the user. The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
11.2 Civil penalties. 
A.	A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the Township for a maximum civil penalty of five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
B.	The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the Township. 
C.	In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
D.	Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
11.3 Criminal prosecution. 
A.	A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 93 days, or both. 
B.	A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the WWTP which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least five hundred ($500.00) dollars, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than 93 days, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under State law. 
C.	A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this ordinance, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this ordinance shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than five thousand ($500.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 93 days, or both. 
D.	In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than five thousand ($500.00) dollars per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 93 days, or both. 
11.4 Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this ordinance are not exclusive. The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Charter Township of Union's enforcement response plan. However, the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.  
114.012 - Supplemental enforcement action. 
Sec. 12. 
12.1 Performance bonds. The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this ordinance, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the Charter Township of Union, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
12.2 Liability insurance. The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this ordinance, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the WWTP caused by its discharge. 
12.3 Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
12.4 Public nuisance. A violation of any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the Charter Township of Union Ordinance 1999-02 Civil Infraction Ordinance governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the Charter Township of Union for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.  
114.013 - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
Sec. 13. 
13.1 Upset. 
A.	For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
B.	An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (C), below, are met. 
C.	A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)	An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(2)	The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)	The user has submitted the following information to the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days: 
(a)	A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
(b)	The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
(c)	Steps being taken and/or planned to rake, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
D.	In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
E.	Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
F.	Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
13.2 Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 2.1(A) of this ordinance or the specific prohibitions in Sections 2.1(B)(3) through (18) of this ordinance if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
A.	A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
B.	No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Charter Township of Union was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
13.3 Bypass. 
A.	For the purposes of this section,
(1)	"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)	"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
B.	A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
C.	(1)	If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)	A user shall submit oral notice to the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
D.	(1)	Bypass is prohibited, and The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(a)	Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(b)	There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(c)	The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (C) of this section.
(2)	The Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent may approve anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Waste Water Treatment Plant Superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (D)(1) of this section.  
114.014 - Wastewater treatment rates. 
Sec. 14. The Charter Township may adopt Wastewater Treatment Rates for the treatment of wastewater which contains pollutants that are over the local limits specified by this Ordinance. These will be adopted by the Township Board of Trustees as necessary.  
114.015 - Miscellaneous provisions. 
Sec. 15. 
15.1 Pretreatment charges and fees. The Charter Township of Union may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the Charter Township of Union's Pretreatment Program which may include: 
A.	Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications; 
B.	Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users; 
C.	Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction;
D.	Fees for filing appeals; and
D.	Other fees as the Charter Township of Union may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this ordinance and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by the Charter Township of Union. 
Section 15.2 Severability. The various sections and provisions of this Ordinance shall be deemed to be severable, and should any section of this Ordinance be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of the Ordinance as a whole or any section or provision of this Ordinance other than the Section or provision so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  
114.016 - Effective date. 
Sec. 16. This ordinance shall be in full force and effect immediately following its passage, approval, and publication, as provided by law.

Township: The Charter Township of Union, Isabella County, Michigan. 
Township Board: The Supervisor, Clerk, Treasurer, and Trustees of the Charter Township of Union, Isabella County, Michigan.  
129.004 - Standards.

Travel by non-motorized bicycles is permitted. Bicycles shall yield to pedestrians. 
2.	Unlawful damage. It shall be unlawful to damage or deface a sidewalk or pathway by any means. 
(4.02)	Construction standards. Sidewalks or pathways shall comply with the standards set forth herein and any supplemental engineering standards that may be adopted by the Township Board, and with Isabella County Road Commission (ICRC) standards (at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, ICRC enforces Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) sidewalk specifications on roads under the Road Commission's jurisdiction). In the event of a conflict between standards, the agency with roadway jurisdiction shall prevail if the sidewalk or pathway is located in a public road right-of-way. In the event of conflict between different standards, the more stringent standard shall apply. 
1.	Minimum width: Sidewalks: Four (4) feet; Pathways: Eight (8) feet. 
2.	Location: 
a.	Sidewalks shall be located one (1) foot off the property line in the road right-of-way, except where the planned right-of-way is greater than the width of the existing right-of-way, in which case the sidewalk shall be located one (1) foot inside the planned right-of-way. 
b.	Sidewalks shall be aligned horizontally and vertically with existing sidewalks on adjacent properties. 
c.	Pathways may be constructed in lieu of sidewalks or in locations that do not parallel roadways. 
d.	The Planning Commission may modify these width and location requirements upon finding that another location would be more appropriate because of the location of utilities, existing landscaping or trees, the location of connecting sidewalks or pathways on adjacent parcels, or other site considerations. 
3.	Paving. Sidewalks shall be concrete with a depth of at least four (4) inches, except that sidewalks across a driveway or other vehicle crossing shall be reinforced and have a depth of at least six (6) inches. Concrete shall be placed over 6" compacted sand. Pathways shall be 3" hot mix asphalt over 6" 22A gravel (minimum grade). A minimum of 6" top soil shall be removed under concrete or asphalt.

The terms under which such an association assumes such responsibility, including the method of funding sidewalk or pathway maintenance, shall be specified in the recorded subdivision covenants, conditions and restrictions or condominium association master deed and bylaws, as applicable. A Special Assessment District shall be established in the name of the association if the association at any time fails to meet the maintenance standards. 
2.	Repairs or restoration. A sidewalk or pathway that becomes cracked or damaged to the extent that the sidewalk or pathway becomes potentially unsafe for use shall be repaired or restored in compliance with the construction standards specified herein. The following standards shall deem a sidewalk or pathway in need of repair or restoration: 
a.	If the sidewalk has displacement of more than three-quarters (¾) of an inch between any two (2) sections (flags) of sidewalk at the connection joint. 
b.	If the sidewalk or pathway has more than two (2) cracks of one-quarter (¼) inch in width or more in any two (2) linear feet.

1.	Permits. 
a.	A permit is required from the Township prior to the construction, removal, or repair of a sidewalk or pathway. A permit may be obtained by submitting a completed application form, along with plans and specifications, and the required fee, to the Township Building Department. The Building Official shall be responsible for evaluating the application to determine compliance with Ordinance standards (and to determine compliance with the approved site plan, where applicable) and issuing the permit. A separate permit shall not be required if the proposed sidewalk or pathway is part of a larger development that requires a building permit. A copy of the permit shall be kept at hand at the construction site. 
b.	The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining any permits required by the Isabella County Road Commission related to sidewalk or pathway construction within a County road right-of-way. 
2.	Inspection. During construction, the Building Official shall be responsible for inspection. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Building Official shall follow the inspection guidelines set forth in the adopted building code. 
3.	Violations. The Building Official shall be responsible for investigating violations of this Ordinance. Whenever the Building Official determines that a violation exists, the Building Official shall pursue compliance following the enforcement procedures set forth in the adopted building code. If the owner of property where a sidewalk or pathway has fallen into a state of disrepair such that it is unsafe for use fails to complete repairs within thirty (30) days after notification, then the Township may cause necessary repairs and charge the property owner for the costs of repair. If such costs are not paid by the property owner the costs shall become a lien against the property. 
(6.02)	Site plan review. If a proposed sidewalk or pathway is part of larger development that requires site plan review, then the sidewalk or pathway shall be shown on the site plan, which plan shall be reviewed in accordance with the site plan review procedures set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. 
(6.03)	Authority of the Township Board to require sidewalk or pathway construction or maintenance. In accordance with Michigan Public Act 246 of 1931 and Act 246 of 1945, as amended, the Township Board may order the construction, repair, or maintenance of, or may construct, repair, or maintain sidewalks or pathways in a designated area within the Township because of the health, safety, or welfare of the residents. The Township Board shall hold a public meeting relative to the ordering of the sidewalk or pathway construction, repair, or maintenance and shall notify property owners involved of the time and place of the hearing. If the Township Board determines that the construction, repair or maintenance of sidewalks or pathways is necessary, it may construct, repair, or maintain the sidewalks or pathways and assess the costs to the property involved, payable over no longer than a ten-year period, or permit the owners of the property involved to have the sidewalks or pathways constructed, repaired, or maintained according to Township specifications at their own expenses. The Township Board may also propose a cost-sharing mechanism either from general revenues or a Township-wide sidewalk and pathway construction fund. In situations where a proposed sidewalk or pathway does not currently have connecting sidewalks or pathways on the adjacent properties on either side, the Township Board may require a property owner to post a cash deposit in lieu of construction, in an amount equivalent to the cost of construction, which would be held in deposit until the adjacent properties develop and install sidewalks or pathways.

210.000 - PRIVATE ROADS Ord. No. 2000-09 Adopted: December 18, 2000 
An ordinance to regulate the construction of private roads within the Charter Township of Union. 
The Charter Township of Union, Isabella County, Michigan, Hereby Ordains:
 
210.001 - Title, intent and purpose. 
Sec. I. This ordinance shall be known and cited as the "Union Township Private Road Ordinance". The intent of this ordinance is to provide and manage access to land development, while preserving the regional flow of traffic in terms of safety, capacity, and speed. If access systems are not properly designed, these thoroughfares will be unable to accommodate the access needs of development and retain their primary transportation function. This ordinance balances the right of reasonable access to private property, with the right of the citizens of the Charter Township of Union and the State of Michigan to safe and efficient travel. Regulations have been applied to private roads for the purpose of reducing traffic accidents, personal injury, and property damage attributable to poorly designed access systems, and to thereby improve the safety and operation of the roadway network. This will protect the substantial public investment in the existing transportation system and reduce the need for expensive remedial measures. These regulations also further the orderly layout and use of land, protect community character, establish emergency vehicle access and conserve natural resources by promoting well-designed road and access systems and discouraging the unplanned subdivision of land.  
210.002 - Private roads. 
Sec. II.  
1.	Private driveways designed to serve one or two lots which may not be served by a driveway from a public road are exempt from these regulations. Such lots typically do not have frontage on a public road and are served by easements or by "flag" lots. 
2.	Private roads may be permitted in accordance with the requirements of this Section and the following general standards shall apply: 
a)	All private roads in the township shall be constructed to Isabella County Road Commission (I.C.R.C.) specifications as revised and contained in "Standards and Specifications for Plat Development/Site Condominium Development and Street Construction" and have an easement of a minimum of 66 feet in width. 
b)	Private roads that are generally accessible to the public shall have all traffic control features, such as striping or markers, in conformance with the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
c)	The minimum distance between private road outlets on a single side of a public road shall be 660 feet, or less where provided by access classification and standards for state roads and local thoroughfares. 
d)	All properties served by the private road shall provide adequate access for emergency vehicles and shall conform to the approved local street numbering system. 
e)	All private roads shall be designated as such and will be required to have adequate signage indicating the road is a private road and not publicly maintained. 
f)	All private roads shall have a posted speed limit not to exceed 20 miles an hour.
g)	All private roads shall have adequate provisions for drainage and stormwater runoff as provided in the above referenced ICRC document. 
3.	Private roads serving between three and 13 unplatted lots may utilize the I.C.R.C.'s Typical Rural Residential cross section without the bituminous surface. The road commission shall not be compelled to accept roads constructed to this lesser standard. 
4.	Roads serving more than 13 lots shall be constructed or upgraded to meet all specifications in the above referenced I.C.R.C. document. 
5.	Applications for subdivision and land divisions approvals that include private roads shall include a drainage plan and road construction plan, prepared by a registered engineer. The township appointed engineer shall review private road plans for conformance with this Code. 
6.	Construction permits are required for connection to public roads. Application for road construction shall be made concurrent with the creation of a lot that does not have frontage on a public road. A road construction permit shall be issued after approval of the private road plan and the entire length of the road shall be inspected during construction and upon completion. If found in conformance, a final use permit shall be issued. 
7.	No building permit shall be issued for any lot served by a private road until the private road has been constructed and approved, so that all lots to be served by the private road have access to a public road. All lots that are in existence at the time of adoption of this ordinance shall be issued building permits, providing all other requirements for a building permit are met. 
8.	A road maintenance agreement, drafted by the applicant and approved by the township attorney shall be recorded with the deed of each property to be served by a common private road. The agreement shall provide for: 
a)	A method to initiate and finance a private road and maintain that road in good condition;
b)	A method of apportioning maintenance costs to current and future users;
c)	A provision that the township may inspect, and if necessary, require that repairs be made to the private road to ensure that safe access is maintained for emergency vehicles. If required repairs are not made within six months of date of notice, the township may make the necessary repairs and assess owners of parcels on the road for the cost of all improvements plus an administrative fee, not to exceed 25% of total costs; 
d)	A provision that the majority vote of all property owners on the road shall determine how the road is maintained except in the case of emergency repairs as outlined above; 
e)	A statement that no public funds shall be used to construct, repair or maintain the road; 
f)	A provision requiring mandatory upgrading of the roadway if additional parcels are added to reach the specified thresholds; and 
g)	A provision that property owners along that road are prohibited from restricting or in any manner interfering with normal ingress and egress by any other owners or persons needing to access properties with frontage on that road. 
9.	No private road shall be incorporated into the public road system unless it is built to public road specifications of the county. The property owners shall be responsible for bringing the road into conformance. 
10.	All private roads shall have a sign and name meeting township standards and shall include the following notice: "Private Road" "Not maintained by Public". 
11.	An application fee will be established by the Director of Public Works to cover administrative, processing, and inspection costs. 
12.	The United States postal service and the local school district are not required to use the private road for access to the parcels abutting the private road and may require that service be provided only at the closest public access point.  
210.003 - Severability. 
Sec. III. The provisions, sections, sentences and phrases of this Ordinance are declared to be severable and if any such portion is declared unconstitutional or invalid for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, such finding shall in no way affect or invalidate the remainder of this Ordinance.  
210.004 - Effective date. 
Sec. IV. This Ordinance will take effect immediately after publication.

History and findings. Charter Township of Union was sued by a sexually oriented business in Intimate Ideas v Charter Township of Union, Eastern District Case No. 03-10085, and the sexually oriented business opened for business in the Charter Township of Union. Thereafter the Charter Township of Union Board directed the Charter Township of Union Planning Commission to research and develop zoning ordinance provisions defining and regulating sexually oriented businesses. The Charter Township of Union Planning Commission received and reviewed 601 studies and reports about the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, and focused on studies from the cities of Indianapolis, Austin, Garden Grove, Whittier, Minneapolis, St. Mary, and St. Paul. The Charter Township of Union Planning Commission made several preliminary findings based on their review of the studies and reports. Based on the findings and recommendations of the Charter Township of Union Planning Commission, and the selected studies and reports considered by both the Planning Commission and the Charter Township of Union Board, as well as several court decisions,2 the Charter Township of Union Board finds that: 1) sexually oriented businesses featuring nudity and sexual activities produce negative secondary effects of increased crime rates, declining or depressed

property values, and a diminished sense of safety and security in members of the general public when walking in the vicinity of these businesses; 2) the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses can be reduced or minimized by dispersing the sexually oriented businesses and requiring minimum distances between the sexually oriented businesses; 3) the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses are exacerbated by close proximity to bars serving alcoholic beverages by the glass; 4) to minimize the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses on residential areas and the community at large, the sexually oriented businesses should be located a minimum distance away from any residential zoning district, school, church, or public park; 5) the zoning regulations allow for the location of sexually oriented businesses within specified zoning districts of the Charter Township of Union, and a reasonable number of sites legally are available to be acquired and used by sexually oriented businesses; 6) the negative secondary effects of public nudity, live nude performances, and the combination of nudity and businesses serving alcoholic beverages by the glass, can be minimized or eradicated by a local ordinance prohibiting public nudity as authorized by MCL 41.181, and the decisions of the United States Supreme Court;3 7) requiring dancers and other performers to wear a minimal amount of clothing, such as pasties and a g-string, in order to comply with the ordinance will have little or no effect on the expressive element of the performances; 8) the ordinance provisions prohibiting public nudity, live nude performances, and the combination of nudity and businesses serving alcoholic beverages by the glass are narrowly drawn to apply to businesses and performers that offer nude performances on a regular basis, excluding occasional nude performances from the purview of the ordinance.
1. Purpose. The purpose of these ordinance provisions is to define and regulate sexually oriented businesses, and to prohibit public nudity, in order to minimize or eradicate the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and public nudity. The zoning regulations are intended to define and disperse sexually oriented businesses, primarily regulating the location and site requirements of these businesses, but without any restriction on the content of communication protected by the First Amendment.
2. Conflict. The definitions and descriptions of sexually oriented businesses as permitted uses in the zoning ordinance provisions are subject to and limited by the prohibitions against public nudity and nudity in businesses licensed by the Michigan Liquor Control Commission.

Union Township 31-1 P.U.D. Planned
Zoning Ordinance Unit Development
SECTION 31 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (P.U.D.)
31.1 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (P.U.D.), AS DEFINED AND ALLOWED IN THE SUBSECTION BELOW:
Intent: The Planned Unit Development is a method by which creative large scale development of land is encouraged. The P.U.D. is a device that makes use of varying lot sizes and integrates different building structures. Typically, structures in these developments are clustered in such a manner as to achieve the same overall density that would be achieved if the developer had laid out the development in the conventional grid Zoning pattern. In addition to the clustered structures, open spaces are provided to ensure recreational facilities with different building types or land uses and thereby to achieve creativity, flexibility, and variety. Under this section any un-incorporated area in the Township and all proceedings in regard thereto, shall be done with consideration for maintenance of reasonable conditions regarding emission and transmission of injurious or obnoxious noise, vibration, gas, smoke, dust, litter, odor and light glare, traffic, congestion, drainage, lateral land support, effect on property values, light and air, overcrowding of persons, sanitation, general appearance of the area, and other similar considerations having an effect on public health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the surrounding community.
31.2 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS
It is hereby determined that through careful land use and site planning it is sometimes possible to develop substantial tracts of land for uses, and with structures and other facilities that are not fully in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance, nevertheless, are not harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare and, in fact, may be thought to improved efficiency of land uses, be beneficial thereto. It is in the public interest to provide regulations, as an alternative to the regulations otherwise provided in this Ordinance, to make possible such development and use while, at the same time, assuring that any such development and use is not harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare.
31.3 PROCEDURE
A. Final Development Plan: Development or improvement of lots or areas within said P.U.D. area, after approval and adoption of a preliminary development plan, shall be accomplished by submission to the Planning Commission of a final development plan. The final development plan shall include the following information as the Planning Commission finds reasonably necessary to consider said plan:
1. A plot plan based on an accurate survey showing location of present and proposed buildings and improvements; streets; railroads; lots; buildings; drives; parking lots; water and sewer lines; and topographical features, including contours at a workable interval; ditches; water courses; ground cover; and other pertinent physical features of the site.
2. A description of the proposed operation in sufficient detail to indicate the noise, smoke, odor, vibration, dust and dirt, noxious gases, glare and heat, fire hazards, industrial wastes, and traffic that may be produced by such operation.
3. Engineering and architectural plans for controlling problems of the type enumerated under Item 2, above, if deemed necessary by the developer or if required by the Planning Commission or their authorized representative.
Union Township 31-2 P.U.D. Planned
Zoning Ordinance Unit Development
4. Final development architectural sketches or general specifications as to the type of construction and material to be used in the proposed building.
5. The period of time within which the project will be completed.
6. Additional information that the Planning Commission or the Zoning Official may find reasonably necessary to evaluate the proposed development and its effect on surrounding areas.
All aspects of such plan that might have an adverse effect on public health, safety, and welfare, or upon values of nearby property, must be disclosed in the application for approval of such plan.
B. If the Planning Commission shall determine that the proposed use of the land, as shown on the final development plan, might have an enervating, debilitating, or offensive effect on adjacent properties; whether industrial, commercial, residential, or other through the effects of noise, smoke, odor, dust and dirt, noxious gases, glare and heat, vibrations, fire hazards, industrial wasted, traffic, or adverse aesthetic effects; they may require the owner, through the use of qualified technical persons and acceptable testing techniques, to demonstrate the devices that shall be utilized to control the factors determined to be offensive. Upon acceptance by the Planning Commission of such control devices, they shall be incorporated as a part of the final development plan.
C. The Planning Commission shall consider the final development plan and shall when appropriate, direct that specific changes be made to conform with the spirit, purpose, and intent of this Ordinance.
Final approval or disapproval of a final development plan shall be made by the Township Board. A copy of said final development plan, if finally approved, shall be forwarded to the Township Clerk for filing.
D. The Township Board and the Planning Commission are specifically authorized to require the recording of a plat in connection with any such application when such would be required by Act 288 of the Public Acts of 1967, as amended.
Both the Preliminary sketch review and the Final Plan Review shall be conducted after a Public Hearing as provided in Section 7.8.
