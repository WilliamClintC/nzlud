viability and/or functionability of an unoccupied building leading towards
and/or causing its eventual demolition due to decay and/or structural failure
and/or severe degradation over a period of time as a result of a general
lack of maintenance, and/or failure to secure the building from pests or

HOUSING CONVERSION AND EVICTION
§ 63-1. Findings and purpose.
§ 63-2. Definitions.
As used in this by-law, the definitions set forth in Section 3 of Chapter 527 of
the Laws of 1983 shall apply, unless the context clearly requires otherwise
or unless otherwise specified in this section of the by-law.
The Town of Lexington finds and declares that a serious public
emergency exists with respect to adequate housing for a substantial
number of its citizens due to the critical shortage of rental and
affordable housing within the Town. This shortage has been created and
exacerbated by the lack of sufficient new rental housing production,
by increases in financing and construction costs, and by increases in
the cost of real estate, substantially exceeding increases in personal
income. The emergency has also been created and severely aggravated
by the proposed conversion of rental housing into condominiums or
cooperatives; over 45% of Lexington's apartment rental housing stock
has been or is about to be converted into condominiums. Without
sufficient new rental production, such conversion necessarily reduces
the rental housing stock otherwise available. An increasing shortage
of rental housing accommodations, especially for the elderly, the
handicapped, single parent households, and persons and families of
low and moderate income, has been and will continue to result from
this emergency. Furthermore, there is an acute shortage of housing
for low and moderate income families, and the Town does not have
sufficient such housing units to prevent the application of the provisions
of General Laws Chapter 40B to it. Unless the available stock of rental
housing (and those who reside therein) receive more protection than
the law now affords, from the conversion of said housing
accommodations to condominiums and cooperatives, the rental housing
shortage will generate serious threats to the public health, safety and
general welfare of the citizens of the Town of Lexington, particularly to
the elderly, handicapped, and persons and families of low and moderate
income, as defined in Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983 and in the
Housing Element Comprehensive Plan of the Town of Lexington.
A.
Therefore, in order to address this emergency and to continue to
provide a sufficient supply of decent and affordable rental housing in
the Town of Lexington, it is necessary that the Town of Lexington, in
the exercise of its powers under Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983 and
the Home Rule Amendment of the Constitution of the Commonwealth,
further regulate the conversion of rental housing into condominiums
and cooperatives.

CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION BOARD  The citizen board which
administers this by-law.
CONVERSION  The recording of a master deed in order to make the initial
sale and transfer of title to a residential accommodation as one or more
condominium accommodations pursuant to an individual accommodation
deed or deeds or, in the case of a cooperative, an individual proprietary
lease or leases.
LOW OR MODERATE INCOME TENANT  A tenant who meets the
definition of a low or moderate income tenant as defined in Section 3 of
Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983 or a tenant whose income falls within
50% to 120% of the Boston SMSA median income (as calculated by the
Regional Economist, Boston Office, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development), at the time of the conversion.
OWNER  The individual who holds title to any housing accommodation
or any housing subject to conversion, including without limitation, a

a housing accommodation pursuant to a rental agreement written, oral,
express or implied, including a tenant at will.

Applicability of Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983. Owners shall be
required to comply with the provisions of Section 4 of Chapter 527
of the Acts of 1983 and the provisions of this by-law, which shall be
construed to be supplementary to the provisions of Chapter 527 of the
Acts of 1983. Any protection or benefits for tenants created by this bylaw
or conditions imposed by the Board for the protection and benefit
of tenants shall be in addition to, and not instead of, any benefits or
protection provided by any statute of the Commonwealth or by any
decision of any court.
A.
Conversion license required. No housing accommodation in the Town
shall be converted to a condominium or cooperative unless the owner
shall have first secured a license from the Condominium Conversion
Board. The Condominium Conversion Board shall have the authority
to grant licenses for the conversion of rental housing accommodations
to condominium or cooperative accommodations, provided that no
conversion of rental housing accommodations shall be licensed for the
earlier of a period of one year from the date of enactment of this by-law,
or until the Condominium Conversion Board has been appointed and
adopted its rules and regulations. Thereafter, no conversion of rental
housing shall be licensed until the Board, by written decision, grants a
license. The Board shall not refuse to grant a license, if the applicant
has complied with all requirements of federal, state, and local law and
regulations.

§ 63-4. Eviction license system.
License may be subject to reasonable conditions. The Board may make
the license subject to reasonable conditions for the protection of any
tenants.
The Board shall use the following factors in setting conditions to
the granting of a license:
(a) The protection of the public interest of the Town of Lexington;
The hardships imposed on the tenants residing in the
accommodations proposed to be converted;
(b)
The aggravation of the shortage of rental housing
accommodations in the Town, especially accommodations
suitable for families of low and moderate income persons,
for single parent households, for elderly, for handicapped or
for people on fixed incomes, which may result from the
conversion;
(c)
The hardship on the owner of the real estate to be converted
or to the purchaser of the unit;
(d)
Reasonable arrangements, made by the owner or third parties,
to alleviate the hardship on the tenants affected by the
proposed condominium conversion.
(e)
(1)
Scope of conditions. The conditions imposed may include (but are
not limited to) a time schedule for the sale of the individual
accommodations, a requirement that a reasonable percentage (not
less than 10% and not more than 20%) of the accommodations
be offered to the Lexington Housing Authority, Lexington Housing
Assistance Board, or a limited profit or non-profit legal entity on
such terms and conditions as will make the offeree eligible for state
or federal subsidies and as will make it economically feasible for
the unit to be purchased for rental to persons of low or moderate
income. Such units shall be permanently kept as rental
accommodations for low and moderate income persons.
(2)
C.
The provisions of this section apply only to elderly tenants, handicapped
tenants, and low or moderate income tenants, unless otherwise
explicitly stated.
A.
Pursuant to the authority vested in this Town by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the owner of a housing
accommodation shall be prohibited from instituting any condominium
or cooperative conversion eviction as defined in Chapter 527 of the
Acts of 1983, without first obtaining a license from the Condominium
Conversion Board. Further, the eviction of a tenant by any other person
who has purchased a housing accommodation shall be deemed a
condominium or cooperative conversion eviction, if the tenant was a
B.
§ 63-3 LEXINGTON CODE § 63-4
1:48
resident of the housing accommodation at the time that the master
deed for the housing accommodation was recorded pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 183A of the General Laws, or at the time that
the articles of organization for the cooperative were filed with the
Secretary of State.
The Board shall not license an eviction under this section until the
accommodation of the tenant subject to that eviction has been sold,
pursuant to the condominium master deed.
C.
The Condominium Conversion Board shall have the power to
promulgate rules and regulations for the enforcement of this section.
D.
The Board may not unreasonably withhold a license to evict, but may
make the granting of a license subject to reasonable terms and
conditions, which may include (but are not limited to):
Prohibiting the eviction for a period of time, not less than any
period of time to which the tenant is entitled under the provision
of any other law, court decision, regulation, or by-law and not more
than a period of five years from the date of the application for a
license to evict.
(1)
Requiring that the applicant for the eviction license give to the
tenant sought to be evicted an extension of the rental agreement
for a period of time, not less than any period of time to which
the tenant is entitled under the provision of any other law, court
decision, regulation, or by-law and not more than a period of
five years from the date of the application for a license to evict.
The provisions of such rental agreement may not otherwise be
modified, except with respect to the amount of annual rent, any
increase in which shall not exceed an amount equal to the sum
which would result by multiplying said rent by the percentage
increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers as
published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of
Labor Statistics, during the calendar year immediately preceding
the date upon which such rental agreement is commenced, or 10%,
whichever is less; provided, however, nothing herein shall limit the
right of a property owner to any amounts which may be due under
a valid escalation clause in the written lease.
(2)
E.
Any rent increase, imposition of new terms and conditions of the
tenancy, reduction or elimination of services, or other device used to
circumvent the protections of this section shall be invalid.
F.
Any condition or terms imposed by the Board with respect to a license
to evict shall be in addition to, and not instead of, any right, protection,
or benefit available to the tenant under any statute of the
Commonwealth or court decision.

relating to finances, health, age, and family problems (including the
importance of a child finishing school in Lexington).
(1)
(2) The availability of affordable housing for the tenant in Lexington.
(3) The housing situation of the owner of the unit in question.
H.
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, this section

A.
Terms of office. Members of the Conversion Board will serve without
compensation for three-year terms, except for the first year of
appointment when the Selectmen shall designate two members to have
three-year terms, two members to have two-year terms and one
member to have a one-year term. If the Board of Selectmen appoints an
existing board, official committee of the Town, commission or authority
to act as the Condominium Conversion Board, the terms of office of the
Condominium Conversion Board shall be coterminous with the terms of
office of such other board, committee, commission, or authority.
B.
Procedure and hearings. The Condominium Conversion Board shall
promulgate rules of procedure for the conduct of its business.

By furthering these purposes, to enhance public welfare by offering
current and potential Lexington residents a variety of

property owners in the proposed NCD Area and all property owners
within 100 feet of the proposed NCD Area, at the address for such
owners as listed in the then current real estate tax list of the Board of
Assessors. Following such public hearing, the Historical Commission,

open to all interested parties. Within one year of its appointment, the
Study Committee shall determine, by a supermajority of four positive
votes, whether an NCD is appropriate, and shall prepare and file with
the Historical Commission and the Planning Board a written report
explaining its decision. If the Study Committee determines that an NCD

Town not less than 14 days before the day of the hearing, by posting
such notice in a conspicuous place in the Town for a period of not less
than 14 days before the day of such hearing, and by conveying said
notice by certified mail to all property owners in the proposed NCD
Area and to property owners within 300 feet of the proposed NCD
Area, at the address for such owners as listed in the then current real
estate tax list of the Board of Assessors. Said notice shall state that
the report is available in the Planning Office and online at the Planning
Board and Historical Commission websites, and that property owners
in the proposed NCD Area may request a printed copy of the report
at the Planning Office. Said notice shall also include the procedure
and expiration date by which any property owner can elect, by right,
to exclude their property from an NCD designation that may occur
E.
§ 78-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 78-3
1:59
through this designation process. Each such property is herein called
an "opted out property."
Within 30 days of the close of the public hearing, but after the time
period for determining opted out properties has expired, the Historical
Commission and the Planning Board shall hold a joint meeting to
incorporate any changes based upon public input and eliminate
properties within the NCD Area from potential NCD inclusion.
If more than 25% of the properties in the NCD Area (one signature
per property) are opted out properties, then the Historical Commission
and Planning Board, acting jointly, may, at their option, redraw the
proposed boundaries of the NCD Area to exclude certain properties if it
results in a revised NCD Area that maintains the integrity of the study
findings and contains at least 75% of NCD study area properties. Only
if the original or revised NCD Area contains at least 75% of NCD study
area properties may the NCD designation go forward. In that case, the
Historical Commission and Planning Board, acting jointly, shall vote on
a recommendation for NCD designation. If the vote is to not recommend
an NCD designation, then the proposed designation shall be deemed
rejected.
If an NCD is favorably recommended by the Historical Commission and
the Planning Board, acting jointly, they shall prepare a Town Meeting
warrant article incorporating the NCD designation, area, regulations,
and guidelines, and forward it to the Selectmen for consideration at
Town Meeting. A positive majority vote by Town Meeting is required to
approve the NCD.
F.
Each NCD, as adopted by Town Meeting, shall identify its specific
regulations and guidelines, establishing the nature and scope of review
authority granted to the corresponding NCD Commission under this
bylaw for activities within the NCD, including, but not limited to,
selecting categories and types of construction or alteration that are
exempt from or subject to review. The regulations shall permit
accommodations for disability as required by the Fair Housing Act.
G.
The establishment of an NCD shall not be construed to prevent the
construction or alteration of a building or structure located in the NCD
under a building permit, zoning permit or other municipal approval duly
issued prior to the effective date of that NCD's establishment by Town
Meeting.
H.
Amendments to an NCD (including changes to regulations, guidelines,
and the boundaries of the affected NCD) may be proposed by petition
of 10 property owners, or for an NCD Area consisting of 14 or fewer
properties, two-thirds of the property owners in said area, in the NCD,
one signature per property, by the applicable NCD Commission, by the
Historical Commission, or by the Planning Board. Upon receipt of a
written request for any such amendment, the Historical Commission
shall hold a public hearing, notifying all property owners in the NCD

and all property owners within 100 feet of the NCD, at the address for
such owners as listed in the then current real estate tax list of the Board
of Assessors. Within 30 days of such public hearing, the Historical
Commission, by majority vote, shall determine whether the proposed
amendments would be appropriate and may, at its option, appoint a
Study Committee in the manner described in § 78-3C to prepare a
report with its recommendations. If the Historical Commission deems
that the proposed changes are within the scope of the original study, the
Historical Commission shall bring the proposed amendments to Town
Meeting for approval by majority vote. If the Historical Commission
finds that significant changes are being proposed, the process outlined
beginning in § 78-3D shall then be followed. [Amended 3-20-2017
ATM by Art. 35]
The dissolution of an NCD may be proposed by petition of property
owners in the NCD, one signature per property, that constitute 67%
of all property owners in the NCD. Upon receipt of a written request
for any such dissolution, the Historical Commission shall hold a public
hearing, notifying all property owners in the NCD, at the address
for such owners as listed in the then current real estate tax list of
the Board of Assessors. Within 30 days of such public hearing, the
Historical Commission, by majority vote, may, at its option, appoint a
Study Committee in the manner described in § 78-3C and shall prepare
a report with its recommendations. The Historical Commission shall
then forward an NCD bylaw dissolution article to the Selectmen for
consideration at Town Meeting for approval by majority vote.
J.
All expenses of notice and advertisement for the establishment,
modification, or dissolution of an NCD shall be borne by the petitioners.
Any petition shall be accompanied by an agreement to pay these
expenses.

§ 78-5 LEXINGTON CODE § 78-5
1:62
Review:
Any person proposing construction or alteration not exempt from
review shall first file an application with the NCD Commission for
a certificate of compatibility or certificate of hardship, in such form
as the NCD Commission may reasonably determine, together with
such plans, elevations, specifications, photographs, description of
materials, and other information as may be reasonably deemed
necessary by the NCD Commission to enable it to make a
determination on the application. The date of the filing of an
application shall be the date of the receipt of the completed
application by the NCD Commission.
(1)
Following submission of an application deemed complete by the
NCD Commission, the Chair of the NCD Commission shall
determine within 14 days whether the application involves features
that are subject to review by the Commission. If the Chair of
the NCD determines that the application is subject to review, the
NCD Commission shall hold a public hearing within 45 days of the
original filing date. Public notice of the time, place and purpose of
the hearing shall be given at least 14 days prior to the hearing date
by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town
and by conveying said notice to the applicant and all owners of
properties within 100 feet of the property, at the address for such
owners as listed in the then current real estate tax list of the Board
of Assessors, all at the expense of the applicant.
(2)
Following the close of the public hearing, the NCD Commission
shall determine whether the proposed construction or alteration
is compatible with the regulations and guidelines established for
that NCD. If the NCD Commission determines that the proposed
construction or alteration is compatible with the general
regulations and guidelines, it shall issue a certificate of
compatibility. If the NCD Commission determines that the
construction or alteration is not compatible, the NCD Commission
shall provide the applicant with a written statement of the reasons
for its disapproval. A certificate of hardship may be issued if the
NCD Commission determines that, owing to conditions especially
affecting the building or structure but not affecting the NCD
generally, failure to issue a certificate of compatibility would result
in a substantial hardship to the applicant and that such application
may be approved without substantial detriment to the public
welfare and without substantial derogation from the intent and
purposes of the NCD; provided that upon elimination of the
hardship condition, any incompatible construction or alteration
shall promptly be removed.
(3)
If the NCD Commission fails to issue a certificate or statement
of disapproval within 60 days after the filing of the application,
or such further time as the applicant may allow in writing, the
certificate shall be deemed granted.

Commissioner copies of all certificates issued by it as well as any
determinations of disapproval.
(5)
The regulations and guidelines for the NCD may provide that
certain categories or types of construction or alteration shall be
subject to advisory, nonbinding review by the NCD Commission,
or an owner may request such nonbinding review of an otherwise
exempt construction or alteration, in which event the review
procedures shall be followed, but without the NCD Commission
voting or rendering a binding determination.
(6)
In passing upon matters before it, the NCD Commission may consider,
among other things:
The architectural, aesthetic, cultural, economic, social or historical
value and significance of the particular buildings, structures or
settings affected, as well as the effects of the same on the NCD;

relative to nearby buildings and structures in the NCD, the type
of construction, style, the textures and materials of the features
involved in the proposed construction or alteration;

relationship to the street, topography, and existing vegetation,
including mature trees, of the particular site involved in the

things, allow for appropriate architectural diversity and encourage
the compatible updating, expansion and renovation of buildings and
structures in the NCD consistent with the distinctive characteristics of
the NCD.

§ 78-8. Revision of regulations and guidelines.
The NCD Commission shall meet periodically with the property owners in
the NCD for the purpose of determining whether the NCD regulations and
guidelines are still appropriate. The first of these meetings shall occur three
years from the date of the District's designation as an NCD, and shall occur
at no less than seven-year intervals thereafter.
§ 78-9. Judicial review, enforcement, and lapse.
If the NCD Commission has reason to believe, through visual inspection
or other means, that a building or structure in the NCD may be
undergoing demolition by neglect, then the NCD Commission shall
notify the Building Commissioner and the property owner, and the NCD
Commission and the Building Commissioner shall jointly hold a public
hearing to determine whether it is undergoing demolition by neglect,
which shall require the concurrence of the Building Commissioner. In
furtherance of determining its condition, the NCD Commission may,
at any time, request an inspection of the building or structure by the
Building Commissioner.
A.
If the NCD Commission and the Building Commissioner both determine
that the building or structure is undergoing demolition by neglect,
the NCD Commission and the Building Commissioner shall attempt
to negotiate a voluntary agreement with the property owner for
appropriate and timely repairs sufficient to structurally stabilize the
building or structure and prevent further deterioration.
B.
In the event that the NCD Commission and the Building Commissioner
both determine that they are not able to negotiate such an agreement
with the property owner, for any reason, or that the property owner
has agreed to undertake but has failed to satisfactorily complete such
repairs in a timely manner, then the NCD Commission and the Building
Commissioner may take such action as is permitted under § 78-9,
including seeking a court order that specific repairs be undertaken
to secure the building or structure against the elements, vandals and
vermin; to halt further deterioration; and to stabilize it structurally. The
NCD Commission may forbear from commencing an action in court for
any reason.
C.
Upon completion of all repairs that have been agreed upon between
the property owner and the NCD Commission and the Building
Commissioner or that have been ordered by the NCD Commission and
the Building Commissioner, or that have been ordered by the court, and
upon certification by the Building Commissioner that said repairs have
been completed, the NCD Commission shall certify that the building or
structure is no longer undergoing demolition by neglect.
D.
The Building Commissioner shall be charged with the enforcement
of this bylaw. The Building Commissioner is authorized to institute
any and all proceedings in law or equity, as he deems necessary and

§ 78-10. Existing bylaws not repealed.
Nothing contained in this bylaw shall be construed as repealing or
modifying any existing bylaw or regulation of the Town, but it shall be
in addition thereto. If this bylaw imposes greater restrictions upon the
construction or alteration of buildings, structures or settings than other
bylaws or provisions of law, such greater restrictions shall prevail.
appropriate to obtain compliance with the requirements of this by law,
or to prevent violation thereof.
Anyone found in violation of this chapter may be fined not more than
$300 for each day such violation continues, each day constituting a
separate offense. No building permit shall be issued with respect to any
premises upon which a building or structure subject to the provisions
of this bylaw has been voluntarily altered or demolished in violation of
this bylaw for a period of two years after the date of the completion of
such demolition or alteration or the date by which the NCD Commission
and the Building Commissioner both have determined that a building
is undergoing demolition by neglect, whichever date is later, except
pursuant to the issuance of a building permit pursuant to an agreement
reached under § 78-7B, or as otherwise agreed to by the NCD
Commission and the Building Commissioner. As used herein "premises"
includes the parcel of land upon which the demolished building or
structure was or is located. [Amended 3-20-2017 ATM by Art. 35]
B.
Any party aggrieved by a determination of the NCD Commission may,
within 20 days after the filing of the notice of such determination
with the Building Commissioner, file a written request with the NCD
Commission for a review by a joint meeting of the Historical
Commission and Planning Board. The Historical Commission and
Planning Board shall hold a public hearing within 45 days of the
request. Public notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing
shall be given at least 14 days prior to the hearing date by publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town and by conveying
said notice to the applicant and all owners of properties within 100 feet
of the property, at the address for such owners as listed in the then
current real estate tax list of the Board of Assessors, all at the expense
of the party aggrieved. The findings of this joint hearing, which may
sustain or overrule the prior decision of the NCD Commission, shall
be filed with the Building Commissioner within 60 days of the request,
and shall be binding on the applicant and the joint committee, unless a
further appeal is sought in a court with jurisdiction.
C.
Certificates of compatibility and certificates of hardship shall expire in
18 months, plus such time as may be required to pursue or await the
determination of a judicial review as provided above, from their date of
issuance, if construction has not begun by such date. Notwithstanding
the above, the NCD Commission may grant one or more extensions, of
up to six months each, if there are unavoidable delays.

encourage Construction and Alteration that complements and is
compatible with those Buildings and Structures, and their Setting and
character;
B.
To provide residents and property owners with the opportunity to
participate in planning the future and dynamic improvement of the
Turning Mill neighborhood;
C.
To promote wider public knowledge and appreciation for the Turning
Mill neighborhood by serving as an information resource on the history
of the neighborhood and on compatible materials, methods, and options

Zoning Bylaw of the Town of Lexington. For the purposes of establishing
the setback area in which the provisions of this article shall apply, the
measurement shall be from any point on any property line of the lot, to
points along an imaginary line drawn representing the setback area as
specified.
§ 78-14. Turning Mill NCD Commission.

ARTICLE III
Pierce-Lockwood Neighborhood Conservation District
[Adopted 4-11-2018 ATM by Art. 40]
§ 78-16. Purpose.
Pursuant to Chapter 78, Article I, of the Code of the Town of Lexington,
this article describes the regulations and procedures associated with the
administration of the Pierce-Lockwood Neighborhood Conservation District
("PLNCD"). The goals of the PLNCD are to preserve the architectural style
and general size of the homes, and to emphasize the role the PLNCD played
in the historical development of Lexington. The goals can best be described
with the words, "coherence," "proportion," and "aesthetics."
Coherence is defined as having a sense of logical interconnectedness,
consistency and harmony among parts. There is a balance between a home's
uniqueness and its commonality with surrounding houses. This balance is
vital to the neighborhood's identity. Architectural changes should maintain
a harmony among parts, as well as a consistency with the architectural style
of the surrounding homes.
Proportion is defined as having a comparative proper relation between
elements or magnitudes such as size, quantity, ratio and number. A change
in size leading to a large massing in relation to the size of surrounding
Buildings and Structures means, taken as a whole, the Building or Structure
is out of proportion to the neighborhood. Further, an addition that creates a
change in size may detract from the original shape, affecting its aesthetics.
A neighborhood's sense of beauty is indeed its homes' uniqueness within
commonality and includes considerations such as architectural style, shape,
original windows, open porches and landscaping that fits within the natural
beauty surrounding the Pierce-Lockwood NCD. It is defined by the history
of the area, its relationship to the East Village Historic District and to
historical Lexington.
§ 78-17. Definitions.
The following terms shall mean as follows when used in this article. All
Capitalized terms not defined in this article are used as defined in Chapter

(1)
Architectural features such as windows, front doors, exterior
siding, garage doors, and roofing materials should be replaced
in kind; chosen for consistency with original design; or, at least,

arrangement, and composition of its elements on the distinctive
character of the PLNCD.
(3)
The effect on the cohesiveness of the PLNCD with respect to the
scale and massing of the proposed changes relative to nearby
Buildings and Structures in the PLNCD.
(4)
The type of construction, style, textures and materials of the
features involved in the proposed Construction or Alteration.
Limiting the size and mass of any proposed additions, with or
without previous additions, is encouraged.
(5)
Changes in the orientation of a Building or Structure will be
discouraged.
(6)

§ 78-22. Historic District Commission.
Owners of properties within the PLNCD that are also in Lexington's East
Village Historic District may seek approval for Construction, Alteration, or
Demolition that triggers thresholds of either or both this bylaw or the laws
and regulations applicable to Lexington's Historic Districts and subsequent
review by the Commission and/or the Lexington Historic Districts
Commission. Applicants to the Commission that have undergone review
and received a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Lexington Historic
Districts Commission may submit such paperwork and plans to the
Commission as part of any application hereunder.
Attached garages and increasing the amount of paved surface will
be discouraged.
(7)
The Setting and landscape characteristics, including their
relationship to the street, topography, and existing vegetation,
including mature trees, of the particular site involved in the
Construction or Alteration, as well as the effect of same on the
PLNCD. Proposed additions that will shade abutting properties will
be discouraged, such as, for example, precluding the use of yards
for gardens, or shading existing windows or porches.
(8)
For demolitions, the Building, Structure, or Setting proposed to
replace those demolished.
(9)
In making its determination, the Commission shall, among other things,
allow for appropriate architectural diversity and encourage the
compatible updating, expansion and restoration of Buildings and
Structures in the PLNCD consistent with the distinctive characteristics
of the PLNCD.
B.
Although not used as decision-making criteria, the following are
suggested additional guidelines for consideration when planning
Alterations to Buildings, Structures or Settings within the PLNCD:
Discussion with abutters concerning the installation of all allowable
fences is encouraged. Hedges, split rail or picket fences may be
acceptable fencing options.
(1)
If trees must be removed, the replanting of native trees is
encouraged, except where shading will have a negative impact on
abutters.

marine and other wildlife through ingestion and entanglement; clogging
storm drainage systems; littering Lexington's streets, parks, public places,

recycling facilities; requiring the use of millions of barrels of crude oil
nationally for their manufacture.

to a customer at the point of sale. Checkout bags shall not include bags,

retail or grocery store.

gross floor area is devoted to the sale of food products for home preparation
and consumption, which typically also offers home care and personal care
products.

merchandise within a building.
REUSABLE CHECKOUT BAG  A bag, with handles, that is specifically
designed for multiple use and is made of thick plastic, cloth, fabric or other
durable materials excluding polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride.
THIN-FILM SINGLE-USE PLASTIC BAGS  Typically with plastic handles,
these are bags with a thickness of less than 2.25 mils and are intended for
single-use transport of purchased products.

private ways in the Town as provided in this section. The making of any
A.
§ 100-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 100-13
1:105
such temporary repairs to private ways, no matter how often or to what
extent, does not constitute an acceptance by the Town of such ways as
public ways, nor does it constitute a way being "maintained and used as
a public way" under the Massachusetts Subdivision Control Law.
Type and extent of repairs. Repairs shall be limited to grading,
patching, and the layering of gravel to establish a uniform grade,
make drainage repairs, accommodate the Town's emergency vehicles
or otherwise protect or repair the Town's infrastructure.
B.
Public necessity. There shall be a finding of public necessity for said
repairs by the Board of Selectmen in consultation with the Director of
Public Works.
C.
Petition process. The Selectmen may make a determination of the need
for said repairs and may authorize the making of said repairs with
or without a petition of the abutters to said private way. However,
the Selectmen will not entertain a petition from the abutters unless:
(a) it is signed by 51% of the abutters along the private way to be
repaired, or (b) if a majority of abutters to the private way are members
of an association of landowners specific to said way and a majority
vote of that association's membership or board of directors submits the
petition.
D.
Scope of work. The scope of the repair work shall be determined
by the Director of Public Works, subject to approval by the Board of
Selectmen.
E.
Betterments. Betterment charges may be assessed by the Selectmen on
the abutter(s) of such way up to an amount equal to the cost of such
repairs. If betterments are to be assessed, they shall be assessed upon
each parcel of land benefiting from such repair by any method as may
be approved by the Selectmen. Betterments shall be apportioned over
such a period as the Selectmen deem appropriate, after considering
such matters as the estimated useful life of the proposed repairs and
the source of funds to be used for the same.
F.
Funding. Repairs funded under this section through betterments shall
be appropriated at any Special or Annual Town Meeting. The Selectmen
are authorized to seek contributions for a portion of the cost of said
repairs from abutters and the Selectmen may, in their discretion,
require a cash deposit from the abutters.
G.
Town's liability. The Town shall have no liability as a result of any such
repairs under MGL c. 40, § 6N(f). The Selectmen may also request
arrangements to be made to further reduce or eliminate potential
liability risks to the Town arising from the repairs. Such arrangements
may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the provision of
insurance by repair contractors and/or by abutters or associations of
abutters insuring the Town's interests or the provision of suitable
indemnity agreement by abutters or by associations of abutters.

(1)
A.
§ 110-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 114-1
1:109
§ 114-2. Definitions.
The definitions contained herein apply to the interpretation and
implementation of this chapter. Terms not defined in this section shall
be construed according to their customary and usual meaning unless the
context indicates a special or technical meaning. Additional definitions may
be adopted by separate regulation.
ALTER  Any activity that will measurably change the ability of a ground
surface area to absorb water or will change existing surface drainage
patterns. "Alter" may be similarly represented as "alteration of drainage
characteristics," and "conducting land disturbance activities."
Establish a mechanism by which the Town can meet the
requirements of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) general permit.
(2)
Compatibility with other permit and bylaw requirements. This chapter
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other bylaw,
rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements
of this chapter should be considered minimum requirements, and
where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from
those imposed by any other bylaw, rule or regulation, or other provision
of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher
protective standards for human health or the environment shall be
considered to take precedence.
B.
Adoption. This chapter is adopted under authority granted by the Home
Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution, the Home Rule
Statutes, and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Federal Clean
Water Act found at 40 CFR 122.34, and as authorized by the residents
of the Town of Lexington under Article 30 at the Annual Town Meeting
of 2008.
C.

part of the Stormwater Management Regulations.
D.
Penalties. Any person violating this chapter is subject to any applicable
penalties or other legal enforcement action by the Town.
E.
Appeals. The decisions or orders of the Stormwater Agency shall be
final. Further relief of a decision by the Stormwater Agency made under
this chapter shall be reviewable in the Superior Court in an action filed
within 60 days thereof, in accordance with MGL c. 249, § 4.

§ 114-1 LEXINGTON CODE § 114-2
1:110
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs)  Structural, nonstructural, and
managerial techniques that are recognized to be the most effective and
practical means to prevent and/or reduce increases in stormwater volumes
and flows, reduce point source and nonpoint source pollution, and promote
stormwater quality and protection of the environment.
DEVELOPMENT  Any alteration, construction, disturbance, improvement
or modification of land or structures to accommodate a use, expansion of
use or redevelopment on a site.
LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)  A set of strategies that seek to
maintain natural hydrologic systems both during and after the development
process. This approach is implemented by engineering a site so that the
post-development hydrologic functions remain close to predevelopment
conditions by using design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate
and detain stormwater runoff close to its source.
MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM (MS4)  A conveyance or
system of conveyances (including roads with drainage systems, municipal
streets, catch basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man-made channels, or storm
drains) designed or used for collecting or conveying stormwater, which is
not a combined sewer, that is owned or operated by a city or town having
jurisdiction over disposal of sewage, industrial wastes, stormwater, or other
wastes, that discharges to waters of the United States.
NATIONAL POLLUTION DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM (NPDES) 
As authorized by the Federal Clean Water Act, the NPDES permit program
controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge
pollutants into waters of the United States.
RUNOFF  A term used to describe the water from rain, snowmelt or
irrigation that flows over the land surface and is not absorbed into the
ground, instead flowing into streams or other surface waters or land
depressions.
SITE  The parcel of land being developed or a designated planning area
in which the land development project is located.
STORMWATER  Water that accumulates on land because of storms, and
can include runoff from urban areas such as roads and roofs.
STORMWATER AGENCY  The Town's Department of Public Works
Engineering Division is designated to administer, implement and enforce
this chapter.
STORMWATER AUTHORITY  The entity responsible for adopting
regulations pursuant to this chapter.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT  The use of structural or nonstructural
practices that are designed to reduce and control stormwater runoff
pollutant loads, discharge volumes and/or peak flow discharge rates.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PERMIT  A permit issued by the
Stormwater Agency, after review of an application, plans, calculations, and
other supporting documents, approving a system that is designed to protect
§ 114-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 114-2
1:111
the environment of the Town from the deleterious effects of uncontrolled
and untreated stormwater runoff.
§ 114-3. Regulation of discharges to municipal storm sewer system.
§ 114-4. Regulation of stormwater management practices.
Prohibited activities. The prohibition of illicit connections and
discharges to the municipal storm sewer system is necessary for the
protection of local water bodies and groundwater and to safeguard
public safety, health and welfare.
Illicit discharges. No person shall dump, discharge, cause or allow
to be discharged any pollutant or nonstormwater discharge into the
municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4), into a watercourse,
or into the waters of the commonwealth.
(1)
Illicit connections. No person shall construct, use, allow, maintain
or continue any connection to the municipal storm sewer system,
except as exempted in Subsection B below.
(2)
Obstruction of the municipal storm sewer system. No person shall
obstruct or interfere with the normal flow of stormwater into or out
of the municipal storm sewer system without prior written approval
from the Stormwater Authority.

the MS4 including surface drainage or piping that crosses private
property if it serves the public as part of the drainage system.
(4)
A.
Exemptions. Stormwater discharges that are wholly subject to
jurisdiction under the Wetlands Protection Act or the Wetland
Protection Code of Lexington22 and demonstrate compliance with the
Massachusetts Storm Water Management Standards as most recently
revised and updated in accordance with revisions to the wetlands
regulations, 310 CMR 10.00, and as reflected in an order of conditions
or in a determination of applicability issued by the Conservation
Commission are exempt from compliance with this section of the
chapter.
B.
Applicability. This chapter shall be applicable to the following activities:
Any activity that results in a land disturbance greater than one
acre of land, or any activity that disturbs less than one acre if
that project is part of a larger common plan of development that
eventually will disturb more than one acre of land; or

40 or more members rising in their places for that purpose
or substantive change(s) of the rules are defined by the

business shall be required to constitute a quorum, except for a motion to
adjourn for which no quorum shall be required; provided, however, that no
vote carrying the expenditure or appropriation of any sum of money shall
be held to be invalid by reason of lack of the required quorum, unless it
appears from the records of the Town Clerk of the meeting that before the
result of such vote was declared the question of the presence of a quorum
was duly raised and that such record shows that the required quorum was
lacking.
§ 118-19. Further rules of procedure.

herein provided for shall be governed by "Roberts' Rules of Parliamentary
Practice" so far as they are applicable and are not inconsistent with the

TREES
§ 120-1. Findings.
The Town of Lexington finds that mature trees have aesthetic appeal,
contribute to the distinct character of certain neighborhoods, improve air
quality, provide glare and heat protection, reduce noise, aid in the
stabilization of soil, provide natural flood- and climate-control, create
habitats for wildlife, enhance property values and provide natural privacy
to neighbors.
§ 120-2. Intent and purpose.
This bylaw is enacted for the purpose of preserving and protecting both
public shade trees pursuant to General Law Chapter 87 and certain trees
on portions of private property. To achieve these purposes, this bylaw
establishes a Tree Committee and empowers the Committee, in conjunction
with the Tree Warden, to regulate the removal and replacement of trees in
certain circumstances, and to promote the planting and protection of trees
throughout the Town. It is desirable that the Town plant more trees than are
removed to compensate for tree losses and the length of time to maturity.
The provisions of this bylaw, when pertaining to private property, apply only
when there is major construction or demolition as defined below and only
within setback areas.
§ 120-3. Definitions.
When used in this bylaw, the following definitions shall apply:

harmful effects, the Commission may consider the likely long-term effects of
the proposed work as well as the likely effects of the proposed work when
taken in conjunction with any prior work and any contemplated future work
in the affected area. Failure to provide to the Conservation Commission
adequate evidence for it to determine that the proposed work will not cause
significant harm to the interest sought to be protected by this by-law shall
be sufficient cause for the Conservation Commission to deny such permit or
to grant such permit with such conditions as it deems reasonably necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this by-law or to postpone or
continue the hearing to another date certain to enable the applicant and
others to present additional evidence, upon such terms and conditions as
seems to the Commission to be just.

2.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS 2.3
1:149
2.3. ZONING MAP.
General. Zoning districts are shown on a map entitled "Zoning Map
of the Town of Lexington" (the Zoning Map) prepared by the Planning
Board and on file in the offices of the Town Clerk and the Planning
Board. The district boundaries shown on the Zoning Map are part of
this bylaw. Changes to the Zoning District boundaries are made the
same way as amendments to the text of the Zoning Bylaw are made.
The Zoning Map may include geographical features, streets, notations,
and such other information to keep the map current and to facilitate
orientation.
2.3.1
Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries
between zoning districts are shown on the Zoning Map. If there is
any difference between the boundary of a zoning district as shown
on the Zoning Map and the perimeter description in the vote of the
Town Meeting establishing or amending said boundary, the vote of the
Town Meeting governs. In the case of uncertainty regarding a district
boundary voted by Town Meeting, the following rules apply:
Where the district boundary is indicated as a street, highway,
railroad right-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary is the
center line of the street, highway, railroad right-of-way, or utility
easement.
1.
Where the district boundary is parallel to a street, highway,
railroad right-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary is parallel
to it and, unless otherwise shown, 100 feet from its center line.
2.
Where the district boundary is shown as following a watercourse,
the boundary coincides with its center line.
3.
Where the district boundary is shown as following the shoreline of
a body of water, or of a contour line, the boundary is the elevation
above the datum mean sea level of such body of water, or contour.
4.
Where the district boundary is shown as the extension of another
district boundary line, the boundary is its straight-line extension.
5.
If not resolved by the subsections above, the locations of the
district boundaries are to be determined by the distances, if given,
from other lines or features on the Zoning Map, or, if distances are
not given, then by the scale of the Zoning Map.
6.
If, after the application of the rules in the subsections above,
uncertainty still exists with respect to the boundaries of a district,
the Building Commissioner shall make a determination after
seeking the advice of the Planning Board.

SECTION 135-3.0
USE REGULATIONS
3.1. PRINCIPAL USES.
General. No land may be used, and no structure erected or used except
in compliance with the provisions of this bylaw as set forth in Table 1,
Permitted Uses and Development Standards, or as permitted elsewhere
in this bylaw. Uses not listed in Table 1 are prohibited. More than
one principal use is allowed on a lot if each principal use is permitted
by Table 1 and the sum of the principal uses complies with the other
requirements of this bylaw.
3.1.1
Overlay Districts. The use of land in overlay zoning districts is subject
to the regulations of the base zoning district and the additional
requirements of the overlay district, as described in § 135-7.0.
3.1.2
Planned Commercial and Planned Residential Districts. Planned
Development Districts are subject to the preliminary site development
and use plan approved by Town Meeting, as provided in § 7.3.
3.1.3
More Than One Classification. Where a use, structure, development,
or activity may be classified under more than one of the uses in Table
1, the more specific classification applies. If equally specific, the more
restrictive classification is used.
3.1.4
Compliance with Development and Operating Standards. In several
sections of Table 1, there are also development and operating standards
for the permitted uses. A use, building, activity, or development must
comply with all applicable standards. Failure to comply with any one
of the standards will be the basis for denial of a building permit or
certificate of occupancy. Failure to continue to comply with any of
the standards will be the basis for revocation of the certificate of
occupancy.
3.1.5
Banks and Credit Unions and Real Estate Sales or Rentals in CB District
Storefronts. [Added 3-25-2015 ATM by Art. 53; amended
4-11-2016 ATM by Art. 43]
Purpose. Lexington Center is a place in which shops, workplaces,
schools, historic attractions, housing, open space, and civic
facilities intimately co-exist to create an active retail and cultural
destination with an identifiable sense of place. It is in the public
interest that the Town protect and enhance the vibrancy of the
Central Business District by creating a supportive environment for
a diverse group of uses throughout the Center, and regulating the
use of the limited first floor storefront area and frontage of the
Central Business District is necessary to achieve this goal.
1.
Special Permit Review Criteria. In addition to the criteria detailed
in § 135-9.4.2, as a precondition to allowing the establishment,
relocation, or expansion of a banking or credit union or real estate

3.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS 3.1
1:151
service use (Line H.1.05 and Line H.1.04 respectively in the Table
of Uses) in the Central Business District, the SPGA must also find
that the applicant has satisfied the specific criteria listed below:
The granting of the special permit will advance the goals
expressed in § 3.1.6.1 above;
a.
The proposed use in the proposed location is in the public
interest;
b.
The proposed use will not create an undue concentration of
these uses in the immediate area;
c.
The proposed use will maintain hours and days of operation
and an active storefront consistent with other retail uses in the
Central Business District;
d.
The proposed length of the storefront will not exceed the
average length of other storefronts in the Central Business
District;
e.
The proposed first floor square footage will not exceed the
average size of other storefronts in the Central Business
District; and
f.
As part of providing a visually engaging storefront, the interior
area of the property adjacent to the storefront must be a space
dedicated for patrons and shall not be used for office, cubicle,
conference, or storage areas.
g.
The SPGA may waive strict compliance with criteria 2e and 2f
above, where such action is in the public interest and consistent
with the intent and purpose of this bylaw.
3.
[Added 10-18-2017 STM by Art. 4]
Definition. "Marijuana establishment" shall mean "a marijuana
cultivator, marijuana testing facility, marijuana product
manufacturer, marijuana retailer or any other type of licensed
marijuana-related business."
1.
Purpose. By vote at the State election on November 8, 2016, the
voters of the Commonwealth approved a law entitled the
"Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act" (the "Act"), regulating
the control and production and distribution of marijuana under a
system of licenses and regulations. Currently under the Zoning
Bylaw, a marijuana retailer or establishment is not a permitted
use in the Town. Regulations promulgated by the Cannabis Control
Commission are expected to provide guidance to the Town in
regulating marijuana sales and distribution. The regulation of
marijuana raises novel and complex legal, planning, and public
safety issues and the Town needs time to study and consider the
regulation of marijuana retail or distribution centers and address
2.
3.1.7
3.1 LEXINGTON CODE 3.1
1:152
3.2. ACCESSORY USES.
3.3. TEMPORARY USES.
such novel and complex issues, as well as to address the potential
impact of the State regulations on local zoning and to undertake
a planning process to consider amending the Zoning Bylaw
regarding regulation of marijuana retail sales and distribution and
other uses related to the regulation of marijuana. The Town intends
to adopt a temporary moratorium on the use of land and structures
in the Town for marijuana retail and distribution so as to allow the
Town sufficient time to engage in a planning process to address
the effects of such structures and uses in the Town and to enact
bylaws in a manner consistent with sound land use planning goals
and objectives.
Temporary moratorium. For the reasons set forth above and
notwithstanding any other provision of the Zoning Bylaw to the
contrary, the Town hereby adopts a temporary moratorium on the
use of land or structures for marijuana establishments. The
moratorium shall be in effect through December 31, 2018. During
the moratorium period, the Town shall undertake a planning
process to address the potential impacts of marijuana in the Town,
consider the Cannabis Control Commission regulations regarding
marijuana establishments and related uses, and shall consider
adopting new Zoning Bylaws to address the impact and operation
of marijuana establishments and related uses.
3.
General. Any use or structure not listed as an accessory use in Table 1
is permitted as an accessory use provided it is a use or structure that
is customary and incidental to a principal use or structure permitted
by Table 1, conforms to all other provisions of this bylaw, and complies
with all other Town bylaws or General Laws.
3.2.1
Limit on Size of Accessory Uses. An accessory use may not occupy more
than 25% of the area of a lot or more than 25% of the gross floor area on
a lot. This limitation does not apply to off-street parking, or to accessory
apartments, which are governed by other provisions of this bylaw.
3.2.2
General. A building permit, certificate of occupancy, or a special permit
may be granted for a temporary use or structure, for a specific period,
where authorized by this bylaw.
3.3.1
Time Periods for Temporary Uses. The maximum time for temporary
uses or structures permitted by right is two years. The maximum time
for temporary uses or structures permitted by a finding of the Building
Commissioner is three months. The maximum time for temporary uses
or structures for which a special permit is required is two years.
Temporary uses or structures may be, by finding of the SPGA, extended
one additional year. A temporary use may be recurrent provided it is for

a time of not more than one month and the time between the issuance
of permit for a recurrent temporary uses is at least two months.
Relaxation of Dimensional and Other Standards. Permits for temporary
uses or structures may authorize the temporary relaxation of the
dimensional standards of Table 2 where it can be demonstrated it is not
feasible or practical to comply with those standards.

4.2. DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS.
Applicability. Each use, building, or structure must comply with the
standards described in Table 2, Schedule of Dimensional Controls,27
except where provided otherwise by this bylaw.
4.1.1
Lots in More Than One District. When a lot is divided by a district line
and proposed to be used for a building or use that is not permitted by
right in both districts (in Lexington or not), such building or use must
comply with the dimensional standards of § 135-4.0, as if the district
boundary line were a lot line.
4.1.2
Lots Located in More than One Municipality. When a lot is partially
in the Town of Lexington and partially in an adjacent municipality, the
provisions of this bylaw are applied to the part of the lot in Lexington
as if the entire lot were in Lexington.
4.1.3
One Dwelling Per Lot. More than one dwelling on a lot is prohibited,
unless specifically authorized by other provisions of this bylaw.
4.1.4
Change in Lot That Results in Noncompliance. No conforming lot may
be changed to make it nonconforming.
4.2.1
Lot Regularity. No structure may be erected on any lot that does not
have an area in which a circle, the diameter of which is 80% of the
minimum lot frontage, tangent to the lot frontage and within all other
lot lines, may be located.
4.2.2
Developable Site Area. No dwelling may be erected on any lot that does
not contain a contiguous developable site area that is at least 90% of
the minimum lot area for the district in which the lot is located.
4.2.3
Lot Frontage.
Minimum Lot Frontage Required. Every lot must have at least the
minimum frontage set forth in Table 228 for the district in which
the lot is located on a street, as defined in the Zoning Bylaw.
Frontage on unaccepted ways in existence prior to the adoption of
the subdivision control law must receive a favorable determination
from the Planning Board. Ways laid out, but not constructed, may
not be used as frontage.
1.
Designation of Frontage Street. When a lot is bounded by more
than one street, any one of them, but only one, must be designated

as the frontage street, provided the street meets the requirements
for minimum lot frontage described in this bylaw. In the case of
a lot bounded by two streets forming an interior angle of more
than 135°, their combined frontage may be used to satisfy the lot
frontage requirement.
Measurement of Lot Frontage. Frontage is measured in a
continuous line along the sideline of the street right-of-way
between the points of intersection of the side lot lines with the
street right-of-way line. The measurement of lot frontage excludes
jogs in the street width, backup strips and other irregularities in
the street line. In the case of a corner lot, the owner may extend
to the midpoint of the curve connecting street lines, instead of to
their intersection.
3.
Access. An owner must provide a means of access for vehicles
from the frontage street to a principal building for emergency
services, for deliveries, and for off-street parking. Alternatively, the
owner may provide the access from another street provided it can
be demonstrated that it is both physically and legally possible to
provide access from the designated frontage street.
4.
Frontage Reduction on Curves. Where more than half of the lot
frontage is on a circular turnaround, or on a curve of less than
one-hundred-foot radius, frontage may be reduced to not less than
60% of the distance required in Table 2 if the distance between the
side lot lines, measured along the arc parallel to the street line at
the same distance from the street line as the front yard setback
required by Table 2, is not less than the minimum lot frontage
required by Table 2.
5.
Frontage on Turnaround in CRO Districts. In CRO Districts where
a lot abuts on a dead-end turnaround part of a street and also
abuts on such street before the turnaround, the frontage may be
measured in part along the street line before the turnaround and
in part along a projection of the course of such street line through
and beyond the turnaround, provided that the lot has frontage of
not less than 60 feet on the street, including such turnaround.
6.
Structures Below Ground. Where the upper elevation of a structure or
building is below the elevation of the natural grade, and such structure
is covered by earth to a depth sufficient to support vegetation, such
structure may be located in a required front, side or rear yard, but no
closer than five feet to a lot line. Open grates or small ventilation shafts
servicing the part of the structure below ground may be located in the
required yard.
4.2.5
Structures Other than Buildings. The maximum height, in feet, for
structures other than buildings may not exceed the maximum height for

buildings as set forth in Table 2.29 Structures other than buildings may
be located in a required front, rear or side yard provided the height
of the structure is not greater than its horizontal distance from the lot
line, except that:
A fence or wall not greater than six feet in height (except that a
supporting post may be not more than six feet, six inches in height)
may be located on or closer to a lot line than six feet; and
1.
2. A sign, permitted under § 5.2, may be located in a front yard.
Structures on a Building. Structures erected on a building and not used
for human occupancy may exceed the maximum height of a building in
feet provided no part of the structure is more than 20 feet higher than
the upper elevation of the building and the total horizontal coverage of
such structures on the building does not exceed 25%.
4.3.2
Calculating Height for Segmented Buildings. Where a building is on
a sloping site or has some stories that do not extend for the full
building coverage, the height in feet and number of stories of the
several elements of the building may be computed separately provided
that neither the maximum height in feet nor the number of stories in
any one element exceeds that permitted by Table 2.
4.3.3
Special Permit. The SPGA may grant a special permit for structures, but
not buildings, to exceed the maximum height in feet otherwise allowed
by § 4.3, or the percentage of horizontal coverage of structures erected
on a building specified above, provided it makes a determination that
the structure is compatible with the scale of the neighborhood and does
not intrude on the solar access of any adjoining lot.
4.3.4
Height of Dwellings Near Lot Lines. The height of a one-family or twofamily
dwelling may not exceed the maximum height from Table 2 or 20
feet plus 4/3 times the smallest distance from the dwelling to a lot line,
whichever is less. [Added 3-30-2016 ATM by Art. 39]
4.3.5
Purpose. Lexington seeks to have a socially and economically diverse
community, both over the whole of the community and within its
neighborhoods. In support of that fundamental social goal, a basic
housing goal is to provide housing opportunities supportive of the
population diversity we seek. The Town encourages small- and mediumsized
housing stock, in the interest of providing diverse housing sizes
throughout the Town, § 4.4 limits the massing of buildings, which may
impact owners of abutting properties, the streetscape, landscape, and
the character of the neighborhood and Town.

5.1. OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure that any use of land
involving the arrival, departure, or storage of motor vehicles, and all
structures and uses requiring the delivery or shipment of goods, be
designed and operated to:
Promote traffic safety by assuring adequate places for storing of
motor vehicles off the street, and for their orderly access and
egress to and from the public street;
1.
Increase the traffic-carrying capacity of streets and highways in the
Town and obtain a more efficient utilization of on-street curbside
parking;
2.
3. Reduce hazards to pedestrians upon public sidewalks;
Protect adjoining lots and the general public from nuisances and
hazards such as: (i) Noise, glare of headlights, dust and fumes
resulting from the operation of motor vehicles; (ii) Glare and heat
from parking lots; (iii) A lack of visual relief from expanses of
paving; and (iv) Accelerated runoff of surface water from land
covered by impervious materials.
4.
5.1.1
Applicability. No building permit or certificate of occupancy may be
issued for the erection of a new building, the enlargement or increase
in the net floor area of an existing building, the development of a use
not located in a building, or the change from one type of use to another
which has a different parking or loading requirement as set forth in the
parking and loading tables, unless off-street parking spaces and loading
bays are provided in accordance with this section.
5.1.2
Parking and Loading Plan Required. Each application for a building
permit, special permit, certificate of occupancy, or petition for a
variance must be accompanied by an off-street parking and loading
plan. Such plan must contain the information required in the permitting
authority's rules and regulations. Where necessary, the permit
authority may require that the owner or operator of a use, building,
or establishment furnish a statement as to the number of employees
working at the lot or establishment, or the number of motor vehicle
trips (by type of motor vehicle) that are made to and from the use,
building or establishment.

Rules for Interpretation of the Parking and Loading Tables.
Where the number of spaces is expressed as a ratio to dwelling
units, floor area, beds, employees, etc., any fraction thereof shall
require one parking space, but after the first such parking space
or loading bay, only a fraction of 1/2 or greater shall require an
additional space or bay.
1.
Where the requirement is stated "as needed," the applicant for
a permit shall estimate the number of parking spaces or loading
bays required to serve the use and shall provide such number; the
permitting authority shall verify that the number is adequate and
shall, if necessary, order that additional spaces or bays be provided.
2.
To simplify the determination of net floor area, 80% of the gross
floor area may be used.
3.
Where off-street parking or loading serves two or more activities
that are different types of uses, including two or more activities
that are part of the same principal use, the number of spaces or
bays provided shall be the sum of the requirements for the various
individual uses including any fractional number.
4.
Where the requirement is based on the number of employees, the
number of spaces shall be based on the number of employees in the
peak period, which shall be at least three hours per day for at least
three days per week.
5.
Where places of assembly are provided with benches rather than
individual seats, each two linear feet of bench shall equal one seat,
and where no fixed seats or benches are used, each 20 square feet
of floor area in the largest assembly area shall equal one seat.
6.
Where uses are not enclosed in a structure, each square foot of
lot devoted to such use shall be considered equivalent to 1/5 of a
square foot of net floor area.
7.
In the case where the Board of Selectmen authorizes the placement
of temporary seats within the right-of-way of public streets, such
seats may not be counted toward the off-street parking or loading
requirements, as long as they are seasonal and temporary.
8.
Required off-street parking spaces or loading bays which, after
development, are later dedicated to and accepted by the Town
and are maintained by the Town for off-street parking or loading
purposes shall be deemed to continue to serve the uses or
structures for which they were originally provided.
9.
5.1.6
Preferential Rideshare Parking. To encourage the use of highoccupancy
vehicles, office, manufacturing, research, or laboratory uses
of more than 50,000 square feet of gross floor area, as defined in the
5.1.7
5.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS 5.1
1:163
parking and loading tables above, must provide preferential rideshare
parking spaces in compliance with the following standards:
One carpool or vanpool parking space must be provided for every
150 motor vehicle parking spaces.
1.
Rideshare parking spaces may be provided by converting a parking
space required by the parking table.
2.
Carpool and vanpool spaces must be signed and striped, and be
located near the primary entrance(s) of the building without
displacing any handicapped parking.
3.
Bicycle Parking Facilities.
Required spaces. In an office, manufacturing, research or
laboratory use as defined in the parking and loading tables, a
minimum of two bicycle parking spaces shall be provided, and
one additional bicycle parking space shall be provided for each
increment of 20 motor vehicle parking spaces over 40 vehicle
spaces.
1.
Placement and access. Bicycle parking shall be located near the
primary entrance(s) of the building. Half of the bicycle parking
spaces shall be provided as long-term parking, safe and secure
from vandalism and theft and protected from the elements. The
other half shall be provided as short-term (customer or visitor)
parking, and short-term parking spaces shall be visible and
convenient to the building entrance. Bicycle parking apparatus
shall not be installed in a manner that will cause obstruction of
pedestrian or motor vehicle traffic. Bicycle parking shall be
situated in such a way that normal snow removal activities and
snow storage do not impact the bicycle parking facility.
2.
Dimensional Regulation. Each bicycle parking space shall be
sufficient to accommodate a bicycle six feet in length and two feet
in width.
3.
Design. Bicycle parking apparatus shall be of a high-security
design to which the frame and wheel of a parked bicycle may
be attached; installed in a visible location to deter vandalism and
theft; and permanently mounted to the ground or to a building or
other immovable structure. Inverted-U-frame or other racks that
support the bicycle at two or more points above the center of
gravity are required.
4.
5.1.8
Location of Off-Street Parking Spaces and Loading Bays.
Required off-street parking spaces shall be provided on the same
lot as, and loading bays shall be provided next to, the principal or
accessory use they are required to serve.
1.
5.1.9
5.1 LEXINGTON CODE 5.1
1:164
No area may be utilized and counted as both a required parking
space and a required loading bay. However, maneuvering aisles and
driveways may serve both required parking and loading bays if they
meet the design standards of each. Existing areas used for both
parking and loading shall be counted for loading purposes.
2.
Required off-street parking spaces or loading bays may be wholly
or partly enclosed in a structure.
3.
Off-street parking spaces required for two or more buildings, uses,
or establishments on a single lot may be provided in a common lot.

Each parking space and loading bay shall be connected by a
driveway to a street or to an interior drive that leads to a street.
1.
The number of driveways permitting entrance to and exit from a lot
shall be limited to two per street line. Driveways shall be located
to minimize conflict with traffic on public streets and where good
visibility and sight distances are available to observe approaching
pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
2.
No private way or driveway shall be built through a district in
which the use served by the private way or driveway is not
permitted except that access through a GC district to any other
district is permitted. [Amended 3-23-2016 ATM by Art. 38]
3.
4. The maximum grade of any outdoor driveway is 12%.

parked or driven within required setback areas.
6.
Screening for Parking.
In all residential districts, or on a lot in any other district which
abuts or is across the street from a lot in a residential district,
any outdoor parking lot, all loading bays, maneuvering aisles and
driveways shall be screened in a manner to protect abutting lots
from the glare of headlights, noise and other nuisance factors.
1.
Any parking lot, which is a principal use, must be screened along
driveways and around the entire perimeter of the parking lot. The
entrance to driveways, to the extent practicable, shall be located

eight feet and for two-way use shall be a minimum of 18 feet
and a maximum of 30 feet, as measured at the setback line.
d.
Where access or egress is provided for a parking lot, or one or
more loading bays, such access or egress shall be so arranged
to provide a circulation system or maneuvering space on the
lot so that all vehicles may exit from and enter onto a public
street by being driven in a forward direction and no vehicle
shall be required to enter or leave by backing and no vehicle
shall have to stand within a street right-of-way waiting to enter
the lot.
e.
Number of compact car spaces. In parking lots containing more
than 20 spaces, not more than 33% of such spaces may be designed
for use by compact cars. Such compact car spaces shall be located
in one or more continuous areas and shall not be intermixed with
spaces designed for standard cars and shall be clearly designated
by signs or pavement marking. In parking lots with 20 or fewer
parking spaces, spaces designed for use by compact cars are not
permitted.
2.
Loading bays. All required loading bays must have minimum

authority requests, evidence shall be provided that the loading bay
and its maneuvering space are adequate to accommodate large
motor vehicles and trailers.
3.
Marking. In a parking lot or loading area, the surface of the parking
lot or loading area shall be painted, marked or otherwise
delineated so that the location of the parking spaces and loading
bays is apparent, and signs shall be erected indicating that loading
bays, and, if necessary, compact or other reserved parking spaces,
are reserved for such use. Where 50% or more of the required
parking spaces in a parking lot are assigned, such as to individual
employees or to dwelling units in a dwelling, parking spaces for
guests or visitors to the use or establishment, not to exceed 10%
of the required parking spaces, shall be located and designated as
visitor parking near the principal entrance to the building which
they serve.
4.
Availability. To ensure the availability and utilization of required
parking spaces and loading bays on a year-round basis:
5.
5.1 LEXINGTON CODE 5.1
1:168
Unless authorized by special permit or site plan approval, no
fee or other charge to the parker, in addition to a lease or
purchase agreement applicable to occupants generally, shall
be made for a parking space or loading bay required to serve a
use, building, or establishment.
a.
Each required off-street parking space and loading bay shall be
designed so that any motor vehicle may proceed to and from
said space without requiring the moving of any other vehicle
or by passing over any other space or bay.
b.
Parking spaces for vehicles larger than automobiles, such as
large trucks or buses, shall be specifically identified on the offstreet
parking and loading plan and shall be of such dimension
as to accommodate the specified type of vehicle. Such vehicles
shall be permitted to park only in the spaces so identified and
approved.
c.
Snow storage. A strip of land not less than five feet in width
shall be provided on at least two sides of a parking lot or loading
area and designated on the off-street parking and loading plan for
the storage of snow plowed or removed from the surface area of
the parking lot or loading area; such snow storage area may not
encroach on the area required for off-street parking or loading but
may be located in the area of required setback from a lot line or
building.
6.
Surfacing and drainage.
All required parking spaces and loading bays, maneuvering
aisles, and driveways shall have a durable, dustless, allweather
surface suitable for year-round use, such as asphalt
or concrete, and shall dispose of surface water by grading and
drainage in such a manner that no surface water shall drain
onto any public way or onto any lot in other ownership.
a.
It is the intent of this section that the paved surface of a
parking lot or loading area shall be limited to such areas as are
necessary for the parking spaces, loading bays, maneuvering
aisles, and driveways required to meet the provisions of this
section. The off-street parking and loading plan required by
this section shall demonstrate that all paved areas associated
with a parking lot are necessary for the storing, standing, or
maneuvering of vehicles; the permitting authority may deny
the request for a permit when more area is paved than is
necessary to comply with the provisions of this section.
b.
7.
Grade. The maximum grade of any required maneuvering aisle,
parking space, or loading bay shall be 10%.
8.
9. Landscaping.

5.2. SIGNS.
On at least three sides of the perimeter of an outdoor parking
lot containing 20 or more parking spaces, there must be at
least one tree for every eight parking spaces abutting the
perimeter; such trees must be spaced so that some part of a
parking space is not more than 30 feet from a tree.
a.
In the interior part of an outdoor parking lot where two rows of
parking spaces containing a total of 10 or more parking spaces
face each other, a landscaped open space not less than five
feet in width must be provided. The landscaped strip may be
provided either:
Between the rows of parking spaces parallel to the aisle;
or
i.
In two or more strips parallel to the spaces and extending
from the aisle serving one row of spaces to the aisle
serving the other row of spaces. There must be, in each
such strip, at least three trees and in all such strips not
fewer than one tree for every eight parking spaces in the
interior part of the parking lot. Trees must be spaced so
that some part of each parking space is not more than 30
feet from a tree.
ii.
b.
Trees required by this section shall be at least two inches in
diameter at a height four feet above the ground at time of
planting and shall be of a species characterized by suitability
and hardiness for location in a parking lot. To the extent
practicable, existing trees shall be retained and used to satisfy
this section.
c.
Exception for one-family or two-family dwelling. The provisions of
§ 5.1.13 with regard to backing into a public street, marking of
pavement, moving of vehicles and surfacing and drainage shall not
apply where parking is provided for any one-family or two-family
dwelling.
10.

following purposes:
1. To provide a suitable transition between different zoning districts;
5.3.1
5.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS 5.3
1:175
To separate different and otherwise incompatible adjacent land
uses from each other in order to partially or completely reduce
potential nuisances such as dirt, dust, litter, noise, glare from
motor vehicle headlights, the intrusion from artificial light
including the ambient glow from signs, or the view of unsightly
buildings and parking lots;
2.
To preserve or improve the visual and environmental character of
a neighborhood and of Lexington generally;
3.
To offer property owners protection against possible diminution
of property values due to adjacent construction or a change in
existing land uses.
4.
Applicability. No building permit, special permit or certificate of
occupancy for a use shall be issued or granted where this bylaw
indicates that a landscaping, transition or screening area, in
accordance with this section, shall be required or where this section
indicates such shall be provided, unless compliance with the provisions
of this section is demonstrated.
5.3.2
Landscaping Plan Required. A landscaping plan, demonstrating
compliance with the standards contained in this section for
landscaping, transition areas and screening, shall accompany each
application for a building permit, certificate of occupancy, or special
permit. The plan shall be drawn to scale and include dimensions and
distances. The landscaping plan shall be certified by a landscape
architect registered in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The
landscaping plan shall comply with the permitting authority's rules and
regulations.
5.3.3
Transition Areas. Where a lot abuts a different zoning district or is
across a street from a different zoning district, a landscaped transition
and screening area shall be provided and shall be located adjacent
to the lot line as set forth in the table in § 5.3.5, consistent with the
following:
In the case of a nonresidential use in a residential district, a
landscaped transition and screening area shall be provided, except
that while the transition area shall be the width specified in the
table in § 5.3.5, it shall be installed only along those segments of
lot lines necessary to screen the nonresidential use from buildings
located on abutting lots. The transition area may be provided
within the minimum yard required for a building.
1.
Where a lot is divided into two zoning districts for which a
transition area would be required by § 5.3.5, the transition area
shall be along the zoning district line, except that the SPGA may
grant a special permit for the transition area to be in a different
location if it meets the objectives of this section.
2.
5.3.4
5.3 LEXINGTON CODE 5.3

Across the Street. A lot shall be considered to be across the street
from a different zoning district if, at any point along its street line,
a line drawn perpendicular to the street line intersects at any point
with the street line of the lot across the street. Where any part
of the street line of a lot in a nonresidential district and having a
nonresidential principal use is determined to be across the street
from a residential district, a screening and transition area shall be
provided along the entire length of the street line. If a corner lot is
across the street from a residential use or district on only one side
of the lot, then screening is required only on the side that faces the
residential use or district.

Transition Area; Standards and Requirements. The following standards
shall apply to the installation and maintenance of all landscaping,
transition and screening areas required by this section:
Composition of landscaping, transition and screening areas. A
landscaped transition and screening area shall consist of a
landscaped strip and may include fences, walls or berms which
shall serve to provide an effective year-round visual screen at the
time of installation.
1.
5.3.6
5.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS 5.3
1:177
Height of screening. Visual screening comprised of a mixed
planting of deciduous and coniferous trees and shrubs and walls or
fences shall have a minimum overall height of six feet at the time
of installation, except in a required front yard where the maximum
height shall comply with § 5.3.5 so as not to interfere with sight
distance.
2.
Sight distance. In order to provide an unobstructed sight distance
for motorists, there shall be a triangle, which is at least 30 feet
on two sides of the intersection of a street with a driveway or an
interior drive that shall be clear of visual obstructions. The triangle
shall be measured from the point of intersection of the street with
the driveway or interior drive for a distance of at least 30 feet along
the street line; along the side line of the driveway or interior drive
for a distance of at least 30 feet; and by a third line connecting
these two points. Within this triangle so described, nothing shall be
erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as
to impede vision for motorists between a height of 2 1/2 feet and
10 feet above the grade of the center lines of the street and the
driveway or interior drive.
3.
Transition Areas; Type of Plant Materials. The following standards shall
apply:
A variety of plant materials shall be selected to provide an effective
visual screen, to be maintained at a minimum height of six feet.
Plantings shall be a mixture of deciduous and coniferous trees and
shrubs for the screening to maintain its effectiveness throughout
the winter months.
1.
Ground cover, grass, mulch or other equivalent landscape
treatment shall be provided in all landscaped transition and
screening areas. Where the width of a transition area exceeds
20 feet, and where existing vegetation is used as the required
planting, no ground cover, grass, mulch or equivalent treatment
shall be required, provided all man-made debris has been removed
from within the transition area.
2.
3. The substitution of artificial plant materials is not permitted.
Existing vegetation in a healthy condition, which provides an
effective year-round visual screen, may be used provided it is
approved by the permitting authority, which may require
supplemental planting.
4.
Size of plant materials. All trees required by this section shall have
a minimum caliper of three inches at the time of planting.
5.
Spacing of plant materials. The arrangement of plant materials
shall consider the relationship of plants in size, form, texture and
color. The configuration and combinations of plant materials shall
6.

1:178
be in accordance with sound horticultural and landscape
architectural practices.
Protection of landscaping and screening areas. Wherever required
landscaping, transition or screening areas are adjacent to parking
areas or driveways such areas shall be protected by curbing or
wheel stops to avoid damage to the plant materials and other
structures by vehicles.
7.
Structures within Landscaping, Transition and Screening Areas.
Walls or fences may be required within a transition area to
supplement the required planting to provide an effective visual
screen as determined by the permitting authority.
1.
When walls or fences are required by the permitting authority, they
shall be of the following type:
A solid masonry wall faced with visually attractive materials on
the side that faces the residential or less intensive use.
a.
A wood stockade or other opaque wooden fence installed so
that the attractive side faces the residential or less intensive
use. Between such fence and the lot line there shall be planted
a minimum of one shrub or vine per 10 linear feet, and a
minimum of one small deciduous tree per 40 linear feet.
b.
A fence or wall of an alternate material that may be
appropriate to the site may be proposed by the applicant's
landscape architect.
c.
Walls or fences may not be substituted for plant materials
to reduce the required width of a transition and screening
area. A wall or fence may be added only where a mass of
plant materials would not provide an adequate screen or where
required by the permitting authority.
d.
2.
5.3.8
Earthen Berms. The permitting authority may require that earthen
berms be constructed within a transition area as part of a residential
development adjacent to an arterial street or limited access highway,
subject to the following:
1. The berms shall be planted.
Whenever a wall or fence is required in addition to a berm, the wall
or fence shall be located between the berm and the higher intensity
use in order to improve sound absorption.
2.
The use of earthen berms and similar grading techniques in
combination with the standard landscaping requirement is
encouraged.
3.
5.3.9
5.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS 5.3

Berms shall be constructed of earth and shall be between three and
six feet in height.
4.
Use of Transition Areas. The following standards shall apply:
Only necessary driveways or interior drives shall be located across
a required transition area. No structure, parking area, or play area
may be located in a required transition area.
1.
A transition area may be used for passive recreation; it may contain
pedestrian, bike or equestrian trails, provided they do not reduce
the effectiveness of the transition area as a year-round visual
screen. No other uses are permitted in transition areas.
2.
5.3.10
Maintenance.
The owner of the lot shall be responsible for the maintenance,
repair and replacement of all landscaping materials installed in
accordance with the approved landscaping plan.
1.
All plant material shall be maintained in a healthy growing
condition, replaced when necessary and kept free of refuse and
debris. After the initial planting, all plant materials not surviving

shall be replaced in kind.
2.
Fences and walls shall be maintained in good repair. Gates or
openings may be provided where necessary for access to an area
for maintenance.
3.
5.3.11
Certificate of Occupancy. The landscaping plan, as approved, shall
be completed according to specifications prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for any residential or nonresidential use or
building. If the completion of the structure occurs after the planting
season has passed, only a temporary certificate of occupancy may be
issued until the landscaping is completed.
5.3.12
Screening of Other Use Areas within Lots. The following standards shall
apply:
Outdoor storage areas. All outdoor storage areas for nonresidential
uses in residential districts and all facilities for refuse disposal for
all commercial, institutional or multifamily uses in all districts shall
be enclosed by a fence or wall at least six feet in height. In the
event that a wall six feet in height is insufficient to adequately
screen such areas, the permitting authority may require additional
screening in such manner and of such materials as may be
reasonably necessary to adequately screen such area from public

5.5.1
5.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS 5.5
1:183
Applicability. No building permit shall be granted for the erection of a
new building or the enlargement or renovation of an existing building
other than in the CB District with the result that:
There are 10,000 square feet or more of gross floor area on the lot,
including any existing floor area, but not including any floor area
devoted to residential use or to off-street parking; or
1.
There are 50 or more dwelling units, or their equivalent, in a
development, including any existing dwelling units; or
2.
The number of parking spaces is increased by 25 or more and there
are 50 or more parking spaces, including any existing parking
spaces, on the lot.
Unless a special permit has been granted and the SPGA has made
a determination that the streets and intersections affected by the
proposed development have, or will have as a result of traffic
improvements, adequate capacity, as set forth in § 5.5.4, to
accommodate the increased traffic from the development.
3.
5.5.2
Traffic Study Required. A traffic study must be submitted with each
application for a building permit, special permit, or as may be required
by any other provision of this bylaw. The traffic study shall include the
information set forth in the SPGA's rules and regulations, provided that:
The traffic study must be conducted by a traffic engineer who
will certify that he/she qualifies for the position of member of the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE).
1.
Streets "likely to be affected by the development" are those that
have an average daily traffic (ADT) of 2,000 vehicles or more and
will carry 10% or more of the estimated trips generated by the
development.
2.
Intersections "likely to be affected by the development" are those
that have an average daily traffic (ADT) of 2,000 vehicles or more
and for which the development will add 5% or more to the approach
volumes.
3.
5.5.3
Adequate Traffic Capacity. Prior to granting a special permit, the SPGA
shall determine that the streets and intersections likely to be affected
by the proposed development currently have, or will have as a result
of traffic improvements, adequate capacity, as defined in § 5.5.5. In
making its determination of adequate capacity, the SPGA shall consider
at least the cumulative effect on a street or intersection likely to be
affected by the development, as provided in § 5.5.3, of:
1. Existing traffic conditions;
Estimates of traffic from other proposed developments which have
already been approved in part or in whole by the Town of Lexington
for which a traffic study was required, or by official action of an
2.
5.5.4
5.5 LEXINGTON CODE 5.5
1:184
abutting city or town, which have not yet been opened for use prior
to the date that the traffic counts required by this section were
taken; and
3. Estimates of traffic from the proposed development.
Adequate Capacity Defined by Level of Service. Adequate capacity
shall mean level of service "D" or better as described in the "Highway
Capacity Manual, 2010 Edition" published by the Transportation
Research Board. If the level of service that would result from the
cumulative effect, referred to in § 5.5.4, is "E" or below, the SPGA
shall determine there is not adequate capacity and shall deny the
application.
5.5.5
Mitigating Measures to Improve Capacity. The SPGA shall consider that
various traffic engineering improvements, or other method of positive
traffic control, such as a traffic control officer, can improve the trafficcarrying
capacity of an intersection or street and improve the level
of service rating to a higher and acceptable value. The SPGA shall
consider such improvements, or other method of traffic control, in its
determination and may make a conditional determination that adequate
capacity is dependent upon the construction of the traffic engineering
improvement, or other method of traffic control.
5.5.6
Conditions. The SPGA may make a condition of its approval of the
special permit that the start, or any stage, of the construction of the
development, or the occupancy thereof, is dependent upon the start
or completion of the traffic engineering improvement or of the start
of another method of positive traffic control, such as a traffic control
officer, on a permanent basis. A conditional approval shall be dependent
upon at least a start of the physical construction of the traffic
engineering improvement or the execution of an agreement with the
Town of Lexington for another method of traffic control. Letters of
support, or commitment, or approval, or the award of a contract are not
considered as a start of construction. However, as the basis for making
a conditional determination of adequacy, the SPGA may consider as
evidence that the traffic-carrying capacity will be improved to a higher
level of service, such letters of support, or commitment, or approval,
or the award of a contract for construction of the traffic engineering
improvement, or a proposed agreement with the Town of Lexington for
another method of traffic control.
5.5.7
Trip Reduction Requirements. As a condition of its approval of a special
permit or a special permit with site plan review, the SPGA may require
actions and programs by the owner and/or manager of a development
to reduce the number of single-occupant automobile trips made to a
development, particularly during peak traffic hours. Such actions and
programs may include:
Providing a pass to employees for use on a public transportation
system that serves the development site;
1.
5.5.8
5.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS 5.5
1:185
2. Use of car pools and van pools;
Scheduling of hours of operation such as flex-time, staggered work
hours, and spread scheduling that reduces trips during peak traffic
hours;
3.
Preferential parking locations and arrangements for vehicles other
than single-occupant automobiles;
4.
Restrictions on access to, or egress from, off-street parking areas
during peak traffic hours; or
5.
Bicycle parking facilities and other measures such as locker and
shower facilities to encourage bicycle commuting.
6.
Monitoring. Where such conditions are included, they shall include a
reporting system that monitors the effectiveness of the trip reduction
program. The SPGA may make a condition of the granting of the special
permit or special permit with site plan review that:
Such monitor be directly responsible to and report to the Building
Commissioner; and
1.
The applicant is responsible for the cost of providing such
monitoring system.

a special permit to locate the antenna elsewhere on the lot, or on a
building, where it may receive such signals.
7.
Purpose. The general objectives of this section are to:
Encourage preservation of buildings, structures, sites and settings,
and elements of historical or architectural significance.
1.
Establish eligibility criteria for buildings, structures, sites and
settings, and elements attaining protected status under § 6.2.2.
2.
Expand economic options for the owner/investor, by broadening the
permitted uses in various zoning districts and removing barriers
presented by development standards governing those permitted
uses.
3.
Permit the flexibility of development options by modifying
dimensional requirements that might be an impediment to historic
preservation.
4.
Provide incentives to preserve contributory elements of historic
or architectural significance, such as settings and sites, objects,
monuments, trees or other elements.
5.
6.2.1
Historic Eligibility Defined. Any historic element, as defined below, may
qualify for eligibility under this section, if it is included on any of the
following lists or surveys:
1. National Register of Historic Places.
State (Commonwealth of Massachusetts) Register of Historic
Places.
2.

buildings, and other structures and outbuildings located on the
property.
6.2.3
Secondary Qualifying Element. Secondary qualifying elements shall
include sites and settings, objects, monuments, trees or any element of
historical, architectural and/or cultural significance that indicates their
contributory value in establishing historical context.
6.2.4
Special Permit Priority. Priority in granting special permits under these
historic preservation incentives shall, in all cases, be placed upon
keeping buildings and structures in place, rather than moving them
to other locations, provided that the existing siting can be shown to
represent valid historical setting and context. Moving of buildings,
structures and elements to other locations shall be considered only if no
other preservation measures are practical or reasonable on the existing
site, or if the proposed removal is to return a building, structure or
element to an original or more historically accurate location. The SPGA
shall determine the validity of any such requests.
6.2.5
Special Permit. The SPGA, after making the findings required by § 6.2.7
below, may grant a special permit to authorize certain uses and

6.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS 6.4
1:193
Multifamily dwelling. A concealed wireless communication facility
may be installed in a building or in a structure on a building on a lot
on which a dwelling other than a one-family or two-family dwelling
is the principal use provided all residents of such dwelling or
facility receive 30 days' notice before the application for a special
permit is submitted.
1.
Institutional, agricultural, natural resource or commercial uses in
residential districts.
A concealed wireless communication facility may be installed
in a building or in a structure on a building on a lot on which
an institutional, agricultural, natural resource or commercial
use in a residential district (as provided in Table 134) is the
principal use.
a.
A wireless communication facility may be installed if it is colocated
with an existing electrical power transmission line
tower, an existing nonconforming transmitting or receiving
tower, or a water tower, provided that the wireless
communication facility is camouflaged and does not exceed the
height of the tower.
b.
For the purposes of this section, an electrical power
transmission tower, an existing transmitting or receiving tower
or antenna for commercial activities other than a wireless
communication facility shall be considered to be a commercial
use in a residential district.
c.
2.
Uses in commercial districts. A wireless communication facility
may be installed on a lot in a commercial district provided the
wireless communication facility is camouflaged and does not
exceed the height requirements of § 4.4.
3.
Site Development Requirements. The following standards shall apply:
Shelters and accessory buildings. Any communication equipment
shelter or accessory building shall be designed to be architecturally
similar and compatible with the surrounding area. Whenever
feasible, a building shall be constructed underground.
1.
Setbacks. Any new tower shall be set back at least one time the
height of the tower plus 10 feet from each lot line of the site on
which the tower is located. Any non-concealed antenna shall be
set back at least one time the height of the antenna, as measured
from the ground level, from each lot line of the site on which the
antenna is located. However, if the antenna is being attached to an
existing tower whose setback is already approved, either by right,
by special permit or by variance, and if the SPGA determines that
the addition of the antenna does not materially alter the basis of

6.4.6
34.Editor's Note: Table 1 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
6.4 LEXINGTON CODE 6.4
1:194
that prior approval, then no new, independent setback requirement
shall be created by the addition of the antenna. In nonresidential
districts or on Town of Lexington owned land, the SPGA may grant
a special permit to allow a lesser setback if it makes a finding that
such lesser setback provides adequate safety, promotes co-location
or improves design, and will not negatively impact the appearance
and character of the neighborhood.
Security and signs. The area around the wireless communication
facility shall be completely secure from trespass or vandalism. A
sign not larger than one square foot shall be posted adjacent to
the entry gate indicating the name of the facility owner(s) and
a twenty-four-hour emergency telephone number. Advertising on
any antenna, tower, fencing, accessory building or communication
equipment shelter is prohibited.
3.
Lighting. Unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration,
no exterior night lighting of towers or the wireless communication
facility is permitted except for manually operated emergency lights
for use when operating personnel are on site.

construction. New towers shall not exceed the minimum height
necessary to provide adequate coverage within the Town of
Lexington. Erection of a new tower that exceeds the height
restrictions listed in § 6.4 is not permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates in the special permit process that adequate coverage
within the Town of Lexington cannot be met for the locations
permitted under § 6.4.
5.
Justification of Need. The following standards shall apply:
Coverage area. The applicant shall provide a map of the geographic
area in which the proposed facility will provide adequate coverage.
1.
Adequacy of other facility sites controlled by the applicant. The
applicant shall provide written documentation of any facility sites
in the Town and in abutting towns or cities in which it has a legal or
equitable interest, whether by ownership, leasehold or otherwise.
Said documentation shall demonstrate that these facility sites do
not already provide, or do not have the potential to provide by site
adjustment, adequate coverage.
2.
Capacity of existing facility sites. The applicant shall provide
written documentation that it has examined all facility sites located
in the Town and in abutting towns in which the applicant has no
legal or equitable interest to determine whether those existing
facility sites can be used to provide adequate coverage.
3.
Adequate coverage through the least disruptive means. The
applicant shall provide written documentation that the proposed
facility uses the least disruptive technology (through the use of
4.
6.4.7
6.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS 6.4
1:195
repeaters or other similar technology as it may be developed
subsequent to adoption of this bylaw) in which it can provide
adequate coverage in conjunction with all facility sites listed above.
Application; Procedures.

Lexington's Design Advisory Committee shall review an applicant's
site plans and make recommendations to the Director of
Inspectional Services for by right permit applications and to the
SPGA for special permits. The Design Advisory Committee will
make comment on whether the site plans show that a proposed
wireless communication facility will be concealed for a by right
permit if built according to the plans, or whether the site plans
show that a proposed wireless communication facility will be
concealed or sufficiently camouflaged for a special permit if built
according to the plans.
2.
Review by the Communications Advisory Committee. The Board of
Selectmen's Communications Advisory Committee shall review an
applicant's application and make recommendations to the Director
of Inspectional Services for by right permit applications and to
the SPGA for special permits. The Communications Advisory
Committee will make comment as to the application's adherence to
the provisions of this section. The Committee may recommend that
a consultant be hired by the SPGA (at the applicant's expense) if
technical expertise is needed.

6.9.1
6.8 LEXINGTON CODE 6.9
1:204
Applicability. A special permit residential development is a project in
which one or more lots, tracts, or parcels of land are to be improved
for use as a coordinated site for housing. No special permit residential
development shall be initiated without first obtaining a special permit
in accordance with the provisions of this section. The purpose of the
special permit is to provide detailed review of residential developments
that have a substantial impact upon the character of the Town, adjacent
residential areas and the provision of public facilities and services.
6.9.2
Types of Special Permit Residential Development.
A site sensitive development (SSD) is the development of a parcel
with configurations of lots allowing flexibility and creativity in
residential development through reductions in minimum lot area
and frontage requirements in order to minimize site disturbance,
preserve historic and sensitive natural resources, and allow for
efficient patterns of construction to lower development cost. The
number of dwellings in a site sensitive development may not
exceed the number of dwellings that could be constructed in the
development of a conventional subdivision. [Amended 4-9-2014
ATM by Art. 32]
1.
A balanced housing development (BHD) is a development allowing
deviation from the dimensional standards that apply to
developments in conventional subdivisions in order to achieve a
balance of housing choices for a diversity of household types and
sizes. Instead of determining density by minimum lot area and
frontage requirements, the amount of residential development for
the tract as a whole is based on calculations of gross floor area and
impervious surface area derived from a conventional development
plan for the tract of land. [Amended 4-9-2014 ATM by Art. 32]
2.
A public benefit development (PBD) is a type of balanced housing
development that allows increases in gross floor area and
impervious surface area in return for the creation of 10% of the
units as affordable housing.
3.
6.9.3
Scale of Development. An applicant is not entitled to the maximum
development, nor is the applicant entitled to approval of a special
permit residential development. The amount of development permitted
will be based on a fully complying proof plan and the SPGA's evaluation
of the extent to which the proposed development complies with the
criteria set forth-below.
6.9.4
Dimensional Standards. The requirements of § 135-4.0 are modified as
follows:
Lot area. There is no minimum lot area required. Individual lot area
shall be sufficient to meet off-street parking requirements of this
bylaw and the installation of any on-site water supply and sewage
disposal facilities.
1.
6.9.5
6.9 GENERAL PROVISIONS 6.9
1:205
Frontage. There is no minimum frontage required. Frontage for
each lot shall be sufficient to provide for adequate access to the
building site. Where shared driveways or other circumstances
render frontage on a street to be of no importance, none is
required.
2.
Yard and Height Requirements. Yards required by § 135-4.0 and the
height limit of § 135-4.3.5 apply to the perimeter of the site, but are
not applicable within the site. [Amended 3-30-2016 ATM by Art.
39]
3.
Site coverage. There is no maximum site coverage limit for
individual lots. Site coverage for the development tract as a whole
is limited as described below.
4.
Gross Floor Area Standards.
Site sensitive developments (SSD). The total gross floor area (GFA)
in an SSD may not exceed the sum of the gross floor area that
would be permitted on each of the lots shown on the proof plan
under § 135-4.4 of this bylaw. [Amended 3-30-2016 ATM by Art.
41]
1.
Balanced housing developments. The total gross floor area (GFA) of
all structures in a BHD shall be less than the number of lots shown
on the proof plan multiplied by 7,200 square feet.
2.
Public benefit developments. The total gross floor area (GFA) of all
structures in a PBD shall be less than the number of lots shown on
the proof plan multiplied by 8,640 square feet.
3.
6.9.6
Dwelling Unit Count and Limitations on Unit Size.
Site sensitive developments. The number of dwellings in a SSD
shall not exceed the number of dwellings shown on the proof plan.
1.
Balanced housing developments. The number of dwelling units
permitted in a BHD is not limited. At least 25% of the dwelling units
must have a GFA not larger than 2,700 square feet, and at least
50% of the dwelling units must have a GFA not larger than 3,500
square feet.
2.
Public benefit developments. The number of dwelling units
permitted in a PBD is not limited. At least 25% of the dwelling units
must have a GFA not larger than 2,700 square feet, and at least
50% of the dwelling units must have a GFA not larger than 3,500
square feet. In addition, 10% of the total number of dwelling units
in the development must be affordable to households earning no
more than 80% of the area median income.
3.
6.9.7
6.9.8Impervious Surface Standards.
6.9 LEXINGTON CODE 6.9
1:206
Site sensitive developments. The impervious surface limit in a SSD
is based on the proof plan. The limit for the development as a whole
is calculated as follows:
Step 1: Determine the area in square feet of each lot shown on
the proof plan. For each lot in a RS or RT District, multiply its lot
area by 0.20; for each lot in the RO District, multiply its lot area
by 0.12.
Step 2: Determine the total area of the impervious surfaces
contained on the proof plan that are not contained within lots,
such as roads, sidewalks, and similar surfaces.
Step 3: The impervious surface limit for the SSD is the sum of the
impervious surface calculations from Steps 1 and 2.
1.
Balanced housing developments. The impervious surface limit in a
BHD is calculated in the same manner as that of a SSD.
2.
Public benefit developments. The impervious surface limit in a PBD
is calculated in the same manner as that of a SSD and increased by
20%, i.e. multiplied by 1.20.
3.
Site Coverage Standards.
For site sensitive developments, the site coverage limit is based
on the proof plan. The limit for the development as a whole is
calculated as follows:
Step 1: For each lot on the proof plan, multiply its lot area in
square feet by 0.15 for lots in RS and RT Districts, and by 0.09 for
lots in RO Districts.
Step 2: The site coverage limit for the SSD as a whole is equal to
the sum of the individual lot site coverage calculations determined
in Step 1.
1.
2. For balanced housing developments, there is no site coverage limit.
3. For public benefit developments, there is no site coverage limit.
6.9.9
Common Open Space Standards.
Minimum common open space. At least 33% of the developable site
area in a BHD or PBD shall be set aside as common open space. A
maximum of 20% of common open space may be devoted to parking
or structures used for, or accessory to, active outdoor recreation,
provided such parking or structures are consistent with the open
space uses of such land.
1.
Location; condition. Where required or provided, common open
space shall be land that may be in one or more parcels of a size and
shape appropriate for the intended use and available for use by all
occupants of a development.
2.
6.9.10
6.9 GENERAL PROVISIONS 6.9
1:207
Easement. When such open space is conveyed to persons or entities
other than the Town, an easement over such land shall be granted
to the Town to ensure its perpetual use as open space,
conservation, recreation or park land.
3.
Ownership of Open Space. Common open space may be conveyed to:
The Town, subject to acceptance, to ensure its perpetual use as
open space, conservation, recreation or park land; or
1.
A legal association comprised of the owners of the development,
which may include homeowners or owners of condominium or
cooperative units; or
2.
A nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the
conservation of open space.
3.
6.9.11
Streets and Drives. The objective of this section is that adequate access
for fire-fighting, medical and other emergency operations be provided
from the public street system to each site sensitive, balanced housing,
or public benefit development, as follows:
Connection to public street system. Each street and interior, drive,
or system of streets or interior drives, shall connect to a public
street.
1.
A dead-end interior drive will be treated in the same manner as
a dead-end street, and is subject to the provisions governing a
dead-end street that are found in the Subdivision Regulations.
[Amended 3-23-2016 ATM by Art. 37]
2.
In a development served by a dead-end street or dead-end interior
drive, a secondary means of access may be required in order
to provide adequate access for fire-fighting, medical and other
emergency vehicles. The Fire Chief will be consulted as to the
adequacy of the access.
3.
6.9.12
Compliance with Other Rules and Regulations. The construction of
community services, such as utilities, and of streets and interior drives
shall comply with the requirements of the Planning Board's Subdivision
Regulations. [Amended 3-23-2016 ATM by Art. 37]

planning, design, and construction, the overarching principles of
Context Sensitive Design, including attention to scenic, aesthetic,
historic, and environmental resources; and
2.
Clear process. To develop and implement plans adopted through a
broad-based, clear and transparent process.
3.
Overlay District. A TMO District shall not supersede other zoning
districts, but shall be deemed to be superimposed over these other
zoning districts, except that if an applicant elects to comply with the
requirements in this section, this section shall supersede §§ 5.1 and 5.5.
7.2.2
Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to developments
located within a TMO District that elect to comply with the
requirements of this section, rather than complying with §§ 5.1 and 5.5.
Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, an applicant
may not make such an election until a plan for the TMO District
has been adopted by the Planning Board as described below. A final
certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless or until all provisions
of this section have been satisfied, except for those conditions that
by their terms are intended to be satisfied after occupancy of the
structures for which the certificate of occupancy is sought.
7.2.3
Transportation Plan Required. The Planning Board, after consultation
with the Board of Selectmen and an advertised public meeting, shall
adopt a specific plan for each TMO District containing the following
elements:
Assessment of the impacts of reasonably anticipated future
development in the TMO District considering current zoning
bylaws and other legal and physical constraints;
1.
Analysis of existing capital improvement plans or the facilities
element of a plan adopted under MGL c. 41, § 81D;
2.

7.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.2
1:215
Parking and Transportation Demand Management techniques
reasonably calculated to reduce the number of vehicle trips
generated by developments in the TMO District and to ensure the
long term stability of the transportation system;
7.
An implementation program that defines and schedules the specific
municipal actions necessary to achieve the objectives of the plan;
and
8.
A plan to encourage voluntary participation in TDM programs by
those not required to participate.
The plan shall be updated periodically to reflect actual
development activity, actual costs of infrastructure improvements
completed or underway, plan changes, or amendments to the
zoning bylaws.
9.
Transportation mitigation fee. The imposition of a transportation
mitigation fee shall not prevent the Town from imposing fees it may
otherwise impose under local bylaws. The payment of a transportation
mitigation fee is required when an applicant elects to proceed under
this section, subject to the following:
Timing of payment. Payment of the transportation mitigation fee
shall be in cash, under terms and conditions specified in the TMO
District plan.
1.
Payment use. Any transportation mitigation fees paid to the Town
are intended to be used to fund transportation infrastructure
improvements that are necessitated by the proposed development
of the applicant. Examples of appropriate uses include the costs
related to the provision of equipment, infrastructure, facilities,
services, or studies associated with the following: traffic mitigation;
public transportation; bicycle and pedestrian accommodations or
other transportation-related improvements. Except where
deficiencies are exacerbated by the new development, in which
case the fee may be assessed only in proportion to the deficiency
so exacerbated, the fee shall not be expended for personnel costs,
normal operation and maintenance costs, or to remedy deficiencies
in existing facilities. The expenditure of the fees without Town
Meeting appropriation is prohibited.
2.
Rough proportionality and reasonable benefit to fee payer. The
transportation mitigation fee shall be determined by the TMO
District plan described in § 7.2.4. The fee shall be roughly
proportionate to the impacts created by the development. The
purposes for which the fee is expended shall reasonably benefit the
proposed development.
3.
7.2.5
Parking and Transportation Demand Management. Submission of a
Parking and Transportation Demand Management (PTDM) plan, which
is consistent with the TMO District plan described above, is required

approvals.
Enforcement. Compliance with the PTDM plan submitted with an
approved permit application may be enforced through § 9.1.
7.2.7
Special Permit. Where a development electing to proceed under this
section also requires a special permit, the SPGA shall not grant the
special permit unless it imposes conditions, including transportation
mitigation fees and parking and transportation demand management
requirements, to meet the goals of the TMO District plan.
7.2.8
Purpose. A planned development (PD) district is intended to:
Permit considerable flexibility in the development of tracts of land
by requiring few predetermined standards;
1.
Permit a developer to propose, and for the Town to vote on, a site
development and use plan unique to a particular location;
2.
Permit the use of development standards more detailed than the
more general standards elsewhere in this bylaw; and
3.
Provide information for the Town to evaluate the potential impacts
of a proposed development and to enable the Town to require
adherence to such site development plans.
4.
7.3.1
Provisions Applicable to PD Districts.
Standards for development. A PD District does not have
predetermined standards for development. Such standards are to
be proposed by the developer, included in the preliminary site
development and use plan, and approved by Town Meeting.
1.
Uses permitted. Any uses may be permitted in a PD District if they
are clearly identified in the preliminary site development and use
plan approved by Town Meeting.
2.
Compliance required. No use is permitted and no development
may occur in a PD District except in substantial conformity with
a preliminary site development and use plan approved by Town
Meeting, the provisions of this section and site plan review under

NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
8.1. APPLICABILITY.
Except as herein after provided, this bylaw shall not apply to structures
or uses lawfully in existence or lawfully begun, or to a building permit or
special permit issued before the first publication of notice of the public
hearing on this bylaw or any amendments thereto, but shall apply to any
change or substantial extension of such use, to a building permit or special
permit issued after the first notice of said public hearing, to any
reconstruction, extension or structural change of such structure and to any
alteration of a structure begun after the first notice of said public hearing
to provide for its use in a substantially different purpose or for the same
purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater
extent except where alteration, reconstruction, extension or a structural
change to a one-family or two-family residential structure does not increase
the nonconforming nature of said structure, as set forth below.
8.2. NONCONFORMING USES.
8.3. NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES OTHER THAN ONE-FAMILY
AND TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES.
The SPGA may grant a special permit to reconstruct, extend, alter or
structurally change a nonconforming structure other than a one-family or
two-family structure (which are governed by § 8.4, below), or to alter said
structure to provide for a substantially different purpose or for the same
purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater
extent, in accordance with this section only if it determines that such
reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change shall not be substantially
more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure to the
Commencement of Construction or Operation. Construction or
operations under a building permit or special permit shall conform
to any subsequent amendments to this bylaw, unless the use or
construction is commenced within a period of not more than six months
after the issuance of the permit and in any case involving construction,
unless such construction is continued through to completion as
continuously and expeditiously as is reasonable.
8.1.1
Change or Substantial Extension. The SPGA may grant a special permit
to change or substantially extend a nonconforming use only if it
determines that such change or extension shall not be substantially
more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the
neighborhood.
8.2.1
Substitution. The SPGA may grant a special permit to substitute one
nonconforming use for another nonconforming use only if it determines
that the new use shall be less detrimental than the existing use to the
neighborhood.
8.2.2
8.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS 8.3
1:219
neighborhood. No part of a structure that does not conform to a minimum
yard requirement shall be located closer to a lot line than the closest point
of the existing structure to such lot line. No part of a structure that does not
conform to a height requirement shall be higher than the existing structure.
8.4. NONCONFORMING ONE-FAMILY AND TWO-FAMILY
RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES.
8.5. NONCONFORMING LOTS.
No Increase in Nonconforming Nature. Nonconforming one-family and
two-family dwellings may be reconstructed, extended, altered, or
structurally changed, or a new accessory structure may be constructed,
upon a determination by the Building Commissioner that the
nonconforming nature of the structure is not increased. Such
determination will be deemed to be as of right and the applicant
entitled to the issuance of a building permit where each structure
is reconstructed, extended, altered, or changed so as to (a) contain
the improvements within the site coverage and height of an existing
structure; or (b) comply with the applicable yard and height
requirements of § 135-4.0, except that the side yard may be reduced as
noted below: [Amended 3-30-2016 ATM by Art. 39]
If Actual Lot Frontage Is Side Yard Must Be At Least
More than 75 feet but not more than
100 feet
12 feet
More than 50 feet but not more than
75 feet
10 feet
More than 0 feet but not more than 50
feet
7.5 feet
8.4.1
Increase in Nonconforming Nature. In the event that the Building
Commissioner determines the nonconforming nature of the structure
is increased, the SPGA may grant a special permit to allow such
construction, reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change where
it determines that the proposed modification does not create a new
nonconformity and will not be substantially more detrimental to the
neighborhood than the existing nonconforming structure.
8.4.2
Changes to Nonconforming Lots. A lot that does not currently comply
with the dimensional requirements set forth in § 135-4.0 may be
changed provided that such change reduces or does not increase the
extent of the existing nonconformity and does not create a new
nonconformity. Such change shall not cause the protected status of the
lot to be forfeited and the lot shall be considered a nonconforming lot.
8.5.1
Government Acquisition. If government acquisition of land causes a lot
to be rendered nonconforming, or more nonconforming, it shall not
cause the protected status of the lot to be forfeited and the lot shall

8.6. ABANDONMENT, DEMOLITION, OR NON-USE.
Any nonconforming use or structure which has been abandoned,
demolished without reconstruction, or not used for a period of two years,
shall lose its protected status and be subject to all of the provisions of this
bylaw; provided, however, that the SPGA may grant a special permit to
authorize the reestablishment of a nonconforming use or structure where
such reestablishment shall not result in substantial detriment to the
neighborhood.
8.7. NONCONFORMING OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
[Amended 3-25-2015 ATM by Art. 52; 3-23-2016 ATM by Art. 37]
be considered a nonconforming lot. [Amended 4-9-2014 ATM by Art.
32]
Existing Nonconforming Parking Spaces or Loading Bays. Any off-street
parking spaces or loading bays in existence on the effective date of this
bylaw or thereafter established, which serve a building or use, may not
be reduced in number, or changed in location or design contrary to the
requirements of § 5.1 so as to increase the degree of nonconformity
with the requirements of § 5.1.
Change of Use. A use of an existing structure or lot which does
not have sufficient parking or loading, including a use which has
no off-street parking or loading, may be expanded or changed to a
different type of use for which a different number of parking spaces
or loading bays is required as set forth in § 5.1.4 only if the net
increase in the number of required parking spaces or loading bays
is provided in conformity with § 5.1.
1.
Increase in Floor Area. If it is proposed to increase the net floor
area of a building, whether by addition to the exterior of the
building or by internal reconstruction, and the building does not
have sufficient off-street parking or loading bays, full compliance
with § 5.1 for the entire building shall be a condition of the issuance
of a building permit for the construction of the increase of net floor
area.
2.
Parking Spaces or Loading Bays in Existence. Parking spaces or
loading bays lawfully in existence which serve existing uses, are
no longer required for those uses under § 5.1, and comply with
the design standards of § 5.1.13, as to dimensions, loading bays,
surfacing, and grade, may be transferred to a new, changed, or
expanded use in an existing structure, even if they do not conform
to the requirements of § 5.1.13 as to setbacks, snow storage, access
for a parking lot, and landscaping.
3.
Parking Spaces or Loading Bays in Existence. Existing parking
spaces or loading bays that comply with the design standards
of § 5.1.13, as to dimensions, loading bays, surfacing, and grade,
4.
8.7.1
8.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS 8.7
1:221
that are no longer required for existing uses under § 5.1, may be
transferred to a new, changed, or expanded use in an existing
structure, even if they do not conform to the requirements of
§ 5.1.13 as to setbacks, snow storage, access for a parking lot, and
landscaping.
Credit. An applicant seeking credit for existing parking spaces or
loading bays shall first submit an off-street parking and loading
plan, as provided in § 5.1.3, certified by a registered land surveyor
or professional engineer. If the existing paved area is not marked
off into parking spaces or loading bays, such spaces or bays,
complying with § 5.1.13 shall be delineated on the plan. To qualify,
an existing parking space or loading bay shall be entirely on the lot.
5.
Reconstruction or Replacement of a Building.
If a building, for which sufficient off-street parking or loading is not
provided, is destroyed, damaged or demolished by the owner, the
building may be reconstructed or replaced if otherwise permitted
by this bylaw, without providing additional parking spaces or
loading bays provided the new building has the same or less net
floor area and the new uses require the same or fewer parking
spaces or loading bays. If parking spaces or loading bays were
provided before the destruction, damage, or demolition, at least the
same number of spaces or bays shall be provided.
1.
If the uses require a greater number of parking spaces or loading
bays, or if more net floor area is to be constructed than previously
existed, full compliance with § 5.1 for the entire building shall
be a condition of the issuance of any building permit for the
reconstruction or replacement of the building.

to whatever accompanying document(s) you are including with the form
to provide the below-required supplemental information.
A.
If applying for a special permit, on the "Application for Hearing,"
identify which subsection of § 135-88C applies.
B.
The application must be accompanied by a notarized certificate that
stipulates that all the statements and information provided in the
application and its attachments or enclosures are true and correct and
complete to the best of the signer's knowledge and that the certificate
is signed under the personal pains and penalties of perjury. If the
application is being made by or on behalf of an entity, this certificate
must be signed by an authorized representative of that entity.
C.
Section 135-91D, Permits.
Each application for a permit must contain site plans with sufficient
detail that would enable the Town to determine whether the proposed
facility meets the requirements of this Article XV.
As a minimum, include in the site plan package:
For all facilities:
Site plans and engineering drawings, prepared by a
professional engineer, professional architect, or professional
landscape architect licensed to practice in Massachusetts, on
as many sheets (each not exceeding 24 inches by 36 inches)
as necessary to show the following. Typewritten or printed
material shall be submitted in 8.5 inch by 11 inch format.
All material shall be drawn at scales and printed with fonts
and sizes consistent with easily legibility. Cite the vertical

wired, rather than wireless, mode. If any are not, explain
when and why such transmissions need to be by a wireless
mode. Describe in quantitative terms any noise generated
by the facility, including by any air-conditioning and
backup or alternate power equipment. If that noise would
be audible at any point and any time on the property
boundary, provide quantified sound-level data along the
property boundary for both the best-case and worst-case
ambient levels without the facility noise and then with the
facility noise added in. Describe what oil and hazardous
materials, including fuels and lubricants, will be used or
stored at the facility and what procedures will be taken to
ensure the proper handling and disposal of such materials.

(b)
(3)
§ 138-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-28
1:277
A concealed wireless communication facility may be
installed in a building or in a structure on a building
on a lot on which a multifamily dwelling or group care
facility (or other residential use listed in line 1.186 of
Table 1, Permitted Uses and Development Standards) is
the principal use provided all residents of such
multifamily dwelling or group care facility (or other
residential use listed in line 1.186 of Table 1, Permitted
Uses and Development Standards) receive 30 days' notice
before the application for a special permit is submitted.
Provide a copy of the notice and stipulate by whom, how,
to whom, and when the notice was provided.
Section 135-88C(2), Institutional, agricultural, natural
resource or commercial uses in residential districts.
A concealed wireless communication facility may be
installed in a building or in a structure on a building
on a lot on which an institutional, agricultural, natural
resource or commercial use in a residential district (as
provided in Subsections 2, 3, and 4 respectively of Table
1, Permitted Uses and Development Standards) is the
principal use.
Stipulate which subsection of Table 1 you believe applies.
A wireless communication facility may be installed if it is
co-located with an existing electrical power transmission
line tower, an existing nonconforming transmitting or
receiving tower, or a water tower, provided that the
wireless communication facility is camouflaged and does
not exceed the height of the tower as of January 1, 1998.
Cite the maximum heights of the facility and the existing
tower.
For the purposes of this section, an electrical power
transmission tower, an existing transmitting or receiving
tower or antenna for commercial activities other than a
wireless communication facility (as provided in line 14.13
of Table 1, Permitted Uses and Development Standards)
shall be considered to be a commercial use in a
residential district.
[2]
Section 135-88C(3), Uses in commercial districts.
A wireless communication facility may be installed on
a lot in a commercial district provided the wireless
communication facility is camouflaged and does not
exceed the height controls under § 135-39B.

control from § 135-39B.
[3]
§ 138-28 LEXINGTON CODE § 138-28
1:278
Section 135-88D, Locations with nonconforming situations.
The SPGA may grant a special permit to:
(1) Modify a pre-existing nonconforming wireless
communication facility, subject to the provisions of Article
VI of this By-Law; or
(2) Allow an existing wireless communication facility to be
reconstructed with a replacement wireless
communication facility if it decreases the degree of
nonconformity.
Stipulate which of the two circumstances you believe
applies and why. If (1) above, include what you consider
the applicable section in Article VI; if (2) above, describe
how and to what extent you plan to decrease the degree of
nonconformity.
(c)
Section 135-89A, Shelters and accessory buildings.
Any communication equipment shelter or accessory building shall be
designed to be architecturally similar and compatible with the
surrounding area. Whenever feasible, a building shall be constructed
underground.
Show in the site plan package how the architectural similarity and
compatibility would be achieved. If any of the buildings are not to be
underground, explain why you consider that is not feasible, citing the
engineering reasons as well as any financial impact.
C.
Section 135-89B, Setbacks.
Any new tower shall be set back at least one time the height of
the tower plus 10 feet from each lot line of the site on which the
tower is located. Any non-concealed antenna shall be set back at least
one time the height of the antenna, as measured from the ground
level, from each lot line of the site on which the antenna is located.
However, if the antenna is being attached to an existing tower whose
setback is already approved, either by right, by special permit or
by variance, and if the SPGA determines that the addition of the
antenna does not materially alter the basis of that prior approval,
then no new, independent setback requirement shall be created by
the addition of the antenna. In nonresidential districts or on Town of
Lexington owned land, the SPGA may grant a special permit to allow
a lesser setback if it makes a finding that such lesser setback provides
adequate safety, promotes co-location or improves design, and will not
negatively impact the appearance and character of the neighborhood.
Explain how the proposed setbacks comply with the above
requirements or, if any do not, specify which lesser setbacks
(variances) are being requested and the rationale.
D.
E. Section 135-89C, Security and signs.
§ 138-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-28
1:279
The area around the wireless communication facility shall be
completely secure from trespass or vandalism. A sign not larger than
one square foot shall be posted adjacent to the entry gate indicating
the name of the facility owner(s) and a twenty-four-hour emergency
telephone number. Advertising on any antenna, tower, fencing,
accessory building or communication equipment shelter is prohibited.
Explain how these requirements (security, signage, and no advertising)
will be satisfied. Note it is expected that these requirements are
applicable to every facility, even those concealed within other
structures, as all will warrant security and the identifying signage
at their point (or points) of entry (access). The emergency telephone
number is to be a toll-free telephone number which will be answered
or monitored 24 hours a day, every day, so an appropriate response is
provided in a timely manner.
Section 135-89D, Lighting.
Unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration, no exterior
night lighting of towers or the wireless communication facility is
permitted except for manually operated emergency lights for use when
operating personnel are on site.
Describe what lighting will be visible from outside the facility,
regardless of where the fixture may be mounted. If the proposed
lighting is in response to a requirement of the Federal Aviation
Administration, explain how that requirement applies to the proposed
facility.
F.
Section 135-89E, New towers.
Any new freestanding tower shall be of a monopole construction. New
towers shall not exceed the minimum height necessary to provide
adequate coverage within the Town of Lexington. Erection of a new
tower that exceeds the height restrictions listed in § 135-88 is not
permitted unless the applicant demonstrates in the special permit
process that adequate coverage within the Town of Lexington cannot
be met for the locations permitted under § 135-88.
Ensure that any freestanding tower proposed by you is of monopole
construction and that its depiction in the site plan package clearly
reflects it as such. Consistent with the overlays and exposure contours
provided per the above instructions for § 135-91D, explain how you
arrived at the proposed height being the minimum necessary to
provide adequate coverage within the town.
G.
H. Section 135-90, Justification of need.
§ 138-28 LEXINGTON CODE § 138-28
1:280
A. Coverage area. The applicant shall provide a map of the geographic
area in which the proposed facility will provide adequate coverage.
B. Adequacy of other facility sites controlled by the applicant. The
applicant shall provide written documentation of any facility sites
in the Town and in abutting towns or cities in which it has a legal or
equitable interest, whether by ownership, leasehold or otherwise.
Said documentation shall demonstrate that these facility sites do
not already provide, or do not have the potential to provide by site
adjustment, adequate coverage.
C. Capacity of existing facility sites. The applicant shall provide
written documentation that it has examined all facility sites located
in the Town and in abutting towns in which the applicant has no
legal or equitable interest to determine whether those existing
facility sites can be used to provide adequate coverage.
D. Adequate coverage through the least disruptive means. The
applicant shall provide written documentation that the proposed
facility uses the least disruptive technology (through the use of
repeaters or other similar technology as it may be developed
subsequent to adoption of this By-Law) in which it can provide
adequate coverage in conjunction with all facility sites listed above.
Each of the three above requirements must be addressed in the
engineer's report {see Subsection A(1)(d) above}.
Section 135-91A, Applicant.
The applicant or co-applicant for any permit for a wireless
communication facility must be a licensed carrier who has authority
from the FCC to provide wireless communication services for the
facility being proposed. The applicant shall submit documentation of
the legal right to install and use the proposed facility mount at the time
of the filing of the application for the permit.
Provide a copy of your existing license from the FCC under which
you (or the co-applicant licensed carrier) intend to operate the
proposed facility and cite the 47 CFR rule part and, if applicable,
subpart under which that license was granted and the maximum
radiated power allowed by that license.
(1)
Explicitly certify that, if permitted by the town, you (and any
assignees) would then install, operate, and maintain that facility in
strict and complete compliance with all federal, state, and Town
requirements as they apply to the facility at the time of your
application and throughout the permit period ("requirements").
(2)
If those requirements include submission of information on the
proposed facility or its operation, include a copy of that information
in your site plan package. In any case, and not to the exclusion
of other required information, include the information to the same
extent and in a similar format as had been required by the
(3)
I.
§ 138-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-28
1:281
Massachusetts Department of Public Health in their "Notification
of Nonionizing Radiation Source" as had been outlined under 105
CMR 122.021. Excluding the information comparable to what had
been in the "Notification of Nonionizing Radiation Source," if the
required information is voluminous, you may simply explicitly
reference it and defer submission to the Town until the Town
requests you to do so.
Explicitly cite whether routine environmental evaluation is
required by the FCC of the operation of the proposed facility and,
if so, how you intend to accomplish that evaluation.
(4)
Agree that failure to comply with the requirements could, after
appropriate show-cause notification and a reasonable time to cure,
be grounds for removal of noncomplying structures, buildings, and/
or devices by the Town at your expense.
(5)
Certify that nothing in any contract or lease to install, operate,
and maintain the proposed facility in any way precludes you from
fulfilling all those requirements.
(6)

Section 135-91H, Term of permit.
Each special permit shall be valid for a fixed or conditional period of
time as determined by the special permit granting authority. A special
permit for any wireless communication service facility that exceeds
height provisions of § 135-39B shall be valid for a maximum of 15
years. At the end of the approved time period, the facility shall be
removed by the carrier or a new special permit shall be required.
Stipulate the period of time you wish for the permit (not to exceed
15 years if the facility exceeds the height provisions of § 135-39B).
All permitted and special permitted wireless communication
facility carriers shall periodically file with the Town, every five
years (or sooner if specified in a special permit), on operational
aspects of the facility including: power consumption; power
radiation; frequency transmission; the number, location, and
orientation of antennas; and types of services provided.
(1)
Explicitly commit to the following reporting:
Every five years (or sooner if specified in a special permit),
the operator shall submit reports ("periodic report") on the
operational aspects of the facility, including the information
cited in § 135-91H. [Also see Subsection K(2)(c) below.] These
periodic reports shall be filed with the town's Office of
Community Development (Attn: Building Commissioner or
designee) within 10 business days after the end of the period
being reported on.
(a)
Each and every day any of the facility's radiated power levels
and/or power density levels exceed once or more any of the

Rules for Hiring Outside Consultants Under MGL c. 44, § 53G
[Added 2-1-2010]
§ 138-29. Purpose.
As provided by MGL c. 44, § 53G, the Lexington Board of Appeals may
impose reasonable fees for the employment of outside consultants, engaged
by the Board of Appeals, for specific expert services. Such services shall
be deemed necessary by the Board to come to a final decision on an
application submitted to the Board of Appeals pursuant to the requirements
of the Zoning Bylaw (MGL c. 40A), Comprehensive Permit (MGL c. 40B),
or any other state or municipal statute, bylaw or regulation, as they may
be amended or enacted from time to time. The Board of Appeals may also
impose fees for other consultant services related to application review, or
permit conditionings or monitoring, under any of the above-referenced laws
or regulations.
Special account. Funds received pursuant to these rules shall be
deposited with the Town Treasurer who shall establish a special
account for this purpose. Expenditures from this special account may
be made at the direction of the Board of Appeals without further
appropriation as provided in MGL c. 44, § 53G. Expenditures from
this account shall be made only in connection with a specific project
or projects for which a consultant fee has been collected from the
applicant. Expenditures of accrued interest may also be made for these
purposes.
A.
Consultant services. Specific consultant services may include, but are
not limited to traffic, drainage, noise. Services may also include on-site
monitoring during construction, or other services related to the project
deemed necessary by the Board. The consultant shall be chosen by, and
report only to the Board and/or its designee.
B.
Notice. The Board of Appeals shall give written notice to the applicant
of the selection of an outside consultant. Such notice shall state the
identity of the consultant, the amount of the fee to be charged to the
applicant, and a request for payment of said fee in its entirety. Such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date it is mailed or
delivered. No such costs or expenses shall be incurred by the applicant
if the application or request is withdrawn within five days of the date
notice is given.
C.
Fee payment. The fee must be received prior to the initiation of
consulting services. The Board may request additional consultant fees
if necessary review requires a larger expenditure than originally
anticipated or new information requires additional consultant services.
Failure by the applicant to pay the consultant fee specified by the
Board within 10 business days of the request for payment, or refusal
of payment, shall be cause for the Board to deny the application based
on lack of sufficient information to evaluate whether the project meets
D.
§ 138-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-29
1:285
applicable performance standards in the Zoning Bylaw or its
regulations. An appeal by the applicant stops the clock on the above
deadline; the countdown resumes on the first business day after the
appeal is either denied or upheld. A denial for lack of information
may be based solely on the lack of the third party consultant review
identified as necessary by the Board. Failure by the applicant to pay
the consultant fee specified by the Board within 10 business days of the
request for payment shall be cause for the Board to deny the permit
application.
Appeals. The applicant may appeal the selection of the outside
consultant to the Select Board, who may only disqualify the outside
consultant selected on the grounds that the consultant has a conflict of
interest or does not possess the minimum required qualifications. The
minimum qualifications shall consist of either an educational degree or
three or more years of practice in the field at issue or a related field.
Such an appeal must be in writing and received by the Select Board and
a copy received by the Board, so as to be received within 10 days of
the date consultant fees were requested by the Board of Appeals. The
required time limits for action upon the application shall be extended
by the duration of the administrative appeal.
E.
Return of unspent fees. When the Board's review of a project is
completed and a permit/decision issued, any balance in the special
account attributable to that project shall be returned within 30 days.
The excess amount, including interest, shall be repaid to the applicant
or the applicant's successor in interest. For the purpose of this
regulation, any person or entity claiming to be an applicant's successor
in interest shall provide the Board with appropriate documentation. A
final report of said account shall be made available to the applicant or
applicant's successor in interest.

Board of Selectmen  See Ch. 187.
§ 142-1. Purpose; applicability; hours of operation.
§ 142-2. General care of lots.
For the mutual protection of lot owners and the cemetery as a whole,
the following rules and regulations have been adopted by the
Massachusetts Cemetery Association, as the rules and regulations of
Westview Cemetery. With some exceptions as noted herein, these rules
and regulations also apply to Munroe Cemetery. All lot owners and
visitors within the cemetery, and all lots sold shall be subject to said
rules and regulations and subject further, to such other rules and
regulations, amendments or alterations as shall be adopted by the
Cemetery Association from time to time, and the reference to these
rules and regulations in the deed or certificate of ownership to a lot
shall have the same force and effect as if set forth in full therein. The
Cemetery Division, subject to the approval of the Board of Selectmen,
may make such rules and regulations consistent with the law, as it
deems expedient.
A.
Although the gate in Westview Cemetery is open year round, the office

Labor Day, Veteran's Day, Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Day. Where
immediate burial is required by the laws of the State of Massachusetts
or under the rules and regulations of the Board of Health, interments
may be made on Saturdays, Sundays, or some holidays. As described
herein, an additional fee(s) to cover overtime costs will be added to the
regular interment charge.
B.
Oversight of the cemetery operation comes under the direction of
the Public Grounds Superintendent. The general grounds/grave/
administrative care of the Westview Cemetery and three other
cemeteries in Lexington is assumed by the Cemetery Division of the
Department of Public Works and includes the cutting and watering
of the grass at reasonable intervals, the raking and cleaning of the

avenues. The Cemetery Division may plant, embellish, ornament and fence
and erect therein such suitable edifices and conveniences and make such
improvements as it considers necessary.
§ 142-4. Protection from loss or damage.
The Cemetery Division will take all reasonable precautions to protect lot
owners, and the property rights of lot owners, within the cemetery from loss
or damage; but the cemetery disclaims all responsibility for loss or damage
from causes beyond its reasonable control, and especially, from damage
caused by the elements, an act of God, common enemy, thieves, vandals,

invasions, insurrections, riots, or order of the military or civil authority,
whether the damage is direct or collateral, other than as herein provided.

The right to enlarge, reduce, or change the boundaries or grading of the
cemetery, or a section (s), from time to time, including the right to modify
or change the locations of or remove or regrade roads, drives, or walks, or
any part of it is hereby reserved. The right to lay, maintain and operate, or
alter or change pipe lines or gutters for sprinkler systems and drainage is
also expressly reserved, as well as the right to use cemetery property not
sold to individual lot owners for cemetery purposes, including interment of
the dead, incidental or convenient thereto. The cemetery reserves to itself
and to those lawfully entitled thereto a perpetual right to ingress and egress
over graves the purpose of passing to and from other graves.
§ 142-6. Conveyance of burial rights.
The general care assumed by the Westview Cemetery shall in no case
mean the maintenance, repair or replacement of any memorial, tomb,

or unusual work in the cemetery. Nor does it mean the reconstruction
of any marble or granite work or any section or plot, or any portion or

The cemetery reserves, and shall have, the right to correct any errors that

or the description, transfer or conveyance of any interment property, either
by canceling such conveyance and substituting and conveying in lieu
thereof other interment property of equal value and similar location as far
as possible, or as may be selected by the Cemetery Division, or in the sole
discretion of the Cemetery Division, by refunding the amount of money
paid on account of said purchase. In the event such error shall involve
the interment of the remains of any person in such property, the cemetery
reserves, and shall have the right to remove or transfer such remains so
interred to such other property of equal value and similar location as may
be substituted and conveyed in lieu thereof.
No lot or grave in any public cemetery in Lexington shall be sold to
any one who is not a resident of the Town of Lexington at the time
of such sale, unless the purchaser previously lived in Lexington for a
period of 20 or more years, unless waived by the Board of Selectmen.
Nonresidents may be interred if they are the owner of the lot or are
related by blood or marriage to the owner of such lot or a member of
the immediate family (parent, spouse, grandparent, sibling, daughter,
son or grandchildren) of such owner. There is an additional charge for
the interment of a nonresident. [Amended 5-2-2011[
B.
The conveyances of exclusive burial rights shall be made subject to the
provision that a percentage of the purchase price, to be determined
from time to time by the management, is deposited into a fund to be
known as the "Perpetual Care Fund." Money set aside by the Cemetery
Division for the Perpetual Care Fund shall be deposited with the
Trustees of Public Trusts, and said funds shall be managed and invested
by the Trustees of Public Trusts under the provisions of Section 5 of
Chapter 107 of the Legislative Acts of 1910. All other funds received

Trusts will hold and invest the principal sum deposited by the lot owner
and use the annual income therefrom to defray the cost of the general
operation of the cemetery.
D.
The Trustees of Public Trusts reserves the right to either to handle all
investments itself, or to deposit said funds with any person, company,
or corporation qualified to act as trustee for such funds.
E.
§ 142-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-9
1:289
§ 142-9. Descent of titles.
The laws of the State of Massachusetts govern the descent of title to
cemetery lots as well as other matters pertaining to assignments,
conveyances, devises, trust deeds and inalienability. The Cemetery Division
will assist any lot owner who needs information or advice on questions
pertaining to his/her lot.
§ 142-10. Interments.
All funerals on entering the cemetery shall be under the charge of the
Cemetery Division.
A.
Once a casket containing a body is within the confines of the Westview
Cemetery, no funeral director nor his embalmer, assistant, employee
or agent, shall be permitted to open the casket or to touch the body
without the consent of the legal representative of the deceased or an
order signed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
B.
When an interment is to be made in a lot, the location of such interment
shall be designated by the lot owner. Should the lot owner fail or
neglect to make such designation, the cemetery reserves the right to
make the interment in a location designed by the Cemetery Division.
C.
The employees of the Cemetery Division are the only persons who will
be allowed to open graves with the following exceptions:
When the cemetery is directed to make a disinterment by order of
a court of competent jurisdiction and a certified copy of such order
has been filed with the Cemetery Division.
(1)
When the coroner directs the disinterment for the purpose of
holding an inquest and has filed with the Cemetery Division his
signed authorization to release the body to himself and his lawful
agents. In such case, the disinterment must be made by the coroner
or his lawful agents. The cemetery employees will not be permitted
to assist the coroner or his agents.
(2)
D.
The right is reserved by the Cemetery Division to insist upon at least 48
hours' notice (with complete information) prior to any interment and at
least one-week notice prior to any disinterment or removal.

by telephone or for any mistake occurring from the want of precise
and proper instructions as to the particular space, size of grave, and
location in a plot, where interment is desired.

The Cemetery Division will not be liable for the interment permit nor
for the identity of the person sought to be interred.

§ 142-12. Plants and shrubs; flags.
of the city or Town from which the deceased may be brought, nor shall
any body be interred in any such grave or lot in which exclusive burial
rights have been conveyed until the Cemetery Division shall have been
furnished with an order from such owner or his legal representatives
for said interment. No interment shall be made unless all charges
against said lot or grave and all fees for such interment have been paid.
Producing of the deed for the exclusive burial right in any lot or grave
in any such cemetery shall be considered as authority for the opening
of a grave. Any person ordering an interment will be held responsible
for any and all expenses resulting from said order.
I.
No interment shall be used for any other purpose than for the burial of
the human dead.
J.
No burial will be scheduled later than noon on Saturdays, Sundays and
some holidays. After hours, weekends and some holidays burial policy:
Call the emergency number, 781-862-1618 to set up a burial for Monday
or Tuesday.
K.
In order to maintain a high standard of care and to eliminate sunken
graves caused by the collapse of caskets, it is required that all body
burials must be made in outside containers made of natural stone,
metal, or of reinforced concrete. For the interment of infants, fiberglass
containers must be used.
A.
All such containers must be so made and installed as to meet
specifications established by the Westview Cemetery. Outside
containers may be procured from any source, provided they meet the
established specifications which are available from the Cemetery
Division.
B.
The Town of Lexington initiated the sale of grave boxes in July 1992.
In October 1994 burial vaults were added. When cemetery employees
handle or install such containers, a reasonable charge will be made
for such service. When an outside contractor installs a container, a
contractor supervision fee will be assessed to assure the integrity of the
grave.
C.
The Cemetery Division will undertake to maintain, as may be
practicable, the planting of trees and shrubs, to preserve and maintain
landscape features, but does not undertake to maintain individual
plantings, urns or plants.
A.
There shall be no individual beds of shrubbery or flowers allowed on
the grounds unless installed by the Cemetery Division.
B.
§ 142-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-12
1:291
§ 142-13. Flush markers; head stones.
The Cemetery Division shall not be responsible for any kinds of planting
damaged by the elements, vandals, and thieves or by other causes
beyond its control. The Cemetery Division shall have the further
authority to remove all floral designs, flowers, weeds, trees, shrubs,
plants or herbage of any kind from the cemetery as soon as, in the
judgment of the Department, they become unsightly, dangerous,
detrimental or diseased, or when they do not conform to the standard
maintained.
C.
The Cemetery Division shall not be liable for floral pieces, baskets, or
frames in which, or to which, such floral pieces are attached beyond
the acceptance of such floral pieces for cemetery services held in the
cemetery. There shall be no clay, glass, or metal receptacles, or other
containers used on the premises for the holding of floral bouquets.
D.
The Cemetery Division encourages the placing of fresh flowers at
Easter, Mother's Day, Memorial Day, and Father's Day. However, please
use bronze or aluminum vases, which may be purchased from the
monument companies, or the galvanized vases from the Cemetery
Division. If the types of vases that are mentioned above are not
available, please be sure that the containers that are used are not
placed on the grass. Containers left on the grass for only a short period
of time kill the grass so it is mandatory that they be placed on the
marker.
E.
During the winter months, vases must be turned down or removed to
prevent damage and the possibility of person injury. Christmas wreaths,
sprays and artificial flowers may be placed in the cemetery after
November 20th and removed by March 1st. Memorial Day flowers must
be removed by the Sunday following Memorial Day.
F.
Flags may be placed at the graves for Memorial Day and Flag Day. They
may be placed by lot owners, veteran organizations, or other groups.
The Cemetery Division encourages the flags to be placed a week before
Memorial Day and removed by the week after Flag Day. The Cemetery
Division is not responsible for flags, or other personal property left at
the gravesite.
G.
Flowers including funeral flowers left at the cemeteries at other times
will be removed at the discretion of the Cemetery Division when they
become withered. Digging of any kind by anyone other than employees
of the Cemetery Division is absolutely prohibited.
H.
Effective as of January 15, 1992, in Westview Cemetery, the only type
of flush markers that are permitted will be of either granite or bronze
and will be a standard one foot by two feet in size to be placed at the
head of the grave. One marker per grave is all that is allowed.
A.
§ 142-12 LEXINGTON CODE § 142-13
1:292
§ 142-14. Fees and charges.
§ 142-15. Enforcement of rules.
The Superintendent of Public Grounds is hereby empowered to enforce
all rules and regulations. The Cemetery Division shall have charge of the
grounds and buildings, including the conduct of funerals, traffic, lot owners
and visitors, and at all times shall have supervision and control of all
persons in the cemetery.
§ 142-16. General rules of conduct. [Amended 5-2-2011]
The Cemetery Division employees are the only persons allowed to build
foundations for flush markers. Orders for installation of foundations are
accepted in the spring when the frost is out of the ground until the third
week in November.
B.
In Munroe Cemetery, the use of headstones is permitted, but before
any headstone or monument shall be erected in Munroe Cemetery, a
drawing of said headstone or monument must first be submitted to the
Cemetery Division for approval.
C.
The prices for which exclusive burial rights in any lot or grave in
such cemeteries and the charges for opening a grave and making
an interment shall be determined from time to time by the Board of
Selectmen, and all payments must be made in advance and before
any interment shall be permitted in said cemeteries. A schedule of the
current rates and service fees is included at the end of this chapter.
A.
The regulation that all charges must be paid before interment can be
made in said cemeteries may be waived in writing by the Director of
Public Works when circumstances or necessity require such a waiver.
B.
Overtime charges will be assessed in the following situations:
(1) The funeral arrives at the cemetery after 2:00 p.m. on a weekday.
(2) Next-day interment on a weekday with only 24 hours' notice.
(3) Only 24 hours' notice received for a Saturday burial.
When a call comes in later than 11:00 a.m. on Friday for Monday
burial.
(4)
(5) Saturday, Sunday or holiday burial.
C.
Resident requirement for sale. No lot or grave in any public cemetery
in Lexington shall be sold to anyone who is not a resident of the Town
of Lexington at the time of such sale, unless the purchaser previously
lived in Lexington for a period of 20 years or more, unless waived by
the Board of Selectmen and nobody shall be interred in such lot unless
the deceased was, at the time of his or her death, a resident of the
Town of Lexington, or the owner of such lot, or was related by blood or
A.
§ 142-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-16
1:293
marriage to the owner of such lot, or a member of the immediate family
of such owner. (Note: This restricts the sale of lots to residents of the
Town at the time of purchase, but, once the lot has been purchased,
there is no requirement that the owner remain a resident of the Town. A
nonresident owner and members of the immediate family can have the
right of burial).
Reconveyance of grave. No used lot or grave so conveyed by the
Cemetery Division shall be reconveyed by an owner thereof or the
heirs, executors or administrator of said owner to any person or entity
other than to a person related by blood or marriage to said owner or
to a member of the immediate family of said owner or to the Town
of Lexington. If the unused lot or grave is reconveyed to the Town of
Lexington, the owner or the heirs, executors or the administrator of
said owner shall be reimbursed by an amount equal to the original price
paid for such grave (Note: The ownership of graves that have been
used for interments remains in the family, and this provides that the
ownership of unused graves or lots can likewise remain in the family,
but it cannot be conveyed outside the family except to the Town of
Lexington. If the Town reacquires the lot or grave, it pays the original
purchase price. Since the Town loses money for the upkeep of the lot
or grave, in the sense that it has to subsidize that part of the cost
not covered by the income from the Perpetual Care Fund, it seems
reasonable that the Town not be required to pay interest on the amount
or to reimburse at the current price sale).
B.
Permits. No interments shall be made in any lot or grave in said
cemeteries until the Cemetery Division shall have been furnished with
such permits as may be required by the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts or of the city or Town from which the deceased may be
brought, nor shall anyone be interred in any such grave or lot in which
exclusive burial rights have been conveyed until the Cemetery Division
shall have been furnished with an order from such owner or his legal
representative for said interment. No interment shall be made unless
all charges against said lot or grave and all fees for such interment have
been paid.
C.
Authority to open grave. Any person who produces a deed for the
exclusive burial rights in any lot or grave in any such cemetery shall be
considered to have the authority to order an opening of a grave at that
site, and any person who orders an interment will be held responsible
for any and all expenses resulting from said order.
D.
Authorized employees. No grave shall be opened for interment or
removal of a body by any person who is not the employee of the
Cemetery Division of the Town of Lexington, and no body, once interred
in said cemetery, shall be disinterred except upon written request by
the lot owner or producer of the deed.
E.
Burial boxes or vaults. Burial boxes or vaults satisfactory to the
Cemetery Division must be provided for all interments.
F.
§ 142-16 LEXINGTON CODE § 142-16
1:294
Grave capacity. Not more than two adult bodies shall be interred in
any one grave. Not more than one adult body and two infant bodies
(fiberglass must be used) shall be interred in any one grave. Not more
than one adult body and two cremations shall be interred in any one
grave. Not more than four cremations shall be interred in any one
grave. All graves shall be placed on any lot in accordance with a plan
provided by the Cemetery Division.
G.
Walking on graves. Persons within the cemetery shall use only the
roads, walkways and paths, and no one is permitted to walk upon or
across lots or lawns unless it be necessary to do so to gain access to
one's own lot. The Cemetery Division expressly disclaims liability for
any injuries sustained by anyone violating this rule.
H.
Flower picking; grave defacing. Persons visiting the cemetery or
attending funerals are prohibited from picking flowers, wild or
cultivated, breaking or injuring any tree, shrub or plant, or from writing
upon, defacing or injuring any memorials, fence, or other structure
within the cemetery grounds.
I.
Control of automobiles. Automobiles and vehicles must be kept under
complete control at all times. When meeting a funeral procession, they
must stop until the procession passes. They must not pass a funeral
procession going in the same direction. Automobiles must not be left
with the engine running and the emergency brakes must be set when
the driver is not in his/her seat. Mufflers must not be opened nor
the horn sounded within the cemetery. The following things are also
prohibited:
The driving of automobiles or other vehicles through the gates or
in the cemetery at excessive speeds.
(1)
Driving any automobile or vehicle across or upon any grave, lot or
lawn or parking or leaving the same thereon.
(2)
Parking or leaving any automobile or vehicle on any road or
driveway within the cemetery at such location or in such position
as to prevent any other automobile or vehicle from passing the
same, and if so parked or left, the Cemetery Division will remove
the vehicle, at the owner's expense.
(3)
Making a complete or partial reverse turn of any automobile or
vehicle on any road or driveway within the cemetery.
(4)
J.
Waste receptacles. Receptacles for waste material are located at
convenient places throughout the cemetery. Therefore, the throwing of

buildings, is prohibited.
K.
Articles not to be placed on graves. The placing of upright flower boxes,
flag holders, flag emblems, toys, metal designs, balloons, vigil lights,
rocks, ornaments, chairs, settees, vases and similar articles, upon plots

§ 142-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-16
1:295

the right to remove them.
Memorial benches. Memorial benches may be purchased from the
Cemetery Division at a cost of $1,120 each. Payment can be made in
one lump sum or in two or four monthly installments. This is the only
bench that will be approved for installation. The Cemetery Division will
install and maintain the bench and associated landscaping. A total of 20
benches will be allowed at Westview Cemetery. Once 20 benches have
been installed, the program will be ended.
M.
Conduct within the cemetery. It is of the utmost importance that there
should be strict observance of the proprieties in the cemetery.
Therefore, all persons within the cemetery should avoid conduct

Smoking and Youth Access to Tobacco Products
[Adopted 11-8-1994, as amended effective1-5-1997; 6-11-1997;
6-12-2001; 12-8-2008; 7-1-2015]
§ 155-14. Findings.
§ 155-15. Definitions.
There exists conclusive evidence that tobacco smoke causes cancer,
respiratory diseases, various cardiac diseases, negative birth outcomes,
allergies and irritations to the eyes, nose and throat to both the smoker
and nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.
A.
Ongoing research attests to the health hazards of secondhand smoke.
According to the federal government, 83% of worker health complaints
related to indoor air quality are currently linked to smoking.
Elimination of secondhand smoke will substantially prevent the amount
of severe headaches, upper respiratory problems, cancer deaths and
heart-related deaths.
B.
The use of so-called smokeless tobacco has been shown to cause gum
disease, cancer and heart-related disease.
C.
Evidence further demonstrates that tobacco is extremely addictive.
Nearly all first-use of tobacco occurs before high school graduation and
more than 3,000 young people begin smoking every day in the United
States. Massachusetts' youths are beginning smoking at very young
ages. More than 90% of all Massachusetts smokers begin smoking
before the age of 21, and, nationally, in 2000, 69% of middle-schoolage
children who smoked at least once a month were not asked to
show proof of age when purchasing cigarettes according to the CDC.
Due to the addictiveness of tobacco and the long-range health effects
of tobacco use, ready access to cigarettes on the part of youth is a
concern. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (CDC) has
concluded that nicotine is as addictive as cocaine or heroin.
D.
According to the CDC's youth risk behavior surveillance system's 2010
Summary, any non-cigarette tobacco and nicotine delivery product can
be sold in a single "dose," enjoys a relatively low or no tax as compared
to cigarettes, is often available in fruit, candy, and alcohol flavors, and
is popular among youth.
Therefore it is the purpose and intention of the Board of Health to
regulate the sale of tobacco products in order to protect the health of
the youth, general public, and employees in the Town of Lexington.

Practice of Bodywork
[Adopted 10-18-2017]
§ 155-154. Statutory authority; effective date.
§ 155-155. Rationale and purpose.
Whereas persons working in this particular service industry have often been
found to identify themselves as bodyworkers in order to gain exemption
from the Massachusetts Rules and Regulations Governing Massage
Therapists, it is necessary to enact these Regulations Governing the
Practice of Bodywork to protect the public health and safety of the
community. The scope of these regulations is broad and includes many
aspects which if not adequately regulated could endanger the community
with the risk of prostitution, human trafficking and disease transmission.
It is the Board's intent that only individuals who meet and maintain a
minimum standard of competence and conduct within their scope of
practice as a professional may provide services to the public. These
regulations designate the requirements for obtaining a permit to operate
a bodywork establishment and permit to practice bodywork, as well as
grounds for suspension, revocation or denial of such a permit.
§ 155-156. Definitions.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVOCATION  Shall mean an administrative action
with immediate effect taken by the Department for cause when a permit
holder fails to renew a permit, or denies entry to an agent of the Department
during the conduct of an inspection. A permit holder whose permit has been
administratively revoked cannot lawfully continue to practice as a bodywork
therapist or to operate a bodywork establishment in the Town of Lexington.
Permits that have been administratively revoked may be reinstated upon
meeting the conditions contained in these regulations.
AGENT  Shall mean a person who has received delegation of authority
from the Public Health Director to perform functions subject to these
regulations.
APPLICANT  Shall mean a person seeking a permit that has submitted an
application and the applicable application fee for a permit to the Board of
Health.
APPLICATION  Shall mean the application approved by the Public Health
Director and provided by the Department.
On October 18, 2017, the Lexington Board of Health, pursuant to the

Due to a medical condition of a family member, a move would be
unduly disruptive or injurious to health, or the family cannot find
housing that meets its medical needs.
(3)
In the event that following the acceptance of your application for a
rental unit the net income of your household (as shown on your renewal
financial statement) rises above the income limits for your unit (as
contained in § 158-3 above), the rent for your renewal term, apart from
any general increase of rents, will increase to the current market rental
rate for comparably sized units in the Town of Lexington. For such
purposes current market rates shall be the average of the rents charged
for comparably sized units at Captain Parker Arms, Emerson Gardens
and Battle Green Apartments.
A.
However no increase under this section shall cause your rent during
any renewal term to exceed 25% of the current total net income of your
household or 30% if heat is provided by LexHab.
B.
After your rent reaches the current market rates as provided above,
your lease will not be renewed for more than one additional year.
C.
This section shall not constitute or be interpreted as a limitation on
LexHab's general right to withhold renewal as set forth in § 158-6A
above.
D.
LexHab will seek first to ensure that the gross rents from tenants will
be sufficient to meet LexHab's operating costs, including repairs and

to the number of bedrooms in a rental unit. LexHab seeks an
overall utilization factor for its units in the range of 1.5 to 2.0.
(2)
Third, in reviewing individual applications and in making its selections
LexHab will take into account, in addition to the above, the following
factors and criteria, in the order listed:
The applicant's need for housing. This factor shall include the

steps, such as the clearing of land, excavation, site preparation or
other preparatory steps, leading to the construction of a street or the
installation of municipal services or facilities, for which requirements
or standards are in these Regulations, unless and until a definitive
subdivision plan has been submitted to, approved, and endorsed by
the Planning Board and recorded in the Registry of Deeds or the Land
Court, and only then according to the conditions of approval and the
procedures set out in these Regulations.
A.
Complying Plans Must Be Approved. In accordance with MGL c. 41,

1.3. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
Purpose. The powers of the Town of Lexington and of the Planning
Board under the Home Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts
Constitution are exercised to promote the general welfare and

Identifying and securing, for present and future residents, the
beneficial impacts of growth and development;

Regulations, the Subdivision Control Law, MGL c. 41, §§ 81K to 81GG,
inclusive, and amendments to them, apply.

provision of these Regulations, or any decision or determination in the

them.
B.
Invalidation by Changes to State Law. Any part of these Regulations
that may later be invalidated by a new state law, or by amendment of an

A.
3.3 LEXINGTON CODE 3.4
1:454
these Regulations result primarily from and should be considered
as part of the ordinary cost of the business of real estate
development;
To approach a full reimbursement to the Town for the cost of
providing the review, approval, and inspection of a subdivision or
other development proposal and other actions to administer these
Regulations; and
(2)
To create incentives so that applicants will comply fully and
accurately with these Regulations to reduce the time spent by Town
employees on review, inspection, and administration, particularly
of material submitted several times.
(3)
Fees Required. An applicant submitting a proposed plan, a revision
to an approved plan or an application for rescission of a previously

the submittal of the application. Failure to submit this payment
is grounds for denial of the application.

3.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS 3.4
1:455
Schedule of administrative fees. The following schedule
applies to the types of applications to the Board:
Application Types Administrative Fees
Approval not required (ANR) $1,000, plus $500 per new
lot
Residential preliminary
subdivision
1 to 3 lots $1,000, plus $500 per lot
4 to 8 lots $1,500, plus $500 per lot
9 or more lots $2,000, plus $500 per lot

Nonresidential definitive
subdivision

Modifications $1,500
NOTE:
1 One payment of a fee for a residential preliminary plan is
creditable to the initial fee for a definitive plan. If more
than one fee is paid for a preliminary plan, only the first
of those payments is creditable to the initial fee for a
definitive plan.
(c)
Fees for revised applications. Because the administrative fee
is based on the proposed number of lots, should the proposed
number of lots increase, the applicant must pay a fee
equivalent to the difference between the original fee paid and
the fee that would have been paid had the original submission
included the additional lots. Failure to make this payment is
grounds for denial of the application.
(d)
Fee waivers. The Board may waive or reduce any
administrative fee, if, in the opinion of the Board, unusual
circumstances exist regarding the subject property or the
applicant.
(e)
Refund. Once the review process has begun, the Board will not
refund administrative fees, including the case of withdrawal of
the application by the applicant.
(f)
3.4 LEXINGTON CODE 3.4
1:456
Project review fees.
Applicability. In addition to an administrative fee, the Board
may impose a project review fee on those applications which
require, in the judgment of the Board, review by outside
consultants due to the size, scale or complexity of a proposed
project, the project's potential impacts, or because the Town
lacks the necessary resources to perform the review work
related to the permit or approval. In hiring outside consultants,
the Board may engage engineers, planners, lawyers,
designers, or other appropriate professionals able to assist
the Board and to ensure compliance with all relevant laws,
ordinances, bylaws, and regulations. Such assistance may
include, but shall not be limited to, analyzing an application,
monitoring or inspecting a project or site for compliance with
the Board's decisions or regulations, or inspecting a project
during construction or implementation.
(a)
Submittal. Should the Board require outside review, a project
review fee must be submitted to the Planning Office for deposit
in an account established pursuant to MGL c. 44 § 53G (53G
Account). Failure to make this payment is grounds for denial of
the application.
(b)
Schedule of project review fees. The following schedule applies
to the types of applications to the Board set forth below. Where
more than one type of application has been submitted for
Board action, only the largest of the applicable project review
fees may be collected for deposit into the 53G Account, and not
the sum of those fees.
Initial preliminary plan, modification of a preliminary plan,
or modification of a definitive plan:
Project Size Fee

Waiver of Specific Rules and Regulations. In accordance with MGL
c. 41, § 81R, the Board may waive strict compliance with specific
provisions of these Regulations in any particular case where such
action is in the public interest and consistent with the intent and
purpose of the Subdivision Control Law and of these Regulations. An
applicant is not entitled to a waiver, and the Board, in its discretion,
may decline to approve a request for a waiver.
A.
Application for a Waiver. Any person requesting a waiver must submit
the following with the application for approval of the subdivision plan:

B.
4.2 LEXINGTON CODE 4.3
1:462
4.4. ENDORSEMENT.
4.5. ENDORSEMENT CRITERIA.
scheduled meeting is canceled or postponed due to lack of a quorum or
weather conditions, the Planning Director is authorized to act for the
Board and must note the authorization on the plan. He or she must first:
Review the plan with the Chairman or, in his or her absence, the
Vice Chairman of the Board;
(1)
Determine whether the plan constitutes a subdivision as defined by
MGL c. 41, § 81L; and
(2)
Either endorse the plan or not endorse the plan, in which case he
or she must notify the applicant and the Town Clerk of the reasons
for not endorsing the plan.
(3)
Endorsement. If the Board determines that the plan does not require
approval, the majority of the members must endorse the plan with their
signatures. If the Board is not able to sign the plan at that time, the
Board may authorize the Planning Director to sign the plan, and such
authorization must be noted on the plan. If the Board endorses a plan
not requiring subdivision approval, it may add notes indicating why
approval is not required.
A.
Endorsement is Not an Approval. Endorsement of the plan is not an
approval of any subdivision or a determination by the Board as to
conformance with the Zoning Bylaw. It is only an endorsement that the
plan does not require approval under the Subdivision Control Law.
B.
Plans That Do Require Approval. If the Board determines that the
plan does require approval under the Subdivision Control Law, it must,
within 21 days of receipt of a complete application, give written notice
of its determination, stating its reasons, to the Town Clerk and to the
applicant.
C.
Failure To Act within 21 Days. If the Board, or the Planning Director
as provided in Section 4.3B, fails to act upon a plan considered to
be complete or fails to notify the Town Clerk of its reasons for not
endorsing the plan within the required twenty-one-day period, the plan
must be deemed not to require approval under the Subdivision Control
Law. The applicant may then request, and the Town Clerk must issue,
a certificate that the plan is approved because of the Board's failure to
act.
D.
Procedure and Time Allowed for Recording. The applicant must record
the endorsed plan within the time provided for in the Subdivision
Control Law at the Registry of Deeds and must furnish the Planning
Office with a certified copy of the plan, as recorded.
E.
4.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS 4.5
1:463
Criteria. The Board must determine that approval under the
Subdivision Control Law is not required and must endorse the plan if
and only if each lot and parcel shown on the plan either:
Has at least the minimum frontage on a street required by the
Zoning Bylaw; or
(1)
Is to be joined to an abutting lot and the following note appears
on the plan: "Parcel X is to be joined to Lot Y and is not to be
considered to be a separate lot."; or
(2)
The note "For the purposes of the Subdivision Control Law, Parcel
X cannot be used for the site for a building." appears on the plan.
(3)
A.
Existing Buildings. Notwithstanding the criteria above, the Board must
endorse a plan where every lot or parcel on the plan:
(1) Contains a substantial building which existed on April 4, 1948; or
Is to be joined to an abutting lot and the following note appears
on the plan: "Parcel X is to be joined to Lot Y and is not to be
considered to be a separate lot."; or
(2)
The note "For the purposes of the Subdivision Control Law, Parcel
X cannot be used for the site for a building." appears on the plan.
(3)
B.
Frontage on Unaccepted Street. An unaccepted street not shown on
a plan approved under the Subdivision Control Law must meet the
standards for streets and ways described in Section 7.2 of these
Regulations to provide the frontage required in Section 4.5A.
C.
Frontage on Subdivision Street. An unaccepted street shown on a plan
approved under the Subdivision Control Law must meet the following
conditions to provide the frontage required in Section 4.5A:
The construction of the subdivision street has been completed, has
been approved by the Town Engineer and the Board, and the surety
being held for completion of the subdivision has been released; or
(1)
An ANR plan may be submitted to change the shape or size of lots
shown on a previously approved subdivision plan, provided that the
approved way is built or a performance guaranty is in place.

Board and to the Board of Health of a preliminary subdivision plan, the
Board must approve the preliminary subdivision plan, with or without
waivers and conditions, or disapprove the plan, stating the reasons for
the disapproval. The Board may include recommendations for features
that should be included in a definitive subdivision plan.
A.
Approval Criteria. The standards for approval of a definitive subdivision
plan will be the basis for the decision on a preliminary subdivision
plan to the extent permitted by the information submitted as part of a
preliminary subdivision plan.
B.
Relationship to Definitive Plan.
Approval of a preliminary subdivision plan does not constitute
approval of a subdivision or guarantee that the Board will approve
a definitive subdivision plan. The Registry of Deeds is not permitted
to record a preliminary subdivision plan.
(1)
Disapproval of a preliminary subdivision plan does not prevent
the submission of a definitive subdivision plan. If a definitive plan

endorsement of the definitive plan. Failure to do so may result in the
rescission of the approval of such plan, unless the Board extends said
period, for good cause shown, after the written request of the applicant
not less than 30 days before the expiration of said period.
B.
Construct Streets and All Required Utilities. As a condition of approval
of a subdivision, the applicant agrees to construct streets and complete
all other work specified on the definitive plan or required under these
Regulations, meet all relevant provisions of the Zoning Bylaw and other
bylaws, including installation of required utilities in such subdivision,
and all work incidental to them, such as grading of lots to provide
drainage, construction of retaining walls and other details or as
specifically required by the Board.
C.
Perpetual Rights and Easements.
As a condition of approval of a subdivision, the owner must grant
to the Town a right and easement to construct, repair, replace,
extend, operate, use and forever maintain all water mains, sewer
mains, and all surface and subsurface stormwater drains in,

must retain and reserve the necessary rights and easements in any
conveyances or mortgaging of land or lots and in the recording of
plans and easements.
The owners must grant the Town the right to enforce on-street
parking regulations within the subdivision and on any streets
connecting the subdivision to the public street system. For projects
that include minor streets, an instrument prohibiting parking and
granting the Town enforcement rights will be required.
(3)
Post-Construction Responsibilities of Owners. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 6.3D, it is the responsibility of the owners and
owners' successors in title to all or any portion of the subdivision to
maintain the landscaping, streets, and utilities within the subdivision
until formally accepted by the Town. The owner must provide a
supplemental covenant agreeing to maintain the streets and utilities,
including snow removal, and permitting the Town to maintain them if
necessary at the expense of the owners.
E.
Plan. If no notice of appeal has been filed with the Town Clerk, or
if an appeal has been taken and disposed of in a way which leaves
the definitive plan approved and the Town Clerk has endorsed the
plan to that effect, any required modifications have been made or
referred to on the plan, together with any conditions of approval, and
the agreed-upon security has been accepted by the Board, the Board
must endorse its approval on the plan, including the dates of approval
and of endorsement, and return the plan originals to the applicant.
The applicant must record the original property rights and dimensional
standards plan and street layout and profile plans in the Registry of

page or document number of recording.
A.
Certificate of Action. The certificate of action and any easements and
covenants must be recorded at the same time as the plans.
B.
Supplemental Covenant. The Board may require, before the
endorsement of the definitive plan, a supplemental covenant containing
those conditions of approval that are intended to survive the release
of the statutory covenant. The Board's Legal Counsel must approve
such covenant as to form. Such covenant must be executed and duly
recorded by the owners of record, and must run with the land. The
covenant must be referenced on the definitive plan before recordation
in the Registry of Deeds. The applicant must promptly, after recording,
send a copy of the covenant, showing book and page number, to the
Board.
C.
6.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS 6.5
1:475
Security for Construction of Ways and Improvements Required. The
Board must not endorse its approval on the plans until security for
the construction of ways and the installation of the required municipal
services and other improvements to serve the subdivision has been
provided. One of the methods in this section must be selected but may
be varied from time to time by the applicant, so that different parts of
the subdivision may be secured by different methods, as long as the
entire subdivision is secured by one method or another.
A.
Bond or Surety. The applicant may give a bond, bankbook, or other
readily negotiable security in the amount estimated by the Board to
fully cover the cost, including inflation and contingencies, of
constructing the ways and installing the municipal services or utilities
to serve the lots enumerated in such bond or in a separate agreement
referring to such bond. Such bond or security if filed or deposited must
be approved as to form by the Board's Legal Counsel and as to sureties
by the Town Treasurer. Such bond or security must be contingent on
the completion of such improvements no later than three years from the
date of the endorsement of the definitive plan. Failure to so complete
will result in the automatic rescission of the approval of the definitive
plan by the Board, unless the Board extends said period, for good cause
shown, after the written request of the applicant before the expiration
of said period. Upon satisfactory performance of all required work,
the bond or other security may be released by a vote of the Board
and returned to the applicant. Upon failure to satisfactorily complete
the work within the time specified, or within such further time as the
Board may grant, the Board must have the right to enforce said bond
or realize upon other security to the extent necessary to complete
the work to the satisfaction of the Board. In accordance with MGL
c. 41, § 81U, the Board may expend the proceeds of such bond or
deposit not exceeding $25,000 without specific appropriation by the
Town, provided the Board of Selectmen approves the expenditure. At
the anniversary date of posting of a bond or other security and when
circumstances otherwise call for such action, the Town may verify that
the security is still in force and effect and that the surety or financial
institution is solvent and capable of paying the required amount.
Amount. In determining the amount of the bond or surety, the
Board will be informed by the following formula in setting the sum
of the security:
(a) The applicant's estimate of the cost to complete the work; plus
(b) A ten-percent contingency; plus
(c) Cost increases due to inflation over a five-year period; plus
(d) Costs associated with as-builts and street acceptance plans.
(1)
Required terms. All performance bonds must contain the following
provision:
(2)
B.
6.5 LEXINGTON CODE 6.5
1:476
If the Principal fully and satisfactorily observes and performs per
the qualifications and time schedule set forth here specified all the
covenants, agreements, terms, and provisions in the following:
(a) The application for definitive plan approval;
(b) The Subdivision Control Law and the rules and regulations
of the Planning Board which govern this subdivision;
(c) The Decision of the Planning Board dated _____ and
attached to this as Exhibit A; and
(d) The definitive plan, as approved by the Planning Board in
the Decision;
Then this obligation is void; otherwise, it remains in full force
and effect and the sum must be paid to the Town of Lexington as
liquidated damages.
The penal sum of the bond or the amount of other security may
be reduced from time to time by the Board upon request of the
developer upon the partial performance of the required
improvements.
(3)
Construction Mortgage Agreement. The applicant and the lending
institution which provides a construction loan for the subdivision may
enter into an agreement with the Board, whereby the lender must at
all times retain a portion of the loan adequate to cover the cost of all
outstanding work of construction of ways and installation of municipal
services or other required improvements, and release portions of the
amount so retained upon certification by the Board that the
corresponding portion of the required work has been satisfactorily
completed. Upon failure of the applicant to perform the required work
within the agreed-upon period, the lender must make so much of the
retained money as may be necessary to complete the required work
available to the Board. Upon satisfactory completion of all required
work, the applicant may request the release of the agreement and
proceed in the same manner as under Section 6.6.
C.
Statutory Covenant. Before the endorsement of the definitive plan, the
applicant may elect to submit a covenant for review by the Board
stating that no lot in the subdivision may be sold and no building may
be erected thereon until the improvements specified in the decision and
on the definitive plan are constructed and installed so as to adequately
serve said lot or lots. The Board's Legal Counsel must approve such
covenant as to form. Such covenant must be executed and duly
recorded by the owners of record, and must run with the land. Such
covenant must state that the improvements shown on the definitive
plan must be completed no later than three years from the date of
the endorsement of the definitive plan. Failure to so complete the
improvements may result in the rescission of the approval of the
definitive plan by the Board, unless the Board extends said period, for
good cause shown, after the written request of the applicant no less
D.
6.5 GENERAL PROVISIONS 6.5
1:477
6.6. RELEASE OF SECURITY.
than 30 days before the expiration of said period. The covenant must be
referenced on the definitive plan before recordation in the Registry of
Deeds. After recording, the applicant must promptly send a copy of the
covenant to the Board, showing the book and page number.
Converting Covenant to Another Performance Guaranty. If the applicant
desires that lots be released from a covenant and that the
improvements remaining to be constructed or installed be secured by
another form of performance guaranty, a formal written request must
be sent to the Board by registered mail, which sets forth and includes:
Extent. The extent and scope of remaining work to be completed to
satisfy the requirements for the construction or installation of all
required ways and municipal services.
(1)
Estimate. An estimate, under these Regulations, which reflects all
remaining costs related to the construction of all required ways and
installation of all required municipal services.
(2)
Form and type. The form and type of guaranty being given to the
Board to secure all remaining improvements.
(3)
Board action. The Board or its agent will make a determination as
to the sufficiency of the submitted estimate, and, if such estimate is
accepted, a new performance guaranty will be given to the Board.
Upon acceptance by the Board of the new performance guaranty,
all applicable lots must be released from the covenant.
(4)
E.
Converting Bond, Deposit, or Agreement to Covenant. If the applicant
desires to secure by means of a covenant the construction of ways and
the installation of municipal services in a portion of a subdivision for
which no building permits have been granted nor any lots have been
sold, and to have the Board release the bond, deposit of money or
negotiable security, or agreement and mortgage previously furnished
to secure such construction and installation, the applicant must submit
to the Board a reproducible tracing and three contact prints of the
reproducible tracing of the definitive plan, limited to that part of the
plan which is to be subject to such covenant. Upon approval of the
covenant by the Board, reference to them must be inscribed on such
section of the plan, and it must be endorsed by the Board and recorded
with the covenant at the expense of the applicant. Certified copies of all
documents that the applicant records at the Registry of Deeds must be
provided to the Board as in these Regulations.
F.
General. Upon completion of required improvements, security for the
performance of which was given by the bond, deposit, or covenant,
or upon the performance of any covenant with respect to any lot, the
applicant, at his expense, must send by registered or certified mail
to the Town Clerk and the Board a written statement that the said
A.
6.5 LEXINGTON CODE 6.6
1:478
construction or installation which has been secured in connection with
such bond, deposit, covenant or agreement has been completed per
the requirements contained in these Regulations. Such statement must
contain:

completed per the definitive plan.
(5)
When applicable, a written certification from the Board of Health
that the installation of sewage disposal facilities has been
performed satisfactorily.
(6)
Copies of or reference to the necessary instruments, executed by
the applicant, transferring to the Town all utilities and easements
as shown on the definitive plan. (See below.)
(7)
Refusal. If the Board determines that said construction or installation
has not been completed, it must specify to the Town Clerk and to
the applicant, in writing by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, the details wherein said construction and installation must
have failed to follow the requirements contained in these Regulations.
B.
Constructive Release. Upon failure of the Board to act on such
application within 45 days after receipt of them by the Town Clerk and
the Board, all obligations under the bond must cease and terminate by
operation of law, and any deposit must be returned and any covenant
must become void. If that said forty-five-day period expires without
such specification, or without the return of the deposit or release of
the covenant as previously mentioned, the Town Clerk must issue a
certificate to such effect, duly acknowledged, which may be recorded.
C.
As-Built Plans. The following as-built plans and profiles, prepared by
an engineer or land surveyor, based on an on-the-ground survey done
within six weeks of submittal, must be submitted to the Board following

or Town Engineer. These may be new plans or full-size prints of the
approved definitive plans showing in red or other clearly
distinguishable color all differences between the approved and the
actual construction. Where the departures are considered significant,
the Board may require corrective work or may require engineering
calculations to substantiate acceptability of work as done. All submitted
material must also be supplied in digital form, as described in Section
3.3.E(4).
A street layout plan, typically at a scale of one inch equals 40 feet,
in a form approved by the Town Engineer as suitable for submission

A plan and profile, typically at a scale of one inch equals 40 feet,
detailing street locations, house locations, if any, and grades and
the location and elevation of all underground utilities and
appurtenances, including rim grades, percent of slope for sewer
and drain lines, and contours, of two-foot intervals, for a distance
of 40 feet from the sideline of any street layout, utility easement,
the boundaries of any resource protection zoning district, and the
boundary of any area which the Conservation Commission has
previously determined to be subject to MGL c. 131, § 40, "as built."
(2)
The engineer must obtain, from actual field survey and other
sources as may be necessary, such information as is necessary to
properly identify any as-built locations of all underground utilities.
(3)
General. Under MGL c. 41, § 81W, the Board may, upon its own motion
or upon the request of any person interested, amend, modify or rescind
the approval of a definitive plan. Failure to follow these Regulations
or the specifications and conditions in the approval of the definitive
plan may constitute a basis for such action by the Board. Such action
may include the utilizing of any security posted by the applicant, the
rescission of subdivision approval and all other measures provided by
law.
A.
Procedure. The procedure for the amendment, modification, or
rescission of a definitive plan, under MGL c. 41, § 81W, must conform

1:480
SECTION 175-7.0
REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS
7.1. SITE DESIGN.
Site Design Objectives.
Design objectives. Proposed developments must be located to
preserve and enhance the natural features of the site, including
tree canopy, to avoid disturbance of environmentally sensitive
areas, to minimize adverse impacts of development on adjoining
properties, to minimize the alteration of the natural features of the
site and to preserve and enhance scenic points, historic buildings
and places and similar community assets which add value and
attractiveness to the subdivision and the Town.
(1)
Residential development. The construction of streets and municipal
facilities and of dwellings in a residential development must
consider topography, natural features, and drainage and must
promote privacy for residents, adequate solar access, tree canopy,
planting and other natural elements and consistency with the
overall aesthetic appearance of the development.
(2)
Commercial development. The construction of streets and
municipal facilities and of buildings in a commercial development
must consider topography, natural features, and drainage and must
reduce the impacts of noise, odor, glare and the scale of
development on adjoining properties.
(3)
Unsuitable land. Land that the Board determines to be unsuitable
for development due to flooding, improper or adverse drainage,
adverse topography, poor soils, bedrock, location of utility
easements or other features that the Board determines may be
harmful to the safety, health, convenience and general welfare
of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and or its
surrounding area must not be subdivided or developed unless
adequate measures are planned by the applicant and approved by
the Board to eliminate any short-term or long-term impacts created
by development of the unsuitable land.
(4)
A.
Lots; Property Rights.
Compliance with Zoning Bylaw. All lots shown on the plan must
meet the frontage, area, shape, and access requirements of the
Zoning Bylaw.
(1)
Relationship of lot to street. Every lot must have adequate access
for pedestrians, automobiles, emergency vehicles, such as firefighting
apparatus and ambulances, and larger vehicles, such as
delivery trucks.
(2)
B.
7.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.1
1:481
Lot arrangement. Lots must be arranged so that there will be no
foreseeable difficulties in securing building permits to build on all
lots due to lack of compliance with the Zoning Bylaw; because of
topography, soils, bedrock, improper drainage or other conditions;
or in providing practical, workable access to buildings on each lot.
(3)
Easements.
Utility easements, where necessary, must be at least 20 feet
wide.
(a)
When a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream, or has a stormwater storage
facility, the Board may require an easement of adequate width
to conform substantially to the lines of the feature and to
offer for the possibility of flooding, protection of banks and
adjacent properties, construction or future maintenance and
other necessary purposes.
(b)
Slope easements must be offered where necessary to ensure
lateral support and protection of streets and other construction
features.
(c)
No section of a street, pedestrian path, bicycle path, water
system, sanitary sewerage system, storm drainage system or
another utility system may be approved if it requires a
connection to the land of other owners unless appropriate
easements are first obtained.
(d)
(4)
Subdivision straddling municipal boundaries. Whenever access to
the subdivision or any lot in it is required to cross land in another
town or city, the Board may require documentation that access for
the intended use has been legally established in that town or city as
a public street or as part of an approved subdivision in accordance
with local zoning. In general, lot lines should be laid out so as not
to cross municipal boundaries.
(5)
Self-imposed restrictions. If, as part of a subdivision application,
the applicant or owner places voluntary restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision that is greater than the
requirements of these Regulations or Zoning Bylaw, such
restrictions or references to them must be shown on the definitive
plan and recorded in the Registry of Deeds.
(6)
Bounds.
Permanent reference bounds for surveying must be set:
Along each right-of-way line at all intersections, angle
points, points of change in direction or curvature of
streets, and at the two corners of each lot that abuts the
right-of-way; and
[1]
(a)
(7)
7.1 LEXINGTON CODE 7.1
1:482
Along each line of any easement at angle points, points of
change in direction or curvature.
[2]
If a permanent bound is set on a long straight line, bounds
must be set so that each is visible, or not more than 500 feet,
from the next bound in each direction.
(b)
Permanent bounds must be of granite or reinforced concrete
six inches square and three feet long with a one-inch deep onehalf-
inch diameter drill hole in the top. Permanent bounds must
be set in bank run gravel and must be set flush with the surface
of the ground per the Standard Specifications. Where the soil
makes the setting of permanent bounds impractical, alternate
types of permanent monumentation may be used with the prior
approval of the Town Engineer.
(c)
Markers. In addition to locations where permanent bounds are
required, a permanent reference marker for surveying must be set
along each lot line at angle points, points of change in direction or
curvature. Permanent markers must be metal pipes or pins at least
24 inches in length and must be embedded in the ground so that
they are not easily removed or shifted from the point they mark.
(8)
General Construction Requirements.
Construction specifications. If the subdivision plan proposes
construction for which standards or specifications are not given
by these Regulations, the Board's Development Regulations, or
the Town's Standard Specifications, the Massachusetts Highway
Department Standard Specification for Highways and Bridges,
latest edition, will apply. If there is a difference between the Town's
Standard Specifications and the Massachusetts Highway
Department Standard Specification for Highways and Bridges, the
Town Engineer must determine which standard or specification will
apply.
(1)
Reimbursement for extra construction. The Board may require
an applicant to install municipal services and construct ways of
greater width or size than the requirements for the subdivision
alone with the added cost to be reimbursed by the Town. Under no
circumstances will a developer be reimbursed for the construction
of a street with a pavement less than 33 feet wide, nor will a
reimbursement be made for extending streets and utilities to the
subdivision's boundaries.
(2)
Improvements across entire frontage. The improvements required
by these Regulations must be constructed across the entire
frontage of any lot the subdivision of which is approved by the
Board.
(3)
Accessibility. All proposed improvements must comply with MGL c.
22, § 13A and all regulations adopted under it.
(4)
C.
7.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.2
1:483
7.2. STREETS AND RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
Complete Streets Design Objectives. All subdivision street plans and
designs must provide appropriate accommodations for all
transportation system users, including pedestrians, cyclists, transit
users, and motorists. Complete streets are designed and operated to
enable safe access for users of all ages and abilities. Street designs
should be developed in a context-sensitive manner in which
consideration is given to the surrounding physical environment, land
uses, as well as the location of existing and other planned infrastructure
to support a multi-mode transportation network.
General objectives. The subdivision street system must be designed
to:
Permit the safe, efficient and orderly movement of motor
vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles.
(a)
Meet, but not exceed, the needs of the present and projected
future population to be served.
(b)
Offer easy and prompt access by emergency vehicles, such as
fire, police and ambulance vehicles, and to permit effective
delivery of Town services, such as snow removal, school bus,
and refuse removal services.
(c)
Contribute to a safe and efficient Town-wide system of
movement of motor vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles.
(d)
Promote connections for pedestrians, bicycles, and motor
vehicles between adjacent neighborhoods and more direct
access to public facilities, such as schools, recreation areas,
and open space.
(e)
Provide alternatives to the Town's few arterial streets to
connect adjacent neighborhoods.
(f)
Promote public transportation and increased pedestrian and
bicycle accommodations in order to reduce vehicular
congestion and environmental pollution.
(g)
Minimize the long-term costs for maintenance and repair of
streets.
(h)
Enhance the appearance of the subdivision and the Town by
achieving a visually attractive streetscape.
(i)
(1)
Residential subdivisions. In addition, the street system in a
residential subdivision must be designed to:
Discourage use of streets in residential neighborhoods by
through traffic that originates or has a destination:
[1] Outside of the Town.
(a)
(2)
A.
7.2 LEXINGTON CODE 7.2
1:484
[2] In a commercial area.
In residential neighborhoods in the Town that are a mile or
more away.
[3]
Protect the residential character of the development by
encouraging safe-speed travel within the subdivision and
reducing noise and fumes.
(b)
Promote safe travel by bicycles and pedestrians and, where
possible, offer facilities for them separated from automobiles.
(c)
Commercial subdivisions. In addition, the street system in a
commercial subdivision must be designed to:
Encourage carpooling, van services, cycling, and public
transportation and a reduction in single-occupant automobiles.
(a)
Reduce congestion on nearby streets and preserve adequate
transportation capacity and user safety at affected
intersections and street segments.
(b)
(3)
Layout and Alignment of the Street System.
Must connect to a public street.
Each street within a subdivision must connect to and be
accessible from the public street system, either directly or via
some combination of:
Streets approved as part of another definitive subdivision
plan which have either been constructed in accordance
with that plan or for which adequate surety exists to
guarantee satisfactory completion of the street;
[1]
Streets other than those above which are built to the same
design standards as new subdivision streets constructed in
compliance with these Regulations; or
[2]
[3] One or more other streets in the subdivision.
(a)
In order to meet these requirements, the applicant may
improve existing streets at its own expense. The Board may
not approve a subdivision plan that requires improvement of
a street if a competent legal opinion is presented that the
applicant does not have the necessary rights to make such
improvements unless the Town Counsel provides an opinion
that any potential legal impediments to such construction have
been removed.
(b)
(1)
Streets continuous. Where there is more than one street within a
subdivision, streets must be connected into one continuous system.
(2)
(3) Intersections.
B.
7.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.2
1:485
Streets must be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles, and in no case at less than a seventy-five-degree
or more than a one-hundred-five-degree angle.
(a)
New subdivision streets may be constructed at an intersection
of two existing streets if the proposed subdivision street is
aligned opposite one of the existing streets.
(b)
An intersection of two streets may not be within 125 feet of any
other existing or proposed intersection as measured between
the points of intersection of the center lines of the intersecting
streets.
(c)
Extension to Adjoining Land.
Easement reserved for an extension to adjoining land. When land
adjoining the subdivision can be developed, the subdivision plan
must allow for the future extension of streets and other public
facilities to the adjoining land. The subdivision plan must reserve
an easement to the adjoining land for the future extension of the
street and other public facilities.
(1)
Reserve strips prohibited. Where a way within the subdivision
passes within 25 feet of an adjacent property, the subdivision plan
must reserve an easement providing access from the way to the
adjacent property.
(2)
Reconstruction of street if development of adjoining land occurs
later. If the adjoining land is later developed, the developer of that
land may extend the street and utilities to the adjoining land. Such
construction must include the removal of any turnaround. Any land
within the right-of-way that was part of the turnaround and is no
longer needed for an extended right-of-way must be landscaped
and deeded to the abutters.
(3)
Utility stubs extended.
The Board may require the developer to construct stubs of
utility lines and other underground services and facilities to
the edge of the right-of-way so that future extension of the
street and utilities can be made without digging trenches in the
street.
(a)
The Board may require the developer to construct a wye stub
of newly constructed utility lines to the edge of the right-of-way
of a street to serve lots that abut the street but are not in the
subdivision so that those lots may connect to the Town system
later without digging trenches in the street.
(b)
(4)
C.
Street Classification.
(1) Compliance with the Classification System.
D.
7.2 LEXINGTON CODE 7.2
1:486
The street type is defined by assessing the street's proposed
role in the Town's (and regional) transportation system,
together with its surrounding built and natural environment.
Lexington is generally suburban in character, with some parts
appearing rural and some quite urban, which makes
identifying the unique or project-specific contextual elements
crucial to determining the appropriate design.
(a)
For the purposes of an application, the Board will determine
the classification of each proposed street.
(b)
Classes. The street type reflects its degree of local access and
regional connectivity as described below:
Arterials. Arterials have a high to moderate degree of regional
connectivity at a wide range of speeds with a low to high
level of local access. Examples include Waltham Street and
Massachusetts Avenue.
(a)
Collectors. Collectors have a low to moderate degree of
regional connectivity, at a wide range of speeds, with a higher
degree of local access than arterials. Grant Street, Hill Street,
and Lincoln Street are examples of collectors.
(b)
Local streets. Local streets have a low to no degree of regional
connectivity, low speeds, and a high degree of local access.
(c)
Minor streets. Minor streets are a subset of local streets that
serve, directly or indirectly, fewer than 10 existing, proposed,
or potential dwelling units. Minor streets are typically, but not
always, dead-end streets.
(d)
(2)
Street Names. Street names must be different enough in sound
and in spelling from other street names in Lexington so as not to
cause confusion. A street that is planned as a continuation of an
existing street must have the same name. The extension of a street
to connect to another street with a different name must have the
name of the longer street. The Board, after consultation with the
Town's public safety officials, determines the name of the street.
(3)
Street name signs. Street signs must be erected on two-inch inside
diameter posts at all street intersections per the Standard
Specifications. A temporary street name sign with black letters
four inches long on light background must be erected at the time
work is started in that part of a subdivision at all points where
permanent signs will be required. The developer must keep
complete visibility of street name signs until they are replaced
by permanent signs that follow the Town's specifications, at the
developer's expense.
(4)
E. Design Standards for Streets and Rights-of-Way.
7.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.2
1:487
Design standards for streets and rights-of-way.
These standards draw from and rest upon several important
street design resources. These standards are consistent with,
and in the case of silence or conflict should be referred to those
described in:
The 2011 edition of "A Policy on Geometric Design of
Highways and Streets," by The American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO);
[1]
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation's
specific guidance on complete streets design standards
found in the following publications:
[a] Project Development and Design Guide (2006);
Healthy Transportation Policy Directive (P-13-0001,
2013);
[b]
[c] Engineering Directive E-14-006 (2014); and
Separated Bike Lane Planning and Design Guide
(2015).
[d]
[2]
The many related resources referenced in the above,
especially those aimed at achieving flexibility around
pedestrian and bicycle facilities,
[3]
(a)
The standards below are not an attempt to provide every detail
needed to design a right-of-way, but highlight key elements
where the Town wishes to provide specific guidance to create
context-sensitive rights-of-way.

Collector and arterial design. Proposed subdivisions that require
collector- or arterial-scale rights-of-way should refer to the design
resources listed in Subsection E(1) above.
(2)
Cross slopes. The cross slopes of the travel lanes are 3/8 of an inch
per foot. The maximum cross slope of the planting strips is 3:1. The
maximum cross slope for sidewalks is 1.5%.
(3)
Bicycle accommodations. All proposed streets must make adequate
provisions for cyclists. For minor and local streets, these
accommodations are likely to be met by sharing the travel lane,
without the need for formal markings or signage. On collectors
and arterials, however, depending on the context, adjustments to
travel lane widths, shoulder widths, pavement markings, dedicated
bicycle lanes, or separated lanes may be required.
(4)
On-street parking. Due to their width, on-street parking is
prohibited on minor streets. Local streets, by contrast, can
informally accommodate parking on one side of the street. Onstreet
parking on collectors and arterials should be designed
carefully in consideration of other travel lane users, such as
cyclists.
(5)
Changes in direction. Any change in direction of right-of-way
tangents must be connected by either a horizontal curve or an
intersection.
(6)
Dead-end streets.
A dead-end street may not be longer than 650 feet from the
point of beginning following the center line to the furthest
point on the right-of-way line. The point of beginning of a dead-
(a)
(7)
7.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.2
1:489
end street or way or of a system of dead-end streets or ways is
the point of intersection of street center lines with a street of
which there are two or more distinct vehicular access routes to
the general street network of the Town.
A street sign stating "Dead End" or "Not a Through Way,"
satisfactory to the Town Engineer, must be installed.
(b)
Dead-end street turnaround design standards.
Every dead-end street must Terminate with a sixty-foot
radius right-of-way line with a landscaped center island.
[1]
The pavement must have an outside turning radius of at
least 50 feet.
[2]
The pavement must have an inside turning radius of at
least 25 feet.
[3]
Alternative plans must include an analysis and evaluation
of fire apparatus maneuvers throughout the turnaround
created by swept path analysis and turn simulation
software.
[4]
(c)
Center line of street. The center line of the paved section of the
street must follow the center line of the right-of-way.
(8)
Driveway aprons. Driveway aprons must be constructed to serve
each lot, graded to offer unimpeded drainage in the gutter, and
constructed to the same standards as the street to the actual
driveway width but in no case less than eight feet nor greater than
20 feet wide for the entire distance between the exterior right-ofway
line and the paved section of the street.
(9)
Curbs and gutters.
Curbing is required to offer for safety, stormwater
management, and delineation and protection of the pavement
edge and to prevent erosion. Except where specified below,
a continuous, low profile, Cape Cod style berm of bituminous
concrete must be provided as an integral part of each new
street.
(a)
Vertical granite curbing must be installed:
[1] At the back of catch basins that are at low points;
[2] On all sections of a street with a grade greater than 5%;
[3] At all corner roundings; and
[4] On all collector and arterial streets.
(b)
(10)
7.2 LEXINGTON CODE 7.2
1:490
The design, dimensions, and installation of all granite or
bituminous curbing must follow the Town's Standard
Specifications.
(c)
Slopes and walls.
Wherever the grade of the approved street differs from the
grade of the adjacent land or where otherwise necessary for
public safety, in the area beyond the sidewalk or landscaped
planting strip, the developer must erect retaining walls and
guardrail fences or offer slopes no steeper than one foot
vertical to three feet horizontal in fill and one foot vertical
to two feet horizontal in cut to ensure proper protection and
lateral support.
(a)
No retaining wall may have a height above finished grade
greater than five feet. Where necessary, a series of retaining
walls may be constructed in a terraced effect, provided the
horizontal distance between the outside face of one wall is at
least four feet from that of the next wall.
(b)
Landscaping must be provided on slopes and on the terraces
between retaining walls to reduce the visual impact of the
construction. Such walls, fences, slopes, and planting are
subject to the Board's approval as to location, design, and
dimensions and must be constructed in a manner satisfactory
to the Town Engineer.
(c)
(11)
Sight distance, alignment, and profile. To ensure proper sight
distances, alignment and profile of proposed streets designers
must use the methodology laid out in AASHTO's "A Policy on
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets," referenced above. The
Policy describes in detail how to calculate stopping sight distances,
decision sight distances, passing sight distances, and horizontal
and vertical profile.
(12)
Street Construction.
Construction standards and procedures. The following construction
and installation standards apply:
The area between the right-of-way lines must be cleared and
grubbed except for those trees intended to be preserved as
street trees.
(a)
All excavation must conform to the lines and grades shown
on the approved definitive subdivision plan. Where mucky soil,
ledge or clay is encountered within the right-of-way, it must be
removed entirely and, where necessary, replaced with ordinary
borrow or other materials specified in Massachusetts Highway
Department Standard Specifications for Highways and
Bridges, latest edition. Where water is encountered or is
(b)
(1)
F.
7.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.2
1:491
7.3. SIDEWALKS AND PATHS.
expected to be encountered within four feet of the finished
grade of the street, subsurface drainage, of a design
acceptable to the Town Engineer, must be constructed.
Boulders or ledge must be removed to a depth of at least 24
inches below final grade when within the area to be paved.
Extensive ledge areas may require the installation of
interceptor sub drains or perforated pipe. Where street and
shoulder grades require more than two feet of cut or fill,
retaining walls may be required along abutting property lines
unless a suitable alternative is shown, such as an earth slope
one foot vertical to two feet horizontal. In such cases, a slope
easement of adequate width must be obtained.
(c)
The paved section of a street must conform to the current
version of the Town of Lexington's Standard Street
Construction Details. All materials used in the construction of
streets must conform to the Town's Standard Specifications
or, when not covered by the Standard Specifications, to the
Massachusetts Highway Department Standard Specifications
for Highways and Bridges, latest edition.
(d)
Restoration of existing streets. Whenever the construction of
utilities, connection to existing services, or facilities requires
opening a street, the developer must reconstruct the existing
pavement, as follows:
By cold-planing the entire width of the street to a depth of 1.5
inches, from the point of curvature of the curb rounding across
the proposed subdivision street to the point of tangency of the
opposite curb rounding; and
(a)
Overlaying the cold-planed area with a one-and-one-half-inch
finish course of bituminous concrete.
(b)
(2)
Sidewalks.
Location. Sidewalks must be located within, and next to, the
exterior line of the right-of-way. Sidewalks must be a uniform
distance parallel to the paved section of the street and separated
from it by a landscaped strip. However, in order to avoid mature
trees in the proposed right-of-way that is to be preserved,
applicants may deviate from this standard without the need for a
waiver, provided they remain within the right-of-way.
(1)
Alternative locations. The applicant may propose, or the Board may
require, that all or some of the walks be located within easements
rather than within the right-of-way of the street. The width and
construction of walks in easements must be the same as if within a
street right-of-way.
(2)
A.
7.2 LEXINGTON CODE 7.3
1:492
Construction. Sidewalks construction must conform to the Town's
Standard Specifications.
(3)
Footpaths and Trails.
Where required. The Board may require the construction of a
footpath or trail to offer access to open space, recreational areas,
streets, footpaths, trails, bicycle paths, or recreational paths
located either within the subdivision or on adjoining land.
(1)
Objectives for footpaths and trails. Footpaths and trails should be
individually tailored, in width and material, to take full advantage
of the area's unique natural surroundings with attention to the
following objectives and standards:
Build for durability by:
Finding the most stable, well-drained soils that can bear
the weight of pedestrian traffic;
[1]
[2] Building boardwalks where the soil is wet or unstable; and
[3] Using a switchback plan on slopes to inhibit erosion.
(a)
Minimize environmental impact by:
Disturbing the environment surrounding the trail as little
as possible;
[1]
Leaving trees that will offer a natural check on the amount
of undergrowth that will require maintenance;
[2]
[3] Designing for proper drainage;
[4] Harmonizing the trail with its environment; and
Using natural construction materials, such as dirt,
cobblestones, or wood, where appropriate.
[5]
(b)
Offer privacy for adjacent landowners by one or more of the
following:
[1] Constructing a berm, fence, or combination of both;
[2] Planting trees and shrubs; and
Allowing the natural vegetation to reclaim the area if it will
offer adequate protection.
[3]
(c)
(2)
Path easements. Easements for footpaths or trails must be at least
10 feet wide. Easements providing public access over these paths
and trails are required.
(3)
Identification. A sign or identification for a footpath or trail must:
(a) Be placed at the entrance and junctions of trails; and
(4)
B.
7.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.3
1:493

Be coordinated with the color of the existing signage used in
the conservation areas in Lexington;
(b)
Bicycle Path or Recreational Path.
The Board may require the construction of a bicycle path or
recreational path:
To offer a connection to a Town bicycle path or recreational
path located on adjoining land or streets; or
(a)
Where the path would be part of an existing or proposed Town
bicycle path or recreational path system or of bicycle path or
recreational path leading to a public school.
(b)
(1)
Path easements. Easements for footpaths or trails must be at least
10 feet wide. Easements providing public access over these paths
and trails are required.
(2)
Construction. A bicycle path or recreational path must be at least
10 feet wide and constructed in accordance with the Town's
Standard Specifications.
(3)
C.
Standards for Water and Sewer Service.
Construction requirements. All elements of the water and sanitary
sewer service must be designed to comply with the Town's Water,
Sewer and Drain Regulations and the Standard Specifications.
(1)
Connection to Town system. Water and sanitary sewer mains must
connect to the municipal water supply and sanitary sewer systems,
respectively.
(2)
A.
Water Mains.
Objectives. Water mains, laterals, and appurtenances must be
designed to offer adequate water service for the needs of residents
and for fire suppression.
(1)
Looped water system. The water system must be designed to form
a continuous loop with existing or proposed water mains.
(2)
Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants must be spaced not more than 500 feet
apart. A copy of the plan showing fire hydrant locations must be
submitted by the Board to the Fire Chief for his or her comments
and recommendations.

Installation. All electric power lines and communication lines must
be installed in underground conduits. Communication lines must
include, but not be limited to, telephone, security alarm, and cable
television. To ensure that future providers have access to the
development, additional conduits must be provided.
(1)
Streetlighting. The developer must show provisions for
streetlighting on a plan subject to the approval of the Town
Engineer. The developer must install the conduit underground and
construct the bases. Poles and streetlights may not be installed
without the prior written approval of the Town Engineer.
(2)
D.
Objectives. Projects must be developed to maximize stormwater
recharge within the site, minimize direct overland runoff onto adjoining
lots, streets, and watercourses, and ensure that the Town can meet the
requirements of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) general permit.
A.
Drainage Easements.
Where it is necessary to carry drainage across lots within the
project, drainage easements must be provided of such width and
construction as will be adequate to accommodate the volume and
velocity of the runoff. However, in no case may the easements be
less than 20 feet wide.
(1)
When a proposed drainage system will carry water across land
outside the project boundaries, appropriate drainage rights must
be secured by the applicant and referenced on the definitive plan.
(2)
B.
Standards for Stormwater Management.
Construction requirements. All projects subject to this section must
be designed to comply with the requirements for above-threshold
projects detailed in Article VI, Stormwater Management
Regulations, of Chapter 181 of the Code of Lexington.
(1)
C.
Objectives and Applicability.
Objectives. The Board determines that:
Trees and other plant materials planted within or along the
right-of-way as part of a coordinated landscape plan improve
the appearance and economic value of a subdivision;
(a)
A landscaped island in the center of a turnaround is better than
a paved surface covering the entire island;
(b)
(1)
A.
7.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.6
1:495
7.7. RESERVATION OF LAND FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES.
The owners of the lots that have frontage on the turnaround,
individually and collectively, should support the landscaping in
such islands, and the owners of other lots that have frontage
on sections of the right-of-way within which landscaping is
planted should support that landscaping;
(c)
Every effort must be made to preserve existing trees within the
proposed right-of-way as well as within individual lots shown
on the subdivision.
(d)
Street Trees.
Location. Street trees must be planted, at the developer's expense,
on each street within the tract being subdivided. Trees should
be planted within the right-of-way's planting strip(s) and spaced
between 27 feet and 35 feet apart on center.
(1)
Characteristics. Proposed street trees must meet the following
standards:
Proposed street trees must be of the applicable USDA Zone
hardiness, licensed nursery stock with good root development
and branching characteristics with a one-year warranty.
(a)
(b) No more than 50% of any one genus may be proposed.
Proposed street tree species must be indigenous to the region.
A list of recommended tree species can be found in the
Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife's publication
"The Vascular Plants of Massachusetts: A County Checklist."
(c)
Be a minimum size of three inches in caliper, measured four
feet from the ground level, and eight to 10 feet of height in
place.
(d)
Be planted in holes of a depth and width of two times the
diameter of the root ball. Trees must be planted at their proper
depth, in good quality topsoil, and securely staked.
(e)
(2)
B.
Cul-De-Sac Plantings. The center island of a cul-de-sac must be
landscaped.
C.
Restoration of Slopes. All cut and fill slopes subject to erosion and
adjoining the right-of-way must be planted with suitable well-rooted,
low-growing plant materials as shown on the landscape plan. Plants or
perennial grass must be suited to the adjoining landscape and located
to offer adequate cover. The Board may require the planting of sod and
other erosion control measures where called for.
D.
Designation for Reservation. The Board may require the designation
of one or more parts of the subdivision tract for reservation for three
A.
7.6 LEXINGTON CODE 7.7
1:496
years for park, playground, open space or other municipal purposes.
The reservation of land may not be unreasonable in relation to the
size of the tract being subdivided and to the prospective uses of the
reserved land.
Plan Notation. If the Board designates land for reservation for
municipal purposes, a notation must be made on the definitive
subdivision plan concerning the area being reserved and the
requirement that no street, utilities, building, or other improvements
within the boundaries of the land being reserved may be made for three
years from the date of endorsement of the plan without the Board's
prior written approval.
B.
Action by Town Within Three Years. During the three-year reservation
period, the Town may choose to buy any or all of the reserved land
and must justly compensate the owner for the land acquired. If the
Town does not choose to buy the land within the three-year reservation
period, the developer may go ahead with improvements per the
approved subdivision plan.

designee are at the expense of the applicant. Subdivision bonds will not
be released until all such expenses have been paid to the Board.
Access. To verify that the required improvements are constructed or
installed in accordance with these Regulations and with the applicable
technical standards, the Board, its agents, and employees of the Town
must be allowed access to the subdivision during normal working hours
while it is under construction, subject to notice and compliance with
safety standards.
A.
Notice. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that written notice
is delivered to the Planning Office and the Town Engineer upon the
completion of each of the tasks enumerated below and at least three
working days before commencing the next task or covering the work
performed. Work covered before the expiration of three working days
after such notice may be required to be uncovered or dug up or may be
considered to have not been done per these Regulations.
B.
Required Inspections.
Before the start of construction in a subdivision, the Board will
designate either the Town Engineer, his or her designee, or another
authorized Engineer to be responsible for periodic inspection of
construction. The developer may not go ahead with construction of
any of the following stages of development until the Town Engineer
has given his written approval of the satisfactory completion of the
earlier stage.
(a) Clearing, grubbing, and excavation to firm subbase;
Filling and grading to rough grade may include utility
trenching;
(b)

The Town Engineer may require inspection at such other intervals,
as he or she may deem necessary to assure proper construction
of the improvements. In addition, the Town Engineer may require
periodic inspection reports from the developer's engineer.
(2)
Street Construction.
No pavement may be laid:
(a) After frost has penetrated the base more than one inch; or
After the air temperature stays at or below freezing for more
than a day; or
(b)
After the final day for paving set by the Town Engineer,
whichever occurs first.
(c)
(1)
No paving may be done under any adverse conditions, as
determined by the Town Engineer.
(2)
Any sections of pavement not meeting the approval of the Town
Engineer must be removed and replaced.
(3)
D.
Reinspection of Incorrect Construction. If the Town Engineer does not
give written approval of the satisfactory completion of the earlier stage,
or at any other time, and the Planning Director gives written notice
to the developer that any of the facilities are not constructed per the
approved subdivision plan, or do not follow the Standard Specifications,
or are not constructed following good construction practice as
determined by the Town Engineer, the developer must correct the
construction of the facility so that it complies. The developer may not go
ahead to a later stage of construction until the incorrect construction
has been corrected and the Town Engineer issues a written statement
that the construction complies. A site visit by the Town Engineer may
be required, for which a fee is required.
E.

Authority. As authorized by § 9.3.4 of the Zoning Bylaw and under
the authority delegated to the Town of Lexington by Article 89 of
the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, known as the "Home Rule Amendment," the Planning
Board of the Town of Lexington (Board) adopts these Regulations
governing those matters in its jurisdiction under the Zoning Bylaw.

the installation of municipal services within them or undertake
preliminary steps, such as the clearing of land, excavation, site
preparation or other preparatory steps, leading to development of
land for which requirements or standards are in these Regulations,
unless all required approvals have been granted by the Planning
Board and recorded in the Registry of Deeds or the Land Court, if
applicable, and only then according to the conditions of approval
and the procedures set out in these Regulations.

MGL c. 40A and the Home Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts

refunded if an application submitted for approval is withdrawn.
4.1.4
Costs of Advertising and Holding Public Hearing. The applicant is
responsible for the costs of publishing the legal notice of any public
hearing. If the Board is required to hold the public hearing in a building
other than the Town Office Building and there are costs associated

costs. Failure to pay for the legal notice or other hearing costs will be
grounds for denial of the application.
4.1.5
Applicability. In addition to an administrative fee, the Board may impose
a project review fee on those applications which require, in the
judgment of the Board, review by outside consultants because of the
size, scale, or complexity of a proposed project, the project's potential
impacts, or because the Town lacks the necessary resources to perform
the review work related to the permit or approval. In hiring outside
consultants, the Board may engage engineers, planners, lawyers,
designers, or other appropriate professionals able to help the Board
and to ensure compliance with all relevant laws, ordinances, bylaws,
and regulations. Such support may include, but not be limited to,
analyzing an application, monitoring or inspecting a project or site for
compliance with the Board's decisions or regulations, or inspecting a
project during construction or implementation.

Submittal. Should the Board require outside review, a project review
fee must be submitted to the Planning Office for deposit in a 53G
Account. Failure to make this payment is grounds for denial of the
application.
4.2.2
Schedule. The following schedule applies to the types of applications
to the Board set forth below. Where more than one type of application
has been submitted for Board action, only the largest of the applicable
project review fees may be collected for deposit into the 53G Account,
and not the sum of those fees.
1. Residential: $2,000 plus $700 per unit.
2. Nonresidential: $5,000.
4.2.3
Replenishment. When the balance in an applicant's 53G Account falls
below 25% of the initial project review fee, as imposed above, the Board
may require a supplemental project review fee to cover the cost of the
remaining project review. Failure to make this payment is grounds for
denial of the application.
4.2.4
4.1 LEXINGTON CODE 4.2
1:516

require a supplemental project review fee to ensure the availability of

SECTION 176-7.0
UNACCEPTED STREETS STANDARDS
7.1. AUTHORITY.
7.2. OBJECTIVES.
7.3. APPLICABILITY.
Authority.
The Zoning Bylaw requires every lot to have frontage on a street
as defined in the Zoning Bylaw (§ 135-10.0). The Bylaw has three
classifications of streets: 1) a public way laid out and maintained
by a public authority; 2) a way constructed in accordance with an
approved subdivision plan; and 3) a way in existence on April 4,
1948, that has been determined to be adequate by the Planning
Board.
1.
This third classification of "street" is not a permanent one as it
relies on the determination of the Planning Board as to the status
of the street at the time a building permit is sought. In order for
a way in existence on April 4, 1948, to be categorized as a street,
the Planning Board must make a determination that it has sufficient
width, suitable grades, and adequate construction to provide for
the needs of vehicular traffic in relation to the proposed use of
the land served by the way, and for the installation of municipal
services to serve the land and the buildings erected, or to be
erected, on that land.
2.
This section of the Zoning Regulations sets forth the procedures
and construction standards by which the Board will render its
opinion on the adequacy of these ways.
3.
7.1.1
Objectives. The Planning Board has adopted these Regulations for the
following reasons:
To extend the system of streets that are either accepted public
ways or are constructed to Town standards in a manner compatible
with the Town's complete streets policies;
1.
To set forth written standards and procedures for determining the
adequacy of unaccepted ways to serve as frontage, in relation to
the construction of large additions or new dwellings, for lots on
such ways.
2.
7.2.1
Regulated Activities and Length of Jurisdiction.
Regulated Activities. Until the Planning Board determines that the
unaccepted street provides adequate frontage, no building permit
may be issued for any lot on a way not accepted by the Town but in
existence on April 4, 1948, for:
1.

7.5. REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS.
a. A new dwelling on a vacant lot; or
Additions to, or replacement of, an existing dwelling that
increases the gross floor area on the lot by more than 1,000
square feet.
b.
Length and Direction of Jurisdiction. The Board will determine the
adequacy of the way along the entire frontage of the lot and the
intervening distance between the lot and the nearest accepted
street, plus any area required to provide a safe transition to the
existing ways, which may add to the length of the required
improvements.
2.
Process Outline. The Planning Board issues its determination after an
application is received, staff conducts a review of the proposal, and the
matter is discussed at a public meeting with abutter notification.
7.4.1
Action Deadline. The Planning Board must act on a street determination
application within 45 days from the submission date unless extended
per Section 3.3.6, or the application will be deemed constructively
approved.
7.4.2
Decision. The Planning Board will determine that:
The unaccepted street presently is of adequate grade and
construction and no improvements are necessary; or
1.
The unaccepted street is not presently of adequate grade and
construction but will be after certain improvements, proposed by
the applicant, are made; or
2.
The unaccepted street is not of adequate grade and construction
and the improvements proposed by the applicant are not sufficient
to change that determination.
3.
7.4.3
Determinations are limited to the grade and construction of the street
and should not be interpreted as implying that the lot under
consideration meets any other test of the Zoning Bylaw to qualify it as
a buildable lot.
7.4.4
Performance Guaranty. If the improvements are not to be completed
before the issuance of a building permit, the Board will require a
performance guaranty to cover the costs of the construction and
inspections, in accordance with Sections 6.5 and 6.6 of the Board's
Subdivision Regulations.
7.4.5
Duration of Determination. Street determinations are valid for two
years from the date the designation was voted by the Board.

the Board believes may be affected by, or interested in, the
proposed rezoning;
b.
Notify at least all persons who would receive notice of an
application for approval of a special permit as described in
MGL c. 40A, § 11, of the receipt of the proposal with a brief
summary of it; and the Board's procedures and those
prescribed in the Zoning Bylaw for review, public meetings and
c.

8.8. PUBLIC HEARING AND RECOMMENDATION.
hearings and official action on a proposed amendment to the
Zoning Map.
2. The Planning Board will conduct a public information meeting.
Second presentation. Depending on the comments and
recommendations received from others, the Planning Board may
request that the applicant makes a second presentation at a public
information meeting.
3.
Decision. The Planning Board will make a written recommendation
that will indicate whether the proposed use of the land, without
consideration of the proposed density or other design features, is
acceptable to the Board.
If the use alone is not acceptable, the Board will indicate the
proposal is unlikely to receive a subsequent favorable
recommendation by the Board.
1.
If the use is acceptable, the recommendation will indicate whether:
The proposed density and other design features are
acceptable, or could be acceptable if modified;
a.
The proposed conditions on the development, or mitigating
measures or benefits to the neighborhood or the Town, are
acceptable or could be acceptable if modified.

The Board may cite specific improvements or modifications of the
proposal that are necessary for it to make a favorable
recommendation to the Town Meeting.
3.
The time period for sketch plan. The Planning Board will make a
written recommendation within 60 days after a sketch plan has
been properly submitted and determined to be complete.
4.
Effect on subsequent decisions; the right to petition. The Planning
Board's recommendation, at the sketch plan stage, does not
guarantee the Board's subsequent recommendation. An
unfavorable recommendation, at the sketch plan stage, should not
be interpreted to deny an applicant the right to petition the Town
Meeting for a rezoning of the land; it does affect the likelihood of
obtaining a favorable recommendation from the Planning Board.
5.
8.7.3
Submission. All information required by Subsections 8.5 and 8.6 shall
be submitted to the Planning Board before the first publication of the
advertisement for the public hearing.

recommendation to Town Meeting, the Planning Board will request
a recommendation from the Town Engineer, the Conservation
8.8.2
8.7 LEXINGTON CODE 8.8
1:546
Commission, and such other departments, boards or committees as
the Board believes may be affected by, or interested in, the proposed
rezoning.
Decision. After conducting a public hearing, the Planning Board will
make a written recommendation to the Town Meeting that the rezoning
of the land be approved or disapproved prior to the Town Meeting vote
on the rezoning petition.
8.8.3
Basis for Planning Board Recommendation. The Planning Board's
recommendation to the Town Meeting will be based on the information
presented at the public hearing. The Planning Board's recommendation
may take into account any revisions made by the applicant after original
submittal until the close of the public hearing.
8.8.4
Contents of Planning Board Recommendation. The Planning Board
recommendation to the Town Meeting will include at least the
following:
A recommendation as to whether the rezoning petition, including
the preliminary site development and use plan, should be approved

SECTION 176-9.0
SITE PLAN REVIEW
9.1. GENERAL REGULATIONS.
9.2. ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS.
Authority and Purpose. These regulations governing site plan review
are adopted under Section 9.5.4.2 of the Zoning Bylaw to create
uniform procedures and standards for the review of site plans
submitted to the Town. Said review is intended to protect the health,
safety, convenience and general welfare of the inhabitants of the Town
of Lexington by assessing potential impacts on municipal services and
utilities, traffic, the environment and aesthetics and by assuring that
the same are adequately considered. Site plan review is not aimed
at the prohibition of permitted uses in a zoning district, but with
reasonable regulation consistent with the public interest.
9.1.1
Amendment. These regulations may be amended from time to time by
a majority vote of the Planning Board at any regularly scheduled public
meeting, following notice and a public hearing as required by Section
9.5.4.2 of the Bylaw.
9.1.2
Applicability. Under Section 9.5.2 of the Bylaw, the following types of
activities and uses require site plan review by the Board or its designee:
Exterior construction or expansion of a structure resulting in an
increase of 500 square feet or more of total building gross floor
area or 500 square feet of site coverage; or
1.
2. Any change(s) to an approved site plan.
9.2.1
Preapplication Review.
Sketch plan. All applicants are encouraged to submit a sketch plan
to the Planning Office for review in advance of filing an application
with the Board. This review does not constitute a formal application
for site plan review. Before or upon submittal of a sketch plan,
the applicant must contact the Planning Office to schedule an
appointment with Town staff to review the plan.
1.
Scope of review. Town staff will review the sketch plan in an effort
to promote greater efficiency in the formal review process. Such
review will be limited to technical issues in the areas of Town staff's
expertise. While Town staff may offer opinions on the viability of
a particular site modification, improvement or design, compliance
with these regulations and/or the probability of securing waivers
therefrom, all such comments are nonbinding and should not be
construed by the applicant to constitute instructions or directives
of a binding nature.
2.
9.2.2
9.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS 9.2
1:549
9.3. MINOR SITE PLAN.
Approval. The Board, or its designee in the case of a minor site plan
review, may approve an application subject to such reasonable
conditions as may be necessary or appropriate to:
Enforce compliance with substantive requirements of this chapter,
unless waived; and
1.
Protect the health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the
inhabitants of the Town of Lexington.
2.
9.2.3
Conditions. Among its conditions, the Board, or its designee in the case
of a minor site plan review, may require the provision of adequate
security by the applicant, in such form and amount as may be
determined by the Board. This security is to ensure the satisfactory
completion of all improvements required by its site plan approval,
exclusive of those being made to privately owned structures. The
Planning Board, or its designee in the case of a minor site plan review,
may also require a formal commitment to future compliance, including
a monitoring program post-permit issuance for compliance purposes for
a time specified in the site plan approval.
9.2.4
Disapproval. The Board, or its designee in the case of a minor site plan
review, may disapprove an application where:
The application is incomplete, as determined by the Board or its
designee in the case of minor site plan approval, and the applicant
has been so notified and has failed to remedy the application; or
1.
The imposition of reasonable conditions will not ensure the
project's compliance with the substantive requirements of these
regulations; or
2.
The imposition of reasonable conditions will not adequately protect
the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the
inhabitants of the Town of Lexington, or the public interest; or
3.
4. The project, as proposed, does not comply with the Zoning Bylaw.
9.2.5
Lapse. Site plan approval by the Board lapses if building permits for
development of the project, where required, have not been issued
within two years from the date of approval. The Board may grant an
extension of time upon the written request of the applicant for good
cause.
9.2.6
Applicability. An application made under Section 9.5.2 of the Bylaw and
not considered a major site plan under Section 9.4 will be considered a
minor site plan.
9.3.1
Required submittals. An applicant must submit one copy of its
application for review of a minor site plan to the Town Clerk and
five copies of the application to the Planning Board designee, the

9.2 LEXINGTON CODE 9.3
1:550
9.4. MAJOR SITE PLAN.
Planning Director in the case of minor site plan approval. The designee
may require a minor site plan to include, or be accompanied by, any
information, and items required by these regulations. However, minor
site plans must normally be required to contain only a plot plan,
showing the location of all buildings and structures on the lot and
including existing conditions and proposed changes.
Decision by the Designee. The designee, under the standards set forth
here, reviews minor site plans. The designee must, after review of the
minor site plan, file a written decision within 60 days of receipt of the
application in the office of the Town Clerk, and notify the applicant
of his/her decision. The required time limits for the filing of such
decision may be extended by written agreement of the applicant and
the designee, and a copy of such agreement must be filed in the office
of the Town Clerk. Failure by the designee to act in the sixty-day period
is considered approval of the minor site plan. The applicant who seeks
such approval because of the failure of the designee to act in the time
prescribed must notify the Town Clerk, in writing, within 14 days from
the expiration of said 60 days or extended time.
9.3.3
Appeal. The decision of the designee on a minor site plan may be
appealed to the Planning Board. Such appeal must be filed with the
Board within 14 days of the filing of the designee's decision with the
Town Clerk. The decision of the Planning Board must be filed with the
Town Clerk within 60 days of the date the appeal is filed. All costs
of mailed notice and publication of notice must be borne by the party
appealing the decision.
9.3.4
Applicability. An application made under Section 9.5.4.1 of the Bylaw
will be considered a major site plan when:
Exterior construction or expansion of structures which results in an
increase of more than 5,000 square feet of total building gross floor
area in any three-year period; or
1.
The available parking on the site is increased by more than 20
parking spaces in any three-year period.

elements of proposed buildings must be evaluated in relation to existing
buildings adjacent or surrounding buildings. The Planning Board may
not consider interior arrangements. The back and sides of each building
must be given architectural care particularly if available for view by the
public.
9.5.6
Land Disturbance. Site and building design must preserve natural
topography outside of the development footprint to reduce unnecessary
land disturbance and to preserve natural drainage on the site.
9.6.1
9.4 GENERAL PROVISIONS 9.6
1:553
Clearing for Utility Trenching. Clearing for utility trenching must be
limited to the minimum area necessary to maneuver a backhoe or other
construction equipment. Roots should be cut cleanly rather than pulled
or ripped out during utility trenching. Tunneling for utility installation
should be used wherever feasible to protect root systems of trees.
9.6.2
New Sites. Placement of new buildings, structures, or parking facilities
must blend with the natural landscape. New building sites must be
directed away from the crest of hills, and foundations must be
constructed to reflect the natural terrain. Sites must be designed in
such a way as to avoid impacts to rare and endangered species and
wildlife habitat on a site, and to maintain contiguous forested areas.
9.6.3
Archeological or Historic Resources. The proposed development must
be consistent with the applicable standards of the Historical
Commission and the Massachusetts Historical Commission.
9.6.4
Preservation of Existing Vegetation. Priority must be given to the
preservation of existing stands of trees, trees at site perimeter,
contiguous vegetation with adjacent sites (particularly existing sites
protected through conservation restrictions), and specimen trees.
Understory vegetation beneath the dripline of preserved trees must
be retained in an undisturbed state. During clearing and construction
activities, all vegetation to be retained must be surrounded by
temporary protective fencing or other measures before any clearing or
grading occurs, and maintained until all construction work is completed
and the site is cleaned up. Barriers must be large enough to encompass
the essential root zone of all vegetation to be protected. All vegetation
inside the protective fencing must be retained in an undisturbed state.
9.6.5
Location of Construction Activities. To minimize the clearing and
grading on a site associated with construction activities, such as
parking of construction vehicles, offices/trailers, stockpiling of
equipment/materials, such activities may be limited to areas already
planned for permanent structures. Topsoil may not be stockpiled in
areas of protected trees, and wetlands or their vegetated buffers.
9.6.6
Limit Of Clearing. Development envelopes for structures, driveways,
wastewater disposal, lawn areas, and utility work must be designated
to limit clearing and grading. Clearing of vegetation and alteration
of topography must be replicated with native vegetation planted in
disturbed areas.
9.6.7
Removal of Invasive Species. The removal of invasive species will be
required except when their removal would lead to unnecessary or
unneeded clearing, such as a large stand of mature trees.
9.6.8
Finished Grade. Finished grades in disturbed areas should be limited to
no greater than a 3:1 slope (rise over run), while preserving, matching,
or blending with the natural contours and undulations of the land to
the greatest extent possible. Finished grade must be no higher than the
trunk flares of trees to be retained unless tree wells are used.

through phasing of construction operations must be limited. Effective
sequencing must occur inside the boundaries of natural drainage areas.
9.6.10
Revegetation. Proper revegetation techniques must be employed
during construction using native plant species, proper seedbed
preparation, fertilizer and mulching to protect germinating plants.
Revegetation must occur on cleared sites in the first planting season
appropriate to the selected plant species. Proposed landscaping must
include native and drought-tolerant species and prohibit invasive or
non-native plants.
9.6.11
Topsoil. A minimum of six inches of topsoil must be placed on all
disturbed surfaces, which are proposed to be planted.
9.6.12
Irrigation. In general, the need for irrigation must be avoided by
appropriate planting. The Planning Board may require that water to
irrigation must be provided by an on-site well, cisterns, or other
acceptable and feasible method.
9.6.13
Access. Access via roadways abutting residential districts must be
avoided where possible. Entry to and exit from a development with
frontage on more than one street must be in a way that causes the
least impact to the surrounding neighborhoods as determined by the
Planning Board.
9.7.1
Driveways. All driveways must be designed to afford adequate sight
distance to pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists exiting to public ways.
Improvements may be required on the public way for vehicular turning
movements in or out of the site and safe pedestrian access to adjoining
sidewalks, paths, walking trails or bikeways.
9.7.2
Curb Cuts. Curb cuts must be limited to the minimum width for safe
entering and exiting. The location of driveway openings in relation
to traffic and to adjacent streets must provide for the convenience
and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement inside the site. The
number of curb cuts must be minimized.
9.7.3
Interior Circulation. The proposed development must assure safe
interior circulation inside its site by separating pedestrians, bikeways,
and vehicular traffic. Internal circulation must be planned to
accommodate existing or planned transportation demand management
services, such as, but not limited to, public transit, ride sharing, and
shuttle services. Traffic calming measures, such as crosswalks, bike
lanes, rumble strips, and landscaped islands, will be required, where
appropriate, on the site to maximize pedestrian and cyclist safety.

SECTION 176-10.0
TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT PLANS
10.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
10.2. HARTWELL AVENUE AREA (TMO-1) DISTRICT PLAN.
There is a Transportation Management Overlay District plan adopted by the
Planning Board specifically for the TMO-1 District, as required by Section
7.2.4 of the Zoning Bylaws, known as the "TMO-1 District Plan" or the
"Hartwell Avenue Area Plan." The increased development authorized for
the Hartwell Avenue area by the Lexington 2009 Annual Town Meeting
will result in increased traffic counts. Without proactive intervention, such
an increase will adversely impact traffic circulation in nearby routes and
associated intersections. The TMO-1 District Plan was developed to mitigate
the effects of projected impacts.
Purpose. Per Section 7.2 of the Zoning Bylaw, the purpose of
Transportation Management Overlay District (TMOD) plans is to allow
greater opportunity for facilitating effective multimodal transportation
networks that will increase the quality of life in Lexington. Compliance
with a TMOD plan provides an alternative to the special permit process
outlined in Section 5.1, Off-Street Parking and Loading, and Section
5.5, Traffic Standards, of the Zoning Bylaw.
10.1.1
Waivers. Upon request, the Planning Board, or in the case of a small
project PTDM plan the Planning Board's designee, may waive strict
compliance with the requirements of a TMOD plan for a particular
development where such waiver is in the public interest and not
inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the plan. An applicant is
not entitled to a waiver and the Planning Board, or its designee, in its
discretion, may decline to approve a request for a waiver.
10.1.2
Effective Date. Any TMOD plans and regulations may be updated
periodically to reflect actual development activity, actual costs of
infrastructure improvements completed or underway, plan changes, or
amendments to the Zoning Bylaws.
10.1.3
Enforcement. A final certificate of occupancy may not be issued unless
or until all provisions of Section 7.2 have been satisfied.
10.1.4
Applicability. The provisions contained in the TMO-1 District Plan, and
these regulations, apply to developments located inside the TMO-1
District that elects to comply with the requirements of Section 7.2 of
the Zoning Bylaw and the specific requirements of the TMO-1 District
Plan, instead of the special permit process outlined in Sections 5.1 and
5.5 of the Zoning Bylaw.
10.2.1
Floor Area Ratio. When a development electing to proceed under this
section also requires a special permit because its floor area ratio (FAR)
is greater than that permitted by right in the underlying district and
10.2.2
10.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS 10.2
1:559
the total additional net floor area is greater than 100,000 square feet
(SF), the SPGA may impose additional traffic and infrastructure impactrelated
conditions, including additional transportation mitigation fees
and parking and traffic demand management requirements, to meet the
goals of the TMO-1 Plan.
Transportation Mitigation Fee.
Calculation of payment. The transportation mitigation fee is the
sum of $5 for each square foot of increased net floor area, as
defined by the Zoning Bylaw.
1.
The timing of payment. Twenty-five percent of the fee must be paid
within five days of the issuance of the building permit, site plan
review (when applicable) or special permit, whichever occurs first.
The remainder of the fee must be received in full, no later than the
issuance of an occupancy permit.
2.
10.2.3
Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the parking and
loading standards in the TMO-1 District must be calculated and
applied per Section 5.1 of the Zoning Bylaw for the underlying
district.
1.
The preferential parking spaces required by 5.1.7 of the Zoning
Bylaw may also be used by single-occupancy vehicles with an EPA
combined mileage rating of 40 or more miles per gallon.
2.
All applicable sites must provide one bicycle parking space for each
15 motor vehicle parking spaces, with a minimum of two bicycle
parking spaces.
3.
10.2.4
Parking and Transportation Demand Management Plans (PTDM Plans).
Developments located in the TMO-1 District that elect to comply
with the requirements of the TMO-1 District Plan must create
and carry out a parking and transportation demand management
(PTDM) plan as detailed below. PTDM plans must be submitted
for review with the application for a building permit, site plan
review, or special permit, whichever comes first. A final certificate
of occupancy may not be issued unless a complying PTDM plan has
been submitted.
1.
Types of PTDM Plans. Projects that require major site plan review
or a special permit must submit a full PTDM plan, as described
in Section 10.2.5.4. Projects that are either exempt from site plan
review or subject to minor site plan review may submit either a
small project PTDM plan, as described in Section 10.2.5.3, or a full
PTDM Plan.
2.
Small Project PTDM Plans. Small project PTDM plans are reviewed
by the appropriate permit granting authority. Projects exempt from
3.
10.2.5
10.2 LEXINGTON CODE 10.2
1:560
site plan review have their PTDM plans reviewed by the Building
Commissioner, while projects subject to minor site plan review are
reviewed by the Planning Board's designee. Small project PTDM
plans must provide a description of the specific demand
management techniques that will be used to achieve a reduction in
single occupancy vehicle use.
Full PTDM Plans. Full PTDM plans are reviewed by the Planning
Board. Full PTDM plans must include membership in, or a contract
with, a local Transportation Management Association (TMA) that
provides transit services in the Transportation Overlay District to
reduce the use of single occupancy vehicles. Full PTDM plans must
provide a description of the specific demand management practices
that will be used to achieve a maximum of 85% of site trips being in
single occupancy vehicles. These must include the use of financial
incentives that encourage the use of alternative commuting modes
of travel to create equity between modes of travel, such as parking
cash out, travel allowances, rideshare benefits, and transit benefits
such as subsidies for TMA shuttles, MBTA and Lexpress passes.
4.
Both small and full PTDM plans require annual reports to the Town.
Unless a different arrangement is made with the Town, reports
are due to the Planning Office on July 1, or the first business day
afterwards. Annual reports must include:
a. An employee and/or patron mode split survey;
Biennial counts of parking occupancy and driveway traffic
counts; and
b.
The results of the selected PTDM measures and goal
attainment.

§ 181-32. Trenches.
The maximum length of open trench permissible at any time shall be in
accordance with existing normal municipal standards or as may be specified
by the Director or his designee. No greater length shall be open for
pavement removal, excavation, construction, backfilling, patching or other
operations without the written permission of the Director.
§ 181-33. Prompt completion of work.
After an excavation is commenced, the permittee shall prosecute with
diligence and expedition all excavation work covered by the excavation
permit and shall promptly complete such work and restore the way to its
original condition or as near as may be, so as not to obstruct the way or
travel thereon more than is reasonably necessary.
§ 181-34. Breaking through pavement.
The use of hydro-hammers or heavy-duty pavement breakers for

§ 181-35. Backfilling.
as to where and how the excavation shall be made. All safeguards, such
as lanterns, barriers and signs, shall be maintained at all times by the
permittee (licensed installer) while the work is in progress.
Street surface openings henceforth will be restricted for a period of at
least five years after a new permanent surface is laid, except in cases
of extreme emergency. Since modern bituminous concrete surface
materials remain in excellent condition for many years beyond the
aforesaid period and since such openings are the greatest single
contributor to pavement deterioration, utility companies and
contractors will be strictly limited in resorting to this method of
excavating Town streets irrespective of surface age.
I.
When a street excavation is made on streets resurfaced within the
past five years or on an arterial route street as herein defined or
shopping area street, as defined in § 181-18B of these regulations, the
permittee must install a cement concrete patch or equivalent depth of
bituminous base course if acceptable to the Director of Public Works.
Utility companies placing utilities in a shallow trench (up to 3 1/2 feet)
in depth and narrow trenches (up to two feet) in width may in certain
instances be exempt from the cement concrete patch. Open excavations
may not be allowed in which case jacking or other tunneling methods
will be required.
J.
The trench in the street must be filled and temporarily resurfaced in
the same day it is opened unless otherwise directed by the Director or
his designee. The trench shall be backfilled to within 13 1/2 inches of
the top with approved excavated materials. Twelve inches of approved
gravel shall be placed in the trench, and the remaining 1 1/2 inches
shall be filled with temporary bituminous surface. Road surface shall be
precut to avoid damaging surfaces surrounding the trench.
A.
The backfilled material in the trench must be mechanically tamped in
six-inch layers or, if the backfill material does not contain too much clay,
it may instead be thoroughly puddled unless otherwise directed by the
Public Works Department. If the temporary road surface is not placed
the first day, then as soon as it is consistent with the permanency of the
work or directed by the Public Works Department, the gravel subbase
shall be excavated to the required grade in order to place temporary
1 1/2 inches of bituminous surface. The temporary pavement shall be
placed and raked to a uniform surface and rolled to the required
thickness and to a grade that will match the existing bituminous road
surface.
B.
The permittee shall maintain the temporary surfacing and shall
promptly fill with similar material any depressions and holes that may
occur so as to keep the surfacing in a safe and satisfactory condition for
traffic.
C.

§ 181-36. Restoration of permanent paving.
Temporary resurfacing may be either so-called "cold patch" or plantmixed
hot asphalt aggregate, all as produced in accordance with the
standard specifications of the Massachusetts Department of Public
Works, and is to be a minimum of 1 1/2 inches compacted thickness.
D.
A minimum of three months after the temporary resurfacing, unless
a shorter period is approved by the Director, the temporary subbase
shall be excavated to the required grade in order to place bituminous
concrete surface.
E.
All permanent paving shall be done in accordance with the
specifications of the Department of Public Works of the Town of
Lexington by and at the expense of the permittee.
A.
The permittee shall remove and acceptably dispose of all excavated
material before proceeding with the remainder of the work and shall
thoroughly compact the surface of the subbase. Any broken or irregular
edges of existing pavements shall be cut away in straight lines as
directed leaving a sound vertical face at least six inches back from the
edge of the existing pavement.
B.
The bituminous concrete base and top shall be laid and rolled in two
courses. The binder (base course) shall be two inches in depth (note:
base shall not be less than existing roadway base course and not less
than two inches) and the top course shall be 1 1/2 inches in depth.
The minimum total thickness of both courses, measured after rolling,
shall be 3 1/2 inches. The base course of the permanent pavement shall
be placed and carefully raked to a minimum surface and thoroughly
rolled to the required thickness. Before placing the base course of the
permanent pavement, the edge of the original bituminous surfacing
shall receive an application of approved asphalt emulsion so that the
new pavement material may be properly bonded to the old. The top
course of the permanent paving shall be placed to a grade that will
match the existing bituminous surface after rolling.
C.
The permanent paving shall not overlap the existing pavement and will
not have to be applied with a mechanical spreader unless otherwise
directed.
D.
The permittee shall furnish, place, grade and compact bituminous
concrete pavement of Class I Type I-I as shown and specified in the
latest Massachusetts State Department of Public Works Standard
Specifications for Highways and Bridges.
E.
Under certain circumstances where trenches are considered extensive
it may be required, upon completion of patching trenches, to overlay
the affected area for the full width of roadway and at least 30 feet
beyond the affected area with one inch of dense graded bituminous
concrete.

§ 181-37. Cement concrete patch paving.
All lawn surfaces over the trench shall be replaced with sod or loam and
reseeded to grade. All sidewalks dug through shall be carefully patched
after backfilling.
A bituminous concrete sidewalk shall be squared off and patched
with the same material and rolled so as to provide a continuous
smooth surface. Cement concrete sidewalks shall be repaired by
making a new concrete block or blocks through which the trench
passes. Preformed expansion joints, when deemed necessary, will
be installed against buildings, walls, steps, foundations or existing
concrete blocks. The new cement concrete square shall be made
of air-entrained Class A (3,500 lbs.) mix or better and be matched
in color with the remaining sidewalk as nearly as possible. All
concrete must be cured by covering with material in accordance
with the best known concrete curing procedures. All walks shall be
laid over a minimum of 12 inches of well-compacted gravel. Cement
concrete shall be treated with silicone or linseed oil sealer for salt
damage prevention.
(1)
The permittee shall be responsible for repairing any damage to
public utilities (water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone, etc.) or to
Town trees, shrubs, poles or signs which may be disturbed or
damaged during the course of the work or on account thereof. The
permittee shall be responsible for the maintenance of the street
opening excavation trench for one year after the date of completing
the installation except where such maintenance is made necessary
by the act or neglect of another.
(2)
Exceptions to the permanent paving requirement of the
Department of Public Works of the Town of Lexington may be made
only for state or federal government agencies or to public utility
companies for narrow or shallow trenches as defined in § 181-34J.
(3)
G.
All restoration of cement patch paving areas shall be done at the
expense of the permittee and must meet the specification of the
Department of Public Works.
A.
In instances when open cut is permitted, provisions for patching will
require, wherever practical, that a six-inch reinforced or precast
concrete slab be laid over the backfilled trench extending one foot
beyond either side of the edge of surface and allowing for a threeinch
bituminous concrete Type I-I surface, all as shown of the detail
sheet page E-1 entitled "Typical Street Replacement Detail for Cement
Concrete Patch."
B.
When approved, the concrete slab may be cast in place conforming
to Massachusetts standard specifications for Class F cement concrete
and, additionally, shall be high-early strength. The slab shall have steel
reinforcing for tensile strength placed in accordance with good

that are obliterated or damaged during construction shall be repainted by
or under the direction of the Department of Public Works of the Town of
Lexington at the expense of the permittee.
engineering practices. The permittee must place temporary heavy-duty
steel plating adequate to carry heavy traffic over the trench area until
the concrete is sufficiently cured.
Consideration may under certain limited conditions be given to the
elimination of the concrete patch, allowing underground utility
installations to be made where the permittee agrees to replace
foundation and base material in kind and to maintain satisfactorily
a permanent (plant-mixed hot asphalt) bituminous concrete Type II
patch for a period of one year except at which time the original

Yard waste curbside collection. Yard waste is collected at curbside
during the spring and fall collection period in a separate truck by the
regular waste contractor and transported to the Town compost site at
the Hartwell Avenue Recycling Facility.
Containers. Yard waste must be placed in open trash barrels or
biodegradable paper bags and must not be mixed with regular
trash. Yard waste in any other containers will not be collected.
(1)
Where and when. Place yard waste (in open barrels or
biodegradable paper bags sold by local merchants) containers
curbside at least eight feet away from regular trash containers
on the regular trash collection day during the three-week spring
or ten-week fall collection period. Consult the annual recycling
brochure or local newspaper for exact collection dates. Yard waste
placed at curbside prior to or after the yard waste curbside
collection period will not be collected.
(2)
Biodegradable bags. These thirty-gallon bags hold three times the
weight of plastic bags and they do not pollute the environment
as plastic bags do. So-called "plastic biodegradable bags" are a
combination of plastic and cornstarch. They are weaker in strength
than the paper bags and while the cornstarch breaks down the
plastic does not. The following Lexington merchants are selling
biodegradable paper bags for leaf collection, for $0.40 per bag, as
a community service:

purchase a yard waste permit sticker during business hours at the
DPW Operations Facility at 201 Bedford Street. Permit sticker fees
are dependent upon the size of the vehicle. Contractors who do not
obtain a permit or who provide false information will not be allowed
to enter the area. Punch cards for occasional disposal of up to 10
yards (one-yard increments) of yard waste or for dumping brush
from one inch to three inches in diameter are available for $50 ($5
per yard).

§ 181-69 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 181-70
1:625
Stormwater Management Bylaw and implemented through these
Stormwater Management Regulations. Terms not defined in these
regulations or in the Stormwater Management Bylaw shall be construed
according to their customary and usual meaning unless the context
indicates a special or technical meaning.
§ 181-71. Applicability; project classification.
Applicability.
These regulations apply to all activities governed by the
Stormwater Management Bylaw as described below:
Any activity that results in a land disturbance of greater than
one acre of land, or any activity that disturbs less than one
acre of land if that project is part of a larger common plan of
development that will disturb a total of more than one acre of
land; or
(a)
A new dwelling on a vacant lot, a new dwelling replacing an
existing dwelling, or the reconstruction of an existing dwelling
that is demolished to the extent of 50% or more of its
replacement cost, as determined by the Building
Commissioner or designee; or
(b)
Any development project that:
Requires a special permit or a special permit with site plan
review; or
[1]
Requires approval of a definitive plan under the
Subdivision Control Law.
[2]
(c)
(1)
Stormwater discharges that are wholly subject to jurisdiction under
the Wetlands Protection Act or Chapter 130 of the Code of the
Town of Lexington, the Wetland Protection Bylaw, and demonstrate
compliance with the Massachusetts Storm Water Management
Standards as most recently revised and updated in accordance
with revisions to the wetlands regulations, 310 CMR 10.00, and
as reflected in an order of conditions or in a determination of
applicability issued by the Conservation Commission are exempt
from compliance with the Stormwater Management Bylaw and the
remainder of these regulations.
(2)
A.
Project classification. Activities subject to these regulations are
referred to as projects. Projects fall into one of two classifications:
above-threshold projects and below-threshold projects.
Above-threshold project classification: Any activity governed by the
Stormwater Management Bylaw that results in a land disturbance
greater than or equal to one acre, or that is part of a larger common
plan of development that eventually will disturb more than one

B.
§ 181-70 LEXINGTON CODE § 181-71
1:626
§ 181-72. Administrative procedures and requirements.
acre of land is considered an above-threshold project. Activities
governed by the Stormwater Management Bylaw that are abovethreshold
projects shall be consistent with these regulations in
their entirety.
Below-threshold project classification: Any activity governed by
the Stormwater Management Bylaw, but which results in a land
disturbance less than one acre, and that is not part of a larger
common plan of development that eventually will disturb more than
one acre of land is a below-threshold project. Projects governed
by the Stormwater Management Bylaw that are below-threshold
projects shall be consistent with performance standards identified
in § 181-74. Below-threshold project applicants shall only be
required to submit the materials described in § 181-72B(2), and
shall not be required to comply with the remaining administrative
procedures and requirements in § 181-72.
(2)
Permit required.
Projects that meet the applicability criteria of the Lexington
Stormwater Management Bylaw shall require a stormwater
management permit in accordance with these regulations.
(1)
No land disturbance activity shall occur until a permit has been
issued hereunder and conditions of approval have been met.
(2)
No landowner or responsible party shall receive any building or
other land development permits required for land disturbance
activities without first meeting the requirements of the bylaw and
these regulations prior to commencing the proposed activity.
(3)
A.
Stormwater management permit application. An application for a
stormwater management permit shall include the materials specified
in this section. Additional copies may be requested by the Stormwater
Agency.
For above-threshold projects, as defined in Appendix VI-A, the
applicant shall file with the Stormwater Agency three copies of
a completed application package for a stormwater management
permit. Each copy of the completed stormwater management
permit application package shall include:
An application form with original signatures of all property
owners as well as the applicant signature if the applicant is not
a property owner;
(a)
Projections of dates of commencement and completion of
construction activities;
(b)
(c) Payment of the application and other applicable fees;
(1)
B.
§ 181-71 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 181-72
1:627
A list of abutters certified by the Assessor's Office, to be used
by the applicant to provide notice;
(d)
A list of requested waivers, if applicable. Such a request shall
be accompanied by an explanation or documentation and as
described in § 181-79;
(e)
(f) A stormwater management plan;
(g) An erosion and sediment control plan;
(h) An operation and maintenance (O&M) plan;
Above-threshold projects subject to the National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for
Storm Water Discharges from Construction Activities
("Construction General Permit") shall also submit the following
with their application unless otherwise waived under 40 CFR
§ 122.26(b)(15)(i):
A copy of the notice of intent to comply with the
Construction General Permit; and
[1]
A copy of receipt of EPA authorization letter and tracking
number.
[2]
(i)
A surety bond, if required, consistent with § 181-76 of these
regulations.
(j)
For below-threshold projects, applicants shall submit an erosion
and sediment control plan, consistent with performance standards
identified in § 181-74, directly to the Town of Lexington Building
Department during application for residential or commercial
building permits. Successful application of and acquisition of a
Town of Lexington building permit will constitute compliance of
below-threshold project applicants with these regulations.
(2)
Entry on land. By filing an application for a stormwater management
permit, the property owner grants the Stormwater Agency and its
agents, officers, and employees permission to enter the site to verify
the information in the application and to inspect for compliance after
issuance of the stormwater management permit, including the making
of such examinations, surveys, or sampling as the Stormwater Agency
deems necessary for such inspections, subject to the constitutions and
laws of the United States and the commonwealth.
C.
Fees. For an above-threshold project, an applicant shall pay with each
submission of an application an application fee to cover expenses
connected with the administration of and review of the stormwater
management permit and a technical review and inspection fee sufficient
to cover professional services. The Stormwater Agency is authorized
to retain a registered professional engineer or other professional
consultant to advise the Agency on any or all aspects of these
D.
§ 181-72 LEXINGTON CODE § 181-72
1:628
applications. Applicants must pay application and applicable technical
review and inspection fees before the review process may begin. Fees
shall be calculated as follows:
Application fees for above-threshold projects.
All projects subject to the Stormwater Management Bylaw:
a nonrefundable fee of $0.01 per square foot of the project
disturbed area to be permitted, up to a maximum of $1,500.
(a)
(b) Permit extensions/modifications: a nonrefundable fee of $100.
(1)
Technical review and inspection fees for above-threshold projects.
In addition to the above fees, the Stormwater Agency is
authorized to require an applicant to pay a fee for the
reasonable costs and expenses for specific engineering and
other consultant services deemed necessary by the
Stormwater Agency. Payment of such fees may be required at
any point in the review and inspection process prior to final
certificate of completion. The initial amount of this technical
review fee shall be $5,000. The final amount shall be
determined by the Town Engineer. If the actual cost incurred
by the Town for review of said application is less than the
amount on deposit as specified above, the Stormwater Agency
shall authorize that such excess amount be refunded to the
applicant concurrently with final action on said application.
(a)
Such fee shall be held in a revolving fund by the Stormwater
Agency, to be used to engage independent consultants should
the Stormwater Agency determine necessary, based on the
characteristics or complexity of the issues raised by the
application and/or construction. Such fee shall be governed
and administered in accordance with MGL c.44 § 53G.
(b)
If prior to certificate of completion issuance, the Stormwater
Agency finds that the initial deposit is not sufficient to cover
actual costs incurred by the Town during the review of the
application, the applicant shall be required to submit forthwith
such additional amount as is deemed required by the
Stormwater Agency to cover such costs. The Stormwater
Agency shall notify the applicant of such additional amount in
writing. Failure to submit such additional amount as required
within 14 days of receipt of said notice shall be deemed reason
to deny said application.
(c)
The Stormwater Agency reserves the right to waive or discount
its fees at its discretion.
(d)
(2)
Permit application review procedures. The Stormwater Agency shall
review all applications for a stormwater management permit for
completeness. If the Stormwater Agency determines that the
E.
§ 181-72 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 181-72
1:629
application is not complete, the Agency will notify the applicant in
writing, within 21 days of receipt of the application, what additional
information is required. The permit application review procedures are
as follows:
Preapplication meeting (recommended for above-threshold
projects only). Prior to submittal of an application, the applicant
may request a preapplication meeting. The Stormwater Agency
shall establish the meeting date during the Town's business hours.
The meeting shall be held at the Town's Department of Public
Works. The meeting will assist the applicant in submission of a
complete stormwater management permit application.
(1)
Abutter notification (required for above-threshold projects only). At
the time of application submittal, the applicant shall provide notice
to all abutters of the application's filing and invite comment to the
Agency on said application for a period of seven days. The Agency
shall make the application available for inspection by the public
during business hours at the Department of Public Works.
The Stormwater Agency may, in its discretion, waive this
requirement if abutters have been notified of the same project
at other stages of project approval by other Town of Lexington
boards or commissions.
(2)
Final action. The Stormwater Agency shall take final action within
21 days of the receipt of a complete application unless such time is
extended by agreement between the applicant and the Stormwater
Agency, per § 181-74E(4) below. The Stormwater Agency's final
action, rendered in writing, shall be filed with the Department of
Public Works and shall consist of either:
Approval of the stormwater management permit application
based upon determination that the proposed plan will
adequately protect the water resources of the Town of
Lexington and is in compliance with the requirements set forth
in these regulations;
(a)
Approval of the stormwater management permit application
subject to any conditions, modifications, or restrictions
required by the Stormwater Agency which will ensure that the
project will adequately protect the water resources of the Town
of Lexington and is in compliance with the requirements set
forth in these regulations; or
(b)
Disapproval of the stormwater management permit application
based upon a determination that the proposed plan, as
submitted, does not adequately protect water resources, as
set forth in these regulations, or the application is deemed
incomplete.
(c)
(3)
§ 181-72 LEXINGTON CODE § 181-72
1:630
§ 181-73. Performance standards.
Mutual extension of time. The required time limits for final action
may be extended by written agreement between the applicant and
the Stormwater Agency. A copy of such an agreement shall be filed
with the Department of Public Works.
(4)
Constructive approval. Failure of the stormwater Agency to take
a final action for an application within 21 days of receipt of a
complete application shall be deemed to be approval of said
application. Upon certification by the Town Clerk that the allowed
time has passed without Stormwater Agency action, the activity
may proceed as proposed in the application.
(5)
Changes to approved plans. The permittee must notify the Stormwater
Agency in writing of any significant change or alteration in the system
authorized in a stormwater management permit before any such
change or alteration is made. If the Stormwater Agency determines
within 21 days that the change or alteration is significantly different in
nature or character, it shall require the applicant to submit an amended
application and obtain approval of the change from the Stormwater
Agency prior to construction.
F.
Project completion. At final completion of all above-threshold projects,
the permittee shall request a certificate of completion pursuant to the
requirements of § 181-77 of these regulations.
G.
Expiration of stormwater management permit. A stormwater
management permit expires two years after the date of issuance. If the
project associated with an approved stormwater management permit
granted under the Stormwater Management Bylaw has not been
substantially completed within two years of permit issuance, a new
permit, or a permit extension may be required by the Stormwater
Agency.
H.
Minimum performance standards. Except as expressly provided, runoff
from all above-threshold projects shall meet Standards 1 through 10
of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection's
Stormwater Management Standards and Handbook using current best
management practices (BMPs) and these regulations. Where an
inconsistency exists between the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook
and these regulations, the stricter requirement shall apply.
A.
Additional design criteria.
Landscape design performance standards. Site plans and
landscape plans for all proposed projects shall take appropriate
steps to minimize water use for irrigation and to allow for natural
recharge of groundwater. Native species and habitat creating
species shall be used in all landscape plans to the maximum extent
(1)
B.
§ 181-72 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 181-73
1:631
possible. Invasive species shall not be planted in the Town of
Lexington.
Hydrological basis for design. For stormwater facility sizing
criteria, the basis for hydrologic and hydraulic evaluation of
development and redevelopment sites are as follows:
Evaluation and implementation of low-impact development
(LID) practices is required to the maximum extent practicable.
Guidance on these practices is provided in Appendix VI-B65 and
the Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook.
(a)
The condition and capacity of any existing infrastructure that
will be connected to or from the proposed development shall
be evaluated.
(b)
The twenty-four-hour rainfall amounts shall be based on the
Northeast Regional Climate Center "Atlas of Precipitation
Extremes for the Northeastern United States and Southeastern
Canada" (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of an inch).
(c)
The minimum time of concentration for street drainage shall
be five minutes.
(d)
Water velocities in pipes and gutters shall be between two feet
and 10 feet per second, not more than five feet per second
on paved surfaces, and not more than four feet per second in
vegetated areas.
(e)
Impervious cover is measured from the site plan and includes
any material or structure on or above the ground that prevents
water from infiltrating through the underlying soil (including
compacted gravel).
(f)
Off-site areas shall be assessed based on their predeveloped
condition for computing the water quality volume (i.e.,
treatment of only on-site areas is required). However, if an offsite
area drains to a proposed stormwater management facility,
flow from that area must be accounted for in the sizing of a
specific facility.
(g)
Off-site areas draining to a proposed facility should be modeled
as present condition for peak-flow attenuation requirements.
(h)
The length of sheet flow used in time of concentration
calculations is limited to no more than 100 feet.
(i)
Detention time shall be computed as the time between the
center of mass of the inflow hydrograph and the center of
mass of the outflow hydrograph. For purposes of choosing
a runoff curve number, all pervious lands in the site shall

§ 181-74. Erosion control performance standards.
be assumed prior to development to be in good hydrologic
condition regardless of conditions existing at the time of
computation.
Proposed residential, commercial, or industrial subdivisions
or ANRs shall apply these stormwater management criteria
to the land development as a whole. Individual lots in new
subdivisions shall not be considered separate land
development projects, but rather the entire subdivision shall
be considered a single common plan of development.
Hydrologic parameters shall reflect the ultimate land
development and shall be used in all engineering calculations.
(k)
Discharges to water-quality impaired waters. The applicant must
determine whether stormwater discharges from the proposed site
will contribute, either directly or indirectly, to the impairment of an
impaired water body with or without approved total maximum daily
load. The Massachusetts Integrated List of Waters is published
every two years and shall be the reference for determination of
water body impairment listings. Stormwater management facilities
and nonstructural stormwater BMPs shall be selected that will
control the discharge of the pollutant(s) identified as causing the
impairment.
(3)
Erosion and sediment control design criteria. The following erosion
and sediment control performance standards must be met. Except as
expressly provided, all stormwater management permit projects shall
meet Standard 8 of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection's Stormwater Management Standards and Handbook using
current best management practices (BMPs) and these regulations.
Where an inconsistency exists between the Massachusetts Stormwater
Handbook and these regulations, the stricter requirement shall apply.
Minimize total area of disturbance and minimize unnecessary
clearing and grading from all construction sites. Clearing and
grading shall only be performed within areas needed to build the
project, including structures, utilities, roads, recreational
amenities, post-construction stormwater management facilities,
and related infrastructure.
(1)
Prior to any land disturbance activities commencing on the site, the
developer shall physically mark limits of the allowable disturbance
on the site with tape, signs, or orange construction fence, so that
workers can see the areas to be protected. The physical markers
shall be inspected daily by the permittee.
(2)
Erosion and sediment control measures shall be installed and
maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications
(3)
A.
§ 181-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 181-74
1:633
and good engineering practices to ensure they perform as
intended.
Erosion and sediment control measures used shall be chosen based
on the goal of minimizing site disturbance from installation of such
measures.
(4)
Stormwater runoff velocities shall be minimized to the greatest
extent practicable. Increases in runoff velocities due to the removal
of existing vegetative cover during development and the resulting
increase in impermeable surface area after development must be
taken into account when providing for erosion control.
(5)
Protect disturbed areas from stormwater runoff. Best management
practices (BMPs) can be utilized to prevent water from entering
and running over the disturbed area. Diversions and other control
practices to intercept runoff from higher watershed areas, store or
divert it away from vulnerable areas, and direct it toward stabilized
outlets may be used.
(6)
Sediment trapping and settling devices shall be employed to trap
and/or retain suspended sediments and allow time for them to
settle out in cases where perimeter sediment controls (e.g., silt
fence and hay bales) are deemed to be ineffective in trapping
suspended sediments on-site.
(7)
Stormwater management facilities to be used after construction
shall not be used as BMPs during construction unless otherwise
approved by the Stormwater Agency. Many technologies are not
designed to handle the high concentrations of sediments typically
found in construction runoff, and thus must be protected from
construction related sediment loadings.
(8)
Sediment shall be removed once the volume reaches 1/4 to 1/2 the
height of a perimeter sediment control system. Sediment shall be
removed from silt fence prior to reaching the load-bearing capacity
of the silt fence which may be lower than 1/4 to 1/2 the height.
(9)
Sediment from sediment traps or sedimentation ponds shall be
removed when design capacity has been reduced by 50%.
(10)
On and off-site material storage areas, including construction and
waste materials, shall be properly protected and managed.
(11)
Soil stockpiles must be stabilized or covered at the end of each
workday. Stockpile side slopes shall not be greater than 2:1. All
stockpiles shall be surrounded by sediment controls.
(12)
Projects must comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws
and regulations, including waste disposal, sanitary sewer or septic
system regulations, and air quality requirements, including dust
and debris control.
(13)
§ 181-74 LEXINGTON CODE § 181-74
1:634
§ 181-75. Stormwater management plan contents.
Interim and permanent stabilization measures shall be instituted
on a disturbed area immediately after construction activity has
temporarily or permanently ceased on that portion of the site. Two
methods are available for stabilizing disturbed areas: mechanical
(or structural) methods and vegetative methods. In some cases,
both are combined in order to control erosion.
(14)
Temporary sediment trapping devices must not be removed until
permanent stabilization is established in all contributory drainage
areas.
(15)
The duration of the exposure of disturbed areas due to removal of
vegetation and/or regrading shall be stated in writing in a schedule
that will be prepared at the time of application for permit and
maintained as part of the project records.
(16)
Dust control shall be used during grading operations. Dust control
methods may consist of grading fine soils on calm days only or
dampening the ground with water.
(17)
During construction, all disturbed areas shall be enclosed with
compost filter socks in the down gradient direction or in any
direction to which erosion can occur.
(18)
During construction, any site entrance from a paved, public way
shall be improved with a temporary construction entrance built
in accordance with the recommendations of the Massachusetts
Erosion and Sediment Control Guidelines for Urban and Suburban
Areas to prevent soil from being transported onto the street.
(19)
During construction, catchbasin or other drainage system inlet
structures down gradient of the construction entrance shall be
protected with silt sacks or other inlet protection device.
(20)
If the work produces or distributes soil on public or private ways,
that soil shall be cleaned up by the responsible party as soon as
possible but in all cases within 24 hours.
(21)
If the work causes the discharge of soil to Town drainage
structures, all affected downstream pipes shall be cleaned by the
responsible party within three days.
(22)
The application for a stormwater management permit shall include the
submittal of a stormwater management plan to the Stormwater Agency
for all above-threshold projects. The stormwater management plan
shall also contain sufficient information for the Stormwater Agency to
evaluate the environmental impact, effectiveness, and acceptability of
the measures proposed by the applicant for mitigating adverse impacts
from stormwater runoff. This plan shall be designed to meet the
Massachusetts Stormwater Standards and additional criteria
A.
§ 181-74 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 181-75
1:635
established in these regulations, and must be submitted with the stamp
and signature of a professional engineer (PE) licensed to conduct such
work in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
The stormwater management plan shall fully describe the project in
drawings, narrative, and calculations and shall include the following:
Project narrative. Required contents of the stormwater
management plan narrative are provided in Appendix VI-C66 of
these regulations.
(1)
Project drawings and specifications. Required contents of the
stormwater management plan drawings and specifications are
provided in Appendix VI-C of these regulations.
(2)
Erosion and sediment control plan.
An erosion and sediment control plan is required at the time
of application for all projects. Plan approval by the Stormwater
Agency is required prior to any land disturbances. The plan
shall be designed to ensure compliance with the stormwater
management permit, these regulations, the Massachusetts
Stormwater Handbook, oand the NPDES Construction General
Permit (when applicable). In addition, the plan shall ensure
that the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards (314
CMR 4.00) are met in all seasons.
(a)
If a project requires a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP) per the NPDES Construction General Permit, the
applicant must also submit a complete copy of the SWPPP as
part of its application for a stormwater management permit.
If the SWPPP meets the requirements of the Construction
General Permit, it will be considered equivalent to the erosion
and sediment control plan described in this section.
(b)
The erosion and sediment control plan shall contain sufficient
information to describe the nature and purpose of the
proposed development, pertinent conditions of the site and
the adjacent areas, and proposed erosion and sedimentation
controls. The applicant shall submit such material as is
necessary to show that the proposed development will comply
with the design requirements listed below.
(c)
For larger developments where construction phasing occurs,
the erosion and sediment control plan shall be updated as
needed based on changing conditions at the site.
(d)
Required contents of the erosion and sediment control plan are
provided in Appendix VI-D67 of these regulations.

Operation and maintenance plan.
An operation and maintenance (O&M) plan is required at the
time of application for all above-threshold projects. The O&M
plan shall be designed to ensure compliance with the permit,
these regulations and the Massachusetts Stormwater
Handbook, and that the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality
Standards (314 CMR 4.00) are met in all seasons and
throughout the life of all of the project's stormwater
management facilities. The O&M plan shall be a stand-alone
document, submitted as a digital file, preferably .PDF, in
addition to paper copy and shall remain on file with the
Stormwater Agency. Compliance with the O&M plan shall be
an ongoing requirement. When applicable, stormwater
management easements will be required for all areas used
for off-site stormwater control, unless the Stormwater Agency
grants a waiver. To ensure that all stormwater management
facilities continue to function as designed, a final O&M plan
shall be submitted prior to issuance of a certificate of
completion. This plan shall reflect any modifications made
during the permitting process and the site specific conditions.
(a)
The O&M plan shall include, at a minimum:
The names, addresses and contact information of the
property owner(s).
[1]
[2] The signature(s) of the owner(s).
The names, addresses, and contact information of the
person(s) responsible for site operation and maintenance,
including how future property owners will be notified of
the presence of the stormwater management facilities and
the requirement for proper operation and maintenance; if
responsibility is contracted to a third party, a copy of the
maintenance agreement(s) with said third party must be
provided.
[3]

Agency.
[8]
Stormwater management facilities and practices included in
an O&M plan shall undergo ongoing inspections to document
maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the
requirements of the agreement, the plan and § 181-78 of these
regulations. At a minimum, inspections shall occur once every
year.
(c)
Surety.
Stormwater completion surety.
As a condition of issuance of the stormwater management
permit, and before the start of any land disturbance or
construction activity, the Stormwater Agency may require the
applicant to post a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit,
cash, or other acceptable security in an amount sufficient to
guarantee completion of the approved estimated cost of
construction.
(a)
The form of the bond shall be approved by the Stormwater
Agency, and be in an amount deemed sufficient by the
Stormwater Agency to ensure that the work will be completed
in accordance with the permit.
(b)
If the project is phased, the Stormwater Agency may release
part of the bond as each phase is completed in compliance with
the permit but the bond may not be released to an amount
less than 15% of the original amount until the Stormwater
Agency has received the final inspection report as required by
§ 181-77B(1) of these regulations and issued a certificate of
completion.
(c)
This requirement will be considered met if a surety bond that
complies with the provisions of this Subsection A has been
required by other Town boards or commissions.
(d)
(1)
A.
Inspections. Construction site inspections shall be conducted by the
applicant in accordance with the approved stormwater management
plan. Noncompliance issues discovered during inspections are the
responsibility of the construction site operator to resolve in a timely

arrange for an on-site, preconstruction meeting. The
applicant's technical representative, the general contractor,
or any other person with authority to make changes to the
project, shall meet with the Stormwater Agency or its
representative to review construction sequencing and the
permitted plans and their implementation.
(a)
The applicant shall maintain a copy of the approved and signed
plans and permits for a stormwater management permit, and
documentation demonstrating that conditions of approval have
been met, including a copy of the approved erosion and
sediment control plan and, if applicable, an EPA Authorization

Inspections by applicant.
To ensure erosion control practices are in accord with the
filed erosion and sediment control plan, the applicant or an
authorized representative will conduct erosion and sediment
control inspections at least once every 14 calendar days, and
within 24 hours of the end of a storm event of 0.25 inch
or greater, from the start of construction until the site is
permanently stabilized. Inspection frequency may be reduced
to once a month if the site is temporarily stabilized, runoff
is unlikely due to winter conditions (e.g., site is covered with
snow, ice, or the ground is frozen), or, if construction is
occurring during seasonal dry periods. The applicant shall
obtain approval from the Stormwater Agency for any change in
inspection frequency, including termination of inspections due
to site stabilization.
(a)
Erosion and sediment control inspections must include all
areas of the site disturbed by construction activity and areas
used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation.
The individual conducting the inspection must look for
evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the
stormwater conveyance system. Sedimentation and erosion
control measures identified in the erosion and sediment
control plan must be observed to ensure proper operation.
Discharge locations must be inspected to ascertain whether
erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to waters of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and
United States, where accessible. Where discharge locations
are inaccessible, nearby downstream locations must be
inspected to the extent that such inspections are practicable.
(b)
(2)
§ 181-76 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 181-76

of public access on a temporary or permanent basis, including without
limitation devices designed to collect, distribute or sell any item, such as
private delivery service boxes, boxes for the collection of other items and
boxes for newspapers or other literature, provided that the term shall not
include those structures or devices erected or placed by authorized public
agencies for public safety and/or public welfare purposes. Authorized public
safety/public welfare devices include, but are not limited to, streetlights,
traffic lights, mailboxes, fire hydrants, trees and trash receptacles.
PERSON  Any individual or entity that owns, installs, manages, maintains,
leases, controls or uses any outdoor box.
§ 187-2. General regulations.
In order to maintain safe and clean sidewalks and streets, all persons within
the Town of Lexington must comply with each of the following regulations
with respect to outdoor boxes:
Any person may install, use, or maintain an outdoor box as long as no
portion of the outdoor box projects into or over any part of the roadway
of any public street or any part of a driveway, entryway or public street
point of access for a home, business, or other public or private property.
A.
Any person may install, use, or maintain an outdoor box as long as no
portion of the outdoor box resting in whole or in part upon or over any
sidewalk or public path endangers the safety of persons or property,
unreasonably interferes with or impedes the flow of pedestrian or
vehicular traffic, hinders the use of any handicapped access ramps
or otherwise interferes with compliance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act, interferes with or impedes the ingress or egress from
any residence, place of business, or any legally parked or stopped
vehicle, impairs the visibility of a motor vehicle entering the roadway,
interferes with the cleaning of any sidewalk for the purposes of snow
removal or other public maintenance, or interferes with the use of
poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, parking meters,
mailboxes or other public fixtures or utilities.
B.
All outdoor boxes that are located on public property must be located
within specific zones, which zones shall be delineated by the Director.

be placed within 300 feet of each other.
F.
No outdoor box may contain a publication or literature that is harmful
to minors as defined by MGL c. 272, § 31.
G.
All persons who wish to place an outdoor box on a public walkway or
public path or on any public property must pay a nominal maintenance
fee to the Town in order to offset the aggregate increased cost of
maintaining public property (grass, curbs, sidewalks, etc.) in the
immediate vicinity of the outdoor boxes. The maintenance fee shall
be established and adjusted from time to time as approved by the
Selectmen, with the recommendation of the Director, who will estimate
the increased costs of property maintenance near and around outdoor
boxes.
H.
Securing and anchoring outdoor boxes.
No outdoor box shall be chained, anchored, or attached in any
manner to public property, including signposts, parking meters,
fences, trash receptacles, or other public fixtures without the
explicit approval of the Director in advance. The Director may deny
approval to secure an outdoor box to public property if, in his or
her determination, such action would physically or aesthetically
damage public property, create an impediment to pedestrian,
bicycle or motor vehicle traffic or otherwise create an unsafe
condition. Any denial of such permission shall be accompanied by
the Director's statement of the specific reasons for such denial.
(1)
I.
§ 187-2 LEXINGTON CODE § 187-2
1:650
§ 187-3. Application process.
In order to prevent theft, outdoor boxes may be anchored or
attached to each other or anchored by other theft prevention
methods, only so long as all such methods are specifically approved
by the Director in advance. The Director may deny such approval
pursuant to the guidelines in Subsection I(1) above, and such
denial shall be accompanied by the Director's statement of the
specific reasons for such denial.
(2)
Any person who intends to install or maintain an outdoor box on public
property, or who currently maintains and intends to continue to
maintain an outdoor box on public property after the effective date
of these regulations, must submit an application to the Director. Such
application should be addressed to the Director, to the attention of
"outdoor box applications," and must contain the following information:
The person's name, address and phone number and the name or
title of the publication or literature to be distributed.
(1)
The number of outdoor boxes proposed to be located on public
property.
(2)
The precise location at which each outdoor box will be located,
specifically describing the street or streets, intersections and/or
the street address nearest to the proposed location.
(3)
If one or more of the outdoor boxes will be located within a zoned
historic district, a certificate of appropriateness issued for each
such outdoor box by the LHDC.
(4)
A.
If any portion of the application is incomplete, the Director shall deny
the application. After the application is submitted, the Director may
conduct a site inspection of the proposed location for each outdoor
box or, for those persons already maintaining an outdoor box on public
property, the Director may conduct a site inspection of the current
location of each existing outdoor box. Subject to the provisions of
these regulations, and any other applicable regulations or bylaws, the
Director will approve or deny the application for any proposed location
or locations. If the application is denied, the Director must state the
reasons for such denial, specifically referring to the provision or
provisions of these regulations (or other law) that the proposed location
would contravene or specifically describing the manner in which the
proposed location would physically or aesthetically damage public
property, create an impediment to pedestrian, bicycle or motor vehicle
traffic or otherwise create an unsafe condition.
B.
If the application is denied, the applicant may appeal in writing within
14 days of the date of the Director's decision to the Town Manager.
Within the same fourteen-day period, the applicant may also request
that the Town Manager grant a variance from these regulations on
C.
§ 187-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-3

§ 187-4. Historic districts.
Outdoor boxes are not exempt from regulation under the Historic Districts
Act. Therefore, in addition to the above general regulations, in order to
preserve the unique physical character of the local historic districts, any
person who intends to place an outdoor box within one of the four
established historic districts of the Town must first receive a certificate of
appropriateness from the LHDC.
the ground that denial of the application will deprive the applicant of
sufficient alternative means of communication, in violation of federal
or state constitutional guaranties of free speech or free press. The
written appeal or variance request shall fully state all the facts and
reasons supporting the claim for relief on appeal. On appeal, the Town
Manager shall have the power to grant the application with or without
conditions, grant a variance or affirm the Director's denial. The Town
Manager shall issue a decision within 14 days of receipt of the written
appeal.
If the application is denied, the Director may order the relocation or
removal of any outdoor boxes which are located on public property as of
the effective date of these regulations, with such relocation or removal
to be undertaken within 10 days of the Director's order (or, if the denial
is appealed unsuccessfully, within 10 days after the Town Manager's
affirmance of the Director's denial and of the denial of any variance
request).
D.
Applications to maintain outdoor boxes existing on the date these
regulations are adopted must be submitted by January 1, 2001, and, if
timely submitted, will serve to authorize continued maintenance of an
outdoor box at its current location unless and until the application is
denied by the Director or, if an appeal is taken, by the Town Manager.
E.
The LHDC shall receive applications for certificates of appropriateness
from persons intending to install or continue maintaining an outdoor
box within a historic district. Upon receipt of an application, the LHDC
shall hold a hearing to evaluate the potential impact on the integrity
of the historic district, taking into account the proposed location of the
outdoor box, the exterior design, color and signage displayed on the
outdoor box and the proposed method, if any, of anchoring the outdoor
box. After weighing the above factors, the LHDC must issue or deny
the certificate of appropriateness. If the LHDC denies the certificate
of appropriateness, it must state the specific reasons for such denial
and inform the applicant of what steps can be undertaken to enhance a
successful subsequent application.
A.
A certificate of appropriateness must accompany each application to
the Director for installation of an outdoor box in a historic district and
must remain on file with the Director. If the Director discovers that an
outdoor box is located within a historic district without a certificate

§ 187-24. Background.
The Town of Lexington, by a vote of its citizens, had earlier established
alcoholic beverage licenses for restaurants with a minimum seating
capacity of 99. In 2002, the Lexington Center Committee began to discuss
ways to attract more businesses to the commercial district. It found that
surrounding communities such as Arlington and Waltham had revitalized
their commercial areas by attracting smaller chef-owned restaurants. The
ability to sell alcohol made these restaurants economically viable. Town
Meeting passed a home rule petition seeking to eliminate the ninety-nineseat
minimum seating capacity. That petition was approved by the
Legislature and then overwhelmingly approved by the citizens on March 2,
2004, by a vote of 7022 to 1224.
Statements and information provided in all applications shall be made
under the pains and penalties of perjury, and any false statement
contained in any application shall be cause for refusing to grant or
renew the alcoholic beverage license or for suspending, canceling or
revoking an alcoholic beverage license already granted.
F.
The annual license fee is due at the time of applying for or renewing an
alcoholic beverage license. Annual fees are as follows:
(1) All alcohol: $3,500.
(2) Wine and malt only: $2,500.
G.
For a new license or change of license, an administrative fee of $100 is
due at the time of application.
H.
If an applicant is denied a license, a new application shall not be
received for 12 months unless a Board of Selectmen member, who
previously voted against the application, moves to allow resubmission
and such motion prevails.

Burglar, Hold-Up and Other Alarms for Police Service
[Adopted 8-15-1980; amended through 6-18-2007]
§ 187-85. Purpose.
§ 187-86. Definitions
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ALARM COMPANY  A person or business that sells, provides, monitors,
maintains, services, repairs, alters, replaces, moves or installs an alarm
system. This includes an individual or business that installs an alarm system
for his or its private or proprietary facilities.
ALARM OFFICER  A designee of the Police Department responsible for
administration of the alarm program. The Alarm Officer is charged with the
responsibility of reviewing alarm activations, service fee billing, reporting
on problematic alarm systems and serving as a resource to the community.
ALARM SYSTEM  A device or series of devices that emits or transmits a
remote or local audible, visual or electronic signal indicating an alarm has
been activated and is intended or is likely to result in the summoning of
police services. This does not include an alarm installed in a vehicle unless
the vehicle is permanently located at the site.
ALARM USER  Any homeowner, renter, lessee, or other resident and any
renter, lessee, or owner of a business or other establishment or building
(other than a government facility) who is primarily responsible for an alarm
system and/or an activation of the alarm system.
ALARM VERIFICATION  An alarm that has been independently verified by
a third party other than the Police Department confirming that the alarm
was activated as the result of a crime or incident requiring the police to
investigate.
AUTOMATIC VOICE DIALER  Any electronic, mechanical or other device
that, when activated, automatically contacts the Police Department by
telephone, radio or other means requesting police services through a
prerecorded message or other automated system.
Pursuant to Chapter 5, formerly Section 28 of Article XXV of the
General By-Laws of the Town of Lexington, these rules and regulations
for police alarms are hereby adopted, effective September 15, 1980, as
amended on November 14, 1988, on August 5, 1991, on December 16,
1991 and on July 1, 2007.
A.
The alarm history in Lexington from 1991 through 2006 provided
statistical evidence that less than 1% of alarm activations involve
criminal conduct. The model burglar alarm ordinance drafted by the
National Burglar & Fire Alarm Association and the False Alarm
Reduction Association was used as a resource.
B.
§ 187-85 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-86
1:677
CANCELLATION  The notification of the Police Department by the person
who initially requests police response to a non-high-risk alarm activation
that the situation does not require a police response.
CONTACT PERSON  One or more individuals, or a private business,
that can respond to the alarm location to assist police and fire services
to thoroughly inspect the property, secure unlocked doors and windows,
deactivate or reset an alarm, and/or take responsibility for protected
property.
FALSE ALARM  Any alarm where a responding officer(s), having
completed a timely investigation of the alarm site, finds no reasonable
evidence of a criminal offense. False alarms include avoidable alarms
whereby the alarm activation caused by noncriminal behavior could have
been avoided with simple preventative measures.
HIGH-RISK ALARMS  Include panic, duress, silent, robbery, holdup and/
or any similarly labeled alarm that suggests the alarm has been manually
activated and a crime is in progress or there is some other life threatening
event. High-risk alarms also include commercial establishments, such as
gas stations, banks, jewelry stores and/or businesses with cash or valuables
commonly victimized by robbery or commercial thefts.
NUISANCE ALARM  Any alarm that activates repeatedly and/or
unnecessarily within the same twenty-four-hour period, emits an outside
audible that does not reset after 10 minutes, emits an outside audible
that sounds more than twice from the same activation, and/or when the
Chief of Police, or a designee, determines the alarm is a nuisance due to a
violation(s) of these rules and regulations.
§ 187-87. Automatic voice dialers prohibited; non-high-risk alarm
activations.
§ 187-88. Alarm registration.
Alarm users are prohibited from using and alarm companies are
prohibited from installing automatic voice dialers. A violation of this
rule is punishable by fine.
A.
Alarm activations that are not high-risk alarms should be reported to
the Police Department on the published business telephone line. Known
emergencies should be reported by dialing 9-1-1. Other special lines
may be designated by the Police Chief to report alarm activations.

An alarm company that monitors alarm systems with the purpose of
reporting alarm activations to the Police Department shall register all
alarm systems monitored by the company located within Lexington
annually between January 1 and January 15. If registering 10 or more
alarms, the list must be provided in alphabetical order by name.
Whenever there is a change, the alarm company will register, within
two weeks, any new and removed alarm systems or when there has
been a change to the required registration information.
B.
An alarm company without registration information must coordinate
with the alarm user and/or the person or business that retains the
registration information and confirm that each alarm system is properly
registered. Without confirmation that an alarm system is properly
registered, alarm verification is required prior to reporting the alarm
activation to the Lexington Police Department.
C.
An alarm user with an alarm company is excused from registering his or
her alarm if an alarm company has registered the same alarm system.
The alarm user and the alarm company are responsible for coordinating
who will register the alarm system.

a local audible, visual or electronic signal indicating an alarm has been
activated and is intended or is likely to result in the summoning of
police services. The address, name of the person responsible for the
alarm system and phone number of the property must be provided
annually between January 1 and January 15 and/or within two weeks of
a change to this information.
E.
No fee. There is no fee for registering an alarm system. The costs for
police service to false alarms will be carried by those alarm users whose
alarm system(s) causes three or more false alarms in a calendar year.
F.
No registration is required if the residence or business has no local
audible, visual or electronic signal that alerts a neighbor or passing
person that an alarm has been activated and for other types of alarms
where the alarm user or alarm company provides alarm verification.
In these instances, no false alarm will be reported to the Police
Department.
G.
Recommendation; use of contact person. When registering an alarm
system, the Police Department will accept the name of and encourages
the use of a contact person. This information will be used when there is
an alarm activation to help protect the property or to avoid additional
false alarms.
H.
A violation of § 187-88, including any false statements during the
registration process, is punishable by fine.

Maintain: insure that the alarm system is properly installed and
maintained to minimize or eliminate false alarms (including equipment
that prevents false alarms during regional power outages and severe
storms). If two false alarms are received in a calendar year, the alarm
system should be inspected, repaired if needed, and/or the alarm
user(s) should receive additional training in the use of the alarm
system.
B.
Train: insure that all persons who may activate the alarm are properly
trained in the use of the alarm system and/or have the means to disarm
and rearm the alarm system without causing a false alarm.
C.
Proper use. Adjust the alarm system so that an alarm's audible signal
sounds for no longer than 10 minutes after being activated. The alarm
shall be programmed to sound or cycle not more than twice during any
single activation. The alarm user shall not intentionally cause a false
alarm resulting in a police response to the alarm site. Any violation of
this subsection is punishable by a fine.
D.
Proper installation. The alarm company shall install alarm systems that
meet current industry standards and offer alarm users written and oral
instructions as to the proper use of the system. The alarm company
should make regular maintenance, upgrades and remedial training
available to the alarm users.
A.
High-risk alarms. Alarm companies should clearly distinguish high-risk
alarms when reporting an alarm activation to the Police Department.
High-risk alarms will be given a high-priority police response.
B.
Reporting alarm. The alarm company representative, when reporting
an alarm activation, should provide when available the nature of the
alarm, the owner's name and the address of the alarm, the location
within the address where the alarm was activated, and any other
pertinent information that may assist police officers to safely
investigate the alarm.
C.
Cancellation: An alarm cancellation should be reported to the Police
Department as soon as it is learned that a police response is not
required. Cancellations received prior to police arrival will not result
in a service fee. No cancellation will be accepted for high-risk alarm
activations.
D.
The Police Chief, or his designee, may suspend police response to any
alarm where an undue number of false alarms have occurred and/or
where an alarm user or alarm company does not reasonably comply
with any provision of the police alarm bylaw.
A.
§ 187-89 LEXINGTON CODE § 187-91
1:680
§ 187-92. Alarm service fee.

suspended without the prior investigation by the alarm officer or other
designee as to the reasons for excessive false alarms.
B.
Residential alarm. When there have been three false alarm activations
in a twenty-four-hour period, the Police Chief or designee may suspend
further police response to the alarm for up to three days. When there
have been eight false alarms that are subject to the alarm service fee,
the Police Chief or designee may suspend further police response for
any period of time thereafter.
C.
Nonresidential alarm. When there have been three false alarm
activations in a twenty-four-hour period, the Police Chief or designee
may suspend further police response to the alarm for up to three days.
When there have been 10 false alarms that are subject to the alarm
service fee, the Police Chief or designee may suspend further police
response for any period of time thereafter.
D.
Restoration of service. The Police Chief or designee may authorize
restoration of police response when an alarm user or alarm company
reasonably demonstrates that he or it has taken appropriate measures
to prevent additional false alarms and/or has come into full compliance
with these rules and regulations.
E.
Residential. An alarm service fee of $80 will be assessed on the third
and each subsequent false alarm in a calendar year. The alarm service
fee for the first and second alarm will not be assessed, provided no
additional false alarms occur during the calendar year; these fees will
be deferred and included in part proportionately in each service fee for
the third and subsequent false alarm, up to and including the eighth
false alarm.
A.
Nonresidential and high-risk alarms. An alarm service fee of $120 will
be assessed on the third and each subsequent false alarm in a calendar
year. The alarm service fee for the first and second alarm will not be
assessed, provided no additional false alarms occur during the calendar
year; these fees will be deferred and included in part proportionately
in each service fee for the third and subsequent false alarm, up to and
including the 10th false alarm.

In the interest of public safety, all employees or representatives of the
Town of Lexington will hold confidential all information contained in alarm
registrations and/or information that specifically identifies an alarm system.
§ 187-95. Government immunity.
Alarm registration is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty
or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response. Any and all liability
and consequential damages resulting from the failure to respond to a
notification are hereby disclaimed. Governmental immunity, as provided by
law, is retained. By registering an alarm, the alarm user and the alarm
company acknowledge that law enforcement response may be influenced by

purpose of the regulation is to set forth guidance and understanding of the
level of service the Town will provide for maintenance.
§ 187-108. Maintenance; temporary repairs; extensive repair.
§ 187-109. Notification.
After receiving a complaint regarding a defect within a private way, the
Town will investigate to determine the type of repair necessary for safe
passage of emergency vehicles.
§ 187-110. Effective date.
This policy shall take effect 90 days from the date of approval.
The owners abutting private ways are responsible for the maintenance
of such ways. Constructed private ways must be maintained so that
there are no defects to impede the safe passage of emergency vehicles.
A.
The Town may perform temporary repairs to private ways if such
repairs are determined by the Director of Public Works to be required
for public safety vehicles. Said repairs shall be considered necessary
to abate the immediate hazard caused by the defect and shall not
be considered as maintenance of the private way nor shall the way
be considered a public way. The Town shall not be liable for any
damage incurred by the defect, subsequent repair or failure to make
repairs to private ways. Defects, such as potholes, shall be repaired
with materials similar to the road surface and base.
B.
If more extensive repairs beyond grading, patching, or layering of
gravel are requested or if a direct abutter desires repairs for pedestrian
and/or bicycle safety, then a petition must be signed by a minimum
of 51% of the direct abutters to the unaccepted portion of the way.
The petition shall be delivered to the Board of Selectmen office and
copied to the Director of Public Works. Upon approval of the Board of
Selectman, repairs will be completed and all abutters to the unaccepted
way will bear the cost of the improvements through betterment charges
as defined in the bylaw. Unpaid betterments will be liened by the Tax
Collector/Treasurer. Scheduling of said repairs will be done by the DPW
and will be based on availability, weather, and available funding.

Pedestrian Control Regulations
§ 192-70. Pedestrians crossing ways or roadways.
Pedestrians shall obey the direction of police officers directing traffic, and
whenever there is an officer directing traffic or a traffic control signal within
300 feet of a pedestrian, no such pedestrian shall cross a way or roadway
except within the limits of the marked crosswalk at the signalized location
and as hereinafter provided in these regulations. For the purpose of these
regulations, a marked crosswalk shall only be construed to be that area of a
roadway reserved for pedestrian crossing located between two solid white
reflectorized twelve-inch pavement markings in rural areas or markings not
less than six inches wide in urban areas, said markings or lines being no
less than six feet apart.
§ 192-71. Pedestrian actuation.
§ 192-72. Pedestrian obedience to traffic control signals.
Traffic control signal color indications and legends shall have the commands
ascribed to them in this section and no other meanings, and every
pedestrian shall comply therewith, except when otherwise directed by an
officer.
At a traffic control signal location where pedestrian indications are
provided but are shown only upon actuation by means of a pedestrian
push button, no pedestrian shall cross a roadway unless or until the
pedestrian control signal push button has been actuated, and then
pedestrians shall cross only on the proper pedestrian signal indication.
At traffic control signal locations where no pedestrian indication is
provided, pedestrians shall cross only on the green indication. If
necessary, the green indication shall be actuated by the pedestrian by
means of a push button.
A.
At a traffic control signal location, pedestrians shall yield the rightof-
way to vehicles of a funeral or other procession or authorized
emergency vehicles while in performance of emergency duties
regardless of the signal indication given, and they shall not attempt to
cross the roadway until such vehicle or procession has passed, at which
time pedestrians shall then cross the roadway only as provided in these
regulations.
B.
Red and yellow or the word "walk." Whenever the red and yellow
lenses are illuminated together or the single word "walk" is illuminated,
pedestrians facing such indications may proceed across the roadway
and in the direction of such signal only.

Red alone or "don't walk." Whenever the words "don't walk" or any
indication other than red and yellow shown together is illuminated
in a traffic control signal where pedestrian indications are provided,
B.
§ 192-70 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 192-72
1:729
§ 192-73. Pedestrian crossing and use of roadways.
It shall be unlawful for any person to actuate a pedestrian control signal
unless a crossing of the roadway is intended.
§ 192-74. Operators to exercise due care. [Amended 9-23-2002;
6-18-2007]
The provisions of these regulations shall in no way abrogate the provisions
of MGL c. 90, §§ 14 and 14A, which provide precautions for safety of
other travelers and for the protection of blind persons crossing ways.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the provisions of these regulations, every
operator of a vehicle shall exercise due care to avoid colliding with any
pedestrian upon the roadway and shall give warning by sounding the horn
when necessary and shall exercise proper precautions which may become
necessary for safe operation. Violation of this section is a civil infraction
with a maximum fine of $60.
§ 192-75. Officers to enforce pedestrian regulations.
These pedestrian control regulations shall be enforced by all officers of the
Town of Lexington on and after January 1, 1965.
pedestrians approaching or facing such indication shall wait on the
sidewalk, edge or roadway or in the pedestrian refuge area of a traffic
island and shall not enter upon or cross a roadway until the proper
indication is illuminated in the traffic control signal, but any pedestrian
who has partially completed his crossing on the walk indication shall
proceed or return to the nearest sidewalk or safety island on the
yellow indication, the red indication or when the words "don't walk" are
illuminated by rapid intermittent flashes.
Green alone. At traffic control signal locations where no pedestrian
indication is given or provided, pedestrians facing the signal may
proceed across the roadway within any marked crosswalk in the
direction of the green indication.
C.
Yellow alone, red alone or flashing "don't walk." Pedestrians
approaching or facing a yellow, red or flashing "don't walk" illuminated
indication shall not start to cross a roadway.
D.
Flashing red, yellow or green. At any traffic control signal location
where a flashing red, flashing yellow or flashing green indication is
being given facing a crosswalk, pedestrians shall actuate, where
provided, the pedestrian signal indication and cross the roadway only
on the red-yellow or "walk" indication when such indication is in
operation. If no pedestrian signal is provided, pedestrians shall cross
within crosswalks with due care.
E.

roadway closed to travel or under construction or repair, to municipal, state,
federal or public service corporation employees while in the performance of
their duties, to officers engaged in the performance of their public duties or
to pedestrians acting in an emergency which such emergency necessitates
departure from any part of these rules and regulations.
§ 192-77. Penalties.
Any person who violates the provisions of this article which deal with the
proper use of ways by pedestrians shall be punished as provided in MGL c.
90, § 18A.
§ 192-78. Effect of regulations.
All existing rules and regulations governing the operation of vehicles or
the use of ways by pedestrians which are inconsistent herewith are hereby
expressly repealed. This repeal shall not, however, affect any punishment
or penalty imposed or any complaint or prosecution pending at the time
of passage hereof for any offense committed under any of said rules and
regulations hereby repealed. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or
phrase of these rules and regulations is for any reason unconstitutional,
such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of these
rules and regulations. The Board of Selectmen of the Town of Lexington
hereby declare that they would have passed these rules and regulations and
