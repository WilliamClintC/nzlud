infraction up to the entry of judgment. The City may

available under state law for municipal civil
infractions.
(2) The penalty for repeat offenses of the
same ordinance provision within two years of a
prior offense shall be a fine of not less than $50 and
not more than $1,000, plus costs and all other
remedies and sanctions available under state law

BIDDERS.
(A) Public policy. The City has a significant
interest in encouraging the creation of employment
opportunities for its residents and for businesses
located within the City. As a purchaser of goods and
services, the City will benefit from expanded job and
business opportunities for its residents and
businesses through additional revenues generated
by City purchases. It is in the interest of the City of
Big Rapids and its residents to define and quantify a
preference for local eligible bidders who have direct
physical and economic relationships with the City of
Big Rapids.
(B) The City also values the growth and
economic health of those businesses that are located
outside the City, but still in Mecosta County. It is in
the interest of the City to define and quantify a
preference for area bidders who have an economic
relationship with Mecosta County.
(C) This preference for local bidders and area
bidders shall not apply to purchases or projects in
which restricted state or federal grant funds are
utilized and the funding conditions prohibit such
preferences.
(1) Local bidders.
(a) Definition. LOCAL BIDDER shall
mean a bidder whose business is located within the
City of Big Rapids, whereby there is a physical and
economic relationship with the City demonstrated by
the payment of City income taxes on net profits, or
the payment of City property taxes on a plant, office,
or other developed site and equipment as is
ordinarily required for the performance of the
contract or service.

between $1,000 and $20,000 from a local bidder and
the amount of the bid is no more than 5% greater than
that of a non-local bidder in an amount not to exceed
$1,000, then the City Commission in its discretion
may consider the bids equal, and can award the bid
to the local bidder based on local preference.
2. On amounts between $20,000
and $500,000, the following local preference
percentage shall apply:
Amount Local bidder
preference
$20,000 to $100,000 4%
$100,001 to $500,000 3%
(2) Area bidders.
(a) Definition. AREA BIDDER shall
mean a bidder, vendor or business with an
established place of business outside of the City of
Big Rapids, but within Mecosta County.
(b) Preference for area bidders.
1. If the City receives a bid
between $1,000 and $20,000 from an area bidder and
the amount of the bid is no more than 2.5% greater
than that of a non-area bidder in an amount not to
exceed $1,000, then the City Commission in its
discretion may consider the bids equal, and can
award the bid to the area bidder based on local
preference.
2. On amounts between $20,000
and $500,000, the following area preference
percentage shall apply:
Amount Area bidder
preference
$20,000 to $100,000 2%

(3) Discretion. The use and application of
the local and area preference shall be in the sole
2014 S-12
City Boards and Commissions 23
discretion of the City Commission. No local or area
bidder can compel the City Commission to exercise
its discretion and apply the local preference to a
particular bid.
(4) Vendor list. Where possible, requests,
quotes and/or bids from local and area vendors shall
be solicited as a part of any procurement process. A
list of local and area vendors and their wares shall be
maintained in the City Treasurer's office. It is the
obligation of the vendors to submit their names and
wares for the vendor's list.

be defrayed by special assessment, the Commission
shall cause estimates of the cost to be made and
diagrams to be drawn of the work and the locality to
be improved. The diagrams shall be filed with the
City Clerk for public examination. The Commission
shall give notice of the proposed public improvement
and the district to be assessed by publication once a
week for at least two consecutive weeks in a local
newspaper identifying the time when the
Commission will meet and consider any objections.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.04 COST OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
The cost of any public improvement which may
be defrayed by special assessment shall include,
without limitation, the cost of surveys, plans,
assessments, permits, fees, construction, necessary
condemnation and necessary expenses incurred for
engineering, financial, legal, administrative, and
other professional services of a similar kind involved
in the making and financing of the improvement and
in the levying and collecting of the special
assessment. If the service is rendered by City
employees, the City may include in the cost to be
defrayed by special assessment the fair and
reasonable cost of rendering the service.

§ 35.05 TIME OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
Special assessments to defray the estimated cost
of any improvement shall be levied before or during
the process of making the improvement.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.06 PRO RATA SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
When any special assessment is to be made pro
rata upon the lots and premises in any special
assessment district according to frontage, benefits, or
other method, the Commission shall by resolution
direct the same to be made by the Assessor. The
resolution shall state the estimated cost of the
improvement, what proportion of the cost of the
improvement is to be paid by special assessment,
what part, if any, is to be paid by the City, the
number of installments in which assessments may be
paid, and the special assessment district or the land
and properties on which the special assessments are
to be levied. The Commission shall state the method
by which the special assessment for each lot, parcel
of land, or properties shall be calculated.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.07 DUTIES OF ASSESSOR.
Upon receiving direction from the Commission
by resolution, the Assessor shall prepare an
assessment roll, entering and describing all the lots,
premises, and parcels of land to be assessed, and the
names of those persons, if known, chargeable with
the assessments. The Assessor shall levy the amount
to be assessed upon the land and against the persons
according to the roll, in the manner directed by the
Commission and the provisions of this chapter. In all
cases where the ownership of any description is
unknown to the assessor, he or she shall insert the
word “unknown.” If by mistake or otherwise any
person shall be improperly designated as the owner
of any land, or if the land shall be assessed without
the proper name of the owner, such assessment shall
remain valid, in all respects, upon and against such
lots, parcels, or premises as though assessed in the
name of the proper owner. When the special
assessment roll is confirmed it shall be a lien on the
lots, parcels, or premises.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.08 METHOD OF ASSESSMENT.
(A) If the assessment is according to frontage,
the Assessor shall assess to each lot or parcel of land
such relative portion of the whole amount to be levied
as the length of the front of such premises abutting
upon the improvement bears to the whole frontage of
all the lots to be assessed, because of the shape or
size of any lot or parcel of land an assessment for a
different number of feet would be more equitable. If
the assessment is according to benefits, the Assessor
shall assess upon each lot such relative portion of the
whole sum to be levied as shall be proportionate to
the estimated benefit resulting to each lot from the
improvement.
(B) When the Assessor shall have completed
the assessment, he or she shall report to the
Commission in the form of a certificate endorsed on
the assessment roll as follows:
“STATE OF MICHIGAN
CITY OF BIG RAPIDS
TO THE CITY COMMISSION:
I hereby certify and report that the
foregoing is the special assessment roll and
the assessment made by me pursuant to the
resolution of the City Commission adopted
on for the purpose of paying that
part of the cost which the Commission
decided should be paid and borne by
special assessment for the described public
improvement.
In making the assessment I have, as near as
may be, and according to my best
judgment, conformed in all respects to the
directions contained in the resolution of the
Commission and applicable provisions of
the Charter and City Code.
Dated:
City Assessor”

Before adopting or confirming any special
assessment, notice of hearing for the special
assessment proceeding shall be given to each owner
of or party in interest in any lot, parcel of land, or
property to be assessed, whose name appears upon
the last local tax assessment records. Notice shall be
given by mailing, by first class mail, a notice
addressed to that owner or party at the address
shown on the tax records at least ten days before the
date of the hearing. The notice of hearing shall
include a statement that appearance and protest at
the hearing in the special assessment proceeding is
required in order to appeal the amount of the special
assessment to the state tax tribunal.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.10 FORM OF NOTICE.
The exact form of the notice shall be determined
by the Assessor. The notice shall comply with
applicable state statutes and the provisions of this
chapter. The notice of the special assessment sent to
the property owner or person responsible for
payment of the ad valorem property taxes shall
include complete information on how to appeal the
special assessment. The notice shall include a
statement that the owner or any person having an
interest in the real property may file a written appeal
of the special assessment with the state tax tribunal
within 30 days after the confirmation of the special
assessment roll if that special assessment was
protested at the hearing held for the purpose of
confirming the roll.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.11 FAILURE TO GIVE NOTICE.
Any failure to give notice as required shall not
invalidate an entire assessment roll, but such failure
may invalidate the assessments on property affected
by the lack of notice. A special assessment shall not
be declared invalid as to any property if the owner or
the party in interest actually has received notice, has
waived notice, or has paid any part of the
assessment. If any assessment is declared void by
court order or judgment, a reassessment of the
property may be made.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.12 COMMISSION REVIEW.

hear any objections raised by any person who

assessment. The Commission may correct the roll as
to any assessment, description of premises, or other
error, and may confirm the roll as reported or as
corrected. The Commission may refer the
assessment roll back to the Assessor for revision, or
the Commission may annul it and direct a new
assessment, in which case new proceedings by way
of notice and hearing shall be held. When a special
assessment is confirmed by the City Commission, the
City Clerk shall make an endorsement upon the roll
showing the date of confirmation.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.13 NATURE OF ASSESSMENT.
Any special assessment confirmed by the City
Commission shall be final and conclusive, subject
only to a properly taken appeal to the state tax
tribunal. All special assessments from the date of
confirmation shall constitute a lien upon the
respective lots or parcels of land assessed and shall
be a charge against the person to whom assessed
until paid.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.14 COLLECTION AND PAYMENT.
Upon the confirmation of any special assessment,
the amount may be divided into not more than ten
installments, one of which shall be collected each
year at times determined by the Commission, with
annual interest at the rate determined by the
Commission upon confirmation of the roll, but the
whole assessment after confirmation may be paid to
the City Treasurer at any time, in full, with the
proportionate accrued interest. All special
assessments shall be due upon confirmation, except
when the Commission directs that payment can be
made in installments, or when a different date for
payment in the future is specified by the Commission.

§ 35.15 APPORTIONMENT WHEN LAND IS
DIVIDED.
No apportionment of a special assessment shall
be allowed except by direction of the City
Commission after review of the request for
apportionment and a report of the Assessor on the
request. The Commission may direct the Assessor to
apportion the uncollected assessment upon several
lots or parcels of land divided from a larger lot or
parcel. The Assessor's report of such apportionment,
when confirmed by the Commission after notice and
hearing, shall be conclusive on all the parties.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.16 INSUFFICIENT OR EXCESSIVE SPECIAL
ASSESSMENTS.
When any special assessment proves to be
insufficient to pay for the cost of the improvement for
which it was levied, the Commission may make an
additional pro rata assessment. In case a larger
amount is collected than was necessary, the excess
shall be refunded on a pro rata basis to those who
paid.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.17 IRREGULAR, INVALID, OR VOID
ASSESSMENTS.
Whenever any special assessment shall be
deemed irregular, invalid, or void by the City
Commission, whether by court order or otherwise,
the Commission may reassess for the collection of the
cost of the improvement without limitation, except
that payments made in satisfaction of the original
assessment shall be applied on the reassessment.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.18 DUTIES OF CITY TREASURER AND
ASSESSOR.
When any special assessment roll shall be
confirmed, the City Clerk shall transmit the roll to the
City Treasurer for collection. The City Treasurer
shall certify to the Assessor on an annual basis those
assessments that remain unpaid. Upon receiving the
certificate, the Assessor shall levy the sums identified
upon the respective lots or parcels of land to which
they are specifically assessed, complete with interest
at the rate of 6%, and against the person chargeable
therewith, as a tax in the next general tax roll of the
City. The amount levied in the tax roll shall be
collected and enforced with the other taxes and shall
continue to be a lien upon the lots or parcels of land
until paid.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.19 SUITS FOR COLLECTION.
At any time after a special assessment has
become confirmed, but timely payment has not been
made, the amount of the assessment can be collected
by a lawsuit in the name of the City against the person
or property assessed. The special assessment roll, a
certified copy of the resolution confirming the roll,
and certification by the City Treasurer that the
payment was not made in a timely fashion, shall be
prima facie evidence of the right of the City to
recover the amount indicated.
(Ord. 373-12-94, passed 12-19-94)
§ 35.20 IRREGULARITIES IN ASSESSMENT NO
BAR
TO COLLECTION.
Irregularities in the special assessment process
shall not be a bar against a claim by the City for the
actual cost of the improvement incurred by the City.

directly or indirectly or otherwise refrains from
participation in the decision on the award of the

less than 5% of any privately or closely held business
and where the public servant will not have any
involvement in the transaction on behalf of the

§ 38.11 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, CONTENTS.

available. The accuracy of the meter on any premises
will be tested by the Department upon written
request of the owner who shall pay a fee specified in
the Utility Schedule of Fees, adopted by the City
Commission to cover the cost of the test. If on such
test, the meter shall be found to register over 3%
more water than actually passes through it, another
meter will be substituted therefore, and the fee will
be refunded to the owner of the premises, and the
water bill may be adjusted in accordance with

responsibility of the owner. The owner of the on-site
water system shall at all times maintain the internal
plumbing in a manner that does not subject the
on-site system and the City water system to potential

Department, the loss of water represents a threat to
the public health, safety and welfare of the water
system, the Department may issue written notice to
the customer requiring the immediate repair of the
customer's internal plumbing. If repairs are not
undertaken within the time specified by the
Department, the water may be turned off in order to
protect the public health, safety and welfare of the

on the line entering the property. Such device shall
be installed immediately downstream from the meter.

shall be installed in an accessible, above grade
structure that is protected from freezing. The
property owner shall obtain the written approval of
the Department before installing the meter and the
backflow prevention device.
(M) If requested, the City may provide a meter
to a customer not served by the public water system,
where such meter is to be used to establish the
volume of waste water discharged into the sanitary
sewer system. Any such meter shall be obtained from
the City in accordance with the Utility Schedule of
Fees, shall remain the property of the City, shall be
installed by the customer in full conformance with the

installed and service begins. The Department shall be
contacted so that the proposed location of the meter
and remote reader can be identified and approved.
The owner shall install the meter and remote reader
in the location specified by the Department staff. The
Department may install the remote reader, conduit
and wiring, and shall bill the owner on a time and
materials basis. Service shall not be allowed until the
meter and remote reader installation have been
approved by the Department.

supervision of the Department, and no connection
through which water may pass from one property to
another shall exist even though the ownership of both
properties may be the same, except in such special
cases when allowed by the City Manager, with the
consent and approval of the City Commission.
(C) Excessive or unnecessary use or waste of
water, whether caused by carelessness or by
defective or leaking plumbing or fixtures is
prohibited. For disregard, or repeated violation, of
this provision, the Department may turn off the water.

water represents a threat to the public health, safety
and welfare of the water system, the Department may
issue written notice to the owner requiring the
immediate repair of the owner's internal plumbing. If
repairs are not undertaken within the time specified
by the Department, the water may be turned off in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare
of the remaining customers.

off by the Department for any reason, no person
except an authorized employee of the Department

§ 52.19 GREASE, OIL AND SAND
INTERCEPTORS.
(A) Grease, oil and sand interceptors or
similarly effective fats, oil and grease control devices
shall be provided by and for all food service
establishments, and for any other sewer user when,
in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
which may contain grease in excessive amounts, or
any flammable wastes, sand or harmful ingredients,
except that such interceptors shall not be required for
private living quarters or dwelling units or FSEs that
prove to the Superintendent, through procedures
outlined in division (C)(8) below, that the user’s
discharge of fats, oils and grease into the sanitary
sewer is less than the domestic background
concentration which is updated annually in the
Wastewater User Charge Report as the “Domestic
Background Wastewater Strength” table. All
interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved
by the Superintendent, and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning by the
owner and inspection by the City.
(B) Grease and oil interceptors shall be
constructed of impervious materials capable of
withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial
construction, watertight and equipped with easily
removable covers which when bolted in place shall
be gastight and watertight.
(C) Where installed, all grease, oil and sand
interceptors shall be cleaned and maintained by the
owner, at his or her expense, in continuously efficient
operation.
(1) Any user required to install and
maintain an interceptor (trap) of any kind shall
maintain and clean out the interceptor and shall
document and keep:
(a) A maintenance schedule;
(b) The identity of the person(s) who
cleaned and maintained the interceptor;
(c) The method and location of
grease, oil and sand disposal.
(d) The documentation required by
this section shall be available for review by the
Superintendent and copies shall be provided to the
Superintendent upon request.
(2) Problems with or damage to an
interceptor/trap shall be reported immediately to the
owner and the Superintendent and repaired or
corrected.
(3) No interceptor/trap clean out material
shall be discharged into a sewer.
2018 S-13
Sewer Use Regulations 20A
(4) No bacteria or enzyme products shall
be used in the maintenance of interceptors/traps
without prior written approval from the
Superintendent.
(5) Users shall implement best practices of
grease management to minimize discharge of food
grease to the POTW.
(a) Under sink grease traps shall be
cleaned weekly, or more or less frequently as
approved in writing by the Superintendent.
(b) Clean outs of all other
interceptor/traps shall be scheduled and conducted
so the interceptor/trap does not exceed 25% solids
content (including both the top and bottom layers of
solids) and there is no visible discharge of grease or
oil.
(c) The clean out process shall
remove the entire grease mat, liquids, sludge, and
solids from screens, baffles, air-relief chambers, and
wash down the interior walls.
(6) The interceptor/trap is subject to
inspection by the Superintendent at any time.
(7) The Superintendent will maintain a list
of all users with FOG control devices. All FSEs and
other non-domestic users required to have FOG
control devices shall submit to the Superintendent
documentation describing the size and location of the
control device installed. Each FOG device user may
be charged a monthly fee to cover costs associated
with the periodic evaluation and review. Users that do
not maintain and produce monthly records of the
FOG device may be fined for noncompliance in
accordance with § 53.107.
(8) FOG control devices.
(a) FSE facilities shall reduce the
discharge of fats, oils and grease to the sanitary
sewer to less than the domestic background
concentration, or install an FOG control device
approved by the Superintendent. FSE facilities must
have an approved sampling manhole and must, at
their own expense, conduct a random grab sample
supervised by the Superintendent once a week for
four weeks, or otherwise at the discretion of the
Superintendent, to prove discharge of fats, oils and
grease to the sanitary sewer is less than the domestic
background concentration. FSEs that prove to the
Superintendent that the user's discharge of fats, oils
and grease into the sanitary sewer is less than the
domestic background concentration will not be
required to install a FOG control device and shall not
be surcharged for fats, oils and grease.
(b) A grease trap generally is used for
small to medium volume establishments such as fast
food restaurants or full service restaurants (generally
serving less than 400 meals per day). A grease trap is
a small reservoir built into the sewer line close to the
source of grease production. The reservoir contains
baffles which retain the wastewater long enough for
grease to congeal and rise to the surface. The
accumulated grease is then removed from the trap
for proper disposal, reducing the grease entering the
sanitary sewer system.
(c) Interceptors usually are used for
high volume full service restaurants (generally
serving more than 400 meals per day) or large
institutional food service production such as hotels,
hospitals and schools. An interceptor is typically a
vault (500 to 750 gallons) that is located on the
exterior of the building. The vault contains two
chambers with 90-degree grease retention fittings
and additional grease is collected as the wastewater
cools and grease congeals on the surface of the
water. This grease is then removed from the
interceptor for proper disposal.
(9) Best FOG management practices.
(a) Best FOG management practices
should be employed to decrease the amount of FOG
discharged from FSEs. The use of best management
practices can contribute to a financial benefit through
a reduction in grease interceptor maintenance
frequency and overall FOG discharge to the sanitary
sewer system.
(b) Suggested best management
practices for food service establishments are posted
on the City website.

(A) Where preliminary treatment or flow
equalization facilities are provided for any waters or
wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation at the owner's
expense.
(B) When required by the City, the owner of
any property serviced by a building sewer shall
install a suitable monitoring facility for the purposes
of inspection, sampling and flow measurement as
called for in §§ 53.085 through 53.088.
(C) All measurements, tests, and analyses of the
characteristics of waters and wastes to which
reference is made in this chapter shall be determined
in accordance with the procedures found in 40 CFR
Part 136 at the control manhole provided for, or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the
event that no special manhole has been required, the
control manhole shall be considered to be the
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to
the point at which the building sewer is connected.
(D) Sampling shall be carried out by
customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and
property. The particular analysis involved will
determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls
of a premise is appropriate or whether grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not
always, BOD and TSS analysis are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are

There shall be no agreement between the City
and an industrial concern that would allow any
waiver of Federal prohibited discharge standards or
categorical pretreatment standards except under the
mechanisms specified in the General Pretreatment
Standards Regulations. Special agreement or
arrangements between the City and industrial
concern falling within the mechanisms specified in
the General Pretreatment Standards Regulations may
be made whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the City
for treatment, subject to payment of a surcharge. The
strength of such waste shall be determined by
composite sampling at the owner's expense over a
period of time sufficient to generate a representative
sample. Surcharges will be assessed based on a
prorated share of the annual costs of operation and
maintenance associated with the treatment and
handling of a substance, multiplied by the ratio of
weight of excess substance over the normal weight of
the substance treated annually.

§ 53.021 LIMITATIONS ON WASTEWATER
STRENGTH.
(A) State requirements. State requirements and
limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met
by all dischargers which are subject to such
standards in any instance in which they are more
stringent than federal or local requirements and
limitations.
(B) Supplementary limitations — discharge limits
- local limits.
(1) No user shall discharge wastewater
containing concentrations (and/or mass limitations)
in excess of the following:
Material Concentration (mg/l)
Conventional Pollutants
Ammonia – N 64
BOD5 1,000
Total Suspended Solids 900
FOG 200
TPH 49
Total Phosphorus as P 36
Material Concentration (ug/l)
Nonconventional Pollutants/upper limits:
METALS
Arsenic 60
Cadmium 90
Copper 950
Cyanide 130
Chromium, Total 2,700
Chromium, Hexavalent 300
Lead 570
Mercury *(LOD)
Nickel 930
Selenium 150

Ethyl Benzene 31
Xylenes, Total 44
Methylene Chloride 41
Tetrachloroethylene 5
Trichloroethylene 21
1,1,1- Trichloroethane 16
* The local discharge limitation for mercury is
established at the level of detection (LOD) in
accordance with the following:
There shall be no detectable amounts of
mercury discharged into the publicly owned
treatment works (POTW). Mercury sampling
procedures, preservation, handling, and
analytical protocol for compliance monitoring
shall be in accordance with EPA Method 245.1.
The Level of Detection (LOD), developed in
accordance with the procedure specified in 40
CFR 136 shall not be greater than 0.2 ug/L for
mercury, unless higher levels are appropriate
due to matrix interference.
The evaluation of potential matrix interference(s)
shall include, at a minimum, the following:
(a) A demonstration that the laboratory
conducting the analysis is capable of achieving
the LOD of 0.2 ug/L in reagent water;
(b) A demonstration that the LOD of 0.2 ug/L
cannot be achieved in the effluent; and
(c) A demonstration that an attempt has been
made to resolve the matrix interference(s).
In cases where true matrix interference(s) can
be demonstrated, a discharge-specific LOD will
be developed in accordance with the procedure
in 40 CFR 136. Discharge-specific LODs will be
incorporated into the wastewater discharge
permit of the nondomestic user.
(2) In addition to penalties for violating the
ordinance for discharging wastewater containing
concentrations (and/or mass limitations) in excess of
the limits stated above, surcharges shall be assessed
by the City for any conventional pollutant discharged
to the POTW in excess of average domestic influent
WWTP concentration according to the City Sewer
User Charge System, § 54.12(A), subsection G,
"Surcharges." Discharges of any pollutant may not
exceed the stated limitation under any circumstance.
Surcharges will be based on a pro rated share of the
annual costs of operation and maintenance associated
with the treatment and handling of a substance,
multiplied by the ratio of weight of excess substance
over the normal weight of the substance to be treated
annually.
(3) (a) The City of Big Rapids sustains costs to
operate and maintain the City's sanitary sewer system
and wastewater treatment plant. The Utility is paid by
user fees that shall be distributed as equitably as
possible among the users. The typical user rates
2018 S-13
38 Big Rapids - Public Works
employed by the City of Big Rapids cover costs
associated with the treatment of normal domestic
strength wastewater. Higher strength wastes incur
higher costs for treatment. Industrial and commercial
users sometimes discharge high strength wastes and
the surcharge program allows the City to recover the
costs associated with treating this wastewater.
(b) Surcharges are an additional charge
used to cover the extra cost of treating conventional
pollutants in excess of domestic background
concentrations.
(c) The City's surcharge procedure shall
include, on at least a semi-annual basis, composite
sampling on typically four consecutive days to
determine the user concentration in mg/l of
conventional pollutants from each non-domestic user.
These user concentrations will be compared to the
domestic background concentration for each
parameter found under "Surcharge" in the City's User
Charge Report. When the user concentration
exceeds the domestic background concentration for
a parameter, the excess amount will be the
concentration used to calculate the pounds to be
surcharged. The flow used shall be the actual monthly
flow. Example: the domestic background
concentration for total phosphorus is 5 mg/l. User A
has an user concentration of 8 mg/l. The surcharge
concentration for User A would be 3 mg/l. This
concentration multiplied by the monthly flow in
millions of gallons * 8.34 pounds per gallon gives the
total pounds of phosphorus. If User A consumed
600,000 gallons of water, that would be 0.6 million
gallons * 3 mg/l * 8.34 = 15.01 pounds of surcharge
phosphorus @ $2.51/lb = $37.67 for that month. The
excess concentration surcharge shall remain in effect
until the next sampling. Each user subject to
surcharges may be billed monthly or quarterly
according to water usage or metered discharge.
Sampling and analysis shall be performed by the
City. A split of each sample shall be made available
to each user upon written request to the
Superintendent. The City may obtain additional
samples to verify a user's effluent parameters. Any
surcharged user may request additional samples
based on a changed condition since the last sampling
event. Costs for additional samples and analysis shall
be paid by the user.

contributions may in the opinion of the Control
Authority cause the POTW to violate its NPDES
permit.
(B) Excess capacity beyond that as reserved
above will be allotted on a first-come basis
determined by the date the application is received by
the Authority, provided construction leading to the
prompt completion is underway within two years of
the date of approval for sewer service. Should
construction not be underway, a subsequent
application will be processed as above. Application
dates will be as provided by the Control Authority
and approval dates will be by the Control Authority.

Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall submit
baseline reports to the POTW in a form prescribed
and furnished by the POTW.
(B) Within 180 days after the effective date of a
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or 180
days after a final administrative decision has been
made upon a categorical determination submission
in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.6(a)(4),
whichever is later, industrial users which are Existing
Sources subject to such National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards and currently discharging to
the POTW shall submit a properly completed
Baseline Report.
(C) New sources, when subject to a National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard, shall submit a
baseline report at least 90 days prior to
commencement of discharge to the POTW.
(D) In support of the baseline report, the
industrial user shall submit, in units and terms
specified in the application, the following
information:
(1) Name and address of the facility
including the name of operator and owners.
(2) List of any environmental control
permits held by or for the facility.
(3) Brief description of the nature, average
rate of production, and standard industrial
classification of the operation(s) carried out by such
user. This description shall include a schematic
process diagram indicating points of discharge to the
POTW from the regulated processes.
(4) Information showing the measured
average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per
day, to the POTW from each of the following:
(a) Regulated process streams; and
(b) Other streams as necessary to
allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40
CFR Section 403.6(e).
(5) The industrial user shall identify the
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards
applicable to each regulated process, and shall:
(a) Submit the results of sampling and
analysis identifying the nature and concentration of
regulated pollutants in the discharge from each
regulated process. Both daily maximum and average
concentrations shall be reported. The sample shall be
representative of daily operations.
(b) A minimum of four grab samples
must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, FOG,
sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants,
24-hour composite samples must be obtained through
flow-proportional composite sampling techniques
where feasible. The Control Authority may waive flow
proportional composite sampling for any industrial
user that demonstrates that flow-proportional
sampling is not feasible. In such cases samples may
be obtained through time-proportional composite
sampling techniques or through a minimum of four
grab samples where the user demonstrates that this
will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged.
(c) The user shall take a minimum of
one representative sample to compile that data
necessary to comply with the requirements of this
section.
(d) Samples should be taken
immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities
if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other
wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater
prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow the use
of the combined wastestream formula of Section
403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the
pretreatment standards. Where an alternate
concentration or mass limit has been calculated in
accordance with Section 403.6(e) this adjusted limit
along with supporting data shall be submitted to the
POTW.
(6) The industrial user shall provide a
statement, reviewed by an authorized representative
of the industrial user and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent
basis, and if not, whether additional operation and
maintenance (O&M) measures or additional
pretreatment is required for the industrial user to
meet the National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards.
(7) If additional pretreatment or O&M will
be required to meet the National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards, the industrial user shall
provide the shortest schedule which will provide such
addi t ional pret reatment or O&M. The
2003 S-4
46 Big Rapids - Public Works
completion date in this schedule shall not be later
than the compliance date established for the
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard.
(a) Where the industrial user's
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard has been
modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR Section
403.7) or the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR
Section 403.6(e)), or net/gross calculations (40 CFR
Section 403.15), at the time the industrial user
submits a baseline report the information required in
§ 53.065(D)(5)(d), (6) and (7) shall pertain to the
modified limits.
(b) If the National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard for the industrial user is
modified after the baseline report is submitted, the
industrial user shall make any necessary
amendments to information provided as a response
to § 53.065 (D)(6) and (7) and submit them to the
POTW within 60 days after the modified limit is
approved.
(8) The following conditions shall apply to
any schedule submitted in response to §
53.065(D)(7):
(a) The schedule shall contain
increments of progress in the form of dates for the
commencement and completion of major events
leading to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment required for the user to meet
the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing
contract for major components, commencing
construction, completing construction, and the like).
(b) No increment referred to in
§ 53.065 (D)(8)(a) shall exceed nine months.
(c) Not later than 14 days following
each date in the schedule and the final date for
compliance, the user shall submit a progress report
to the POTW including, at a minimum, whether or not
it complied with the increment to be met on such date
and if not, the date on which it expects to comply with
this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and
the steps being taken by the industrial user to return
the construction to the schedule established. In no
event shall more than nine months elapse between
such progress reports to the POTW.
(9) Such other information as may be
required by 40 CFR 403.12(b) and as may be
reasonably requested by the POTW.

§ 53.066 COMPLIANCE DATE REPORT.
Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable Categorical Pretreatment
Standards, or, in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into
the POTW, any user subject to Categorical
Pretreatment Standards shall submit to the POTW a
report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated
process which are limited by such Standards and the
average and maximum daily flow for these process
units in the user facility which are limited by such
pretreatment standards or requirements. Where
equivalent mass or concentration limits are
established by the POTW for a user, this report shall
contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term
production rate. Where a user is subject to
Categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production, the report shall include the user's actual
production during the appropriate sampling period.
The report shall state whether the applicable
Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into
compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user, and
certified to by a qualified professional.

§ 53.067 BYPASS REPORTING.
(A) An industrial user may allow any bypass to
occur which does not cause pretreatment standards
or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for
essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of
divisions (B) and (C) of this section.
(B) (1) If an industrial user knows in advance
of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notices
to the POTW, if possible at least ten days before the
date of bypass.

(2) An industrial user shall submit oral
notice of unanticipated bypass that exceeds
applicable Pretreatment Standards to the POTW
within 24 hours from the time the industrial user
becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five days of the time the
industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass
has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the
bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on
a case by case basis if the oral report has been
received within 24 hours.
(3) Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW
may take enforcement action against an industrial
user for a bypass unless:
(a) The bypass was unavoidable to
prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe
property damage;
(b) There were no feasible
alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary
treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate
backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to
prevent a bypass which occurred during normal
periods of equipment downtime or preventive
maintenance; and
(c) The industrial user submitted
notices as requires by division (B)(1) of this section.
(C) The POTW may approve an anticipated
bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the
Control Authority determines that it will meet the
three conditions listed in this section.

§ 53.068 CONTINUING COMPLIANCE
REPORTS.
(A) Any user subject to a pretreatment standard
set forth in this chapter, after the compliance date of
such pretreatment standard or, in the case of a new
discharger, after commencement of the discharge to
the POTW, shall submit to the POTW during the
months of June and December, unless required more
frequently by the POTW, a report indicating the
nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated
substances in the effluent which are limited by the
pretreatment standards hereof. In addition, this
report shall include a record of all measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows. Flows
shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement;
however, where cost or feasibility considerations
justify, the POTW may accept reports of average and
maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques.
The POTW for good cause when considering such
factors as local high or low flow rates, holiday, budget
cycles, or other extenuating factors, may authorize
the submission of said reports on months other than
those specified above.
(B) The POTW may impose miss limitations on
users which are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases where the imposition of mass limitations are
appropriate. In such cases, the report required by
division (A) of this section shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the
effluent of the user.
(C) These reports shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the
flow and the nature and concentration, or production
and mass where requested by the Superintendent, of
pollutants contained therein which are limited by the
applicable pretreatment standards.
(D) For industrial users subject to equivalent
mass or concentration limits established by the POTW
in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), the report required by paragraph (e)(1)
shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's longterm
production rate. For all other industrial users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards
expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of
operation), the report required by paragraph (e)(1)
shall include the user's actual average production
rate for the reporting period.
(E) Reports of significant industrial users shall
contain all results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge, including the flow and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass where
required by the POTW. The frequency of monitoring
by the discharger shall be as deemed necessary by
the POTW to assess and assure compliance by the
industrial user with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements.

concentration of prohibited or regulated substances
in the effluent which are limited by the pretreatment
standards hereof. In addition, this report shall include
a record of all measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flow during the reporting period
previously stated.
(B) Flows shall be reported on the basis of
actual measurement; however, where cost or
feasibility considerations justify, the POTW may
accept reports of average and maximum flows
estimated by verifiable techniques. The POTW, for
good cause when considering such factors as local
high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or
other extenuating factors, may authorize the
submission of said reports on months other than
those specified above.
(C) Reports of dischargers shall contain all
results of sampling and analysis of the discharge,
including the flow and the nature and concentration,

(A) Information and data (other than effluent
data) about a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits and
monitoring programs and/or from inspections shall
be available to the public unless the user specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the POTW that the release of such information
would divulge information, processes, or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of
the user. Any such request must be asserted at the
time of submission of the information or data. When
such a confidentiality claim is asserted, the
information shall be treated as such until a
determination is made by the POTW. Effluent data
shall be available to the public without restriction.
(B) When the person furnishing a report
satisfies the POTW that such person had made the
demonstration required by (A), the portions of the
report which may disclose trade secrets or secret
processes shall not be made available for inspection
except by the state or EPA for uses related to this
chapter, the NPDES permit and pretreatment
programs. Confidential portions of a report shall be
available for use by the state or EPA in judicial
review or enforcement proceedings involving the
person furnishing the report. Effluent data will not be
recognized as confidential information.

service, the electrical service, and/or the wastewater
contribution permit shall, within a period of time as
determined by the POTW, cease all discharges or be
subject to utility cutoff or sewer blockage by the
POTW.
(C) It is the intent of this section to authorize the
POTW to order in person, or by signed document, the
immediate, but orderly shutdown of any operation,
discharge, or facility, or any party thereof, for good
cause shown. ORDERLY SHUTDOWN means
consideration is to be given to protection of human
safety and property of both the POTW and the
discharger. It does mean that the responsible person
for an offending discharge will immediately initiate
2003 S-4

52 Big Rapids - Public Works
discussion with the POTW and will initiate the orderly
actions required to stop the offending discharge and
not wait for the next shift, weekend, or other
convenient time. Orderly shutdown recognizes that
consideration is to be given to the discharger for
protection of human safety and for protection of
equipment or property. For example, if the offending
discharge source can be isolated, only that part of a
facility need be shutdown. A discharge may need to
be continued from a furnace or reaction vessel
during cool-down to prevent injuries or damage.
Reduced flows may be allowed, for example, to
provide fire protection, refrigeration to protect food
inventories, or to provide heat during the winter.
Such consideration is not to be construed to relieve
the discharger of any liability for damages caused
before or during the orderly shutdown period.
(D) In the event of failure of the discharger to
comply voluntarily with the suspension order within
the specified time, the POTW shall notify the
Department of Environmental Quality and commence
judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to
compel the discharger's compliance with such order.
The POTW shall reinstate the wastewater contribution
permit and/or the wastewater treatment service and
terminate judicial proceedings upon proof by the
discharger of the elimination of the noncomplying
discharge or conditions creating the treatment as set
forth above.

§ 53.101 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
The POTW may revoke the permit of any
discharger who fails to:
(A) Factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of its discharge;
(B) Report significant changes in wastewater
constituents or characteristics;
(C) Provide reasonable access to discharger's
premises by representatives of the POTW or the
Department of Environmental Quality for the purpose
of inspection or monitoring; or
(D) Violates the conditions of its permit or this
chapter, or any final judicial order entered with
respect thereto.

§ 53.102 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION;
ADMINISTRATION ADJUSTMENT.
(A) Whenever the POTW finds that any
discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies
revocation of a wastewater contribution permit
pursuant to § 53.101, the City shall serve or cause to
be served upon such discharger a written notice
either personally or by certified or registered mail,
return receipt requested, stating the nature of the
alleged violation. Within ten continuous days of the
date of receipt of the note, the discharger shall
respond personally or in writing to the POTW
advising of its position with respect to the allegations.
Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the
veracity of the allegations and, where necessary,
establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof.
(B) Submission of this plan in no way relieves
the user of liability for any violations occurring before
or after receipt of the notice of violation.

Where the violation of § 53.101 hereof is not
corrected by timely compliance by means of
administrative adjustment, the City may order any
discharger which causes or allows conduct
prohibited by § 53.101, to show cause before the City
or its duly authorized representative why the
proposed revocation action should not be taken. A
written notice shall be served on the discharger by
personal service, certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, specifying the time and place of a
hearing to be held by the City or its designee
regarding the violation, the reasons why the
enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed
enforcement action, and directing the discharger to
show cause before the City or its designee why the

proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the hearing shall be served no less than
ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on
any agent, officer, or authorized representative of a
discharger. The proceedings of the hearings shall be
considered by the City which shall then enter
appropriate orders with respect to the alleged
improper activities of the discharger. Appeal of such
orders may be taken by the discharger in
accordance with applicable local or state law.

§ 53.105 COMPLIANCE ORDER.
When the POTW Superintendent finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate the
chapter or a permit or order issued thereunder, he
may issue an order to the industrial user responsible
for the discharge directing that, following a specified
time period, sewer service shall be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances have been installed and are
properly operated, and compliance is achieved.
Orders may also contain such other requirements as
might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to
address the noncompliance, including the installation
of pretreatment technology, additional selfmonitoring
and best management practices.

§ 53.106 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
When the POTW Superintendent finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate this
chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, the
POTW Superintendent may issue an order to cease
and desist all illegal or unauthorized discharges
immediately.
(A) In an emergency, the order to cease and
desist may be given by telephone.
(B) In nonemergency situations, the cease and
desist order may be used to suspend or permanently
revoke industrial wastewater discharge permits.
(C) The cease and desist order may order the
industrial user to take such appropriate remedial or
preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and terminating the
discharge.

§ 53.107 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
(A) Notwithstanding any other section of this
chapter, any user who is found to have violated any
provision of this chapter, or permits and orders
issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not to
exceed the maximum allowable under state law (e.g.,
$1,000) per violation. Each day on which
noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be
deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such
assessments may be added to the user's next
scheduled sewer service charge and the POTW
Superintendent shall have other collection remedies
as he has to collect other service charges. Unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties shall constitute a lien
against the individual user's property. Industrial
users desiring to dispute such fines must file a
request for the POTW Superintendent to reconsider
the fine within ten calendar days of being notified of
the fine. Where the POTW Superintendent believes a
request has merit, he shall convene a hearing on the
matter within 15 calendar days of receiving the
request from the industrial user.
(B) Non-domestic users that fail to file required
documentation may be charged twice the IPP user
charge for each month that the documentation is
delinquent, or a minimum charge of $25 a month.

§ 53.108 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
(A) The POTW Superintendent may suspend the
wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater
permit of an industrial user whenever such
suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge presenting or causing an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health
or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the environment.
(B) Any user notified of a suspension of the
wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater
permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the POTW Superintendent shall take such steps
as deemed necessary, including immediate
termination of water service or severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to
any individuals. The POTW Superintendent shall
allow the user to recommence its discharge when the
endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings set forth in § 53.101 are initiated against
the user.
2018 S-13
54 Big Rapids - Public Works
(C) An industrial user which is responsible, in
whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall

§ 53.110 OPERATING UPSETS.
(A) Any industrial user, which experiences an
upset in operations which places the discharger in a
temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter
or wastewater contribution permit issued pursuant
hereto, shall inform the POTW immediately upon first
awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where
such information is given orally, a written follow-up
report thereof shall be filed by the discharger with
the POTW within five calendar days. The report shall
specify:
(1) Description of the upset, the cause
thereof, and the upset's impact on a discharger's
compliance status;
(2) Duration of noncompliance, including
exact dates and times of noncompliance; an estimate
of the volume and strength of wastes discharged and
if the noncompliance continues, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to occur;
(3) All steps taken or to be taken to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of such an
upset or other conditions that may result in continued
noncompliance.
(B) An UPSET means an exceptional incident in
which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment
Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the industrial user. An “upset” does not
include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
(C) An upset shall constitute an affirmative
defense to an action brought for noncompliance with
Categorical Pretreatment Standards if the
requirements of division (D) of this section are met.
(D) An industrial user who wishes to establish
the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate,
through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the industrial
user can identify the cause(s) of the upset.
(2) The facility was at the time being
operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and
in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures.
(3) The industrial user has submitted the
following information to the POTW and Control
Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written
submission must be provided within five calendar
days):
(a) A description of the indirect
discharge and cause of noncompliance.
(b) The period of noncompliance,
including exact duties and times or, if not corrected,
the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected
to continue.
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned
to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the

action brought against it alleging a violation of the
general prohibitions established in §§ 53.015 and
53.016 if it can demonstrate it met the conditions set
forth in 40 CFR 403.5 (a)(2):
(A) The user did not know or have reason to
know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
a discharge or discharges from other sources, would
cause pass through or interference; and
(B) (1) A local limit designed to prevent pass
through and/or interference, as the case may be, was
developed in accordance with paragraph (c) of 40
CFR 403.5 for each pollutant in the user's discharge
that caused pass through or interference, and the
user was in compliance with each such local limit
directly prior to and during the pass through or
interference; or
(2) If a local limit designed to prevent pass
through and/or interference, as the case may be, has
not been developed in accordance with paragraph
(c) of 40 CFR 403.5 for the pollutant(s) that caused the
pass through or interference, the user's discharge
directly prior to and during the pass through or
interference did not change substantially in nature or
constituents from the user's prior discharge activity
when the POTW was regularly in compliance with the
POTW's NPDES permit requirements and, in the case
of interference, applicable requirements for sewage
sludge use or disposal.

APPENDIX: MERCURY REDUCTION PLANS
Sections
1. Mercury Reduction Plan may be required
2. Release from requirement
1. MERCURY REDUCTION PLAN MAY BE
REQUIRED.
(A) To ensure that the maximum allowable
mercury loading to the POTW is not exceeded, the
Control Authority may require any nondomestic user
with a reasonable potential to discharge mercury to
develop, submit for approval and implement a
Mercury Reduction Plan (MRP). The MRP may be
required by permit if the nondomestic user has not
violated the local limit for mercury, but the Control
Authority has determined that a reasonable potential
for such a violation may exist. MRP's may be
required in notices of violations, orders or other
enforcement actions when the nondomestic user has
violated the mercury local limit. At a minimum, an
approvable MRP shall contain the following:
(1) A written commitment by the
nondomestic user to reduce all nondomestic
discharges of mercury to levels below the LOD within
three years of the MRP's original approval date;
(2) Within 60 days of notification by the
Control Authority that a MRP is required, the
nondomestic user shall supply an initial identification
of all potential sources of mercury which could be
discharged to the sanitary sewer system;
(3) Specific strategies for mercury
reduction with reasonable time frames for
implementation, capable of ensuring that mercury
discharges will be below the specified LOD within
three years;
(4) A program for quarterly sampling and
analysis of the nondomestic discharge for mercury in
accordance with the 245.1 methods;
(5) A demonstration of specific,
measurable and/or otherwise quantifiable mercury
reductions consistent with the goal of reducing
mercury discharges below the specified LOD.
Where such reductions can not be demonstrated
through normal effluent monitoring (e.g., mercury
discharges are near LOD), the demonstration should
incorporate the following:
(a) Internal process monitoring,
documenting the results of mercury reduction
2004 S-5
strategies at sampling locations within the facility
(e.g., a program of regular monitoring of sink traps
where mercury containing reagents had previously
been disposed, but have since been substituted by
non-mercury containing compounds);
(b) Internal and/or effluent sampling
utilizing clean and/or ultra-clean sampling and
analytical methods as referenced by USEPA Federal
Register. Note that the results of such monitoring will
not be used for compliance purposes unless
performed in accordance with EPA Method 245.1 and
collected at the appropriate compliance
measurement location.
(c) Loading calculations wherein the
nondomestic user calculates the total mass of mercury
reduced from the sanitary sewer discharge through
reagent substitutions, changes in disposal practices
and/or other approved MRP strategies implemented.
(6) A semiannual report on the status of the
mercury reduction efforts. At a minimum, these
reports shall:
(a) identify compliance or
noncompliance with specific reduction commitments
in the MRP;
(b) summarize the analytical,
mass-based or other quantifiable demonstrations of
mercury reductions performed to date;
(c) provide all applicable analytical
data;
(d) provide an evaluation of the
effectiveness of actions taken to date;
(e) provide updates to the initial list of
mercury containing compounds discharged to the
sanitary sewer; and
(f) propose for approval new
strategies and/or modifications to the current MRP to
continue and improve mercury reduction efforts.
(7) Any other conditions that the Control
Authority deems necessary to ensure that mercury
reduction efforts are effective in achieving the goals
of this section.
(B) Failure to submit an approvable MRP within
30 days of the required due date shall constitute
significant noncompliance in accordance with this
section, and will result in publication as a significant
violator.
56B Big Rapids - Public Works
(C) A MRP may be evaluated for adequacy at
any time by the Control Authority. If such an
evaluation determines that the Mercury Reduction
Plan is inadequate, or the nondomestic user has not
complied with its approved MRP, the nondomestic
user will be notified. Failure to comply with the MRP
requirement constitutes noncompliance. The Control
Authority will follow its Enforcement Response Plan
(ERP) to ensure that corrective actions are taken.
2. RELEASE FROM REQUIREMENT.
(A) A nondomestic user may request a release
from MRP requirements if:
(1) all samples of the discharge for a
period of one year are less than the specified LOD;
(2) the nondomestic user has complied
with the minimum monitoring frequency of quarterly
sampling events; and
(3) the Control Authority deems that MRP
commitments have been fulfilled sufficiently to
ensure continued compliance with the mercury
limitation.
(B) The Control Authority shall notify the
nondomestic user of any release from MRP
requirements in writing.
(C) If the MRP requirement is waived by the
Control Authority, the nondomestic user remains
subject to the local limitations for mercury in
accordance with the requirements of this section.
(D) Re-discovery of mercury in the
nondomestic user discharge subjects said user to the
submission of a new MRP, or escalation of
enforcement in accordance with the ERP.

§ 54.09 COLLECTION.
The City is hereby authorized to enforce the
payment of charges, including Water Invoices, for
water and/or sewage disposal service to any
premises by discontinuing either the water service or
the sewage disposal service to such premises, or
both, and an legal action may be instituted by the
City against the customer. The charges for water
supply and/or sewage disposal service, which, under
the provisions of Act 94, Public Acts of 1933 of the
state, as amended, are made a lien on the premises
to which furnished, are hereby recognized to
constitute such lien, and the City shall, annually, on
May 1, certify all unpaid charges for such services
furnished to any premises which, on April 30
preceding, have remained unpaid for a period of six
months, to the City Assessor, who shall place the
same on the next tax roll of the City. Such charges so
assessed shall be collected in the same manner as
general City taxes. To provide the City with proper
notice of a lease containing a provision that the lessor
shall not be liable for payment of water or sewage
system bills accruing subsequent to the filing of an
affidavit according to Act 94, Public Acts of 1933,
being MCL § 123.165, the lessor shall complete and
submit an affidavit in the form provided and required
by the Treasurer's Office. Upon receipt of the
affidavit, no water or sewer service shall be
commenced or continued to the specified premises
until there has been deposited with the City not less
than $100 for residential accounts and not less than
$150 for commercial accounts. The Treasurer's Office
may require a deposit in an amount up to six times the
average monthly water bill for the premises. Where
the water service to any premises is turned off by the
City to enforce the payment of water or sewage
charges, the water service shall not be recommenced
until all delinquent charges have been paid and a
deposit as in the case of tenants is made, and a water
turn-on/turn-off fee as provided in the Water Utility
Schedule of Fees is paid. In any other case where, in
the discretion of the City, the collection of charges for
water supply and/or sewage disposal service may be
difficult or uncertain, the City may require a similar
deposit. Such deposits may be applied against any
delinquent water supply and/or sewage disposal
service charges and the application thereof shall not
affect the right of the City to turn off the water service
and/or sewage service, to any premises for any
delinquency thereby satisfied. No such deposit shall
bear interest and such deposit, or any remaining
balance thereof, shall be returned to the customer
making the same when the customer shall discontinue
receiving water supply and/or sewage disposal
service or except as to tenants as to whom notice of
responsibility for such charges has been filed with
the City, when any 12 successive monthly bills shall
have been paid by the customer with no delinquency.

(3) Township customers. The sewer rates to
customers in Big Rapids Township and Green
Township shall be determined by the current User
Charge Report.
(4) Industrial Pretreatment Program (IPP).
Commercial, industrial, and institutional users shall
be charged an additional amount per 1,000 gallons of
use for the Industrial Pretreatment Program (IPP) as
determined by the current User Charge Report.
(5) Single customer facilities. Sewer lift
stations, facilities, or other services on the system
which serve only one customer shall be individually
charged the cost of that private service.
(B) Surcharges. The City’s surcharge procedure
shall be based on one of two methods:
(1) For non-domestic users with a sampling
manhole meeting the Industrial Pretreatment
Program (IPP) manual specifications, or other
approved method of discharge sampling, on at least
a semi-annual basis, the City will conduct composite
sampling, on typically four consecutive days to
determine the average concentration in mg/l of
conventional pollutants from each non-domestic user.
These user concentrations will be compared to the
domestic background concentration for each
parameter found under "Surcharge" in the City's User
Charge Report. When the user concentration
exceeds the domestic background concentration for
a parameter, the excess amount will be the
concentration used to calculate the pounds to be
surcharged. The flow used shall be the actual monthly
flow. Example: the domestic background
concentration for total phosphorus is 5 mg/l. User A
has an user concentration of 8 mg/l. The surcharge
concentration for User A would be 3 mg/l. This
concentration multiplied by the monthly flow in
millions of gallons * 8.34 pounds per gallon gives the
total pounds of phosphorus. If User A consumed
600,000 gallons of water, that would be 0.6 million
gallons * 3 mg/l * 8.34 = 15.01 pounds of surcharge
phosphorus @ $2.51/lb = $37.67 for that month. The
excess concentration surcharge shall remain in effect
until the next sampling. Sampling and analysis shall
be performed by the City. A split of each sample shall
be made available to each user upon written request.
The City may obtain additional samples to verify a
user's effluent parameters. Any surcharged user may
request additional samples based on a changed
condition since the last sampling event. Costs for
additional samples and analysis shall be paid by the
user.
(2) Non-domestic users without an
approved sampling manhole or other approved
method of discharge sampling that are Food Service
Establishments (FSEs), and do not require an
industrial discharge permit, may be surcharged
according to the surcharge classification procedure
established by the City. This allows the City to levy
surcharges to FSEs based on the specific type of
service conducted (i.e., Full Service Restaurant, Fast
Food Restaurant, Institutional Food Service, Grocery
Store with Food Preparation, or Baked
Goods/Bakery) by the user, in lieu of individual waste
sampling results. Users placed in a specific class of
FSE by the City may request individual surcharging
based on actual sampling and analytical results as
long as an adequate sampling manhole is provided
and the user reimburses the City for sample
collection time and materials and analytical
expenses.
(3) Each user subject to surcharges may
be billed monthly or quarterly according to water
usage or metered discharge.
(C) Food service establishments that do not have
sampling manholes. The Superintendent shall classify
food service establishments (FSEs) based on type of
food product, customer consumption method and
food preparation activities within the categories
defined below. The waste classification system shall
determine how FSEs are surcharged.
(1) Full service restaurants; definition. This
FSE typically prepares and serves food in a dining
setting. Attending patrons are provided food items
served on plates with utensils that have to be washed
after the patrons have completed their meals.
Cookware is also cleaned on the premises. Food
preparation comprises the many activities that
constitute the provision of service at a full service
establishment - baking, frying, grilling, broiling,
boiling, etc. The overwhelming majority of service is
provided in seating areas with a relatively small
amount of carryout business.
(2) Fast food restaurants; definition. This
FSE prepares food intended for immediate
consumption. Its food items are often provided in
paper or other types of disposable wrappers and
containers along with disposable utensils. The
patrons of fast food establishments dine in a seating
area or take their food on a carryout basis. Cookware
is cleaned on the premises. Food preparation
comprises the many activities that constitute the
provision of service at a full service establishment -
baking, frying, grilling, broiling or boiling.
2018 S-13
62 Big Rapids - Public Works
(3) Institutional food service; definition. This
FSE category comprises establishments that basically
provide food service to the tenants or employees of
a commercial, multi-unit/group residential or
institutional facility. The food is prepared and/or
provided in the location of the facility, usually in a
cafeteria with seating. Depending on the type of
facility, the food may be delivered to the room of the
patrons or they can consume their food in a dining
area. The employees of the food service
establishment usually work for or are contracted by
the facility in which the food is served.
(4) Grocery store with food preparation;
definition. This FSE encompasses the various grocers,
delis and supermarkets that prepare food. Food
preparation comprises the many activities that
constitute the provision of service at a full service
restaurant- baking, frying, grilling, broiling or
boiling. The patrons of these establishments buy food
that is ready for consumption and they usually take
the food items with them when they leave the
establishment, although some may have relatively
small areas for patrons to consume food. Cookware
and utensils are cleaned on the premises.
(5) Baked goods or bakery; definition. This
FSE typically prepares a variety of baked goods, such
as bread, pastries, and cakes for retail sale and for
consumption by patrons who come to the
establishment for baked goods for immediate
consumption. The area dedicated to serving walk-in
patrons is relatively small compared the total size of
the facility with an equally small area dedicated to on
premise consumption.
(D) Standard FSE wastewater strengths.
(1) Standard FSE wastewater strengths are
established for each pollutant of concern including
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total
Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Phosphorus (TP), and
Ammonia.
Category BOD
(mg/l)
TSS

Institutional food service 487 — 7.9 —
Grocery with food preparation 746 600 17.0 64.0
Baked goods or bakery 655 745 — —
(2) The standard FSE wastewater strengths
are established based on sampling at locations within
each classification in Big Rapids and are posted on
the City's website and will be included in the annual
Big Rapids Wastewater User Charge Report. These
standard FSE wastewater strengths will be updated
annually to reflect the results of ongoing sampling.
(E) Surcharge rates.
(1) The Superintendent shall assess a
surcharge rate for each FSE user based on the
standard FSE wastewater strength for that
classification unless sampling is being conducted at
the facility. The established surcharge rate for each
pollutant and domestic background concentration for
each pollutant of concern is updated annually as part
of the City's User Charge Report.
(2) Surcharge amounts shall be
determined for FSEs by determining the difference
between the standard FSE wastewater strength and
the domestic background concentration for that
pollutant. The measured flow from the facility shall be
applied to determine a cost per pound for each
pollutant of concern. A facility may choose to conduct
site specific sampling if they believe the standard FSE
wastewater strengths listed do not adequately
represent their discharge. Sampling procedures and
frequency must be approved, and are subject to
oversight, by the Superintendent. Costs associated
with such sampling and lab analysis would be the
responsibility of the user. Surcharge calculations
shall then be established by averaging grab or
composite (as determined by the City to be
appropriate) samples taken from the facility's
discharge.
(F) Site specific testing.
(1) The owner of a FSE may elect to have
the industrial surcharge billed according to
representative samples taken at the facility. The FSE
2018 S-13
Water and Sewer Rates 62A
owner is required to pay for installation of a sampling
point and all sampling costs. Sampling frequency
shall be determined by the City and analytical results
shall be submitted to the City for review.
(2) Non domestic users that conduct site
specific testing shall install an approved sampling
manhole together with any meters and equipment
deemed necessary by the Superintendent or the City
Manager, in order to adequately sample wastewater.
Unrestricted access to the sampling manholes shall
be available at all times for the Superintendent. A
sampling manhole or chamber must be located near
the outlet of each lateral, sewer, drain or pipe which
connects to the wastewater system. Site inspections
may be conducted by the City to verify the user's
discharge and note the presence of any sampling
devices or grease traps.

§ 54.13 UTILITY REFUNDS AND CORRECTED
BILLING.
(A) If a customer or the City's Utility Department
document that an error has been made in utility
billing, the City Treasurer's Office may either bill the
customer for the underpayment or credit or refund
the overpayment to future utility bills. Adjustments to
such utility bills shall be limited to a period of three
years.
(B) No penalty or interest will be charged for
either overpayment or underpayment of a utility bill.
(C) A courtesy adjustment may be granted to a
customer that wishes relief for a water and/or sewer
bill due to leaks in the customer's water system. The
customer shall document the basis of their claim,
show that the leak has been repaired and submit such
claim to the City. Staff shall review the claim and
determine any adjustment to be given. The criteria
for the adjustment will occur when consumption
exceeds 50% of normal usage. The courtesy
adjustment may be made for a period not to exceed
two months of water /sewer use. Any adjustment may
consider consumption in excess of the average of the
highest three month period during the previous
12-month period. Any refund found to be due the
customer will be credited to the next water/sewer

55.35, §§ 55.40 through 55.42, §§ 55.50 through 55.61,
and §§ 55.70 and 55.71) is to establish technical
procedures and standards for the review of drainage
patterns and storm water control structures. The
purpose of the chapter is to provide the city of big
rapids with a mechanism to control and regulate
storm water runoff and discharge.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.31 DEFINITIONS.
For the purpose of this subchapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
CATCHMENT AREA. The entire area that will
contribute flow to the proposed storm drain. Limits
of catchment area may or may not coincide with
property boundaries.
DETENTION POND. An acceptable storage
facility used to contain stormwater runoff and slow
the rate of discharge to downstream waters.
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SERVICES. The
Director of Public Services of the City or his
designee.
DRAIN. Either an open or closed conduit
intended
to provide for natural or manmade conveyance of
stormwater from higher land to a downstream area.
ENGINEER. The engineer, or authorized
licensed agent of the City.
HYDRAULIC GRADE LINE. The hydraulic grade
line will be taken as the anticipated surface of water
taking into account energy losses.

(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.33 DIRECTION OF FLOW.
Under no circumstances can a development alter
the natural direction of flow from its previous
direction unless determined unavoidable by the
Director of Public Services. The Director will
evaluate the change in direction and give written
approval detailing conditions of the change. All flow
resulting from an approved change will be required
to flow into a detention pond as defined by this
chapter. The proprietor will minimize the total
quantity of flow being redirected.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.34 CONNECTIONS AND ASSOCIATED
WATER QUALITY.
(A) Storm drains built and discharging to any
surface water, or manmade conveyance, whether
owned, operated, or maintained by the City, and
1997 S-1
68 Big Rapids - Public Works
traversing the City limits, will be limited to rainfall
and naturally occurring overland flow. Discharge of
sanitary water, gray water from sinks, bath tubs,
washing machines, or any other plumbing fixtures
into storm system is prohibited. Other connections
prohibited include the direct connection of roof
drains to a City sanitary sewer system, and any other
connection that will cause or allow pollutant
transport.
(B) Specific direct connections that will be
required for review and approval of the design and
facilities to be allowed include sump pump discharge
lines and footing drains. Sump pump connections
shall be protected from pollutants entering the sump
pit and being pumped into the City storm sewer.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.35 QUANTITY OF FLOW CALCULATIONS.
(A) Flow calculations submitted to the City shall
be based on the rational method “Q = CIA” for
developments with catchment areas less than ten
acres, where Q is the computed runoff in cubic feet
per second (cfs), C is the weighted C factor, I is the
intensity for a ten-year storm event, and A is the total
acreage in the tributary study area. For
developments with catchment areas greater than ten
acres, the “TR 55” method or other method
acceptable to the Director of Public Services will be
used for design.
(B) The weighted C value indicates the percent
of runoff expected at peak conditions. The weighted
coefficient will be computed as the sum of areas
multiplied with the associated C value and then
divided by the total drainage area. C values for
areas of development will be taken from the
following table:

(C) The value used for the intensity shall be
obtained using the ten-year storm event as shown in
Appendix A. The time of concentration used will be
calculated by a reasonable method and presented to
the Director of Public Services for review.
Developments located in the following zones will
require a minimum time of concentration of 5
minutes: Residential/Commercial, Commercial 1, 2,
or 3 and Industrial (RC, C-1, C-2, C-3, and I).

to pond over inlet structures set in parking, driving,
or walking areas will be 0.5 feet from top of grate.
The maximum height of water for inlet structures set
in road ditches or grassed areas will be 1.5 feet from
top of grate. This condition may be waived if, in the
opinion of the Director of Public Services, the
resulting elevation of water will not cause adverse
effects and still fulfills the intent and purpose of this
chapter. Under no condition can the water level be
more than two feet from the top of casting.

basin will be 4N, have mastic joints or O-ring joints,
have a bituminous sealant between casting and pavement,
and be built to meet ASTM C 478. Manholes or
catch basins will be set at every intersection of pipe
larger than 8O, change in grade, change in direction,
or at a maximum distance of 350N. Proprietors shall
contact the Public Services Department to obtain a list
of current castings to be used.
(C) Storm conveyance networks will be
designed to provide for the ten-year peak discharge
as calculated by § 55.35 of this chapter. The method
necessary to analyze pipe or channel hydraulics will
be based on Manning's Equation as given below:
Q = A*1.486/n*(R)^(2/3)*(S)^1/2
where:
Q = Cumulative flow from ten-year storm
event
A = Cross sectional area of pipe or
channel
R = Hydraulic radius
S = Slope of hydraulic grade line based
on ten-year storm event
n = Manning's coefficient taken from
table below
Typical Manning's Coefficients
Concrete pavement 0.011
Concrete pipe 0.012
Cast iron 0.012
Vitrified clay 0.014
Channel lined with asphalt 0.015
Earth, clean 0.018
Gravel 0.023
Corrugated metal 0.024
Earth with grass and weeds 0.030
Earth with dense weeds and brush 0.080
(D) Storm conveyance channels will be
designed to ensure that the elevation of the hydraulic
grade line will not permit uncontrolled flooding. If
surcharging of manholes will be required to meet the
anticipated ten-year storm event, the hydraulic line
must be included in the profile view of submitted
plans. Calculations supporting drainage
requirements for the Director of Public Service's
review will also be necessary.

§ 55.42 ADDITIONAL DESIGN CONSTRAINTS.
(A) Velocities in open channels shall not
become erosive for the type of soil and type of
vegetation anticipated to carry the water. Pipe
outlets such as footing drains, farm tiles, sump pump
discharges, and other connections to a Citymaintained
channel will be protected from erosion
by means as determined by the Director of Public
Services. Typical methods include rip rap, outlet
elevations lowered, drop structures, oversized pipe
diameter, or other methods as deter-mined
necessary.
(B) Pipe outlets will be designed and installed
to adequately resist erosion. The proprietor will
design adequate channel or bed stabilization using
accept-able methods for transition from pipe to
channel flow. Any damage incurred to the City storm
sewers will be the responsibility of the proprietor.
(C) All charges, including legal fees, will be
charged against the proprietor to repair damage
resulting from the discharge.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
PEAK FLOW REDUCTION
§ 55.50 STORMWATER DETENTION.
The intent of this subchapter is to decrease the
rate water enters the City storm sewer during peak
flows.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.51 PROJECTS SUBJECT TO DETENTION
REQUIREMENTS.
Land subject to detention requirements includes
new development within the City limits or an
adjoining parcel that will connect to City storm or
drains. All projects requiring detailed storm drain
review as defined in § 55.05 will require detention
facilities unless specifically mentioned above.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.52 SEQUENCING OF PONDS.
Each parcel as described on the date of acceptance
of this chapter will have only one pond. If a
property is split or is partially developed, the pond
calculations will be based on the entire parcel and
not limited to the area developed.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.53 MAINTENANCE OF STORAGE AREAS.
(A) Maintenance of the detention pond is the
responsibility of the property owner. If the property
owner is not maintaining the pond and the resulting
condition negates the intent and purpose of this
chapter, the City will issue a written notice granting
ten days to correct the situation. If, after the written
notice, the pond is not maintained, the City will post
a 24-hour notice to enter the premises and perform
the necessary maintenance. Costs associated with
the maintenance, including materials, labor, legal
fees, and out of pocket expenses incurred by the City
will be billed to the property owner.
(B) Examples of maintenance that will be
required include but are not limited to the following:
(1) Periodic inspection of operation;
(2) Mowing weeds, grass, and removal of
saplings;
(3) Removal of sediments from pond
bottom;
(4) Removal of debris and other non toxic
pollutants;
(5) Repair of erosion damage; and
(6) Maintenance of outlet structures
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.54 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS.
The ponds shall be designed to minimize
adverse effects, promote safety, limit the rate
drainage leaves the site, and be aesthetically
pleasing. Ponds shall be designed to reduce the loss
of soil particles and promote a higher quality of
water. Such practices may include longer detention
ponds, baffles, and other creative methods.

1997 S-1
Stormwater Control and Management 71
§ 55.55 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR
DETENTION PONDS.
(A) Wherever practical, ponds shall be located
in natural depressions or low lands but not in
protected wetlands or regulated floodplain areas.
Discharge for ponds should be directed towards
wetlands where applicable.
(B) All ponds built in the City are required to
have all of the following characteristics unless
specifically waived by the Director of Public
Services:
(1) A minimum of 15-feet buffers must be
maintained between adjacent property and the toe of
berm for the detention pond.
(2) A maximum of 3:1 side slopes is
required for all berms.
(3) The length to width ratio will be no less
than 3:1 to promote adequate settling of solids.
(4) All inlets to the pond will produce a
nonerosive velocity of storm water when discharged
during peak flows. Permanent erosion control
measures will be required where exit velocities
exceed four feet per second.
(5) The crest of the berm must have a
minimum width of five feet around the entire pond.
(6) Pond bottom slopes will be 2% if
grassed or 1% if concrete or asphalt is proposed.
Concrete or asphalt will be considered for hydraulic
purposes only, and proprietors are encouraged to
use grass or natural vegetation.
(7) Pond cross slopes will be as listed in
subdivision (B)(7).
(8) Maximum depth from the elevation to
the emergency spillway and the pond base elevation
will be four and a half feet, although three feet is
more appropriate.
(9) The toe of any berm may not be any
closer than 15 feet from any outbuilding, and 25 feet
from any building intended for occupancy.
(10) A method for screening the pond will
be submitted for review and approval to ensure that
the pond will be aesthetically pleasing to the
surrounding properties.
(11) Water loving trees such as willows shall
not be planted within 80N of the pond.
(12) All obstacles, such as old farm tiles, that
have the potential to affect the design performance
will be reported to the Director upon discovery and
will be rerouted, removed, or reconfigured to the
Director's satisfaction to maintain the intended design
of the pond.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.56 REQUIRED RELEASE RATE.
The maximum allowable release rate will be
determined by the three-year predevelopment
conditions. The predeveloped condition will be
taken as the three-year intensity multiplied by the
weighted C (as determined for the rational formula)
but cannot exceed 0.2 cfs per acre. Calculations
supporting the release rate will be submitted along
with other calculations required. The Director of
Public Services may increase or decrease the
allowable release rate based on the current capacity
of the City storm sewers.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.57 REQUIRED STORAGE VOLUME.
(A) The volume of storage required will be
based on the difference between the required
release rate as determined in § 55.56 and the 25-year
fully developed conditions. The acreage used for
detention require-ments will be taken as the
developed property acres. The chart included in the
§ 55.70 has been provided to aid in the necessary
calculations. This form must be attached with all
required calculations for site plan approval.
(B) During any storm event, the detention pond
will be required to store a minimum of 20% of the
total required for a period of 12 hours. The engineer
will provide calculations by an acceptable method to
demonstrate to the Director of Public Services that the
pond is designed to store water for the 12-hour
period. The percentage of total storage may be
increased or decreased at the discretion of the
Director.

§ 55.58 CONTROLLED OUTLET.
(A) Methods that will be considered as acceptable
outlet controls include perforated risers,
vertically arranged orifices, horizontally arranged
orifices, and broad crested weirs.
(B) The controlled outlet will be properly
designed to handle the maximum allowable
discharge for the site.
(C) The minimum diameter of pipe that can be
utilized for controlled outlets is 6O in diameter.
Outlets with multiple holes are acceptable, where
fittings such as a solvent weld cap with only one hole
drilled in the end will not be acceptable.
(D) The Director of Public Services may request
modified outlet conditions, configurations, sizing, and
method in order to fulfill the intent and purpose of
this chapter.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.59 EMERGENCY OUTLET.
(A) The emergency outlet will be designed to
handle runoff from the ten-year developed condition
for the entire catchment area as defined in § 55.35(D).
Acceptable methods that can be used for emergency
outlets include but are not limited to concrete lined
channel, bituminous lined channel, horizontally
arranged orifices, and vertically arranged orifices.
The method used must be designed to prevent any
channel or bank erosion that would threaten the
integrity of the channel or bank.
(B) The design consideration will be such that
the amount of water anticipated to reach the pond
will be able to leave at the same rate assuming the
controlled outlet has been plugged. The necessary
elevation for the emergency outlet will be such that
the required volume of storage will be maintained.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.60 BERM ELEVATION (FREEBOARD).
The maximum height of pond will be calculated
based on the type of outlet proposed. Freeboard of
at least 0.5N above the highest discharge elevation for
the
emergency outlet shall be provided to ensure protection
from overtopping and an uncontrolled release.
(Ord. 420-4-97, passed 4-21-97)
§ 55.61 FAILED STORM WATER FACILITY.
If a storm water facility fails during a flood event,
the Director of Public Services will request that the
pond be reconstructed. Since the existing pond
failed, the reconstruction shall be viewed as a new
facility and will require a permit in accordance with
this chapter.

REPEATED ILLEGAL ACTIVITY INVOLVING
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES OR ALCOHOL
§ 90.80 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
The City Commission determines that whenever
the repeated illegal use, sale, distribution, furnishing
or possession of controlled substances or alcoholic
beverages occurs on any real property, or whenever
any real property is used repeatedly for the violation
of laws regulating controlled substances, alcoholic
beverages, or nuisance parties, a public nuisance
may result. A public nuisance results from the
increased criminal activity that occurs within the
surrounding neighborhood, the increased pedestrian
and vehicular traffic within the surrounding
neighborhood, the increased noise and public
disturbances that occur within the surrounding
neighborhood by reason of loud music, yelling and
screaming, brawls, domestic violence, damage to
personal property, litter and public urination, and the
fear engendered in the minds of neighbors living in
the surrounding neighborhood.

only after a formal complaint is filed by the City’s
Director of Public Safety and notice is given to the
owner of the real property and the owner has had an
opportunity to be heard at a public evidentiary
hearing before the City Commission.
(B) Notice of the public evidentiary hearing
shall be given to the owner by personal service or
certified mail to the address indicated by the City
Assessor’s records, the Mecosta County Register of
Deeds records, and the City’s Neighborhood
Services Department records. The notice shall state
the nature of the alleged public nuisance, and the
time, date and location of the hearing. Certified mail

whose ownership interest is reflected in the records
described above. Notice shall be posted on the real
property at least seven calendar days prior to the
date of the hearing.
(C) The City Commission shall act as a
municipal administrative agency, functioning in a
quasi-judicial capacity as authorized by state law and
its Charter, when determining whether or not a
public nuisance exists under the standards
established in this Chapter. The City Commission
shall make this determination based solely on
evidence presented at the public evidentiary
hearing, of which a record shall be made and kept.
In conducting the public evidentiary hearing, the City
Commission shall afford an owner and City personnel
an opportunity to present evidence and make
arguments as to factual and legal issues. Crossexamination
of opposing witnesses shall be
permitted. An owner may appear in person or be
represented by an attorney, but lay representation
shall not be permitted. In conducting the public
evidentiary hearing, the City Commission can admit
and give weight to probative evidence of a nature
commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent
individuals in the conduct of their affairs. The City
Commission shall not be bound by the Michigan
Rules of Evidence. Irrelevant, incompetent and
unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
(D) The City Commission shall make factual
findings at the close of the public evidentiary
hearing, determining at a minimum:
(1) The street address and legal
description of the property; and
(2) The owner(s) of the real property; and
(3) The number and nature of specified
incidents or conditions; and
(4) The time frame in which these occurred
or existed; and
(5) The nature of the alleged public
nuisance; and
(6) The actions taken by the owner to
prevent or abate the specified incidents or
conditions.
(E) The declaration of a public nuisance and
any order of abatement must be by an affirmative
vote of not less than four City Commission members.
(Ord. 483-8-01, passed 8-6-01)
§ 90.84 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE AND COSTS.
If the City Commission determines by resolution
that any real property is a public nuisance according
to the provisions of this Chapter, and after giving due
consideration to the actions taken by the owner to
prevent or abate the specified incidents or
conditions, it may order abatement of the public
nuisance in addition to any other remedies available
at law or in equity. The order of abatement can be
entered at the public evidentiary hearing on the
alleged public nuisance, or at a later hearing noticed
out in the same manner as the public evidentiary
hearing. The City Commission may receive
additional evidence on the issue of abatement.
(A) If it is determined that all or a portion of the
real property should be vacated to abate the public
nuisance, the City Commission shall order the real
property vacated and declare occupancy of all or a
2014 S-12
Nuisances 10C
portion of the real property prohibited, which shall
authorize the Director of Public Safety to prohibit
occupancy by padlocking, boarding, or otherwise
securing the real property, for up to one year as
determined by the City Commission based upon the
evidence.
(B) The City Commission may determine and
order that the owner shall be liable for the full cost of
materials and personnel, including City employees
and contractors, utilized in padlocking, boarding or
securing the real property, and subsequent or
remedial actions required to keep the real property
vacant for the abatement period.
(C) The City Commission may order the costs
assessed against the real property and collected as
taxes.
(D) The City Commission may revoke the
housing maintenance certificate for any real property
determined to be a public nuisance, and the real
property shall not be occupied by a tenant until a
housing maintenance certificate has been requested
and issued according to § 151.20.
(E) Where only a discrete area of the real
property is involved in the illegal activity giving rise
to the declaration of a public nuisance, the City
Commission shall not order any other part of the real
property vacated. By the way of example, if only a
single apartment in a multiple unit structure is the site
of the incidents or conditions specified in this
Chapter, then the City Commission shall vacate the
single apartment, and not the entire structure.

§ 90.85 FINDING OF PUBLIC NUISANCE.

nuisance exists if any three or more of the following
listed incidents or conditions occur within a

notice of it is given by personal service or certified
mail to the owner with an explanation of the potential
consequences if similar activities occurs at the
property within nine months, and if two or more
specified incidents or conditions occur or are found
to exist within nine months of the first.

known to be involved, and the nature of the
underlying illegal activity.

discretion.

shall determine that a sidewalk is unsafe for use, or

not found, by posting the notice in some conspicuous
place on the premises.
(B) The notice shall specify the construction of
the sidewalk required and specifications therefor, or

sidewalk condition is unsafe and dangerous and
requires immediate repair to assure public safety and

harmless the City from all claims or damages incident
to the creation and operation of an outside
establishment.
(F) Effective dates and hours of operation.
(1) All permits shall specify the dates and
duration of the permitted sidewalk occupancy, and

period. Permits may not be granted for a period in
excess of 12 months. Sidewalk occupancy permits

substance abuse screening and assessment at his or
her own expense as described in § 131.14(D). A
minor may be found responsible or admit
responsibility only once under this division (A)(1).
(2) If a violation of this division (A) occurs
after one prior judgment, the minor is guilty of a
misdemeanor. A misdemeanor under this division
(A)(2) is punishable by imprisonment for not more
than 30 days if the court finds that the minor violated
an order of probation, failed to successfully complete
any treatment, screening, or community service
ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that
conviction or juvenile adjudication, or by a fine of not
more than $200, or both. A court may order a minor
under this division (A)(2) to participate in substance
use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of
the Public Health Code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230,
and designated by the Administrator of the Office of
Substance Abuse Services, to perform community
service, and to undergo substance abuse screening
and assessment at his or her own expense as
described in § 131.14(D).
(3) If a violation of this division (A) occurs
after two or more prior judgments, the minor is guilty
of a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor under this
division (A)(3) is punishable by imprisonment for not
more than 60 days, if the court finds that the minor
violated an order of probation, failed to successfully
complete any treatment, screening, or community
service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine
for that conviction or juvenile adjudication, or by a
fine of not more than $500, or both, as applicable. A
court may order a minor under this division (A)(3) to
participate in substance use disorder services as
defined in section 6230 of the Public Health Code,
1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the
Administrator of the Office of Substance Abuse
Services, to perform community service, and to
undergo substance abuse screening and assessment
at his or her own expense as described in
§ 131.14(D).
(B) If an individual who pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of division (A)(2) above or
offers a plea of admission in a juvenile delinquency
proceeding for a misdemeanor violation of division
(A)(2) above, the court, without entering a judgment
of guilt in a criminal proceeding or a determination in
a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the juvenile
has committed the offense and with the consent of the
accused, may defer further proceedings and place
the individual on probation. The terms and conditions
of that probation include, but are not limited to, the
sanctions set forth in division (A)(3) above, payment
of the costs including minimum state cost as provided
for in section 18m of chapter XIIA of the Probate Code
of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.18m, and section 1j

PA 175, MCL 769.1j, and the costs of probation as
prescribed in section 3 of chapter XI of the Code of

court finds that an individual violated a term or
condition of probation or that the individual is
2018 S-13
Alcoholic Beverages 15
utilizing this division (B) in another court, the court
may enter an adjudication of guilt, or a determination
in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the
individual has committed the offense, and proceed as
otherwise provided by law. If an individual fulfills the
terms and conditions of probation, the court shall
discharge the individual and dismiss the
proceedings. A discharge and dismissal under this
section is without adjudication of guilt or without a
determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding
that the individual has committed the offense and is
not a conviction or juvenile adjudication for purposes
of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law on
conviction of a crime. An individual may obtain only
one discharge and dismissal under this division (B).
The court shall maintain a nonpublic record of the
matter while proceedings are deferred and the
individual is on probation and if there is a discharge
and dismissal under this subsection. The Secretary of
State shall retain a nonpublic record of a plea and of
the discharge and dismissal under this subsection.
These records shall be furnished to any of the
following:
(1) To a court, prosecutor, or police
agency upon request for the purpose of determining
if an individual has already utilized this division (B).
(2) To the Department of Corrections, a
prosecutor, or a law enforcement agency, on the
Department's, a prosecutor's, or a law enforcement
agency's request, subject to all of the following
conditions:
(a) At the time of the request, the
individual is an employee of the Department of
Corrections, the prosecutor, or the law enforcement
agency, or an applicant for employment with the
Department of Corrections, the prosecutor, or the law
enforcement agency.
(b) The record is used by the
Department of Corrections, the prosecutor, or the law
enforcement agency only to determine whether an
employee has violated his or her conditions of
employment or whether an applicant meets criteria
for employment.
(C) A misdemeanor violation of § 131.08
successfully deferred, discharged, and dismissed
under division (B) is considered a prior violation for
the purposes of divisions (A)(2) and (3) above.
(D) A court may order an individual found
responsible for or convicted of violating section
§ 131.08 to undergo screening and assessment by a
person or agency as designated by the
Department-designated community mental health
entity as defined in section 1100a of the Mental Health
Code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1100a, to determine
whether the individual is likely to benefit from
rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug
education and alcohol or drug treatment programs.
A court may order an individual subject to a
misdemeanor conviction or juvenile adjudication of,
or placed on probation regarding, a violation of
§ 131.08 to submit to a random or regular preliminary
chemical breath analysis. The parent, guardian, or
custodian of a minor who is less than 18 years of age
and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1
to 722.6, may request a random or regular
preliminary chemical breath analysis as part of the
probation.
(E) The Secretary of State shall suspend the
operator's or chauffeur's license of an individual
convicted of a second or subsequent violation of
section § 131.08 or of violating § 131.09 as provided
in section 319 of the Michigan Vehicle Code, 1949 PA

review process. The right to make divisions exempt
from the platting requirements of the Land Division
Act can be transferred but only from a parent parcel
or parent tract to a parcel created from that parent
parcel or parent tract. The purpose of this Section is
to identify when a proposed division of land requires
review and approval through the land division
process, outline the approval process, detail criteria
necessary for approval, review building permit
requirements, and provide for an appeals process.
(1) When is Land Division Approval
required. Land division approval is required when
dividing unplatted property into two or more parcels,
the division is not exempt from the Land Division Act
as identified in division (A) above and
the number of divisions proposed, together with any
previous divisions of the same parent parcel or
parent tract, does not exceed those allowed by
Section 108 of the Land Division Act, Act 288 of the
Public Acts of 1967, as amended.

legal description of all parcels resulting from the
proposed division, including the remainder of the
parent parcel or parent tract.

(b) Submission and review.
1. Application and fee shall be
submitted to the City Clerk or designee.

shall review for compliance with the Land Division
Act and this chapter. The City Assessor or designee
shall be responsible for determining if the applicant
has provided an adequate and accurate legal
description and an adequate survey, map or drawing,
if the proposed division meets the four to one
maximum parcel depth to width ratio, if the applicant
possesses division rights equal to the number of
divisions desired, and if the divisions do not exceed
the maximum number of land divisions allowed as
outlined in division (B)(1) above of this section.
3. The City Engineer and Public
Works Director shall review for compliance with
adopted departmental standards and ordinances.
The City Engineer and Public Works Director shall be

compliance with parcel width and parcel area
requirements.
5. Within 45 days of receipt of a
complete application for land division approval, the
City Assessor or designee shall approve or deny the
land division request. In the case of denial, the City
Assessor or designee shall identify in writing the
basis for denial of the request. The basis for denial
shall be non-compliance with one of the standards for
approval outlined in division (B)(3) below of this
section.
(3) Criteria for approval.
(a) All proposed land divisions must
comply with all of the following criteria in order to be
approved. The following shall be the basis for
approval of a land division request.
1. Each parcel (including the
remainder of the parent parcel or parent tract) shall
have an adequate and accurate legal description and
shall be shown on a survey, map or drawing, drawn
to scale, which shows the area of each parcel, parcel
lines, dimensions, setbacks, public utility easements,
rights-of-way, accessibility and any other information
that is necessary to determine compliance with the
criteria for approval.
2. Each parcel ten acres or less
in size shall have a depth not more then four times its
width unless a variance from this requirement is
granted by the ZBA. For the purpose of this criterion,
the definition of lot (parcel) width in Article 2 of the
City of Big Rapids Zoning Ordinance shall be used.
For the purpose of this criterion, depth shall be
defined as the mean distance from the front street lot
(parcel) line to the rear lot (parcel) line as defined in
Article 2 of the City of Big Rapids Zoning Ordinance.
The depth to width ratio requirements shall not apply
to the remainder of the parent parcel or parent tract
retained by the proprietor.
3. Each parcel shall comply with
the minimum parcel width, maintained to the
minimum lot depth, for the zoning district in which it
is located unless a variance is granted by the ZBA.
4. Each parcel shall comply with
the minimum parcel area for the zoning district in
which it is located unless a variance is granted by the
ZBA.
5. Each parcel is accessible as
defined in this chapter.
6. The request complies with the
limitation on the maximum number of divisions
allowed per parent parcel or parent tract as outlined
in division (B)(1) of this section and Section 108 of the
Land Division Act, Act 288 of the Public Acts of 1967,
as amended.
7. Each resulting parcel that is a
development site has adequate easements for public
utilities from the parcel to existing public utility
facilities.
(b) The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)
may grant a variance from the minimum parcel area,
minimum parcel width or maximum parcel depth to
width ratio upon a finding of practical difficultly as
defined in Section 13.6 of the City of Big Rapids
Zoning Ordinance.
(4) Building permit requirements. Approval
of a land division neither implies the resulting parcels
are buildable, nor a determination that the resulting
parcels comply with other City ordinances or
regulations. In order to build on a parcel, the
property must also comply with the State’s Building
Code, the City’s Zoning Ordinance, and all other
applicable City ordinances. In addition, any parcel
resulting from a division that is less than one acre in
size shall not be issued a building permit unless the
parcel has both of the following:
(a) Public water or district health
department approval for the suitability of an on-site
water supply.
(b) Public sewer or district health
department approval for the suitability of an on-site
sewage disposal.
(5) Appeals. Any applicant aggrieved by a
decision of the City Assessor or designee on a land
division request may appeal the decision to the ZBA
by submitting the required application and fee to the
Zoning Administrator. If an appeal is filed, the City
Assessor or designee shall transmit the file on the
request being appealed to the ZBA.
(C) Parcel combinations. Any combination of
existing parcels into a single parcel that does not
involve a land division or lot split as defined in this
chapter, upon the written request of the proprietor,
shall be approved by the City Assessor or designee,
provided the proposed new parcel complies with the
minimum parcel area and parcel width requirements
of the City’s Zoning Ordinance. Absent a written
request, the Assessing authority shall send a notice of
intent to combine parcels to the proprietor.

Commission may permit such variance or variances
as, in its sound discretion, it believes to be
reasonable and within the general purpose and
policy of this chapter.

preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property
right of the applicant.

not be detrimental to the public welfare or be
injurious to property in the vicinity of the proposed

denial of the request. The basis for denial shall be
non-compliance with one of the standards for
approval outlined in division (J)(3) below.
(3) Criteria for approval.
(a) All proposed lot splits must
comply with all of the following criteria in order to be
approved. The following shall be the basis for
approval of a lot split request:
1. Each parcel (including the
remainder of the original parcel) shall have an
adequate and accurate legal description and shall be
shown on a survey, map or drawing, drawn to scale,
which shows the area of each parcel, parcel lines,
dimensions, setbacks, public utility easements,
rights-of-way, accessibility and any other information
that is necessary to determine compliance with the
criteria for approval.
2. Each parcel ten acres or less
in size shall have a depth not more then four times its
width unless a variance from this requirement is
granted by the ZBA. For the purpose of this criterion,
the definition of lot (parcel) width in Article 2 of the
City of Big Rapids Zoning Ordinance shall be used.
For the purpose of this criterion, depth shall be
defined as the mean distance from the front street lot
(parcel) line to the rear lot (parcel) line as defined in
Article 2 of the City of Big Rapids Zoning Ordinance.
3. Each parcel shall comply with
the minimum parcel width, maintained to the
minimum lot depth, for the zoning district in which it
is located unless a variance is granted by the ZBA.
4. Each parcel shall comply with
the minimum parcel area for the zoning district in
which it is located unless a variance is granted by the
ZBA.
5. Each parcel shall comply with
the minimum setback requirements for the zoning
district in which it is located unless a variance is
granted by the ZBA.
6. Each parcel is accessible as
defined in this chapter.

Land Division, Plat Review and Lot Split 25
7. The request complies with the
limitation on the maximum number of splits permitted
as outlined in division (J)(1) of this section and
Section 263 of the Land Division Act, Act 288 of the
Public Acts of 1967, as amended.
8. Each resulting parcel that is
a development site has adequate easements for
public utilities from the parcel to existing public
utility facilities.
(b) The Zoning Board of Appeals
(ZBA) may grant a variance from the minimum
setback requirements, minimum parcel area,
minimum parcel width, or maximum parcel depth to
width ratio upon a finding of practical difficultly as
defined in Section 13.6 of the City of Big Rapids
Zoning Ordinance.
(4) Building permit requirements. Approval
of a lot split neither implies the resulting parcels are
buildable, nor a determination that the resulting
parcels comply with other City ordinances or
regulations. In order to build on a parcel, the
property must also comply with the State’s Building
Code, the City’s Zoning Ordinance, and all other
applicable City ordinances. In addition, any parcel
resulting from a split that is less than one (1) acre in
size shall not be issued a building permit unless the
parcel has both of the following:
(a) Public water or district health
department approval for the suitability of an on-site
water supply.
(b) Public sewer or district health
department approval for the suitability of an on-site
sewage disposal.
(5) Appeals. Any applicant aggrieved by
a decision of the City Assessor or designee on a lot
split request may appeal the decision to the ZBA by
submitting the required application and fee to the
Zoning Administrator. If an appeal is filed, the City
Assessor or designee shall transmit the file on the
request being appealed to the ZBA.
(K) Parcel splits. A parcel split is the division of
a parcel consisting of two or more platted lots along
a platted lot line in order to create two or more
parcels. Approval of a parcel split is not required;
however, the split shall not result in the creation of
nonconforming parcels under the terms of the City’s
Zoning Ordinance unless a variance is first granted
by the ZBA. This would include issues of lot width, lot
area and setback requirements.

4.1:27 Exception to Yard and Lot Coverage Requirements:
In cases of legal nonconforming Class A residential lots which do not meet the existing minimum lot width or lot area requirements, minimum side yard
Article 4 General Provisions
4-15
setbacks may be reduced and maximum lot coverage requirements may be increased by administrative action based on the following formula:
(1) Side Yard Setback Reduction
The minimum side yard setback may be reduced at the same ratio as the width of the existing lot and the minimum lot width requirement for the district that the lot is in. (Example: A lot is eighty (80) feet wide in a district that requires lots to be a minimum of one hundred (100) feet wide. The lot’s width is eighty (80) percent of the minimum. The minimum side yard requirement is ten (10) feet. The side yard setback for that lot may therefore be reduced to eight (8) feet, or eighty (80) percent of ten (10) feet).
In no case may the minimum side yard setback be reduced to less than five (5) feet.
(2) Maximum Lot Coverage Increase
The maximum lot coverage requirement may be increased at the same percentage as the percentage that an existing lot’s total area is less than the minimum lot area requirement for that district. (Example: A lot is nine thousand (9,000) sq. ft. in area in a district that requires a minimum lot area of ten thousand (10,000) sq. ft.. The lot is ninety (90) percent of the district requirement, or is ten (10) percent smaller than required. The maximum lot coverage in the district is twenty (20) percent. The maximum lot coverage for that is increased by ten (10) percent of the normal requirement to twenty-two (22) percent (110% x 20% = 22%).
In no case may a lot eight thousand (8,000) sq. ft. or less in size have its lot coverage increased to more than thirty-eight (38) percent of the lot area. In no case may a lot over eight thousand (8,000) sq. ft. in size have its lot coverage increased to more than thirty-three (33) percent of the lot area.
4.1:28 Structure Completion:
All structures or additions to structures shall be completed on the outside in conformance with the building code and with finish materials; such as wood, brick, or brick veneer, shingle, concrete or similar performance tested material within one (1) year after construction is started unless an extension for not more than one (1) additional year is granted by the Zoning Administrator.
4.1:29 One Principal Building:
Article 4 General Provisions
4-15
In all districts, only one (1) principal building shall be placed on a single lot, except in the case of PUD’s, condominium developments and multi-family developments as regulated by this Ordinance.

NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
SECTION 7.0 PURPOSE
Within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments that later may be adopted, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of use which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendments. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival except as provided otherwise by proper authority, as defined herein.
SECTION 7.1 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND
Where, at the time of the passage of this Ordinance, a lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Ordinance, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
7.1:1 No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, except as provided otherwise by proper authority, as defined herein.
7.1:2 No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, except as provided otherwise by proper authority, as defined herein.
7.1:3 If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than six (6) consecutive months or eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period, any subsequent use of such land shall conform with the regulations specified by this Ordinance for the district in which such land is located, except as provided otherwise by proper authority, as defined herein.

(a) Class A nonconforming uses are those which have been so designated by the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA), after application for such designation by the owner of the property.
Article 7 Nonconforming Uses and Structures
7-2
Where Class A nonconforming uses are identified, it is the intent of this Ordinance to provide for their continuance so long as they fulfill the requirements in this section.
(b) Class B nonconforming uses are all nonconforming uses not designated as Class A. All nonconforming uses in existence as of the effective date of this Ordinance or which become nonconforming as a result of subsequent amendments to the Ordinance shall be Class B nonconforming uses until such time as they are designated Class A nonconforming uses. It is the intent of this Ordinance not to encourage the survival of Class B nonconforming uses. Class B nonconforming uses may not be expanded upon, and structures housing nonconforming uses may not be enlarged.
(2) Procedures for Obtaining Class A Designation
Any application for a Class A designation of a nonconforming use under this section shall be submitted and processed under the following procedures:
(a) A written application shall be filed with the ZBA by the property owner, identifying the property the Class A designation is being requested for and how the request conforms to the standards for approval of a Class A designation outlined in this article.
(b) The ZBA may require additional information it considers necessary to reach a decision.
(c) A public hearing shall be held to review the request. The notice requirements for this hearing shall be the same as required for review of a Special Land Use Permit as outlined in Section 10.3:4.
(3) Standards for Approval of Class A Designation
Before an application of Class A designation for a nonconforming use can be approved, the ZBA shall review the application to ensure that the following standards are met:
(a) The continuance of the use would not be contrary to the public health, safety or welfare, or the spirit of this Ordinance.
(b) That the use or structure does not, and is not likely to, significantly decrease the value of nearby properties.
(c) That the use was lawful at the time of its inception and that no useful purpose would be served by strict application of the
Article 7 Nonconforming Uses and Structures
7-3
provisions or requirements of this Ordinance with which the use or structure does not conform.
(4) Approval of Class A Designation
The ZBA shall approve Class A designation for nonconforming uses that comply with the standards and procedures of this section. The decision of the ZBA shall be in writing and shall set forth the findings and reasoning on which it is based. The ZBA shall attach conditions, where necessary, to assure that the use or structure does not become contrary to the public health, safety or welfare, or the spirit and purpose of this Ordinance. In addition, no vested interest shall arise out of a Class A designation, which may be revoked based on requirements in paragraph 5, “Revocation of Class A Designation”.
(5) Revocation of Class A Designation
Any Class A designation shall be revoked following the same procedure required for designation upon a finding that as a result of any violation of the conditions established by the ZBA, or due to changes in the use that cause it to no longer meet the requirements for approval of Class A designation.
(6) Regulations Pertaining to Class A Nonconforming Uses
(a) This Ordinance shall not prohibit the repair, improvement or modernization of a structure housing a Class A nonconforming use.
(b) Any Class A nonconforming use damaged by fire, explosion, flood, Act of God or a public enemy or other means may be restored, rebuilt, or repaired.

(d) Structural changes, including enlargement or extension of a Class A nonconforming use may be permitted by the ZBA, either as a condition of Class A designation, or by subsequent application to the ZBA by the owner of the Class A nonconforming use. The ZBA must document that the enlargement or extension will not be incompatible with surrounding land uses or inconsistent with the public health, safety or welfare or the spirit of the ordinance, or violate the setback requirements of the district in which it is located.
Article 7 Nonconforming Uses and Structures
7-4
(e) A Class A nonconforming use may be substituted for another nonconforming use on the same property in the same structure when the ZBA determines that the change would not increase the nonconformity of the structure or use.
(7) Regulations Pertaining to Class B Nonconforming Uses
(a) This ordinance shall not prohibit the repair of a structure housing a Class B Nonconforming use necessary to keep it structurally safe and sound. Any other improvements including remodeling or modernization, shall not be approved when such improvement is greater than twenty-five (25) percent of the value of the structure as determined by calculating twice the building’s assessed value.
(b) Any Class B nonconforming use damaged by fire, explosion, flood, Act of God or a public enemy or by other means must be rebuilt so as to comply with this Ordinance if the cost of the repairs or reconstruction is greater than fifty (50) percent of the value of the structure as determined by calculating twice the building’s assessed value.
(c) Any Class B nonconforming use abandoned as defined in Section 7.01:3 of this chapter, may not be reestablished.
(d) Structural changes to a structure housing a Class B nonconforming use shall not be permitted except through a variance granted by the ZBA.
(e) A Class B nonconforming use may not be substituted for another nonconforming use, on the same property in the same structure. If a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, the nonconforming use may not be reestablished.
SECTION 7.2 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
Where a lawful structure exists or is lawfully under construction at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, height, yards, its location on the lot may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful. Where a building permit has been granted for a proposed development, the project can be completed provided that construction begins within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this Ordinance and is not discontinued for a continuous period in excess of sixty (60) days and is completed within one (1) year of the date of issuance of the building permit. Lawful nonconforming structures shall be allowed to continue subject to the following provisions:
Article 7 Nonconforming Uses and Structures
7-5
7.2:1 No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered provided that its nonconformity does not increase (see Figure 7-1).
7.2:2 Any such nonconforming structure which has been damaged or destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost at the time of damage or destruction, shall not be reconstructed except in the case of practical difficulty for which the Zoning Board of Appeals must grant a non-use variance.
7.2:3 Should such nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
FIGURE 7-1
EXISTINGNONCONFORMINGSTRUCTUREREQUIREDLOT LINESSETBACKSNONCONFORMITYINCREASEDNONCONFORMITYNOT INCREASEDADDITIONS TO A NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE
7.2:4 If an intended change in use of an existing structure is to a permissible use within the zoning district where the property is located, but all of the dimensional setback requirements cannot reasonably be complied with, the Zoning Administrator may issue a zoning permit if the Zoning Board of Appeals determines that the following conditions are met:
(1) All of the applicable requirements of the zoning district that can reasonably be complied with, will be complied with. Compliance with any requirements of the zoning district is here defined as not reasonably possible if, compliance cannot be achieved without moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation.
(2) Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting zoning district requirements such as paved parking does not constitute grounds for
Article 7 Nonconforming Uses and Structures
7-6
finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. And in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created.
(3) If the property has an existing nonconforming use on it, and the use is changed in accordance with this subsection to a permissible use, the property may not revert to its former nonconforming use status.
SECTION 7.3 NON CONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN COMBINATION.
If lawful use involving individual structures or of structure and land in combination existing at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
7.3:1 No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
7.3:2 Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
7.3:3 Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is changed to a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
7.3:4 When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period (except when government action impedes access to the premises, the structure, or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located).
7.3:5 Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. The structure must be rebuilt to conform to the requirements of this Ordinance and the nonconforming use cannot be continued. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction.
Article 7 Nonconforming Uses and Structures
7-7
7.3:6 A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use if the Zoning Board of Appeals finds that such new use is no more nonconforming than the existing use.
SECTION 7.4 REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF NONBEARING WALLS, FIXTURES, WIRING OR PLUMBING
Repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed in or on a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use provided:
7.4:1 During any consecutive twelve (12) month period, extent of repair or replacement shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure.
7.4:2 Cubic contents of the structure shall not be increased.
7.4:3 Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
SECTION 7.5 CHANGES OF OWNERSHIP
Change of ownership between private parties does not remove the nonconformity nor extend time limits.
SECTION 7.6 REPLACEMENT COST
Replacement cost as used in the above provisions is the cost of restoring the structure to its original condition as appraised by a qualified appraiser employed by the City Commission. Persons aggrieved by said appraisal may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
SECTION 7.7 REMOVAL OF NONCONFORMING STATUS
Any nonconforming structure or land may be made conforming by appropriate action or modifications which cause the structure or land to fulfill the requirements of the district in which it is located.
In case of a nonconforming use which is a use designated as a Special Land Use by this Ordinance, the nonconforming status may be removed upon issuance of a Special Land Use Permit after the appropriate action has been taken in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or person requesting the Special Land Use Permit to initiate the request in accordance with Section 10.2 of this Ordinance.
Article 7 Nonconforming Uses and Structures
7-8
SECTION 7.8 ELIMINATION OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES OR LAND
The City may acquire by purchase, condemnation or otherwise private property for the removal of nonconforming uses and structures. The legislative body may in its discretion provide that the cost and expense of acquiring such private property be paid from general funds, or the cost and expense or any portion thereof be assessed to a special district. The elimination of such nonconforming uses and structures in a zoned district as herein provided is hereby declared to be for a public purpose and for a public use. The legislative body shall have authority to institute and prosecute proceedings for the condemnation of nonconforming uses and structures under the power of eminent domain in accordance with the laws of the State or provisions of any City Charter relative to condemnation.
SECTION 7.9 KNOWN NONCONFORMING USES
The Department of Neighborhood Services shall prepare and maintain an up-to-date record of all known nonconforming uses within the City. Each record shall contain a copy of the assessment card, the commonly known address or approximate location of the property, and a description of the nonconforming use. Application for a zoning permit shall note in the appropriate place on the zoning permit application form the nonconforming statues of the property, and if a nonconforming use exists, the nature of the nonconformity.

ARTICLE 8
LANDSCAPE STANDARDS
SECTION 8.1 INTENT
The intent of this article is to promote the public health, safety and welfare by establishing minimum standards for the design, installation and maintenance of landscaping as buffer zones between zoning districts, along roadways, between adjacent building and in parking lots.
The standards of this article are intended to guide and encourage the protection and enhancement of the environment through requirements for site design and the use of landscape materials. Applicants are encouraged to provide landscaping in addition to the minimum requirements of this Ordinance to improve the function, appearance and value of their property.
SECTION 8.2 APPLICATION
The requirements set forth in this article shall apply to all uses for which site plan review is required under Section 9.2. No site plan or land use shall be approved unless said site plan shall show landscaping consistent with the provisions of this Article.
The Planning Commission may also determine that dimensional conditions unique to the parcel would prevent development of required buffer zones, off street parking area, landscaping or green belts. In addition, when space limitations or prevailing development patterns in the surrounding neighborhoods, justify exceptions to these requirements the Planning Commission may make a determination that an exception be granted.
The following are minimum landscape standards and nothing will preclude the developer and City from agreeing to more stringent standards. If applicable this determination will be made during site plan review.
8.2:1 Landscape Plan Required
A separate detailed landscape plan shall be required to be submitted as part of a site plan review. The landscape plan shall include, but not be limited to the following items:
(1) Minimum scale of one (1) inch to fifty (50) feet.
(2) Proposed plant location, spacing, size, species (common and botanical name) and necessary descriptions for use within required landscape areas.
(3) Existing and proposed contours on-site and one hundred (100) feet beyond the site at intervals not to exceed two (2) feet.
Article 8 Landscape Standards
8-2
(4) Straight cross section including slope, height and width of berms and type of ground cover, or height and type of construction of wall or fence, including footings.
(5) Significant construction details to resolve specific site conditions, such as tree wells to preserve existing trees or culverts to maintain existing natural drainage patterns.
(6) Planting and staking details in either text or drawing form to ensure proper installation and establishment of proposed materials.
(7) Identification of existing trees proposed to be saved including individual tree caliper size and species. Clearly reference on the plan the total number of trees proposed to be preserved, category of preserved tree caliper size and number of trees requested for credit consideration.
(8) Identification of tree protection method for trees proposed to be preserved.
(9) Identification of existing trees over two and one-half (2 ½) inch caliper proposed to be removed.
(10) Identification of grass and other ground cover and method of planting.
(11) Clearly reference on plan total number of proposed parking spaces and number of required parking lot trees.
(12) For principal structure landscape requirements clearly shade/hatch the principal structure floor area of the building footprint regulated for landscape requirements, label linear footage of the building front and/or sides that are subject to landscape requirements (see Section 8.9 Landscape Standards for Principal Structures).
(13) Site plan review for pre-existing sites shall clearly identify the proposed building and/or parking expansion and label the net percent site increase and calculated landscape requirement. Clearly identify proposed building entrances and curb cuts.
(14) Identify areas established for storage of plowed snow during winter months to ensure that plants are not damaged by storage of snow on them.
SECTION 8.3 MINIMUM BUFFER ZONES
It is the intent of this section to provide a landscape buffer between conflicting land uses. The buffer zone is defined as the landscape area located within the required side and rear yard setbacks. Landscape requirements along the public street right of way or front yard are addressed in Section 8.6 Greenbelts.
Article 8 Landscape Standards
8-3
8.3:1 Level of Use
For the purposes of determining the density and type of coverage in the required buffer zone, zoning districts have been classified based on Level of Use, as follows:
LEVEL OF USE

8.3:2 A buffer zone shall be provided within the setback between the subject site and all adjacent properties according to the table below. Walls shall typically be prohibited along a public street right of way or in a front yard unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission. The height of the wall or berm shall be measured from the surface of the parking area or land on the nonresidential side of the wall. All walls shall meet the standards described in item 8.3:4. Buffers utilizing a combination of plant materials, berming and walls will be encouraged.

All property line distances shall be rounded upward to the nearest foot. A combination of evergreen and deciduous plant materials in the hedge will be encouraged.
B = One (1) Deciduous canopy tree and visually solid hedge (during leaf period) of at least four (4) feet in height at maturity, or one (1) evergreen tree and visually solid hedge (during leaf period) at least four (4) feet in height at maturity, per forty (40) linear feet along the property line. All property line distances shall be rounded upward to the nearest foot. A combination of evergreen and deciduous plant materials in the hedge will be encouraged.
Where the adjacent property, including property across a public street or private road, is zoned or used as single family residential, the Planning Commission may require additional landscaping (trees, shrubs, wall or berm) along the property line or within the site to sufficiently screen the parking lot, vehicle headlights, loading zones, outdoor display areas, storage yards, accessory structures, or use.
** A berm will be considered when a minimum twenty-one (21) feet wide buffer strip is available for a three (3) foot height berm. A berm at least three (3) feet high is permitted as part of a buffering requirement (Example: a three (3) foot fence on top of a three (3) foot berm is equivalent to a six (6) foot fence or wall). A four (4) foot high berm may be substituted for a four (4) foot fence or wall. See Section 8.3:5 for Berm Standards.
Home occupations approved by special use permit within the residential districts may require additional buffering, screening or landscape requirements. Requirements may be directed along the property line or within the site to ensure a harmonious effect with adjacent properties, within the residential area and to minimize the impact of a more intense use or activity.
8.3:3 Parking and Storage
Sideyard buffer screen: Parking lot screens will be designed with a hedge, wall, berm, fence or combination thereof forming a continuous screen at least fifty-two (52) inches in height above parking lot grade. The parking lot screen shall be located in the buffer zone to provide maximum screening of the parking lot. The arrangement of shrubs in clusters is encouraged.
Greenbelt screen: All off-street parking areas shall be screened from view with a landscaped area with continuous planting with a minimum four (4) feet height at maturity along the perimeter of those sides which are visible from a public street or approved private street. Shrubs shall be planted with adequate clearance from sidewalks so that they do not grow over or into the sidewalks as they mature. In addition, greenbelts shall follow landscape
Article 8 Landscape Standards
8-5
requirements in Section 8.6 (Greenbelts). The Planning Commission, at their discretion, may approve alternative landscape planting or a solid wall in lieu of a landscape berm.
All loading and unloading areas that are visible from residential districts or public thoroughfares, shall be screened by a vertical screen consisting of structural or plant materials no less than six (6) feet in height. Screening shall be sufficient to contain blowing debris and screen the loading and unloading areas from adjacent property owners.
All storage areas (including areas for storage of refuse) which are visible from residential districts or public thoroughfares, shall be screened on all sides by a fence or wall no less than six (6) feet in height. The fence or wall shall not allow light to penetrate through it.
8.3:4 Wall and Fence Standards – When Buffering is Required:
For the purpose of buffering, walls and fences are the same. Required walls shall comply with the standards listed below.
(1) Walls shall be located either on a lot line, if adjoining property owners agree, or the wall shall be located six (6) inches from the property line finished side facing outward, or placed no more than twelve (12) inches from the lot line or at a location at the discretion of the Planning Commission to suit creative landscaping plan design, or property/utility conditions.
(2) Walls shall have no openings for vehicular traffic or other purposes, except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission.
(3) Walls shall be constructed of face brick, pressure treated wood, or comparable nonporous facing materials on the exterior sides facing an affected district.
(4) Walls shall be durable, weather resistant, rustproof and easily maintainable. Wood or wood products shall be high quality durable materials as approved by the Department of Neighborhood Services. Wood fences shall be sight obscuring sufficient to shield light and block blowing debris. Masonry walls may be constructed with openings which do not in any square section (height and width) exceed twenty (20) percent of the surface. Where walls are so pierced, the openings shall be so spaced as to maintain the obscuring character required and shall not reduce minimum height requirement.
(5) Walls must be maintained in good condition by the property owner.
(6) Curbing, bollards (posts), or plant material shall be required where parking is adjacent to walls. Bumper blocks shall not be permitted.
Article 8 Landscape Standards
8-6
8.3:5 Berm Standards:
Required berms shall be constructed as landscaped earth mounds with a crest area at least four (4) feet in width. The exterior face of the berm shall be constructed as an earthen slope. The interior face of the berm may be constructed as an earthen slope or retained by means of a wall, terrace or other means acceptable to the Zoning Administrator. Whenever an earthen slope is provided, it shall be constructed with a slope not to exceed one (1) foot of vertical rise to three (3) feet of horizontal distance (1.3). (See illustration). Free form naturalistic contouring and berm shaping are encouraged.
Berm slopes shall be protected from erosion by sodding or seeding. Seeded slopes shall be protected with a straw mulch held in netting until the seed germinates and a permanent lawn is established. The straw mulch is not required if the seeded slope is protected by a net that is specifically designed to control erosion. The berm area shall be kept free from refuse and debris and shall be planted with living shrubs, trees or lawn, and shall be maintained in a healthy, growing condition.
As part of an overall site plan, a planting and grading plan shall be prepared for the berm. Plant materials within the berm area shall be installed in accordance with the requirements for Greenbelts or Buffer Zones, depending on berm location, and plant materials contained in this section.

SECTION 8.4 FENCE AND WALL STANDARDS WHEN BUFFERING IS NOT REQUIRED
It is the intent of this Section to provide for the regulation of fences and walls in those instances where a fence or wall is not required by the provisions of this Article for purposes of buffering. Pursuant to this Section it is the City’s goal to balance the protective and privacy aspects brought about through the construction of fencing and walls against the potential loss of natural light, air circulation, and natural views resulting from said construction.
8.4:1 Permit
It shall be unlawful for any person to construct or cause to have constructed any fence or wall upon any property within the City of Big Rapids without first having obtained a Fence Permit from the City’s Zoning Administrator.
8.4:2 Requirements
(1) Fencing or walls may be located on the property line if the abutting property owner consents, in writing, thereto.
(2) Fencing or walls shall be constructed a minimum of six (6) inches from the property line if consent in compliance with Section 8.4:2.1 cannot be obtained.
(3) Fences or walls with a height not to exceed six (6) feet may be constructed in all yards except along required front yard setback or side street setbacks in residential districts. Along front yard or side street setbacks, fences or walls shall not exceed four (4) feet in height; however, on residential perimeters (not in required front yard or side street yard setbacks) which border commercial or industrial zoned properties, fences, or walls shall not exceed twelve (12) feet.
(4) Fences or walls constructed in front yards or side street yards in residential districts shall be no more than forty-five (45) percent solid. (Section 8.4:2 (4) amended by Ord. No. 531-05-04).
(5) Fences and walls may be constructed of wood, brick, plastic, masonry, iron, or woven wire commonly known as chain link, and posts may consist of wood, steel, iron, brick, plastic, masonry, or stone.
(6) In no instance shall barbed or razor wire fencing be permitted on or adjacent to residential property or residential zone district. In no instance shall a fence be electrified.

ARTICLE 12
CONDOMINIUMS
SECTION 12.1 PURPOSE
The intent of this Article is to regulate the division and development of land under the Condominium Act (Act 59 of the Public Acts of 1978, as amended) so that the development is comparable in process and design to property divided and developed by other methods.
SECTION 12.2 CONVENTIONAL CONDOMINIUM VS SITE CONDOMINIUM
In a conventional condominium project, the condominium unit is enclosed air space, such as condominium apartments. In a site condominium project, the condominium unit is a parcel of land that is sold as a building site just as lots in a subdivision are sold.

Unit/“lot” alteration approval is required for any relocation of an existing condominium unit/“lot” or parcel boundary, or when subdividing any condominium unit/“lot” into two (2) or more parcels.
The boundaries between adjoining condominium units/“lots” shall not be relocated, nor shall a condominium unit/“lot” be subdivided unless the condominium documents expressly permit it.
(2) Approval Process
(a) Information required
Information required from the applicant for unit/“lot” alteration approval shall include:
(i) A completed Unit/“Lot” Alteration Application provided by the City.
(ii) An adequate and accurate legal description of all parcels resulting from the proposed alteration, including the remainder of the original parcel.

(iv) Within forty-five (45) days of receipt of a complete application for unit/“lot” alteration approval, the City Assessor or designee shall approve or deny the alteration request. In the event of denial, the City Assessor or designee shall identify in writing the basis for denial of the request. The basis for denial shall be non-compliance with one (1) of the standards for approval outlined in Section 12.7:1(3) below.
(3) Criteria for Approval
All proposed unit/“lot” alterations must comply with all of the following criteria in order to be approved. The following shall be the basis for Approval of a unit/”lot” alteration request.
.
Article 12 Condominiums
12-16
(a) Each parcel (including the remainder of the original parcel) shall have an adequate and accurate legal description and shall be shown on a survey, map or drawing, drawn to scale, which shows the area of each parcel, parcel lines, dimensions, setbacks, public utility easements, rights-of-way, accessibility and any other information that is necessary to determine compliance with the criteria for approval.
(b) Each parcel ten (10) acres or less in size shall have a depth not more than four (4) times its width unless a variance from this requirement is granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA). For the purpose of this criterion, the definition of lot (parcel) width in Article 2 of the City of Big Rapids Zoning Ordinance shall be used. For the purpose of this criterion, depth shall be defined as the mean distance from the front street lot (parcel) line to the rear lot (parcel) line as defined in Article 2 of the City of Big Rapids Zoning Ordinance.
(c) Each parcel shall comply with the minimum parcel width, maintained to the minimum lot (parcel) depth, for the zoning district in which it is located unless a variance is granted by the ZBA.
(d) Each parcel shall comply with the minimum parcel area for the zoning district in which it is located unless a variance is granted by the ZBA.
(e) Each parcel shall comply with the minimum setback requirements for the zoning district in which it is located unless a variance is granted by the ZBA.
(f) Each parcel is accessible as defined in the City’s Land Division, Subdivision Plat Review and Lot Split Ordinance.
(g) Each resulting parcel that is a development site as defined in the City’s Land Division, Subdivision Plat Review and Lot Split Ordinance has adequate easements for public utilities from the parcel to existing public utility facilities.
The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) may grant a variance from the minimum setback requirements, minimum parcel area, minimum parcel width, or maximum parcel depth to width ratio upon a finding of practical difficulty as defined in Section 13.6 of the City of Big Rapids Zoning Ordinance.
Article 12 Condominiums
12-17
(4) Building Permit requirement
Approval of a unit/“lot” alteration neither implies the resulting parcels are buildable, nor a determination that the resulting parcels comply with other City ordinances or regulations. In order to build on a parcel, the property must also comply with the State’s Building Code, the City’s Zoning Ordinance, and all other applicable City ordinances. In addition, any parcel resulting from an alteration that is less than one(1) acre in size shall not be issued a building permit unless the parcel has both of the following:
(a) Public water or District Health Department approval for the suitability of an on-site water supply.
(b) Public sewer or District Health Department approval for the suitability of an on-site sewage disposal.
(5) Appeals
Any applicant aggrieved by a decision of the City Assessor or designee on a unit/“lot” alteration request may appeal the decision to the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) by submitting the required application and fee to the Zoning Administrator. If an appeal is filed, the City Assessor or designee shall transmit the file on the request being appealed to the ZBA.
12.7:2 Parcel Combinations
Any combination of existing parcels into a single parcel that does not involve a unit/“lot” alteration, upon the written request of the proprietor, shall be approved by the City Assessor or designee, provided the proposed new parcel complies with the minimum parcel area and parcel width requirements of the City’s Zoning Ordinance. Absent a written request, the Assessing authority shall send a notice of intent to combine parcels to the proprietor. Permission shall be considered obtained if there is no negative response within thirty (30) days following the notice of intent.
12.7:3 Parcel Splits
A parcel split is the division of a parcel consisting of two (2) or more condominium units/“lots” along an existing unit/“lot” line in order to create two (2) or more parcels. Approval of a parcel split is not required; however, the split shall not result in the creation of nonconforming parcels under the terms of the City’s Zoning Ordinance unless the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) first grants a variance. This would include issues of lot width, lot area and setback requirements.
Article 12 Condominiums
12-18
12.7:4 Amendment of Condominium Project

Decisions made by the City Commission regarding Special Land Use Permits shall be appealed to Circuit Court.
SECTION 13.5 VARIANCES
13.5:1 Upon application of an appeal, the ZBA may grant a variance from the terms of this Ordinance which will not be contrary to the public interest, and where because of special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty to the property owner, and so that the spirit of this Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. The possibility of increased financial return shall not of itself be deemed sufficient to warrant a variance. In granting a variance, the ZBA may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem
Article 13 Zoning Board of Appeals
13-4
advisable in the interest of furtherance of the purpose of this Ordinance, provided the conditions are necessary to:

(3) Insure compatibility with adjacent uses of land.
(4) Promote the use of land in a socially and economically viable manner.
13.5:2 In accordance with the above, the ZBA shall have the following general powers:
SECTION 13.6 NON-USE VARIANCE STANDARDS

(1) The ordinance restrictions unreasonably prevent the property owner from using the property for a permitted purpose; and/or
(2) The variance would do substantial justice to the applicant, and possibly other property owners in the district, and a lesser relaxation of the regulations than that requested would not provide substantial relief to the property owner; and/or
(3) The plight of the property owner is due to the unique circumstances of the property, and not a general condition of the neighborhood; and/or
(4) The alleged practical difficulty has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property; and
13.6:2 In granting a variance, the ZBA shall ensure that the spirit of the Ordinance is observed, public safety secured and substantial justice done.
SECTION 13.7 USE VARIANCE STANDARDS
13.7:1 While considering use variance requests, the applicant must present evidence to the ZBA to show that if the Zoning Ordinance is applied strictly, unnecessary hardship will result and that all four (4) of the following requirements are met:
(1) That the property could not be reasonably used for the purposes permitted in that zone; and
Article 13 Zoning Board of Appeals
13-5
(2) That the appeal results from unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not from general neighborhood conditions; and
(3) That the use requested by the variance would not alter the basic character of the area; and
(4) That the alleged hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property; and
13.7:2 In granting a variance, the ZBA shall ensure that the spirit of the Ordinance is observed, public safety secured and substantial justice done.
SECTION 13.8 RECURRING VARIANCE REQUESTS
Recurring variance requests may be forwarded by the ZBA to the Planning Commission or City Commission for consideration of a text or map amendment.
SECTION 13.9 EXPIRATION OF VARIANCE
Every permit granted for a variance under the provisions of this Ordinance shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the building or work authorized by the ZBA is not commenced within sixty (60) days from the date of authorization, unless authorized by the ZBA. Once work has commenced on a project for which a variance was required, the variance shall expire if construction is not completed prior to the expiration of the zoning permit.
SECTION 13.10 INTERPRETATION OF ZONING ORDINANCE TEXT OR MAP
Where a street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded, differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning Map, the ZBA, after notice to the owners of the property and the immediate adjoining property and after public hearing, shall interpret the Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purposes of this Ordinance for the particular section or district in question. In interpreting the boundaries of zoning districts, the ZBA shall assume, unless there is information indicating otherwise, that district boundary lines as shown on the Zoning Map, unless otherwise indicated, shall be construed as following lot lines, Big Rapids corporate limit lines, centerlines of highways, streets, roads, alleys, easements, railroads, streams, rivers, lakes or those centerlines extended or projected.
The ZBA shall have the authority to interpret the provisions of this Ordinance when a requirement, standard, or other text is unclear. When determining if a particular use is included in the definition of a type or group of uses permitted in a district, it shall not interpret a use specifically listed in one (1) district as being inferred as permitted in another district.
SECTION 13.11 BOND
The ZBA shall have authority to require assurance, surety or performance bond in the form, manner and amount, as in its discretion, may be required to compel compliance with
Article 13 Zoning Board of Appeals
13-6
and performance of all conditions incident to permits granted by said ZBA, provided, however, that such assurance, surety or performance bond shall not be for amounts greater than the reasonable cost of performing or complying with the conditions attached to such permit.
SECTION 13.12 ACTION OF ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
In exercising its powers, the ZBA may, in conformity with the provisions of Act 207 of the Public Acts of 1921, as amended, and of this Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made.
