PREFACE 
    This volume contains the Code of General Ordinances of the City of Boonville, Missouri, being a republication of the ordinances and resolutions of a general and permanent nature of the City of Boonville, and the ordinances and resolutions amendatory thereof and appropriate for inclusion followed by a comparative table giving the disposition of each ordinance and resolution. 
    Said volume is the first codification since 1958, and as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all ordinances and resolutions not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance or the provisions of the Code. Special ordinances or resolutions or those dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, changing street names, granting franchises, etc., are not included herein. For a more specific enumeration of the types of ordinances or resolutions not included, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The ordinances and resolutions have been classified as to subject matter, edited, revised and in many instances rewritten. It should be observed that the chapters have been arranged in alphabetical sequence and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also invited to the footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant state laws. 
    The source of a section is included in the history note enclosed in parentheses at the end of such section. The absence of a history note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of this Code. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 of the Code is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 21 is 21-14. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections may be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-15 and 4-16 is desired to be added, the new sections would be numbered 4-15.1, 4-15.2 and 4-15.3, respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a decimal after the chapter number, e.g., new material may be included between Chapters 12 and 13, by designating it as Chapter 12.1. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same manner, or in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division, as the case may be. 
    A special feature of this volume to which the attention of the user is particularly invited is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, this volume may be kept up-to-date periodically. Amendatory ordinances upon final passage of the City can be edited and the appropriate page or pages affected reprinted for insertion in the Code. In such event, the new or reprinted pages then shall be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. To each amendment will be attached an amendment or editorial note explaining briefly the effect of the amendment upon the section or sections amended and the derivation of such amendment. Each such subsequent amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each index entry has been placed under several headings, some being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which are intended as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. Additions, alterations and deletions in the index will be accomplished in the same manner as is provided for additions, alterations and deletions to the substantive provisions of this publication. 
    The successful maintenance of the Code up-to-date at all times depends upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it shall then become the responsibility of the holder to insert the amendments according to the accompanying instructions. 
    It is earnestly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacement, and that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mary McAllister, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance and for the interest shown by her in the preparation of the manuscript of this publication. Credit is gratefully acknowledged also to the members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout this project. 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Eric Grant, Vice President, Supplement Department, and Peggy Lamar, Editor, of Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida, and is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Boonville.

Sec. 2-19. - Investment policy. 
(a)  Policy. It is the policy of the City of Boonville to invest public funds in a manner which will provide the highest investment return with the maximum security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the city and conforming to all state and local statutes governing the investment of public funds. 
(b)  Scope. 
(1)  This investment policy applies to all financial assets and all funds of the City of Boonville. 
(c)  Prudence. 
(1)  Investments shall be made with judgment and care-under circumstances then prevailing-which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital, as well as the probable income to be derived. 
(2)  The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the "prudent person" standards and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with the investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. 
(d)  Objective. The primary objectives, in priority order, of the city's investment activities shall be: 
(1)  Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of the city shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this objective, diversification is required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio. 
(2)  Liquidity. The city's investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the city to meet all operating requirements which might be reasonably anticipated. 
(3)  Return on investment. The city's investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout the budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account, the city's investment risk constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio. 
(e)  Delegation of authority. Authority to manage the city's investment program is derived from the Missouri Constitution Article IV, Section 15. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to the bookkeeper under the direct supervision of the city administrator. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy. The bookkeeper shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials and maintain records thereof. 
(f)  Ethics and conflicts of interest. 
(1)  Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose to the city administrator any material financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business with the City of Boonville, and they shall further disclose any large personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the city's portfolio. Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of the city, particularly with regard to the time of purchases and sales. 
(2)  All employees with investment authority shall file the appropriate reports with the secretary of state disclosing potential conflicts of interest and substantial interests in accordance with Boonville city ordinance. 
(g)  Authorized financial dealers and institutions. 
(1)  In order for a financial institution to qualify for investment of city funds, certain conditions must exist. Financial institutions shall be restricted to banks which are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. No public deposit shall be made except in a qualified public depository in the State of Missouri. 
(2)  A current audited financial statement is required to be on file for each financial institution in which the city invests. 
(h)  Authorized and suitable investments. The city is empowered by statute to invest in the following types of securities: 
(1)  Bonds, bills, or notes of the United States or an agency of the United States. 
(2)  Negotiable certificates of deposit, savings accounts, and other interest earning deposit accounts of financial institutions whose operations for the two most recent years have resulted in a profit. 
(3)  Repurchase agreements against eligible collateral, the market value of which must be maintained during the life of the agreements at a level equal to or greater than the amount advanced. An undivided interest in the instruments pledged for such agreements must be granted to the city. 
(4)  The Missouri State Treasurer's Repurchase Agreement Pool. 
(i)  Collateralization. 
(1)  All investments which exceed the financial institution's insurance limits shall be secured by eligible collateral. The market value of the collateral must be equal to or greater than the value of the investment instrument less the amount of insurance coverage. Eligible collateral shall mean all securities which would otherwise be qualified for purchase under this policy and which are on the State of Missouri Office of the State Treasurer's list of securities acceptable as collateral to secure state deposits. 
(2)  All investments purchased under this policy are to be issued in negotiable, bearer form to the city or in the form of a safekeeping receipt. 
(3)  Collateral will always be held by an independent third party. A clearly marked evidence of ownership (safekeeping receipt) must be supplied to the city and retained. 
(4)  The right of collateral substitution is granted. 
(j)  Safekeeping and custody. All security transactions, including collateral for repurchase agreements, entered into by the city shall be conducted on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) basis. Securities will be held by a third party custodian designated by the bookkeeper and evidenced by safekeeping receipts. 
(k)  Diversification. The city will make every effort to diversify its investments by security type and institution. 
(l)  Maximum maturities. To the extent possible, the city will attempt to match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow, the city will not directly invest in security maturing more than two years from the date of purchase, unless circumstances warrant other consideration, as approved by the city administrator. 
(m)  Internal control. The city administrator shall establish an annual process of independent review by an external auditor. This review will provide internal control by assuring compliance with policies and procedures. 
(n)  Performance standards. The investment portfolio will be designed to obtain a market average rate of return during budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the city's investment risk constraints and cash flow needs. 
(o)  Reporting. The bookkeeper is charged with the responsibility of preparing a report on the investment activity to be provided to the independent external auditor. Reports will include the issuing financial institution, the type of security, the term to maturity, the interest rate, the amount of principal, performance, interest earnings, etc. 
(p)  Investment policy adoption. The city's investment policy shall be adopted by ordinance of the city council, and any modifications made thereto must be approved by the city council.

(h)  Responsibility of bidders; determination. 
(1)  The city administrator is empowered to award and execute contracts and settle claims on behalf of the city within the purview of this article that are for $30,000.00 or less. The city council shall award all other contracts in excess of $30,000.00 and approve the settlement of claims in excess of $30,000. 
(2)  Contracts subject to bidding requirements shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder as determined at the sole discretion of the city council. In determining the lowest responsible bidder, the city council may consider the following as well as other criteria: 
a.  The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required; 
b.  The capacity of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
c.  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder including but not limited to past performance record; default under previous contracts, whether or not such contract was with the city; competency; and failure to pay or satisfactorily settle all bills due for labor and material on former contracts; 
d.  The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;

h.  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract, including guarantees; 
i.  Whether the bidder is entitled to local or area preference as set forth in the chapter, either through residency of the bidder or sub-contractors. 
(3)  When the recommendation of award is not to the lowest bidder, the city administrator shall prepare a statement of the reasons for such award recommendation. 
(4)  When two or more responsible bidders submit the same low bid, the contract award shall be determined by drawing lots in public at a meeting of the city council; unless one bidder is a local or area bidder and one is a non-local or area bidder, in which event the local or area bidder shall be awarded the contract. 
(i)  Bid; waiver of defects. In awarding a contract pursuant to sealed competitive bidding, the city council may waive any variation from the bid requirements or defect in a bid that does not materially affect the competitive nature of the bid, is not in violation of any ordinance, statute or law and does not prejudice the right of the public. 
A variance or defect does not materially affect the bid if the terms of the bid are clear and unambiguous, the bid contains all essential elements of the contract, if the amount or competitive nature of the bid is not affected and if the bidder has not received an unfair advantage from having seen the competitor's bid documents. 
In considering any waiver, the city administrator shall attempt to secure the best work or materials at the lowest price practicable and shall make such determination in a manner as to fairly and reasonably accomplish such purpose with sole reference to the public interest. 
(j)  Bid; clarification. The city administrator may request clarification of a bid or any part thereof. Clarification shall mean the communication between the city, or its designated agents, and the bidder regarding the bid. Such communication shall not change the bid, the competitive nature of all bids or violate any ordinance, statute or law. 
In considering any clarification the city administrator shall attempt to procure the best supply, service or construction at the lowest practicable price and shall make such clarifications in such a manner as to fairly and reasonably accomplish such purpose with the sole reference to the promotion of public interest. 
(k)  Performance bonds of bidders. A bond, with sufficient sureties, in such amount as shall be deemed adequate, not only to insure performance of contract in the time and manner prescribed in the contract, but also to save, indemnify, and keep harmless the city against all loss, damages, claims, liabilities, judgments, costs and expenses which may in anywise accrue against the city in consequence of the granting of the contract, or which may in anywise result therefrom, may be required of each bidder upon contracts involving accounts in excess of $30,000.00 when, in the opinion of the purchasing agent, the public interest will be served thereby. 
(l)  Competitive sealed proposals. 
(1)  If the city administrator determines in writing that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the city in a particular instance, a contract may be entered into by competitive sealed proposals. The purchasing agent may also provide by regulation that it is either not practicable or not advantageous to the city to procure specified types of supplies, services or construction by competitive sealed bidding. 
(2)  In the event a contract is to be entered into pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the following shall apply: 
a.  Proposals shall be solicited through a request for proposals. 
b.  Adequate public notice of the request for proposals shall be given in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the purchasing agent. 
c.  The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors. 
d.  Proposals shall be opened in a manner so as to avoid disclosure of contents thereof to competing offerors during the process of negotiations. 
e.  The award of any contract pursuant to a competitive sealed proposal in excess of $30,000.00 shall be made by the city council. 
(m)  Local preference in contract award. 
a.  For purchases in excess of $30,000.00: 
1.  If the lowest bidding local vendor is a responsible bidder; and 
2.  The lower responsible bidders are not local vendors; and 
3.

However, nothing in this section shall be deemed to close the record of a person or entity using a credit card held or issued in the name of the city or any record of a transaction made by a person using a credit card or other method of payment for which reimbursement is made by the city. 
(3)  All information obtained by the city regarding medical examinations, medical or psychiatric conditions, course of current or past medical or psychiatric treatment, substance abuse evaluation and treatment or laboratory testing of any nature whatsoever shall be collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files by the custodian of records and shall be treated as closed and confidential records by any employee having access to them, except that:

Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. No. 2863, adopted Feb. 1, 1988, repealed former §§ 2-72-2-77, pertaining to the office of city attorney and originating from Ord. No. 2287, §§ 2-7, adopted Feb. 6, 1978; and Ord. No. 2528, § 1, adopted Jan. 4, 1982. Section 2 of Ord. No. 2863 added new provisions as herein set out in §§ 2-72--2-77. 

Sec. 2-72. - Term of office; election; appointment. 
    The city attorney's position shall be divided into two positions: one position shall be called the city attorney; the other position shall be called the city counselor. 
(1)  The city attorney shall be elected at the-general city election held on April 5, 1988, and every two years thereafter. The qualified voters of the City of Boonville shall elect some suitable and competent person to the office of city attorney, and the person so elected shall hold office until his successor is duly elected and qualified. 
(2)  The city counselor(s) shall be appointed by the mayor with the approval of the council and shall serve at the pleasure of the mayor and city council. The incumbents will be on an independent contractor status and multiple individuals or firms may serve concurrently. 
(Ord. No. 2863, §§ 1, 2, 2-1-88; Ord. No. 4481, § 1, 8-20-18) 
Sec. 2-73. - Qualifications; conflicts of interest prohibited. 
    No person shall be eligible to hold the office of city attorney or city counselor unless he is a person licensed to practice law in Missouri. During the term of office for which he has been elected, the city attorney is prohibited from representing any party other than the city, the state, or any of its political subdivisions in any criminal proceeding or municipal ordinance violation case or proceeding in the 18th Judicial Circuit. Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the civil practice of law by the city attorney. Because the city counselor and city attorney are public officers of the city, neither shall engage in activities in which his personal or professional interests are or foreseeably could be in conflict with the professional duties and responsibilities of his office. While in office, neither the city counselor nor city attorney shall assume or undertake representation of any client other than the city if such representation will be directly adverse to the city or its interests. It shall be a conflict of interest for the city attorney to file any complaint in the municipal division of the Circuit Court of Cooper County against any person the attorney currently represents in a civil matter or where the attorney currently represents any victim of the alleged crime.

In the event the city attorney, on a fiscal year basis, would expend in excess of 180 hours of time in the performance of his or her duties, he or she may request that the city council award reasonable compensation for time spent in excess of 180 hours. The city council of the City of Boonville, in the exercise of reasonable discretion, shall determine what, if any, additional compensation is reasonable for the hours expended by the city attorney in excess of 180 hours per year.

If such appointment is not made as aforesaid, then it shall be the duty of the judge of the circuit court, municipal division, to appoint some competent attorney to represent the city in all cases before the circuit court, municipal division, pending such temporary inability of the city attorney to perform the duties of his office; and the person so appointed shall possess the same power and receive the same fee as the proper officer would if he were present.

Chapter 7.5 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT 
ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSES 

Sec. 7.5-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state has in RSMO 77.260 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the city council of the city ordains as follows: 
(Ord. No. 4254, § 1, 4-18-11) 
Sec. 7.5-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by: 
(1)  The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and 
(2)  The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps. 
(1)  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Cooper County dated May 3, 2011 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
(2)  Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
(3)  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
(4)  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
(5)  Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 4254, § 1, 4-18-11) 
Sec. 7.5-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in section 7.5-2(a); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this chapter to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard. 
(Ord. No. 4254, § 1, 4-18-11) 
Secs. 7.5-4-7.5-20. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 7.5-21. - Lands to which chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones, on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for Cooper County, Missouri on map panels 29053C0132C, 29053C0135C, 29053C0150C, 29053C0151C, 29053C0155C, and 29053C0175C, dated May 3, 2011 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this chapter, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in article IV. 
(Ord. No. 4254, § 1, 4-18-11) 
Sec. 7.5-22. - Floodplain administrator. 
    The city building inspector is hereby designated as the floodplain administrator under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4254, § 1, 4-18-11) 
Sec. 7.5-23. - Compliance. 
    No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 4254, § 1, 4-18-11) 
Sec. 7.5-24. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(Ord. No. 4254, § 1, 4-18-11) 
Sec. 7.5-25. - Interpretation. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 4254, § 1, 4-18-11) 
Sec. 7.5-26. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create a liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 4254, § 1, 4-18-11) 
Sec. 7.5-27. - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby. 
(Ord. No. 4254, § 1, 4-18-11) 
Secs. 7.5-28-7.5-40. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - ADMINISTRATION

In the case of newly opened food establishments, operation may continue until the first date available for such food service training. The supervisory food handler safety card shall be renewed every three years. 
(3)  Fundraising events, festivals and other community events. The training requirement will become effective on January 1, 2012 for organizations preparing or selling food for fundraising, festivals or other community events. This will allow the calendar year of 2011 to conduct outreach to these groups. Notification and education of the training requirement and schedule of training sessions will be disseminated by CCPHC and the city.

(3)  Give written notice of said hearing, either by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or if service cannot be had by either of those modes of service then, by publication in a newspaper qualified to publish legal notices, at least 21 days in advance of the hearing date, to the owner, occupant, mortgagee, lessee, agent and all other persons having an interest in said building as shown by the land records of the recorder of deeds of the county, who may appear before the city council on the date specified in the notice to show cause why the building should not be repaired, vacated or demolished in accordance with the statement of particulars set forth in the building inspector's notice as provided herein.

Provided, however, that abatement of solid waste charges for vacant units shall apply to the next succeeding billing cycle following the billing cycle in which notice of vacancy is received and shall continue in effect during periods of continuous vacancy. Provided further, that abatement of solid waste charges shall not be given on a pro-rata basis, and shall be available only for periods of vacancy which cover an entire billing cycle. 
(h)  Failure of an owner of multi-family dwellings or trailer courts to provide the information and notice required in subsection (f) above shall be unlawful and shall be punishable as provided in section 1-9 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(i)  Service charges for single-family dwellings which are unoccupied may be abated under the same terms, conditions, and process as set forth for multi-family dwellings in section 21-181(g). 
(j)  The system of services established by the provisions of this article is designed as an integral part of the city's program of health and sanitation, to be operated as an adjunct to the city's system for providing sewerage disposal. The city may enforce collection of such charges by bringing proper legal action against the occupant of any dwelling unit or owner of any commercial establishment to recover any sums due for such services, plus a reasonable attorney's fee to be fixed by the court, plus the cost of such action.

    The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95) 
Sec. 21-205. - City's right of revision. 
    The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements or grant variances of the local limits on discharges to the POTW. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95) 
Sec. 21-206. - Dilution. 
    No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement.

Secs. 21-207-21-220. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER 

Sec. 21-221. - Pretreatment facilities. 
    Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 21-201 of this article within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the superintendent before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95) 
Sec. 21-222. - Additional pretreatment measures. 
(a)  Whenever deemed necessary, the superintendent may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(c)  Oil, grease, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of oil and grease, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense. Users required to provide oil and grease interceptors shall retain and make available for inspection and copying, records of proper disposal of such substances. Records shall include date of removal, person(s) responsible for transportation and disposal of the substances, and receiving facility. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. 
(d)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95) 
Sec. 21-223. - Accidental discharge/slug control plans. 
    At least once every two years, the superintendent shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. Pursuant to 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vi), the superintendent may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the superintendent may develop such a plan for any user.

DIVISION 10. - ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES 

Sec. 21-321. - Notification of violation. 
    When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95) 
Sec. 21-322. - Consent orders. 
    The superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 21-324 and 21-325 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95)

    The superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 30 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95) 
Sec. 21-324. - Compliance orders. 
    When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95) 
Sec. 21-325. - Cease and desist orders. 
    When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95) 
Sec. 21-326. - Administrative fines. 
(a)  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(b)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of ten percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(c)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

Sec. 21-327. - Emergency suspensions. 
    The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 21-328 of this article are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 21-323 or 21-328 of this article. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95) 
Sec. 21-328. - Termination of discharge. 
    In addition to the provisions in section 21-256 of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:

Sec. 21-361. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95) 
Sec. 21-362. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
    A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 21-201(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in sections 21-201(b)(3) through (18) excluding (8) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 3255, § 1, 7-17-95) 
Sec. 21-363. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(2)  The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

Survey plats may be submitted and then accepting in lieu of final plats at the discretion of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 4059, § 2, 8-16-07) 
Section 3. - Subdivision design standards and requirements. 
3.1  Relation to adjoining street system. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining areas or their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided, insofar as the commission may deem the continuation of the existing street necessary for public requirements. Offset streets should be avoided but if unavoidable shall be offset by at least 125 feet. The angle of intersection between minor streets should not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle. Streets obviously in alignment with existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. All proposed street names shall be checked against duplication of other street names. The widths and locations of major streets shall conform to the widths and locations designated on the comprehensive plan and in conformance with the street specifications. Other design criteria including sight distances, medians, driveway spacing, traffic control and intersections shall conform to the access management manual. 
3.2  Design standards. 
a.  Street design standards. 
Design Subject Minimum Right-of-Way Width Minimum Pavement Width Maximum Grade (1) Major Streets: Arterials 80 feet 49 feet 5% Collectors 66 feet 38 feet 8% (2) Minor Streets: Residential 50 feet 32 feet 10% Industrial 60 feet 32 feet 6% Commercial 60 feet 32 feet 6% (3) Culs-de-sac (diameter) 100 feet 76 feet 6% (4) Frontage Roads 60 feet 32 feet 8% (5) Low Volume Residential 50 feet 28 feet 8% (Estate/Cul-de-sac streets with low volume traffic) (6) Alleys (nonresidential) 20 feet 16 feet 10% (7) Minimum radius of street intersections at a ninety-degree angle: Arterial streets 30 feet Collector streets 30 feet Minor streets 20 feet (8) Minimum sight distance on vertical curves: Arterial streets 250 feet Collector streets 200 feet Minor streets 150 feet (9) Maximum degree of centerline curvature: Arterial streets 7°-30' Collector streets 12°-30' Minor streets 57°-29' (10) Length of terminal streets requiring a cul-de-sac: Minimum 200 feet Maximum-Normal 750 feet Maximum-Special 1,600 feet*  
*In order to promote developments featuring large lot size, low density of traffic and units, privacy and retainage of natural features, the commission will consider, at a minimum, the following points in deciding whether or not to allow the length of a terminal street to exceed 750 feet as measured from the center of the cul-de-sac to the right-of-way of the nearest through street from which it derives. 
i.  Topography: When construction of a loop return street from the proposed terminus to an intersecting cross street would require building through terrain with steep slopes, ravines, bluffs or swamps so as to result in a cost greater than could be retrieved by the sale of the poor lots along its length. 
ii.  Lot size and arrangement: Size of lots exceed one acre and minimize the number of lots with rear lot lines abutting a neighbor's rear line. 
iii.  Configuration of development: Where the area to be developed of a given plat is such that the length is greater than the width by a minimum ratio of four to one. 
iv.  Phased development: When a developer decides to build and sell lots of a portion of a development in a series of phases, then any streets at the completion of a given phase, which may end temporarily as terminal streets, shall require a temporary cul de sac. 
b.  Lot and block design standards. 
(1) Maximum block length: Residential area 1,000 feet Industrial area 1,500 feet Commercial area 1,000 feet (2) Minimum block length: Residential area 400 feet Industrial area 400 feet Commercial area 300 feet (3) Preferred block length: Residential area 750 feet Industrial area 1,000 feet Commercial area 600 feet (4) Minimum lot depth 100 feet (5) Minimum easement width 10 feet  
3.3  Character of development. 
a.  The commission shall confer with the subdivider regarding the type and character of development that will be permitted in the subdivision and may agree with the subdivider as to certain minimum, restrictions to be placed upon the property. 
b.  Where the subdivision contains streets, sewers, sewage treatment plants, water supply systems, park areas, street trees or other physical facilities necessary or desirable for the welfare of the area and which are of common use or benefit and are not or cannot be satisfactorily maintained by an existing public agency, provision shall be made for the proper and continuous maintenance and supervision of such facility by a private or quasi-public agency, group or business. Such provision shall be made legally binding and shall be approved by both the city and other agency having jurisdiction over the location and improvement of such facilities. 
3.4  Parks, school sites, etc. Where an area being subdivided includes lands proposed to be used for parks or schools, under the duly adopted comprehensive plan of the city and environs, the subdivider shall not plat such lands as a part of the subdivision plat; and shall confer with the appropriate public agency regarding the time, method and amount of payment for the agency to acquire the land. If no agreement has been reached upon the acquisition of the area within two years from the date of the submission of the preliminary plan, the subdivider may then plat the balance of the area. 
3.5  Easements along streams. Whenever any stream or important surface drainage course is located in an area, which is being subdivided, the subdivider shall provide an adequate easement along each side of the stream for the purpose of maintaining, widening, deepening, sloping, improving, or protecting the stream or drainage course. 
3.6  Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of major streets. They shall be installed on at least one side of a minor street in residential districts as zoned by zoning ordinances of the city. The commission may also require sidewalks where, in its judgment, the public interest requires it. The sidewalk specifications provide drawings of standards giving dimensions, grades, and geometry of typical sidewalk and driveway details. 
a.  Refer to sidewalk specifications maintained by the director of public works and revised and adopted December 2008 and revised July 2011. 
b.  Sidewalks shall be placed within the street right-of-way and shall be generally aligned and parallel to the edge of the right-of-way. Curved sidewalks may be necessary to accommodate topography and will be considered on a case by case basis. Sidewalks will be shown on the final plat. 
3.7  Streets: Private. Private streets or roads are not favored and shall be permitted only when it is shown to the satisfaction of the commission and city council that no public interest would be served by a public street or road. Private streets shall be designated to allow for the necessary mobility of public service and safety vehicles. 
    In the event adjoining landowners of a private road request the city to accept dedication of the private road, the city shall not accept the public dedication until the private road is improved to meet current minimum street construction standards. Properties annexed having private roads would be grandfathered in although the owner would continue to be responsible for maintenance and repairs. If property is to be further developed in the future, the plan must be submitted, which may require higher road standards. 
(Ord. No. 4059, § 3, 8-16-07; Ord. No. 4262, § 2, 8-1-11) 
Section 4. - Preliminary plan.

(Ord. No. 4059, § 1, 8-16-07) 
Section 5. - Detail plans: Preparation, requirements, review and approval. 
5.1  Receipt of the signed copy of the preliminary plan is authorization for the subdivider to proceed with the preparation of the detailed plans and specifications for the improvements required by this section. Prior to the construction of any improvements or the acceptance by the city of any guarantee for their construction, the subdivider shall furnish the building inspector three copies of all plans, specifications and other information necessary to determine the precise location, form and method of construction of all required improvements. These plans shall include the drainage calculations used to design all drainage facilities. These plans shall be reviewed by the building inspector and by a licensed engineer designated by the city. The subdivider shall pay the cost of said engineering review, pursuant to the established fee schedule. The detail plans shall consider and conform to the following enumerated items and requirements: 
5.2  Permanent markers. Permanent and semi-permanent monuments conforming to the current "Missouri Standards for Property Boundary Surveys" shall be placed at all subdivision boundary corners where no existing monument was found, and placed at all new interior lot corners and right-of-way points of curvature. A linear and angular tie to a Boonville Mapping Control Station shall be shown on the final subdivision plat, (or the land surveyor may provide sufficient state plane coordinate data/ties on the final plat), to facilitate the proper location of the subdivision for future city mapping planning. A permanent benchmark relative to U.S.G.S. datum shall be placed within the subdivision and noted on the final improvement plans. 
5.3  Street improvements. All street and public ways shall be graded to their full width, including side slopes, and to the appropriate grade, and shall be surfaced in accordance with specification of the city, as set forth in the city's street specifications.

All final plats must dedicate a minimum of a ten-foot wide utility easement parallel and contiguous within the street right-of-way extending the full width of each and every lot located within the development. No utility lines shall run underneath any street pavement except where such lines are perpendicular to the centerline of the street. All utility lines shall be stubbed across the street prior to street paving, except where such requirement is impractical or unnecessary. 
5.8  Street lights. All subdividers or developers shall provide for reasonable street lighting on and along all publicly accepted streets. Subdividers and developers shall provide one light at each street intersection and a minimum of one light for every 400 feet of street frontage according to the current lighting wattage and bulb standards acceptable to the city's electric utility provider. 
5.9  Open spaces provided. All subdividers or developers shall provide for reasonable, adequate open space parks and recreational facilities as provided in the city's comprehensive and/or strategic plans. This provision shall be satisfied by any one or a combination of the following: 
a.  Dedication of open space land for public use; 
b.  Fee in lieu of dedication; 
c.  Development of parks and recreational facilities within the subdivision. The method selected must be approved by the park board, commission and by the city council prior to acceptance of the final subdivision plat. 
5.9.1  This provision applies to development of all residentially zoned lands in the City of Boonville including all subdivisions, lots, tracts and parcels. 
5.9.2  Neighborhood facilities, open space parks, and recreational facilities provided by this article shall be within or near the development area, intended to serve the needs created by such development. 
5.9.3  The city council after first receiving a recommendation from the commission shall have final determination as to the acceptability of dedicated lands, or fee-in-lieu or combination as appropriate to meet the requirements of this article and no building permits shall be issued until provisions of this article are satisfied. 
5.10  Dedications. If dedication of land is selected, the dedication shall be by deed or plat, the amount of dedication required shall be controlled by the zoning character of the land being developed and shall correspond to the density of the subdivision, and shall not be less than provided in the schedule of dedication. 
5.10.1  Schedule of dedication (minimum requirement): 
Zoning Minimum Size Development Amount of Dedication R-1 100 Acres 2.0% R-2 67 Acres 3.0% R-3 50 Acres 4.0%  
5.10.2  The above-required open space shall be in addition to minimum required yard areas and space reserved for off-street parking in zoning ordinance. The percentage figures of dedicated space shall be based upon gross area on the development or subdivision. 
All lands to be dedicated shall meet the following general requirements. 
a.  Size: The minimum size dedication shall be two acres. Developments under this minimum will pay a fee-in-lieu of dedication. 
b.  Location and accessibility: Should be located in or adjacent to subdivision or area to be served and easily accessible to it. 
c.  Topography-drainage: Should consist of 50 percent minimum area within a grade less than four percent; balance may be covered with steep slopes, streams, ditches, lakes, or other natural features, provided however that waivers to this requirement may be granted by the city council to preserve natural features as described in paragraph 12, if such natural features can be utilized as part of the recreational area. 
5.10.3  Any subdivision plat containing suitable facilities to be reserved, constructed and maintained by a homeowners' association or other like legally formed entity to serve the needs of the subdivision being created may satisfy the requirements of this chapter, provided they fulfill the area and suitability of this article, provide for ongoing maintenance in the event of dissolution of the association or entity and are approved by the park board, commission, and city council. 
5.11  Fee-in-lieu of land dedication. When a subdivision is prohibited from dedication of land due to gross area being less than minimum size development for dedication or due to the proximity to existing recreational facilities, a fee-in-lieu is required. The amount of such fee is determined by multiplying the area that would otherwise be required for dedication by the following fee schedule: 
5.11.1  Fee-in-lieu of dedication schedule. 
Zoning Fee per acre* R-1 $20,000.00 R-2 $22,500.00 R-3 $25,000.00  
*Fractional parts are prorated. 
5.11.2  Fee-in-lieu shall be paid on an acreage basis at the time of final plat presentation (terms may be arranged if approved by the city council). No building permit shall be issued until the city receives requirements of dedication and/or fees. 
5.11.3  The city council shall periodically, or upon the request of either the commission or the park board, review and revise the fee-in-lieu of dedication schedule in keeping which current fair market values, relative to the initial schedule at the time of adoption of this article. 
5.11.4  All fee-in-lieu payments shall be deposited in the special park development account established on the books by the city and such funds may be used only for the purchase and development of park and recreational areas. The park board will plan and recommend such purchases to the city council for approval. 
5.12  Resubdividing. Any lands resubdividing after passage of this article shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter except any lands or fee-in-lieu grants previously paid on same lands will receive credit; however, in no instance will lands so dedicated to or fees received by the city be returned or refunded to developers or subdividers. Lot line changes by owners of contiguous lots must meet all setbacks and must file legal descriptions that reference the plat with the Cooper County Recorder. 
5.13  Watercourses. Where a subdivision is transversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided utility easements and drainage rights-of-way, conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourses or drainage rights-of-way of sufficient width to permit maintenance and future expansion reasonably anticipated. When, in the opinion of the city engineer, such watercourse contains obstructions that significantly lessen the capacity of the watercourse, such obstructions shall be removed as a part of the required public improvements. 
5.14  Natural features. Natural features such as trees, brooks, hilltops, and views, shall be preserved whenever possible. The subdivider shall designate or show at the time of filing his final plat those trees, and other natural features which are to be retained. Artificial and natural lakes and wooded areas are to be preserved, and encouraged as much as possible. 
5.15  If, upon completion of the review, the plans are found in conformance with all applicable ordinances and city standards, and with generally accepted standards of engineering design, the building inspector shall notify the subdivider of the approval of the plans. If the plans are found not to be in conformance, the building inspector shall notify the subdivider in writing of all differences. Approval of the plans for the construction of all required improvements is authorization for the subdivider to proceed with the preparation of the final plat. No final plat or official plat of any subdivision shall be approved, considered for approval nor shall any building permit be issued unless the required improvements are guaranteed using at least one or more of the following techniques: 
a.  The improvements have been installed prior to such approval; 
b.  The subdivider files with the city council an escrow secured with cash, or escrow secured with an irrevocable letter of credit or a surety bond, provided that a surety bonding company with a bond rating reasonably acceptable to the city must issue the surety bond and be otherwise reasonably acceptable to the city; 
c.  The escrow or bond shall provide for and secure the actual construction and installation of the improvements and utilities within a period specified by the city council expressed in the escrow or bond, not to exceed three years. The city council may enforce the escrow or bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies, but shall release it within 30 days of the completion of each improvement being completed. No such bond shall be accepted unless it is enforceable by or payable to the city in a sum at least equal to the cost of constructing the improvements as estimated by the building inspector and in form with surety and conditions approved by the city counselor; 
d.  A special assessment district is established with annual assessments sufficient to repay a special assessment bond or other instrument used to finance construction of the improvements. Special assessments may be used to finance not more than 50 percent of the total cost of all improvements and may be used only if approval is given by the commission and the city council; or 
e.  The subdivider files with the city council a personal bond with security, conditioned to secure the construction of the improvements listed below in a satisfactory manner and with a period specified by the city council, such period not to exceed three years. Such bond shall be enforceable by or payable to the city in a sum at least equal to the cost of constructing the improvements as estimated by the building inspector. Such bond shall be acceptable only if the security, form and conditions of the bond are acceptable to the city council. 
5.16  If a developer who has posted an escrow or bond with the city transfers title of the subdivision property prior to full release of the escrow or bond, the city will accept a replacement escrow from the successor developer in a form herein specified in the amount of the escrow or bond held by the city at the time of the property transfer, and upon receipt of the replacement escrow, the city shall release the original escrow or bond in full and release the prior developer from all further obligations with respect to the subdivision improvements. 
5.17  No building shall be occupied unless an occupancy permit has been issued. No occupancy permit shall be issued until all improvements have been constructed, inspected by the building inspector and accepted by the city, and until "as built" drawings have been prepared and filed with the director of public works excepting that if a developer has filed a guarantee, as delineated in this section, with the city for all public improvements to be constructed, the city may, at its option, accept portions of a subdivision by road station points if all improvements in that section are constructed to city specifications. 
5.18  The owner of a tract may prepare and secure approval of a preliminary subdivision plan of an entire area and may install the above improvements only in a portion of such area, but the improvements must be installed at any portion of the area for which a final plat is approved for recording; provided, however, that trunk sewers and any sewage treatment plants shall be designed and built in such a manner that they can easily be expanded or extended to serve the entire area.

Section 2.100. - Action by the City Council conditions and restrictions. 
(a)  The City Council shall approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve all preliminary and final site plans. In approving preliminary or final site plan applications, the City Council, after recommendation from the Planning Commission, may vary the standards set forth in the Zoning Ordinance, provided the general intent of the ordinance is carried out. The City Council shall use the requirements and standards found in the base zoning district as a guide and may permit adjustments from these requirements and standards in the interest of efficient land development and utilization if it is deemed that other amenities or conditions will be gained to the extent that an equal or higher quality development is produced. However, use regulations shall not be varied so as to make them less restrictive. Any part of a structure over the maximum allowable height of the base district shall be set back from property lines one additional foot for each additional foot in height. 
    The requirements of Sections 2.95(c), (d), (e), and (f) may be varied by the City Council if the Council determines that the development complies with the intent of the section. The purpose of such variation is to allow for a variety of architectural designs and innovative site planning that is compatible with the site's existing physical features and surrounding uses. The following guidelines shall be used in said determinations: 
(1)  Site planning: 
a.  All desirable site features such as healthy existing trees, views, and water should be incorporated in the site plan. 
b.  The relationship of the site design to surrounding uses, including setbacks, building heights, parking, open spaces and drives should be considered. 
(2)  Architectural design: 
a.  The project design should take into account surrounding uses, building materials, style and size. 
b.  The building should relate to the site on which they are located taking advantage of all desirable site features. 
c.  Unreasonable continuous and unbroken wall planes should be avoided. 
d.  Architectural elements or features that create a variety of scale relationships should be included. 
e.  Architectural elements or details that are sympathetic to structure on adjoining properties should be included. 
(b)  In its review and approval of preliminary and final site plan applications, the Planning Commission may increase the minimum requirements designated in the applicable sections of the zoning code based upon their review of the individual site's topography, the building's orientation in relationship to street right-of-ways and adjoining properties, the building materials used, and the mass and height of the building. The purpose of such increases in the minimum requirements is to minimize any adverse impacts of the proposed development on adjoining or nearby properties and the general community. 
(c)  If the Planning Commission imposes conditions or restrictions on a preliminary site plan, it shall designate specific requirements which must be met before an applicant may submit a final site plan application. If the Commission imposes conditions or restrictions on a final site plan, it shall designate specific requirements which must be met before issuance of a building permit. The Planning Commission may delegate to the Building Inspector and/or City Administrator, the authority to determine whether the specifically prescribed conditions have been met by the applicant.

A front yard line is a line parallel to the street and as far back from the street as required in this ordinance. The terms "front yard line" and "building line" are synonymous. 
(c)  A rear yard is the area from one side lot line to the other side lot line and from the rear line of the building nearest the rear lot line extended and the rear lot line. The rear yard is always on the opposite end of the lot from the front yard. 
(d)  A side yard is the area situated between the building and the side line of the line of the lot extending through the front yard line to the rear yard line. Any line not a rear line or a front line shall be deemed a side line. 
(e)  On corner lots (lots abutting on two or more streets at their intersection) the front yard shall face the shortest street dimension of the lot except that if the lot is square or almost square, i.e., has dimensions in a ratio of from 3:2 to 3:3, then the front yard may face either street. 
(f)  Lot width means the horizontal distance between the side lines of the lot measured at right angles to the depth. Buildable width is the width of lot left to be built upon after the side yards are provided. 
(g)  Frontage means the distance along a street line from one intersecting street to another or from one intersecting street to the end of a dead-end street. Lot frontage is the width of a lot measured along a street.

Section 7.7. - Telecommunications towers. 
(a)  Purposes: 
(1)  The general purpose of this section is to regulate the placement, construction and modification of telecommunications towers, support structures, and antennae in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in Boonville. Specifically, this Section is intended: 
a.  To provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of Boonville. 
b.  To minimize adverse visual impacts of communications antennae and support structure through the careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
c.  To maximize the use of existing and new support structures so as to minimize the need to construct new or additional facilities; 
d.  To promote and encourage shared use of towers and antennae support structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; 
e.  To ensure that any new telecommunications tower or structure is located in an area compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible; and that hazards to the safety of the public and to adjacent property are eliminated or minimized. 
f.  To ensure that regulation of telecommunications towers and structures does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service. 
g.  To eliminate the uncontrolled proliferation of towers in the City of Boonville which could diminish property values and spoil the aesthetic value of the city. 
(b)  Legislative findings. 
(1)  On February 9, 1996, Congress enacted the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 P.L. No. 104-458. The purpose of the Act included deregulation of the telecommunications industry and providing a more competitive environment for wired and wireless telecommunication services in the United States. 
(2)  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 preserves the authority of the City to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of towers and antennae support structures and to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
(3)  The City has been granted the authority to enact legislation to regulate the construction, placements, and operation of Telecommunications towers and antennae pursuant to its zoning powers established in Chapter 89 RSMo. And additionally pursuant to its general and specific police powers established by statute authorizing the regulations herein to protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
(4)  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has exclusive jurisdiction over (1) regulation of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions from telecommunications facilities, and (2) the regulation of radio signal interference among users of the radio frequency spectrum. 
(5)  Consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the regulations of this section will not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and do not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service. The regulations also impose reasonable restrictions to protect the public safety and welfare and ensure opportunities for placement of antennae with prompt approval by the city. The section does not attempt to regulate in areas within the exclusive jurisdiction of the FCC. 
(c)  Applicability. 
(1)  All towers, antennae support structures and telecommunications facilities, any portion of which are located within the City of Boonville, are subject to this section. All towers within the City of Boonville, Missouri, at the time of passage of this section shall be registered with the City Administrator within 60 days from the effective date hereof together, with the height, width and location thereof.

(4)  Security: All antennae and support structures shall be protected from unauthorized access by appropriate security measures. A description of proposed security measures shall be provided as part of any application to install, build or modify antennae or support structures. Additional measures may be required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit or administrative permit as deemed necessary by the City Administrator or Planning and Zoning Commission in the case of a conditional use permit. 
(5)  Lighting. Antennae and support structures shall not be lighted unless required by the FAA or other state or federal agency with authority to regulate, in which case a description of the required lighting scheme will be made a part of the application to install, build or modify the antenna or support structure. Equipment cabinets and shelters may have lighting only as approved by the City Administrator on the approved site development plan. 
(6)  Advertising. Unless a disguised antenna support structure in the form of an otherwise lawfully permitted pylon sign, the placement of advertising on structures regulated by this section is prohibited. 
(f)  Design criteria and siting requirements. 
(1)  Towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to the requirement of the FAA or any applicable state or federal agency, be painted a neutral color consistent with the natural or built environment of the site. 
(2)  Equipment shelters or cabinets shall have an exterior finish compatible with the natural or built environment of the site and shall also comply with any design guidelines as may be applicable to the particular zoning district in which the facility is located. 
(3)  Towers shall not exceed the height limitation of 150 feet or the height limitation of any airport overlay zone as may be adopted by the city. 
(4)  Antennae attached to a building or disguised antenna support structure shall be of a color identical to or closely compatible with the surface to which they are mounted. 
(5)  All towers shall be set back from all yard lines at least one foot for each foot of height unless an easement is given by the adjoining property owner. Set back requirements for towers shall be measured from the base of the tower to the property line of the parcel on which it is located. 
(6)  Ground anchors of all guyed towers, if permitted, shall be located on the same parcel as the tower and meet the setbacks of the applicable zoning district unless an easement is given by the adjoining property owner. 
(7)  All towers shall be separated from all residential units by a minimum distance of 300 feet as measured from the center of the tower to the closest point of the residential unit. (Residential units include modular and mobile homes used for living purposes). 
(8)  Fences with lockable gates must be constructed around or upon parcels containing towers or telecommunication facilities. Fencing shall be of such a size and style as to protect these facilities from trespass or unauthorized use of the property. 
(9)  Any new tower in excess of 60 feet above AGL shall be constructed to twice the capacity of its primary use in order that secondary users might lease the balance of the tower capacity. The design of the tower compound shall maximize use of building materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that effectively blend the tower facilities within the surrounding natural setting and built environment. 
(10)  Vehicle storage on any tower site is prohibited. Outdoor storage is prohibited except to the extent that the stored materials are used in the normal course of business and the stock is regularly rotated.

On site parking for periodic service and maintenance is approved and should be provided. 
(11)  All towers including their foundations and supports must be designed and certified by an engineer to be structurally sound and, at minimum, in conformance with the city's building code, any applicable state and federal laws, and other standards outlined in the Code. A building permit must be obtained before construction may begin. 
(g)  Shared use. 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of any permit to alter or modify any tower existing on the effective date of this section, the applicant shall provide to the city a written and notarized agreement committing to make said tower available for use by others subject to reasonable technical limitations and reasonable financial terms. The willful and knowing failure of a tower applicant to agree to shared use or to negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same applicant to install, build or modify antennae or towers within the city. 
(2)  Prior to the issuance of any permit to install, build or modify any tower, the tower applicant shall furnish the City Administrator an inventory of all of that applicant's towers in or within one-half mile of the city limits of Boonville. The inventory shall include the tower's reference name or number, the street location, latitude and longitude, structure type, height, type and mounting height of existing antennae and an assessment of available ground space for the placement of additional equipment shelters. 
(3)  Any new tower approved at a height of 60 feet or higher (above AGL) shall be designed and constructed to accommodate additional users. (Ref. 7.7(f)(9)). A written agreement committing to shared use as required by Section 7.7(g)(1) shall be submitted by the tower applicant. The willful and knowing failure of the applicant for a tower built for shared use to negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same applicant to install, build or modify antennae or towers within the City. 
(4)  Any permittee whose tower heights in excess of 60 feet (above AGL) which is constructed after the effective date of this section and which has been built in accordance with setbacks and special conditions granted to towers with shared use capabilities under this article, and which contains additional capacity for installation or shared use of telecommunications facilities as demonstrated at the time the application for construction was granted, shall agree to allow another person to install or share telecommunications facilities on such a tower subject to reasonable terms and conditions negotiated between the parties including the suitability of the proposed tenant, the credit record and technical abilities of the proposed tenant. For the purpose of shared use of antennae, a legal non-conforming tower may be used. However, in no event shall a permittee be required to allow shared use of facilities if to do so would result in technical interference with the delivery of permittee's service. Failure to permit shared use on a tower which has been built in accordance with setbacks and special conditions permitted for towers designed for shared use may result in any enforcement action, as permitted in Section 7.7(i) or 7.7(p) following a hearing as permitted in Section 7.7(i) hereof. 
(5)  Any person seeking shared use of a tower subject to this provision shall, after filing an application, negotiate with the owner/operator for such use. The owner/operator may on a legitimate and reasonable business basis choose between multiple requests for shared use on the same tower or structure, and may reject any request where legitimate technical obstacles cannot be reasonable overcome or where the person requesting shared use will not agree to reasonable financial terms. Any person believing that the owner/operator has breached its duty to negotiate in good faith for shared use shall immediately notify the owner/operator and the City Administrator in writing. The City Administrator may reject the application upon a finding that shared use has been improperly denied. A notice of breach of duty shall explain the precise basis for the claim and shall be accompanied by payment of an administrative review fee of $500.00 to the city to offset the cost of review. After the owner/operator's receipt of the notice, the owner/operator shall have ten calendar days to provide a written submission to the City Administrator responding to the alleged violation of the shared use requirement. If deemed necessary by the City Administrator, he/she may engage, at the cost of the person alleging the violation, a neutral, qualified technical consultant to provide an opinion on feasibility or costs of the shared use request. 
(h)  Uses allowed without a permit. 
(1)  The attachment of additional or replacement of antennae or shelters to any tower existing on the effective date of this section or subsequently approved in accordance with these regulations, provided that additional equipment shelters or cabinets are located within the existing tower compound area. 
(2)  The mounting of antennae on any existing building or structure such as a water tower, provided that the presence of the antennae is concealed by architectural elements or satisfactorily camouflaged by painting them a color identical to the surface to which they are attached. 
(3)  The installation of antennae or the construction of a tower or support structure on buildings or land owned by the City, following the approval of a lease agreement by the Council. 
(i)  Authorization by administrative permit. 
(1)  The placement as follows of antennae and towers are permitted in designated zoning districts only by administrative permit approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and issued by the City Building Inspector. 
a.  The attachment of additional or replacement antennae or shelters to any tower existing on the effective date of this section or subsequently approved in accordance with these regulations, but only when such addition or replacement requires the enlargement of the existing tower compound area as long as all other requirements of this section and the underlying zoning district are met. 
b.  The one-time replacement of any tower existing on the effective date of this section or subsequently approved in accordance with these regulations so long as the purpose of the replacement is to accommodate shared use of the site or to eliminate a safety hazard. The new tower shall be of the same type as the original except that a guyed or self-supporting (lattice) tower may be replaced by a monopole. If the guyed or lattice tower to be replaced is 180 feet or less in height, it shall only be replaced with a monopole. The height of the new tower may exceed that of the original by not more than 20 feet. Subsequent replacements shall require the approval of a conditional use permit. 
c.  Towers erected and maintained for a period not to exceed 30 days for the purpose of replacing an existing tower, testing an existing or proposed network, or special events requiring mobile towers. 
(2)  Application procedures and requirements. 
a.  Applications for administrative permit shall be made on the appropriate forms, to the City Administrator, accompanied by a fee of $200.00 with the following submittals: 
b.  A detailed site plan, based on a closed boundary survey of the host parcel, shall be submitted indicating all existing and proposed improvements including buildings, drives, walkway, parking areas and other structures, public rights-of-way, the zoning categories of the subject and adjoining properties, the location of and distance to off-site residential structures, required setbacks, required buffer and landscape areas, hydrologic features, and the coordinates and heights above AGL of the existing or proposed tower. 
c.  For antennae mounted on existing structures, a report by an engineer certified in the State of Missouri qualifying the integrity of the structure and its ability to support the antennae and any associated equipment.

b.  The City Administrator shall issue a decision on the permit within 45 days of the date of application or the application shall be deemed approved. The City Administrator may deny the application or approve the application as submitted or with such modifications as are, in his/her judgement, reasonably necessary to protect the safety or general welfare of the city citizens consistent with the purposes of this section. The City Administrator may consider the purposes of this section and the factors established herein for granting a conditional use permit as well as any other considerations consistent with this section. A decision to deny an application shall be made in writing, and state the specific reasons for the denial. 
c.  Appeals. Any applicant who is denied a tower application, or who is determined by the City Administrator to be in violation of this section shall have the right to appeal the decision before the Planning and Zoning Commission. At the request of the applicant, an informal hearing shall be set on the agenda at the next regular Planning and Zoning Commission meeting following the denial of an application, or the determination of a violation and shall consider, in addition to a determination of whether or not a violation exists or the application was improperly denied, the question of the technical or economic feasibility of compliance with this section. In the event the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that an existing tower was constructed in accordance with setback and other provisions relating to towers designed for shared use, and said tower is not made available for shared use as indicated at the time of application, the Planning and Zoning Commission may suspend or revoke the permit. Final decisions of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to Chapter 536, RSMo. 
(j)  Conditional use permit required. 
(1)  All proposals to install, build or modify an antenna or support structure not permitted by sections 7.7(h) or 7.7(i) above, shall require the approval of a conditional use permit following a duly advertised public hearing by the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
a.  Applications for conditional use permits shall be filed and processed subject to and in the manner as established in Appendix "C" of the General Code of Ordinances. A decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be accompanied by substantial evidence supporting the decision which shall be made a part of the written record of the meeting at which a final decision on the application is rendered. Evidence may be submitted with the application or thereafter or presented during the public hearing by the applicant or others. 
(2)  Additional minimum requirements. No conditional use permit shall be issued unless the applicant has clearly demonstrated by substantive evidence that placement of an antenna or structure pursuant to Subsection 7.7(h) (Permitted Uses) or Subsection 7.7(i) (Administrative Permits) of this section is not technologically or economically feasible. The Planning and Zoning Commission may consider current or emerging industry standards and practices, among other information, in determining feasibility. 
(3)  Findings required. In addition to the determinations or limitations specified herein for the consideration of conditional use permits, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall also base its decision upon, and shall make findings as to, the existence of the following conditions: 
a.  No existing towers, structures or buildings within the necessary geographic area for the applicant's tower meet the applicant's necessary engineering requirements considering: (1) height; (2) structural strength; (3) resulting signal interference; (4) feasibility of retrofitting; (5) feasibility of redesigning the applicant's tower network; or (6) other limiting conditions that render existing towers, structures or buildings within the applicant's required geographic area unsuitable. 
b.  That the design of the tower or structure, including the antenna, shelter and ground layout maximally reduces visual degradation and otherwise complies with provisions and intent of this section. New towers shall be of a monopole design, unless it is shown that an alternative design would equally or better satisfy this provision. 
c.  That the proposal minimizes the number and/or size of towers or structures that will be required in the area. 
d.  That the applicant has not previously failed to take advantage of reasonably available shared use opportunities or procedures provided by this section or otherwise. 
(4)  If any one, but not more than one, of the first four determinations is not satisfied, approval may be granted only on finding of unique circumstances otherwise necessitating approval to satisfy the purposes of this section. 
(5)  Additional Limitations. No tower shall be approved at a height exceeding 150 feet AGL unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that such height is required for the proper function of the applicant's system or that of a public safety communications system of a governmental entity sharing the tower. Such showing must also be supported by the opinion of a telecommunications consultant hired by the city at the expense of the applicant. The opinion of the consultant shall include a statement that no available alternatives exist to exceeding the height limit or the reason why such alternatives are not viable. 
(k)  Permit compliance. 
(1)  Inspections. By applying for a permit to install, build or modify an antenna or support structure, an applicant grants the city authority to enter onto its property to inspect the tower for the purpose of determining whether it complies with the applicable state law and all other construction standards provided by the code, federal and state law. The city reserves the right to conduct such inspection at any time. 
(2)  Annual filing requirement. An applicant or owner/operator shall certify in writing that its tower is structurally sound and conforms to the requirements of the applicable state law and all other construction standards set forth by the City Code, federal and state law every year by filing by January 1st of every year following the date of the grant of its permit a sworn statement by the owner/operator or his representative to that effect. All applicants with permits or owner/operators of towers in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance shall submit a statement not later than 60 days from the effective date and by January 1st of every year thereafter that said tower is free from hazards and that the tower does not pose an imminent threat to the surrounding area or pubic health and safety. Together with this statement, every applicant or owner shall provide a certificate of liability insurance for no less than $300,000.00 coverage for injury to persons or property as a result of any tower failure or malfunction or defect. All applicants or owner/operators shall list the city as a party who must be notified should this insurance be cancelled or discontinued for any reason 30 days before the expiration of coverage.

PART 15. - GENERAL LANDSCAPING, SCREENING/BUFFERING AND PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING STANDARDS 

Section 15.1. - Purpose. 
    The purposes of the general landscaping, screening/buffering and parking lot standards are: 
(1)  To provide visual separation of more intensive uses from less intensive uses; 
(2)  To preserve and enhance property values by ensuring that yards, open spaces, and parking lots are constructed and maintained with plants and landscape materials; 
(3)  To preserve and incorporate naturally occurring open space and forested areas in development plans to manage stormwater runoff; 
(4)  To establish standards to protect and enhance community appearance with the installation of appropriate landscaping and screening materials within the city; 
(5)  To encourage prudent and skilled workmanship for the installation and maintenance of all plant materials; 
(6)  To provide flexibility in the provision of required landscape materials and designs; and 
(7)  To improve air quality, to reduce heat and glare and to add to the aesthetic quality of parking lots. Trees appreciably reduce the dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air, are proven producers of oxygen, and play a vital role, through transpiration and otherwise, in purifying the air we breathe. Trees are valuable physical and aesthetic community assets in that they provide cooling shade, reduce noise levels and glare, and break the monotony of large parking areas and other human developments. A variety of species of trees and shrubs is encouraged to reduce the impact of potential disease or insect infestations and to provide variety in shape, texture and seasonal color. 
(Ord. No. 4140, § 1(Exh. A), 1-5-09) 
Section 15.2. - Definitions. 
(1)  ANSI A300 Pruning Standard. With the American National Standard for Pruning, ANSI A300, specifications can be written in a virtual infinite number of combinations. The following information is designed to help you understand exactly what will be accomplished in a pruning operation. 
Branch Size- A minimum or maximum diameter size of branches to be removed should be specified in all pruning operations. This established how much pruning is to be done. 
Pruning objectives- 
  Hazard reduction pruning (HRP)- Is recommended when the primary objective is to reduce the danger to a specific target caused by visibly defined hazards in a tree. For example, HRP may be the primary objective if a tree has many dead limbs over a park bench. 
  Maintenance pruning (MP)- Is recommended when the primary objective is to maintain or improve tree health and structure, and includes hazard reduction pruning. An example here might be able to perform an MP operation on a front yard tree. 
Pruning types- Hazard reduction pruning and maintenance pruning should consist of one or more of the pruning types noted below: 
  Crown cleaning- The selective removal of one or more of the following items: dead, dying or diseased branches, weak branches and waterspouts. 
  Crown thinning- The selective removal of branches to increase light penetration, air movement and to reduce weight. 
  Crown raising- The removal of the lower branches to provide clearance. 
  Crown reduction or shaping- Decrease the height and/or spread of a tree. Consideration should be given to the ability of the species to sustain this type of pruning. 
  Vista pruning- The selective thinning of framework limbs or specific areas of the crown to allow a view of an object from predetermined spot. 
  Crown restoration- Should improve the structure, form and appearance of trees which have been severely headed, vandalized or storm damaged.

Synonym: Buffer strip, buffer zone, roadside zone, roadside strip, waterfront zone. See "riparian zone". 
(b)  GIS-A zone of a specified distance around features 
Note 1: Both constant and variable width buffers can be generated for a set of features based on each feature's attribute values; the resulting buffer zones form polygons that are areas either inside or outside the specified buffer distance from each feature. 
Note 2: Buffers are useful for proximity analysis, e.g., to find all stream segments within 300 feet of a proposed logging area. 
(c)  An area maintained around an experimental or sample plot to ensure that the latter is not affected by any treatment applied to the area outside them both. Synonym: Isolation strip. 
(d)  Wildlife management habitat that reduces dangers of having sharply contrasting edges of a harvest area next to protected habitat.

(5)  Hedge. A row of closely planted shrubs or low-growing trees forming a fence or boundary. 
(6)  Landscape plan. The plans will display and designate: 
(a)  North point and scale; 
(b)  Topographic information and final grading adequate to identify and properly specify planting for areas needing slope protection; 
(c)  The location, size and surface of materials of all structures and parking areas; 
(d)  The location, size and type of all above ground and underground utilities and structures within property notation, where appropriate, as to any safety hazards to avoid during landscape installation;

(Ord. No. 4140, § 1(Exh. A), 1-5-09) 
Section 15.5. - Parking lot landscaping. 
1.  Applicability: Landscape plantings shall be installed on any parking lots containing more than ten spaces. 
2.  Plan/plan review: A preliminary landscaping plan for parking lot landscaping shall accompany the preliminary site plan and contain the general description of the proposed landscaping. The final landscaping plan shall accompany the final site plan and contain all the detail to comply with the standards set forth in this Code for review and recommendation by the planning and zoning commission and review and approval by the city council. 
3.  Requirements: 
a.  Plantings may be in the public right-of-way adjacent to the parking lot; however, care should be given not to plant large species or to plant under, on or around utility easements and permission must be obtained from the utility prior to plan approval. 
b.  Plantings shall consist of the number of standard canopy trees needed to shade at least 35 percent of the parking lot when the trees are mature, however, plantings should not adversely affect traffic flow, traffic sight distance, or other traffic safety issues within the parking lot or at the points of ingress and egress. 
c.  All landscaped areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by curbing or anchored wheel stops. Planting islands shall be at least four feet wide and 100 square feet to protect trees and vegetation from bumper overhang and swinging doors. Plantings shall be located to minimize damage caused by car doors and bumpers. 
d.  Areas between trees shall be covered with shrubs, grass or other living groundcover or nonliving groundcover. 
e.  No parking area shall contain more than 150 spaces. If a greater number is required, separate parking spaces of not more than 150 spaces shall be provided and shall be separated by a landscaped area at least ten feet in width. The use of berms and evergreen trees in the landscaped strip is encouraged but not mandated. Up to ten percent of the length of the strip may be opened to permit pedestrian and vehicular access between parking areas. In these large parking lot areas, the amount of shade provided by mature parking lot trees may be reduced to 25 percent in cases where the landscape plan makes effective use of berms, landscape strips or landscaped areas within the interior of the parking lot. A minimum of three different species of trees is required in large parking lots to reduce the impact of potential disease or insect infestations and to provide variety in shape, texture and color. 
f.  Plantings shall be installed in accordance with the plan approved and in accordance with the standards of the Urban and Community Forestry Division of the Missouri Department of Conservation. 
g.  All plants shall be maintained in a healthy condition in accordance with generally accepted professional horticultural and arboricultural standards and practices such as recommended in ANSI Standard A-300. Plants which die or are unhealthy shall be replaced. Regular pruning and trimming shall be applied to maintain health and to permit the plants to achieve their intended form and height.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4119, § 1(Exh. A), adopted June 16, 2008, amended App. E in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former App. E, §§ 1-18, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 3878, § 1, 11-4-02; Ord. No. 4083, § 1, 1-7-08. 

Section I. - Foreword. 
    This manual has been prepared to present the criteria to be used in the city for the design of facilities to control storm runoff. 
    It is intended that this design manual will be applied to areas of new development, and also provide guidance for the construction and reconstruction of storm drains in areas previously developed. 
    The standards in the design manual are to be followed at all times unless the developer or his engineer can show significant financial savings in providing alternative facilities which still fulfill the intended requirements and intents of the design manual. The circumstances and reason for any change and the proposed alternative shall be set forth in writing for consideration by the city engineer. 
    It is realized that standards and specifications must be flexible and adaptable to new design procedures, materials, equipment, and methods of construction in order to provide the best facilities for health and safety in the most economical manner. Thus, it is intended that the design manual be updated periodically. Users should check to ensure that they have the most recent edition. It is important that users should also consult the most recent city ordinances and regulations that might include references to storm drainage. 
(Ord. No. 4119, § 1(Exh. A), 6-16-08) 
Section II. - Hydrology. 
RUNOFF RATE COMPUTATION. 
    Storm drainage facilities for residential subdivisions and small commercial or industrial developments with watersheds less than 200 acres shall be designed on the basis of discharges calculated by the rational formula. In calculations for stormwater detention or retention basins the following computer implementations of the unit hydrograph are acceptable. 
a.  SCS Technical Release No. 55, "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds" 2 nd Edition, June 1986 
b.  SCS Technical Release No. 20, "Project Formulation Hydrology" 2 nd Edition, May 1983 
RATIONAL FORMULA. 
    The Rational Formula is expressed as: 
Q = CiA, where: 
Q = Peak runoff rate in cubic feet per second (cfs). 
C = Runoff coefficient which expresses the ratio of peak runoff to rainfall and which is dependent upon the pervious characteristics of the surface receiving the rainfall. 
i = Rainfall intensity in inches per hour for a duration equal to the time of concentration. 
A = Tributary area in acres. 
DRAINAGE AREA. 
    The area, A, is the only parameter in the rational formula which is subject to accurate determination and represents the total area tributary to any point under consideration for which runoff is being determined. Since runoff is subject to various characteristics of the area, investigation of the drainage area should include a compilation of principal factors, which may affect runoff. These factors include land use, areas of impervious and pervious surfaces, character of soil and vegetation cover, and the general magnitude of ground slopes. A current topographic map with contours should be obtained for use in drainage area calculations. All upstream tributary areas are to be considered as fully developed as zoned at the time of design or as shown in the city's comprehensive plan, whichever is greater. The city may require that storm drainage systems for tributary areas upstream of existing storm drainage facilities include on-site stormwater detention facilities limiting the peak discharge to that which would have occurred for the existing land use type prior to a zoning change or prior to changes in development of the area. The city may waive requirements for detention facilities when the owner and/or the developer make satisfactory arrangements to improve or provide a downstream drainage system of adequate hydraulic capacity for peak rates of discharge to the system, including discharge from the owner's site, to a point downstream where the rate of total runoff from the site is ten percent or less of the total runoff rate conveyed by the downstream system measured at the time of system peak rate. The city may, at its option, also permit downstream system improvements and detention combinations that provide the same level of control. 
RUNOFF COEFFICIENTS. 
    Of the parameters in the rational formula, runoff coefficients are the least subject to accurate determination. Surface runoff is affected by vegetation, and evapotranspiration. The most significant factor is percolation into the soil, which is greatly influenced by soil type and surface vegetation. It is common practice to use general overall runoff coefficients, which are based upon either land uses or surface characteristics. Runoff coefficients from Table 1 and Calculation Form B are to be used for runoff calculations. 
TIME OF CONCENTRATION (T c ) 
    Time of concentration is the period of time required for runoff to become established and for water to flow from the most distant point of the drainage area to the point under consideration. Time of concentration consists of an overland flow component and a channel flow component. 
    A minimum time of concentration of five minutes shall be used for runoff from pavements and paved swales. A minimum of ten minutes shall be used at inlets intercepting runoff from grassed swales. 
TIME OF CONCENTRATION, OVERLAND FLOW. 
    The selection or computation of the overland flow component of the time of concentration, T c and the determination of the variables, which affect it, is a very critical and important step in computing the peak rate of runoff. For a particular drainage area, the length, slope, and composite runoff coefficient must be determined. The length is the distance from the extremity or most remote point in the catchment area, in the direction parallel to the slope, until a defined channel or inlet is reached. To the first inlet, gutter flow will be considered as channel flow and handled as such. The total time of concentration will be the time of overland flow plus the time within the channel. 
    The slope, in percent, is the difference in elevation between the most remote point in the catchment area and the downstream edge of the overland flow area, divided by the horizontal distance between the two points. A composite runoff coefficient will be determined for the tributary area where overland flow will occur. A nomograph, Figure 1, is included for estimating overland flow time. 
TIME OF CONCENTRATION, CHANNEL FLOW. 
    The time of concentration within the channel can be determined by solving the Manning Formula for discharge: 
Q = 1.49/n AR <?xpp frax/2 3?> S 1/2 
and the continuity equation. 
Q = AV 
in which: 
Q = The quantity of water flowing in the channel (cfs). 
A = The cross-sectional area of water at a given channel section (sq. ft.). 
V = The mean velocity of water through a given channel section (fps). 
R = The hydraulic radius which is the cross-sectional area, A, divided by the wetted perimeter of the section W (ft.). 
S = The slope of the energy grade line which is equal to the water surface and the channel bottom in uniform flow (ft/ft). 
N = The roughness coefficient from Table 2. 
    Figure 6 can be used in the general solution of the Manning's Formula. 
    Since the quantity of stormwater reaching an open channel will normally increase continuously along its length, and the velocity will vary from the upper to the lower end of a channel section, it will be necessary to determine the average velocity in the channel section in order to compute a value for T c . 
    Typical channel cross sections near the upper and lower ends of the channel section can be plotted and the average slope determined from field survey information or from a contour map of the area. A value of "n" can be selected from Table 2. 
    The quantity of water at the upper end of the channel can be computed. Various water depths on the typical section can be tried and corresponding values for A and R determined until the Q computed by the Manning Formula is equivalent to the design Q. The values of A and Q can then be substituted into the continuity equation to determine the velocity, V, at the section being considered. 
    By using the same steps, a velocity can be computed at the lower end of the channel section and an average velocity determined. Velocities for channelized gutter flow can be taken from Figures 2, 3, and 4. Time of concentration within the channel is then equal to the length of the channel section, L, in feet, divided by the average velocity, V a , in feet per minute. 
T c = L/V a 
    The time of concentration within the channel must be estimated so approximate Q and V values through the typical cross section at the lower end of the channel can be computed and used in determining the actual time of concentration in the channel. 
    This principle can also be applied if a closed conduit is involved instead of an open channel, except that the quantity of water and velocity will normally not vary from the upper to the lower end of the conduit length under consideration. Therefore, only one value of velocity will need to be determined. In the case of a pipe, it will be sufficient to use the velocity when the pipe is flowing full to find the T c . Figures 5 and 6 can be used in computing velocity of flow in closed conduits. 
FREQUENCY INTERVAL. 
    The frequency, or return period, is the statistical average interval between rainfalls having an equal magnitude. Storm drain facilities in residential areas shall be designed as a minimum for a 10-year frequency storm. In the central business district and connected business areas, industrial areas, and new business and industrial areas, drains shall be designed for a 25-year frequency storm. Storm drain facilities in new residential areas located below an existing or projected business or industrial area in drainage basins shall be designed to handle the 25-year frequency storm drainage through the business or industrial area. 
    Although storm drain systems are to be designed for storm frequencies as discussed above, new systems for undeveloped areas as stipulated by the city shall include provisions for handling the design runoff, without threat to personal safety or undue property damage, in accordance with the design storm return relationships shown in Table 3. 
    Provisions for handling the runoff in excess of the minimum design storm may include, but not be limited to, temporary detention facilities, gutter flows to curb depth, drainage easements for overland flow, or simply limiting development to elevations above the flood plain. If provisions cannot be made otherwise to handle the excess runoff, the storm drain system shall be designed for the total runoff, with the approval of the city. 
RAINFALL INTENSITY. 
    Selection of a rainfall intensity is made from rainfall intensity-duration-frequency data prepared from historical rainfall data for the area, which is provided in Table 4. The storm return frequency to be used is dependent upon the land use category, which is being protected, and is selected from Table 3. The storm duration is equal to the total time of concentration at the point under consideration. 
FLOWS. 
    Two separate design flows must be developed for most storm drainage projects. First, design flows for gutter capacity and inlet location and capacity are developed. For these calculations, time of concentration is equal to time of overland flow for the incremental drainage area under consideration plus travel time for gutter flow. The design discharge rate is equal to that discharge calculated by the rational formula plus any flow bypassed around upstream inlets. Resulting design flows are used to locate and size inlets and connecting laterals to storm drains. 
    Second, design flows for storm drain capacity are developed. For these calculations, time of concentration is equal to the cumulative time of concentration from the uppermost reaches of the drainage area to the point under consideration. The runoff coefficient is a composite or weighted average coefficient for the entire area upstream of the point under consideration. Design flow is equal to the discharge calculated by the rational formula using the above cumulative values for time of concentration and the composite runoff coefficient. 
(Ord. No. 4119, § 1(Exh. A), 6-16-08) 
Section III. - Storm drain design. 
    Recommended criteria and procedures for design of the major components of the storm drainage system are presented in the following sections. These criteria and procedures are applicable to the most common types of drainage problems, which are expected to be encountered in the city. 
PRELIMINARY DESIGN. 
    Careful planning of storm drainage systems in the preliminary design phase offers the greatest potential for cost savings and for compliance with storm drainage objectives. The best time to prepare conceptual layouts of storm drainage systems is prior to finalization of street layout, easement location, and site grading. Options available to the drainage engineer are greatly reduced once the surface characteristics of the drainage basin have been set. 
    In storm drainage system design, a significant part of the construction cost is represented by small diameter storm drains. The longer that overland flow can be kept from reaching the street network, the further the distance from the ridge line that the storm drain system need begin, and the fewer the number of inlets that will be required. Various layout concepts should be developed and analyzed prior to selection of a final concept for detailed design. 
    Once the street layouts, easement locations, and site grading are finalized, the preliminary storm drainage system layout should be prepared. Whenever it is practicable, storm drains should be aligned to: 
 Avoid meandering, off-setting, and unnecessary angular changes; angular changes in alignment should be limited to a maximum of 90 degrees. 
 Be parallel with the center line of straight streets unless otherwise unavoidable. 
 Be in a straight line between structures, such as manholes, inlets, and junction chambers, for all pipelines 30 inches in diameter and smaller. 
 Make angular changes in alignment by a uniform curve between two tangents for pipelines 33 inches in diameter and larger, or by the use of hydraulically efficient junctions approved by the city. 
    Preliminary selection of storm drain conduits should be based upon providing a velocity when flowing full of between three and 15 feet per second. The minimum acceptable conduit diameter is 12 inches except for storm drains located beneath roadways, which shall be at least 15 inches in diameter. Conduit capacity shall be determined by the Manning Equation, using the appropriate "n" values listed in Table 2. 
GUTTER AND STREET CAPACITIES. 
    The depth of flow in gutters during the minimum design storm shall be limited to that depth that will produce a 10'-0? spread of flow onto the pavement of a new residential street having a two percent straight crown. 
    Gutter flows equal to curb depth will be allowed in residential areas for storms of greater magnitude than the minimum design frequency storm. 
    The following criteria shall be used for establishing the maximum allowable depth of gutter flow in other than residential streets and in older parabolic crowned residential streets. 
Type of Street Minimum Width of Noninundated Pavement 
(feet) Residential 10 Collector 10 Arterial 20  
Figures 2 and 3 show the relationship for quantity of flow, Q, in cfs; velocity, V, in fps; width of water in street in feet; and street slope in percent for a street section with straight two percent crown. It was derived by using Manning's Formula and the continuity equation. 
STORMWATER INLETS 
    Inlet location and design should be given careful consideration. Spacing and location shall be such that the depth of flow in the gutter is limited as discussed in the section on gutter and street capacities. 
    Figures 7, 8, and 9 are included to aid in determining inlet capacities of the various types of inlets. The figures are used for sizing curb-opening inlets on a continuous grade and at a low point in grade. Figures 7 and 8 apply only to curb or side opening inlets on continuous grades. The capacity of the inlet depends upon the length of opening and the depth of flow at the opening. This depth, in turn, depends upon the amount of depression of the flow line at the inlet and cross slope, longitudinal slope, and roughness of the gutter. 
    To use Figures 7 and 8, the following information must be known: 
Length (L) of inlet opening. 
Design flow in the gutter. Any carryover from a previous inlet must be included. 
Longitudinal street grade in percent. 
    The procedure for using Figure 7 is as follows: 
Enter Figure 7 with the design flow in the gutter and the street grade at the point under consideration and determine if the design flow exceeds the capacity of the gutter at the permissible spread. If the gutter capacity is exceeded, additional upstream inlets are required. 
If the design flow does not exceed the gutter capacity, determine the length of inlet, L, required to intercept 100 percent of the gutter flow or determine the amount of by-pass flow if a smaller inlet is selected. By-pass flow must not be allowed to enter arterial streets and must be intercepted by downstream inlets without the downstream flow exceeding the maximum for the appropriate street classifications set forth herein. 
Example: Design gutter flow - 7.0 cfs. 
Street Grade - 4 percent. 
From Figure 7 note that on a four percent street grade, a four-foot type A inlet without deflectors will intercept 6.0 cfs and that 1.0 cfs will bypass downstream. At the given street grade, the eight-foot inlet will intercept 100 percent of the design flow. 
    The procedure for using Figure 8 is as follows: 
Use of Figure 8 is similar to that of Figure 7. Note that the 4'-0? Type A curb inlet with deflectors will satisfy most flows, with reasonable bypassing, when located to maintain the maximum ten-foot flow spread. The 8'-0? inlet would be needed approaching intersection with arterial streets or at other points where a complete interception of flow is required. 
    The nomograph on Figure 9 solves inlet capacity problems under the following conditions: 
The curb-opening inlet is located at a low (no grade) point. 
All flow coming to the inlet must eventually enter the inlet and will pond until sufficient head is built up so the outflow through the inlet will equal the peak inflow from the gutters. 
For example: 
Enter the nomograph with any two of the three values h, Q/L, H/h and read the third in which: 
h = Total height of opening in feet. 
L = Total length of opening in feet. 
H = Depth of water at the entrance in feet. (Depth of water, H shall not exceed nine inches, 0.75 feet, for Type "A" inlets on streets with two percent straight crown). 
Q = Total peak rate of flow to the inlet in cfs. 
Normally, Q, L, and h will be known and the nomograph can be used to determine the depth of water, H, at the inlet. The spread of the water on the street will depend upon the cross slope of the pavement. 
MANHOLES AND JUNCTION STRUCTURES. 
    Manholes and junction structures provide access to a drain for cleaning and act as a junction box for tributary drains. Therefore, a manhole is required wherever a drain changes size or slope, at an abrupt change in alignment, where tributary drains join a main line, and at intervals of not more than 500 feet if the conduit is too small for a man to enter. The designer should check the head losses through manholes and junction structures by using the charts provided in Figure 10, since the losses can be quite significant. 
    The curves are from "Water Supply and Pollution Control" by Clark, Viessman and Hammer, second edition. They were developed for surcharged pipes entering rectangular structures, but may be applied to manholes as pictures on the curves. The "A" curve is used to find entrance and exit losses; the "B" curve is to evaluate the head loss due to increased velocity in the downstream direction. The loss is defined as the difference between the head losses for downstream and upstream pipe (V h-2 -V h-1 ). In cases where the greatest velocity upstream, the difference will be negative and may be applied to offset other losses in the structure. The "C" loss results from change of direction in a manhole. The "D" loss is related to the effect produced by the entrance of secondary flows into the structure. 
CLOSED CONDUIT FOR STORM DRAINS 
    Storm drainpipe shall generally be reinforced concrete. Bituminous coated corrugated metal pipe may be used for culverts and drains under 200 feet where specifically permitted by the City. Pipe should be sized for the amount of water calculated to be in the pipe as determined by inlet analysis under design conditions. The pipe is assumed to flow full under conditions of steady, uniform flow. The minimum design velocity shall be 3 feet per second. Pipe sizes 30 inches in diameter or less shall not decrease in the downstream direction even though increased slope may provide adequate capacity in the smaller pipe. The top of opening of inflow pipes to manholes or inlets shall be at the same elevation or higher than the top of the outflow pipes. Pipes may be sized by using the nomograph in Figure 5 or by calculation using Table 5. 
    Rectangular or square concrete box structures with one or more barrels may also be used as storm drains. In areas where this type of structure appears feasible, comparative cost studies with prefabricated or preconstructed sections should be made to determine which is most economical. The possibility of using the top slab as a driving or walking surface should also be investigated. Capacities for structures of this nature should be determined using the Manning Formula. 
OPEN CHANNELS 
    Open channels for storm drainage may be either natural or man-made channels. Closed conduits flowing less than full can be considered to be open channels. Wherever possible, a channel should be left in its natural state. Normally, a man-made channel, lined or unlined, transports water faster than a natural channel; the increased velocity reduces the time of concentration and increases the intensity of rainfall to be used in the design. This, in turn, increases the design peak runoff for the area and could result in higher costs for structures throughout the drainage area. 
    Flow in open channels should be analyzed by using the Manning Equation (Figure 6) and the continuity equation. The depth at which uniform flow occurs in an open channel is the normal depth. For a channel cross section with a specified discharge, Q, uniform flow may occur at critical depth, at less than critical depth, or at more than critical depth depending on the channel slope. Flow at or near critical depth, d c , is highly unstable and channel sections giving depth of flow near the critical depth should be avoided. Subcritical velocity will prevail at normal depths greater than the critical depth and will occur on mild slopes. Supercritical velocity will prevail at normal depths less than the critical depth and will occur on steep slopes. 
    Critical flow is characterized by a Froude number, F, equal to unity. If F is less than 1.0, the flow is subcritical and if F is more than 1.0, the flow is supercritical. The Froude number, F, is defined as: 
F =  V  vgd m  
in which: 
V = velocity in feet per second. 
g = gravitational constant, 32.2 feet per second per second. 
d m = A/b w 
where: 
b w = width of water surface. 
A = cross-sectional area of flow. 
For a rectangular channel, d m = d. 
    Flow that passes from supercritical to subcritical may result in a hydraulic jump and should be investigated in areas where problems could result. 
    It is rare that uniform flow will occur in all reaches of a channel. There will normally be interconnected reaches of uniform and nonuniform flow. The determination of water surface profiles for a given discharge in the area of nonuniform flow may be necessary to insure against extensive property damage. Computations should begin at a known point and extend upstream for subcritical flow and downstream for supercritical flow. Standard flood profiles have been developed by the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army for the Missouri River. Studies of development in the lower portions of drainage basins intersected by these streams should include the computation of backwater curves for the design storm using the 100-year flood elevations at the intersections as the starting point. 
    To insure against costly errors in the design of conduits, it is good practice to use the energy grade line as a basis for calculation, rather than the flow line. 
    There is an abundance of reference material available concerning the various problems that can be encountered in the backwater analysis of open channels. Since the possible variations in conditions make each problem unique, this manual does not discuss specific solutions. 
(Ord. No. 4119, § 1(Exh. A), 6-16-08) 
Section IV. - Culverts. 
    At the intersection of open channels and roads, streets, or highways, it is necessary to provide an adequately sized culvert; sizing these structures is very important to avoid bottlenecks in the drainage system. Design of culverts involves determination of the hydraulic performance of the structure under certain conditions in addition to its structural adequacy. The more commonly used culvert types include both concrete and metal; circular pipes and arch pipes, and concrete box culverts. 
    A culvert will operate with either inlet-controlled or outlet-controlled flow. Under inlet control, the inlet geometry and the amount of headwater or ponding at the entrance are of primary importance. Outlet control involves the additional consideration of the elevation of the tailwater in the outlet channel and the slope, roughness and length of the culvert barrel. 
INLET CONTROL 
    Most culverts in the city will operate under inlet control. Culverts with inlet control are usually on steep slopes and flow partly full. The headwater or depth of ponding at the entrance is an important factor in the culvert capacity. The headwater depth, HW, is the vertical distance from the culvert invert at the entrance to the energy line of the headwater pool. Because of the low velocities in most entrance pools, the water surface and the energy line at the entrance are assumed to be the same. 
    Figures 11 through 14 were developed by the Federal Highway Administration (Bureau of Public Roads) to aid in sizing culverts. Enter the charts or nomographs with a trial culvert size and the design flow, and read the value for HW/D on the line for the appropriate entrance type. HW can then be computed by multiplying the trial structure diameter or depth, D, by the value from the nomograph. 
OUTLET CONTROL 
    Culverts with outlet control can flow with the culvert barrel full or part full, for part or all of the barrel length. The head, H, or energy required to pass a given quantity of water through an outlet-controlled culvert with the barrel flowing full throughout its length is made up of three major parts, which include a velocity head, H v ; an entrance loss, H e ; and a friction loss, H f . This energy is obtained from ponding of water at the entrance and is expressed as: 
H = H v + H e + H f 
    Figures 15, 16, and 17 which were also developed by the Federal Highway Administration (Bureau of Public Roads), are included to aid in sizing structures with outlet control and, in particular, to determine the value for H. 
    The headwater depth, HW, can be expressed by a common equation for all outlet control conditions, including all depths of tailwater. This is accomplished by designating the vertical dimension for the culvert invert at the outlet to the elevation from which H is measured as h o . Then, 
H = H + h o - LS o 
in which: 
L = the length of the culvert in feet. 
S o = the barrel slope in feet per foot. 
    When the water surface elevation in the outlet channel is equal to or above the elevation of the top of the culvert opening at the outlet, h o is equal to the tailwater depth, TW. TW is the distance in feet from the outlet culvert invert to the water surface in the outlet channel. 
    If the tailwater elevation is below the top of the culvert opening at the outlet, h o is more difficult to determine. The discharge, size, and shape of culvert, and the TW must be considered. In these cases, h o is the greater value of TW as defined above, or 
d c + D   2    
    The critical depth is d c , and D is the culvert height. Tailwater depth is not a factor for culverts flowing below critical depth at the outlet. 
    Figures 18 and 19 give critical depth, d c , at various discharges for different sizes of circular and pipe-arch culverts. 
    To determine the value of H from the charts, select the proper value of k e from Table 6 and enter the chart with the quantity of flow, Q, and the size and length of the structure. Values of k e different than the scales shown can be located by a straight-line interpolation between the scales. Connect the length on the k e scale to the culvert size to establish a turning point. Then connect the discharge and the turning point to determine the head, H. 
    The value of HW should be found for both the inlet and outlet control condition. The flow condition that produces the highest value for HW governs and indicates the flow control existing under the given conditions for the trial size selected. 
(Ord. No. 4119, § 1(Exh. A), 6-16-08) 
Section V. - Erosion control. 
    Slopes in the city are generally steep and erodible velocities can be expected at most enclosed drainage system outlets and in most natural or manmade channels forming elements of the urban drainage system. Table 7 gives maximum permissible velocities in continuously wet, aged channels. Few watercourses in the city will fall into this category. Table 8 gives maximum permissible velocities in channels lined with uniform stands of grass covers, well maintained. Most natural and manmade channels and swales in the city will fall within this category. Most grassed swales in the city will fall within the sod type covers in the second grouping in Table 8. 
    When outlet, channel or swale velocities exceed the maximum values in the tables, the city may require the use of concrete or other nonerodible linings, scour aprons, energy dissipators, stone riprap, or other protective devices. 
(Ord. No. 4119, § 1(Exh. A), 6-16-08) 
Section VI. - Major system. 
    The "major" drainage system consists of all possible routings of runoff from storms greater than the designated "design storm". The major system includes the formal system hydraulically designed to convey the design runoff to receiving streams or channels. The major system also includes side and rear yard swales, streets, and other natural or man-made avenues for large storm runoff to reach large watercourses. The major system will always exist whether considered in design of the development or not. Safe routing of major runoff through the project area must be considered in the initial development of project layout and grading. Details of the major routings in the form of designating flowways and swales must be submitted for review concurrent with submittal of storm drainage facilities conveying the design storm. 
    Estimates of the runoff rates from a 100-year rainfall should be made for the various reaches of the probable "major" system. The probable hydraulic behavior of the various flowways and swales should be examined. 
    Several studies over the years have suggested that during major rainfall events, runoff is significantly greater than produced by the Rational Formula. To account for antecedent precipitation conditions producing this excess runoff, the Rational Formula for use with major storms should be adjusted by multiplying the right side of the Rational Formula by a frequency factor, C f . The formula now becomes: 
Q = CiAC f 
    The following table of C f should be used. The product of C × C f should not exceed 1.0.

(Ord. No. 4119, § 1(Exh. A), 6-16-08) 
Section VII. - Detention storage. 
    Frequently, undeveloped upper reaches of watersheds can use detention facilities to correct runoff problems or to restrict runoff from development to that which existed prior to the change in land use. Because of the proximity of future development in the city to receiving streams and the general lack of suitable sites, on-site detention storage will probably find limited use. 
    When desired by the developer or as required by the city to control runoff, detention storage facilities shall be designed by a registered professional engineer experienced in such design. Prior to design of detention facilities, the developer and his engineer shall consult with the city engineer who will stipulate parameters to be used in establishing the allowable release rate and review siting of the facility. 
    The list of references in this manual contains several references covering design of detention facilities. These and other references covering state-of-the-art design should be used as appropriate. 
    Where appropriate, state and federal laws pertaining to dams shall control and shall take precedence to the extent that the detention facilities may be classified as "dams" thereunder. 
    Requirements covering submittal of design information on detention facilities are included in the next section of this manual titled Design Review. 
A.  General provisions. 
1.  Detention/retention facilities shall have 1,000 acres or less area tributary to the facility. 
2.  Dams which are greater than ten feet in height but do not fall into State or Federal requirement categories shall be designed in accordance with the latest edition of SCS Technical Release No. 60, "Earth Dams and Reservoirs," as Class "C" Structures. 
3.  All lake and pond developments must conform to local, state, and federal regulations. Legal definitions and regulations for dams and reservoirs can be found in the Missouri Code of State Regulations, Division 22. 
B.  Release rate. The maximum release rate from any development shall be the existing undeveloped rate for the 100-year storm. 
C.  Detention basin size. Owners/engineers may utilize methodology outlined in (SCS, 1986). A Type II rainfall distribution shall be the required storm hyetograph. Maximum detention storage shall be based upon the allowable release rate and upon the developed condition for the site. Basin volume shall be sized for the 100-year storm. 
D.  Primary outlet works. The primary outlet shall be designed to meet the following requirements: 
1.  The outlet shall be designed to function without requiring attendance or operation of any kind or requiring use of equipment or tools, or any mechanical devices. 
2.  All discharge from the detention facility when inflow is equal to or less than the 100-year inflow shall be via the primary outlet. 
3.  The design discharge rate via the outlet shall continuously increase with increasing head and shall have hydraulic characteristics similar to weirs, orifices or pipes. 
4.  For dry detention basins, the design shall allow for discharge of at least 80 percent of the detention storage volume within 24 hours after the peak or center of mass of the inflow has entered the detention basis. 
5.  Ponds shall be designed with a nonclogging outlet such as a reverse-slope pipe, or a weir outlet. A reverse-slope pipe draws from below the permanent pool extending in a reverse angle up to the riser and establishes the water elevation of the permanent pool. Because these outlets draw water from below the level of the permanent pool, they are less likely to be clogged by floating debris. 
6.  No orifice shall be less than three inches in diameter. (Smaller orifices are more susceptible to clogging.) 
E.  Emergency spillways. The emergency spillway may either be combined with the outlet works or be a separate structure or channel meeting the following criteria: 
1.  Elevation: Emergency spillways shall be designed so that their crest elevation is 0.5 feet or more above the maximum water surface elevation in the detention facility attained by the 100-year storm. 
2.  Capacity: In cases where the impoundment/emergency spillway is not regulated by either state or federal agencies, the emergency spillway shall be designed to pass the 100-year storm with one foot of freeboard from the design state to the top of dam, assuming zero available storage in the basin and zero flow through the primary outlet. This design provides an added level of protection in the event of a clogged primary outlet or a subsequent 100-year storm event that occurs before the flood pool from the initial storm event recedes to the principal outlet elevation. 
F.  Wet bottom basins/retention facility. For basins designed with permanent pools: 
1.  Minimum depth: The minimum normal depth of water before the introduction of excess stormwater shall be four feet plus a sedimentation allowance of not less than five years accumulation. 
2.  Depth for fish: If the pond is to contain fish, at least one-quarter of the area of the permanent pool must have a minimum depth of ten feet plus sedimentation allowance. 
3.  Side slopes: The side slopes shall conform as closely as possible to regarded or natural land contours, and should not exceed three horizontal to one vertical. Slopes exceeding this limit shall require erosion control and safety measures and a geotechnical analysis. 
G.  Dry bottom basins/detention facility. For basins designed to be normally dry: 
1.  Interior drainage: Provisions must be incorporated to facilitate interior drainage to outlet structures. Grades for drainage facilities shall not be less than two percent on turf. Concrete swales, with a minimum gradient of one percent, may be used as needed to conduct stormwater from turfed bottom areas to the outlet structure. 
2.  Side slopes: The side slopes of dry ponds should be relatively flat to reduce safety risks and to help to lengthen the effective flow path. Slopes shall not be steeper than three horizontal to one vertical. 
H.  Other storage. All or a portion of the detention storage may also be provided in underground or surface detention areas, including, but not limited to, oversized storm sewers, vaults, tanks, swales, etc. 
I.  Access. Provisions shall be made to permit access and use of auxiliary equipment to facilitate emptying, cleaning, maintenance, or for emergency purposes. 
J.  Underground storage. Underground detention facilities shall be designed with adequate access for maintenance (cleaning and sediment removal). Such facilities shall be provided with positive gravity outlets. Venting shall be sufficient to prevent accumulation of toxic or explosive gases. 
(Ord. No. 4119, § 1(Exh. A), 6-16-08) 
Section VIII. - Design review. 
    Details and calculations covering the proposed storm drainage system shall be submitted for review by the city. The submitted information shall include all information necessary to build the system and to indicate conformance with this design criteria. Where required by the city, details and calculations shall be prepared by and bear the seal of a registered professional engineer. 
    In addition to calculation forms included in this design manual, completed for each element of the system, the submittal shall include, as a minimum, the following: 
 Topographic map designating limits of the watershed tributary to the proposed system. 
 Aerial photography at 400 scale, obtained from city showing watershed boundaries, and the location of principal features of the proposed drainage system. Note thereon any changes in land use in the watershed that might impact runoff through the project area. 
If detention storage is proposed, the submittal shall also include the following: 
 Rainfall hyetograph plotted in inches per hour as ordinates, and time from beginning of storm as abscissas. 
 Inflow hydrographs plotted in units of cubic feet per second of inflow as ordinates, and time from beginning of storm as abscissas. 
 Maximum outflow rates, in cubic feet per second, and minimum storage volumes as determined in consultation with the city engineer. 
 Complete plans for grading, storm sewers, and inlets, outflow structures, dams, emergency spillways, and other appurtenances. 
 Slope, type, size, and complete flow calculations for outlet structures, spillways, and other waterways. 
 Stage-storage curves for proposed detention facilities plotted in units of detention facility water surface elevation (and depth) as ordinates, and cumulative volume of storage as abscissas. 
 Stage-storage curves for outlet works plotted in units of detention facility water surface elevation (and depth) as ordinates, and discharge rate in cubic feet per second (cfs) as abscissas. 
 Inflow and outflow hydrographs plotted in units of cubic feet per second of inflow and outflow as ordinates, and time from start of storm as abscissas. The inflow and outflow hydrographs shall be plotted and labeled to show total storage requirements and time to empty the detention facility. 
(Ord. No. 4119, § 1(Exh. A), 6-16-08) 
Section IX. - Design procedures. 
STANDARD FORMS 
    Forms A, B, C, D, and E are included to aid the designer in completing computations for a storm drainage system consisting of street gutters, circular or circular-equivalent pipes, inlets, manholes or junction structures, and culverts. Design of less frequently utilized open channels shall be in accordance with procedures outlined in this manual utilizing the listed references applicable thereto. Submittal of open channel hydraulic calculations shall be in a form acceptable to the city. 
BASE MAP PREPARATION 
1.  Prepare a topographic base map showing locations of streets, buildings, lot lines, underground utilities, and natural drainage courses. 
2.  Prepare a preliminary layout of a storm drain network to serve the area, including locations of inlets, storm drains, junctions or manholes, and swales and other routing for "major" runoff. 
3.  Delineate drainage areas tributary to each proposed storm inlet. 
CALCULATION FORMS A AND B 
1.  For each subdrainage area, calculate the composite runoff coefficient, using Table 1, and record the values on Calculation Form A, or determine coefficients by using Calculation Form B. 
2.  Select the appropriate rainfall return frequency from Table 3 for the predominant land use category to be protected in the drainage area. Record the value at the bottom of Calculation Form A or B. 
3.  Complete Calculation Form A or B by checking or filling in the blanks for the planned street width, street cross slope, and storm drain material. 
CALCULATION FORM C 
1, 2.  Determine and record the length of overland flow, L, along the longest path to the inlet, and the average group slope, S, along the same path. 
3.  Using the nomograph for overland flow (Figure 1), given L and S from the above steps and the runoff coefficient from Computation Form A; select the appropriate time of concentration for overland flow, T c . 
4, 5, 6.  Enter the appropriate values for "C" and "A" from Calculation Form A or B and calculate "C" times "A" (or "CA"). 
7.  Using the rainfall return frequency from Calculation Form A or B, the value of T c from Step 3, and the rainfall-intensity-duration data from Table 4, determine the value of rainfall intensity, i. 
8.  Calculate peak runoff from the subdrainage area, Q r , by multiplying CA by i (Column 6 × Column 7). 
For each street gutter that will receive runoff, perform the following gutter and inlet hydraulics calculations, using the right half of Calculation Form C. 
9-12.  Determine the depth of flow, Y g , and the width of spread, W, from the appropriate design chart (Figure 2), by entering the upper graph with the gutter flow, Q g , and the longitudinal street slope, S g , and then by projecting a vertical line down to the lower graph to its point of intersection with the lower curve. The coordinates of this point of intersection gives the values for Y g and W. 
If the values obtained in the above step for Y g and W are less than the maximum values permitted by this manual, then proceed to the next step. If the maximum values are exceeded, then provide additional inlets and repeat the above design steps (beginning with Column 1). 
13.  Select one of the city's standard inlets, using the following guidelines: 
Condition Inlet Type Low point, sump condition Type A Curb Inlet, A Continuous grade, S g = 5% Type A Curb Inlet, A Continuous grade, S g > 5% Type A Curb Inlet with Deflectors, A-D  
Determine the inlet capacity, Q;sub \sub;, for the selected inlet on continuous grade from the appropriate graph (Figure 7 or 8) by following the procedure outlined heretofore in the text of this manual. 
Determine the inlet capacity per foot of length, Q<inf>j</inf>/L/sub<ital></ital>\sub ;, for inlets in sump conditions from the nomograph on Figure 9, by entering the nomograph with H h , based on the amount of ponding as permitted by the street cross-slope and the requirements for noninundated pavement as given in this manual and the height of opening as obtained from standard inlet details. 
14.  The difference between gutter flow, Q g , and available inlet capacity, Q;sub ..... sub;, represents the flow that is bypassed around the inlet q. 
Proceeding in a downstream direction, size each successive inlet by using the runoff discharge calculated by the Rational Formula for each individual subdrainage area (i.e. ignore cumulative effects) plus the bypassed flow from the upstream inlet. 
CALCULATION FORM D 
15-21.  Prepare a preliminary storm drain system, beginning at the upper-most storm inlet in the network. Required storm drain capacities are equal to discharges computed by the Rational Formula at each inlet, plus any carryover discharge from upstream inlets. Time of concentration, T c , at any inlet is equal to the larger of the following two quantities: (1) cumulative time of concentration to the upstream inlet plus travel time in the upstream storm drain reach, or (2) time of concentration for the subdrainage area immediately tributary to the inlet. Values for CA for storm drain design are cumulative values calculated from all upstream drainage areas. Select tentative lengths, slopes, and sizes for each segment of the storm drain network and record them on Calculation Form D. 
22, 23.  Obtain the capacity and velocity of flow of the selected storm drain when flowing full by Manning's Equation (or using Figure 5 or Table 5, when applicable). 
24.  Calculate travel time in the storm drain segment by dividing the length of the segment by the velocity calculated in the preceding step. 
25.  Calculate system head losses, h, by using the graphs and procedures shown on Figure 10. 
26, 27.  Record approximate ground elevations at each manhole or junction and select an initial downstream invert elevation for the uppermost manhole or junction. Proceeding in a downstream direction, successively set manhole or junction invert elevations, with downstream inverts being lower than upstream inverts by at least the distance h L . Prepare preliminary designs of connector pipes (laterals) between inlets and storm drains. 
CALCULATION FORM E 
    For culvert design, it will generally be necessary to complete all steps on Calculation Form A or B and Columns 1 through on Calculation Form C, as described above. 
    For each culvert, beginning at the uppermost reaches of the drainage area, perform the following calculations and record them on Calculation Form E. 
1-4.  Required culvert capacity is equal to discharge calculated by the Rational Formula, using cumulative values for T c and CA. Runoff calculations are to be recorded in the upper left-hand corner of Calculation Form E. 
5-8.  Select a preliminary culvert type, slope (S o ), and diameter (D) and record them along with the culvert Length (L) on Calculation Form E. 
9, 10.  Assuming inlet control, find HW/D from the appropriate nomograph for the type of culvert selected (Figures 11 through 14), entering with D and Q. Multiply HW/D by D to determine the value of HW for inlet control. 
Assuming outlet control, perform the following calculations to find the value of HW for outlet control. 
11.  Find the value for K e for the selected entrance condition and type of culvert from Table 6. 
12.  Using the appropriate nomograph for the type of culvert selected (Figures 15, 16, and 17), connect the value for K e and L with the culvert dimensions with a straight line to establish a point on the turning line. Then draw a straight line from the required discharge, Q, through the turning point to the scale showing head, H. This value of H will be used in the equation HW = H + h o - LS o to find HW for outlet control. 
13.  Calculate the critical depth, d c , for the selected culvert. Figures 18 and 19 give critical depths at various discharges for different types and sizes of culverts. 
14, 15.  Determine the value of (d c + D)/2 and the tailwater depth, TW, downstream of the culvert. In most instances, culvert design will be such that TW = 0. 
16.  h o is the greater of (d c + D)/2 and TW. Record the appropriate value under the column for h o . 
17.  Multiply L by S o and record it in the column for LS o and record it in the column for HW. 
18.  Calculate HW = H + h o - LS o . Circle the larger of the two values for HW. This value determines whether there is inlet or outlet control for the selected culvert and set of conditions. 
(Ord. No. 4119, § 1(Exh. A), 6-16-08) 
Section X. - Design example. 
    The example problem is the design of a hypothetical storm drain system in a residential area and will be analyzed for a 10-year storm frequency. 
    The proposed layout of the system was sketched on a contour map of the area to obtain ground elevations, design slopes, and drainage patterns (See Exhibit I.). 
    All inlets at low points and other inlets in critical areas where debris may be a problem should have extra capacity as a safeguard against flooding. To partially compensate for loss capacity, inlets in such locations should be designed for a flow 20 percent greater than the calculated tributary flow. At critical low points, supplemental inlets may be required. 
DRAINAGE INLET SIZING 
Beginning Inlet No. 1 
    Form C is used for sizing inlets, starting at the upstream end of the system. 
L = 200 ft 
A = 2.0 Ac 
S = 0.04 ft/ft (4.0%) 
C = 0.45 
T c = 10.0 min. from Figure 1 
CA = 0.45 × 2.0 = 0.90 
i = 6.1 in./hr from Table 4 
Q r = CiA = 0.9 × 6.1 = 5.49 cfs 
Q g = 5.49 cfs 
Gutter Slope, S g = Not a factor in sump 
Depth of Flow at Entrance, H = 0.75 
Ref: Figure 9 
h = 8 in. (from Details Type A Curb Inlet) 
Hh = 0.75 = 1.125 0.67  
Q = 1.62 cfs/ft L  
L = Q g × 1.20 = 5.49 × 1.20 = 4.07 1.62 1.62  
Use a standard Type A curb inlet with L = 4' - 0?. 
Inlet Capacity with Blockage Allowance = 
4 × 1.62 = 5.40 cfs 1.20  
If Q g was much larger, the next largest inlet would have been considered. 
Inlet No. 2 
For Inlet No. 2, compute Q r = 2.28 cfs in the same manner, and find that required L = 2.28 × 120/1.62 = 1.69 ft. Use a Type A Standard Curb Inlet with L = 4'-0?. 
Inlet No. 3 
For Inlet No. 3, compute Q r = Q g = 7.64 cfs. From Figure 7, select an L = 4'-0? Type A standard curb inlet without deflectors with Q;sub \sub; = 5.80, bypassing 1.84 cfs to Inlet No. 4. Note on Figure 8 that a 4-foot inlet with deflectors on a 4.0 percent gutter grade has only slightly greater capacity and the additional cost would not be justified. 
Inlet No. 4 
For Inlet No. 4, compute Q r = 3.40 cfs and Q g = 3.40 + 1.84 (bypass) = 5.24 cfs. From Figure 7, select an L = 4'-0? Type A Standard Curb Inlet without deflectors having a capacity of 5.80 cfs, thereby intercepting 100 percent of the flow, a requirement at the arterial street. 
Inlet No. 5 
For Inlet No. 5, compute Q r = Q g = 8.00 cfs. From Figure 8, select an L = 8'-0? Type A Standard Curb Inlet with deflectors having a capacity of 13.5 cfs at the 5 percent gutter slope and intercepting 100 percent of the gutter flow, a requirement at the arterial street. 
Storm Drain Hydraulics and Sizing 
Beginning Inlet - Manhole No. 1 
Form B is used for sizing the drains, starting with the beginning headwall upstream from Manhole No. 1. The drainage area (Area No. 1) was found to be 3.0 acres with a composite runoff coefficient, C, of 0.45. The percent imperviousness is 1.35 (3.0 × 0.45). From a contour map, L = 600 ft. and the average slope, S, was found to be 6 percent. 
T c = 15 min. from Figure 1 
i = 5.3 in. per hour from Table 4 
Q = 1.35 × 5.3 = 7.2 cfs 
Try a 15 in. RCP 
Length, L, of drain (from map) = 100 ft 
Hydraulic slope required = 0.015 ft per ft 
Drain slope provided = 0.015 ft per ft 
The capacity of the 15-inch pipe at a slope of 1.5 percent is 7.2 cfs and the velocity is 5.8 fps from Figure 5. 
The head, HW, or depth of water above the inlet flow line required for the drain to operate effectively can be obtained from Figure 11. The purpose of this head is to overcome entrance losses and to generate the required velocity. 
HW = 1.47 from Figure 11 D  
HW = 1.25 × 1.75 = 2.18 ft 
The 15-inch pipe will be used in this example; however, if the HW would have been too high for local inlet conditions, a larger pipe would have been selected. 
The time of flow from the beginning inlet to Manhole No. 1 is calculated as follows: 
t =   L   =   100   = 0.3 minute V f × 60 5.8 × 60  
Manhole No. 1 - Inlet No. 1 
From Manhole No. 1 to Inlet No. 1, there is no additional runoff introduced, so Q remains 7.2 cfs. 
Try a 15 in. RCP 
L = 150 ft 
Hydraulic slope required = 0.015 per ft 
Drain slope provided = 0.017 ft per ft 
Capacity 7.4 cfs 
Velocity 6.0 cfs 
t =  150  = 0.4 minute 6.0 × 60  
The manhole losses through Manhole No. 1 can now be calculated with the aid of Figure 10. 
Curve A Entrance and exit losses (V = 6.0 fps) = 0.20 ft Curve B Loss due to velocity change (V 2 = 6.0 and V 1 = 5.8) = 0.55 - 0.52 = 0.03 ft Curve C Loss due to change in direction (45º ± bend = 0.10 × 1.0) = 0.10 ft Curve D Loss due to entrance of secondary flow = None Total Manhole Losses (Manhole No. 1) = 0.33 ft  
These losses may be compensated for in the manhole by lowering the outlet flow line by lowering the outlet flow line by at least the amount of the losses below the incoming flow line. 
Inlet No. 1 - Inlet No. 2 
Accumulative CA = 0.90 + 1.35 = 2.25 
T c = 15.3 + 0.4 = 15.7 minutes 
i = 5.2 in. per hour from Table 4 
Q = 2.25 × 5.2 = 11.7 cfs 
Try an 18 in. RCP 
Hydraulic slope required = 0.016 ft per ft from Figure 5 
Drain slope provided = 0.016 ft per ft 
Capacity = 11.7 cfs from Figure 5 
Velocity = 6.7 ft per sec. From Figure 5 
Time of flow = 36/6.7 × 60 = 0.1 minute 
The manhole losses at Inlet No. 1 can now be computed. 
Curve A (V = 6.7 fps) = 0.24 ft Curve B (V 2 = 6.7 and V 1 = 6.0) = 0.70 - 0.57 = 0.13 ft Curve C (V = 6.7 fps (45º ± bend)) = 0.13 ft Curve D None Total Manhole Losses at Inlet No. 1 = 0.50 ft  
At Inlet No. 1 the flow into the inlet from the street gutter is: 
Q I = 0.90 × 5.2 = 4.7 cfs 
This inflow represents 40 percent of the total flow leaving the structure. Where velocities are high and in critical locations where structures are shallow, the position of the hydraulic gradient in the structure should be checked by means found in the references. The position of the hydraulic gradient in the inlet would then confirm that the amount of freeboard above the standing water surface elevation was adequate for this flow to free fall into the inlet. 
As a minimum where the inflow from the street is a significant part of the total flow out of a combination inlet-manhole, the elevation of the top of the outgoing pipe should be below the gutter entrance weir by the following amount: 
d = 1.78 V 2 + 0.50, where g = 32.2 2g  
In this instance, d + D is equal to the HW that can be obtained from Figure 11, plus a 0.50-foot freeboard. If surcharge of the storm drain should be avoided, the outgoing pipe should be placed at a depth below the incoming pipe equal to the manhole losses, Column 25, plus 1.78 V 2 /29. 
Inlet No. 2 - Inlet No. 3 
Calculations for this drain segment follow the above procedures. 
The manhole losses at Inlet No. 2 are as follows: 
Curve A (V = 7.9 fps) = 0.32 ft Curve B (V 2 = 7.9 and V 1 = 6.7) = 1.0 - 0.7 = 0.30 ft Curve C (V = 7.9 fps) (90º bend) 0.19 × 2 = 0.38 ft Curve D None Total Manhole Losses at Inlet No. 2 = 1.00 ft  
Inlet No. 3 - Manhole No. 2 
Calculate following the above procedures. 
Manhole No. 2 - Drain Outlet 
Calculate pipe hydraulics and size following above procedures. Note inflow from Inlets No. 4 and 5. 
Manhole losses at Manhole No. 2 are as follows: 
Curve A (V = 8.7 fps) = 0.40 ft Curve B (V 2 = 6.5 and V 1 = 8.7) = 0.65 - 1.13 = -0.48 ft Curve C (V = 8.7 fps (90º±)) = 0.22 × 2 = 0.44 ft Curve D Q 1 = 20.6 cfs Q 3 = 10.3 = 0.50 Q 2 = 30.9 cfs Q 1 20.6 Q 3 = 10.3 cfs  
Use Curve for Q 3 = 50% Q 1  
Curve D loss = 0.38 ft Total Manhole Losses @ Manhole No. 2 = 0.74 ft  
Open Channel 
By using the total accumulated CA and the intensity for the total T c , find Q at the upstream end of the open channel to be 30.2 cfs. Try a channel with a 4'-0? bottom and 2:1 side slopes. 
T c = 17.6 minutes and CA = 6.31 
Assume vegetal lining, n - 0.035 (Table 2) 
Assume erosion-resistant soils 
Slope S = 0.02 ft per ft 
Assume depth of flow = 1.0 ft 
A = 4 × 1.0 + 2 × 1.0 = 6.0 sq ft 
W = 4 + 2 × 2.236 = 8.47 
R = A =  6  = 0.708 W 8.47  
V = 4.8 fps 
Q = AV = 6.0 × 4.8 = 28.8 cfs 
Try S = 0.025 ft per ft 
V = 5.4 fps (less than 7 fps, Table 8) 
Q = 6.0 × 5.4 = 32.4 cfs 
Length of Channel = 250 ft 
For this example, assume no inflow along the channel. 
t (in channel) =   250   = 0.8 minute 5.4 × 60  
T c = 17.6 + 0.8 = 18.4 minutes 
i = 4.8 in. per hour 
Q = 6.31 × 4.8 = 30.3 cfs (for Culvert design) 
Culvert (See Form E) 
The culvert under the arterial street will be sized so that the headwater is limited to 3.5 ft. above the upstream invert. 
Try a 30 in. RCP, square edge with headwall 
Slope, S o , = 0.02 ft per ft 
Length = 100 ft 
Q = 30.3 cfs 
From Figure 11, HW/D = 1.3 
HW = 1.3 × 2.5 = 3.25 ft (This is the headwater for inlet control.) 
From Table 6, select K e = 0.5 
H - 1.48 from Figure 15 
d c , Critical Depth, = 1.8 (Figure 18) 
d c + D - 1.8 + 2.5 = 2.15 2 2  
For this example, use TW = 0 ft (This will generally be the case in the City, except for culverts in flood plains). 
LS o = 100 × 0.02 = 2.0 ft 
HW = H + h o - LS o = 1.48 + 2.15 - 2.0 = 1.63 ft 
(This is the HW for outlet control.) 
The culvert will operate under inlet control passing Q = 30.3 cfs at a head (HW) of 3.25 ft on the entrance.

Appendix F - CABLE COMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY CODE 

Section 1. - Regulation of authorized providers. 
[A.  Authorization; fee.] To the extent permitted by the 2007 Video Services Providers Act, the city council hereby ratifies all existing agreements, franchises, and ordinances regulating cable television operators and other telecommunications and data transmission service providers and approves imposition of a fee of four percent imposed on the gross revenues of all such providers regulated under the authority of the state public service commission or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to provide video or other telecommunications and data transmission services within the city without such authorization. 
"Gross revenues" shall mean the total amounts billed to subscribers or received from advertisers for the provision of video, telecommunications and/or data transmission services within the city, including (a) recurring charges for video, data and telecom service, (b) event-based charges for service, including but not limited to pay-per-view and other on-demand charges, (c) rental of set top boxes, modems, routers, splitters, antennae, and other service equipment, (d) service charges related to the provision of video or other transmitting service, including but not limited to activation, installation, repair, and maintenance charges, (e) administrative charges related to the provision of video or other transmitting service, including but not limited to service order and service termination charges, and (f) a pro rata portion of all revenue derived, less refunds, rebates, or discounts, by a service provider for advertising over any network to subscribers, where the numerator is the number of subscribers within the city and the denominator is the total number of subscribers reached by such advertising; all of which shall be computed using generally accepted accounting principles. 
B.  General regulations. 
1.  A video service provider shall provide written notice to the city at least ten days before commencing video, cable or wireless telecommunications service within the city. Such notice shall also include: 
(a)  The name, address and legal status of the provider; 
(b)  The name, title, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and fax number of individual(s) authorized to serve as the point of contact between the city and the provider so as to make contact possible at any time (i.e., 24 hours per day, seven days per week); and 
(c)  A copy of the provider's video service authorization issued by the state public service commission. 
2.  A video service provider shall also notify the city, in writing, within 30 days of (a) any changes in the information set forth in or accompanying its notice of commencement of video service or (b) any transfer of ownership or control of the provider's business assets. 
3.  A video service provider shall not deny access to service to any group of potential residential subscribers because of the race or income of the residents in the area in which the group resides. A video service provider shall be governed in this respect by RSMo 67.2707. The city may file a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction alleging a germane violation of this subsection, which complaint shall be acted upon in accordance with RSMo § 67.2711. 
4.  A video service provider shall comply with all Federal Communications Commission requirements involving the distribution and notification of emergency messages over the emergency alert system applicable to cable operators. Any video service provider other than an incumbent cable operator serving a majority of the residents within a political subdivision shall comply with this section by December 31, 2007. 
5.  A video service provider shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the city, its officials, boards, board members, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, and judgments ("claims") for damages or equitable relief arising out of (i) the construction, maintenance, repair or operation of its video services network, (ii) copyright infringements, and (iii) failure to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or licenses or programs to be delivered by the video service network. Such indemnification shall include, but is not limited to, the city's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim prior to the video service provider assuming such defense. The city shall notify the provider of a claim within seven business days of its actual knowledge of the existence of such claim. Once the provider assumes the defense of the claim, the city may at its option continue to participate in the defense at its own expense. This indemnification obligation shall not apply to any claim related to the provision of public, educational, or governmental channels or programming or to emergency interrupt service announcements. 
C.  Video service provider fee. 
1.  Each video service provider shall pay to the city a video service provider fee in the amount of four percent of the provider's gross revenues on or before the last day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter. The city may adjust the video service provider fee as permitted in RSMo § 67.2689. 
2.  The city, not more than once per calendar year and at its own cost, may audit the gross revenues of any video service provider as provided in RSMo § 67.2691. A video service provider shall make available for inspection all records pertaining to gross revenues at the location where such records are kept in the normal course of business. 
3.  Late payments shall accrue interest due to the city compounded monthly at one and one-half percent or such other maximum rate as may be established by law. 
D.  Customer service requirements. All video service providers and telecommunications and data transmission service providers operating and/or providing service to customers in the city shall meet or exceed all minimum customer service requirements set forth in the Act or in any other state or federal statutory or regulatory standards for customer service and consumer protection. 
E.  Reserved. 
F.  Compliance with other regulations. All providers of video and other data, image, audio and worldwide web access service shall comply with all restrictions and requirements of this Code pertaining to access to and use of public rights-of-way (hereinafter sometime referred to as "ROW") and to land use in the various zoning districts of the city. 
(Ord. No. 4459, § 3, 10-16-17) 
Section 2. - Reserved. 
Section 3. - Public right-of-way use regulations.

    Within means in, along, under, over, or across rights-of-way. 
B.  Public ROW permits. 
1.  Application requirements. 
(a)  Any person desiring to excavate, bore, tunnel or otherwise disturb any public ROW must first apply for and obtain a ROW permit by notifying the director or public works of the plan to work in the ROW and paying the appropriate fee, in addition to any other building permit, license, easement, franchise, or authorization required by law. In the event of a need for emergency ROW work, the person conducting the work shall as soon as practicable notify the city of the location of the work and shall apply for the required ROW permit as soon as practicable following the commencement of the work, not to exceed the third business day thereafter. The director may design and issue general permits for emergency ROW work for several different locations or throughout the city. 
(b)  The director may design and make available standard forms for such applications, requiring such information as allowed by law and as the director determines in his or her discretion to be necessary and consistent with the provisions of this ordinance and to accomplish the purposes of this ordinance. Each application shall at minimum contain the following information for the proposed ROW work, unless otherwise waived by the director: 
(i)  The name, address and telephone number of a representative whom the city may notify or contact at any time (i.e., 24 hours per day seven days per week) concerning the work; 
(ii)  If different from the applicant, the name, address, and telephone number of the person on whose behalf the proposed work is to be performed; 
(iii)  A description of the proposed work, including a conceptual master plan and an engineering site plan or other technical drawing or depiction showing the nature, dimensions, location, and description of the applicant's proposed work or facilities, their proximity to other facilities that may be affected by the proposed work, and the number of street crossings and their locations and dimensions, if applicable; 
(iv)  Projected commencement and termination dates and anticipated duration of the work or, if such dates are unknown, a representation that the applicant shall provide the director with reasonable advance notice of such dates once they are determined; 
(v)  Copies of any required certificates of insurance or performance and maintenance bonds. 
(c)  The information required by the application may be submitted in the form maintained by the applicant, provided it is responsive to the application's requirements, and the applicant shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time to complete the application based on the amount of data or information requested or required. 
(d)  Each such application shall be accompanied by the following payments: 
(i)  An application fee approved by the city to cover the cost of processing the application; 
(ii)  Any other amounts due to the city from the applicant, including but not limited to prior delinquent fees, costs, and any loss, damage, or expense suffered by the city because of the applicant's prior work in the rights-of-way or for any emergency actions taken by the city, but the director may modify this requirement to the extent the director determines any such fees to be in good-faith dispute. 
(e)  Applicants shall participate in any joint planning, construction and advance notification of such work, including coordination and consolidation of any excavation of or disturbance to the rights-of-way, as directed by the director. When deemed necessary to accomplish the goals of this Section and to the extent permitted by law the city reserves the right, when feasible and reasonable, to require the sharing of facilities by ROW users. Applicants shall cooperate with each other and other ROW users and the city for the best, most efficient, least intrusive, most aesthetic, and least obtrusive use of the rights-of-way. 
(f)  The director shall establish procedures allowing applicants to ascertain whether existing capacity may be available from other persons utilizing the rights-of-way along the intended path of any proposed work. The director shall also maintain indexes of all ROW permits issued, both by the ROW user and by the affected rights-of-way. 
2.  Application review and determination. 
(a)  The director shall promptly review each completed application for a public ROW permit and shall grant or deny all such applications as provided herein within 31 days of receipt thereof. Unless the application is denied, the director shall issue a ROW permit upon determining that the applicant (i) has submitted all necessary information, (ii) has paid the appropriate fees and (iii) is in full compliance with this ordinance and all other city ordinances. The director may establish procedures for bulk processing of applications and periodic payment of fees to avoid excessive processing and accounting costs. 
(b)  It is the intention of the city that interference with, damage to, excavation or disruption of, or the placement of facilities within the city's rights-of-way should be minimized and limited in scope to the extent allowed by law to achieve the purposes of this ordinance. When reasonable and necessary to accomplish such purposes, the director may require as alternatives to the proposed ROW work either less disruptive methods or different locations for facilities, provided that any required alternative (i) shall not increase expenses by more than ten percent of the applicant's costs for the work as proposed, (ii) shall not result in a decline of service quality, and (iii) shall be competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory. The director shall justify to the applicant that the required alternative is reasonable and necessary. 
(c)  Upon receipt of an application, the director shall determine whether any portion of the rights-of-way will be affected by the proposed work and whether the interference, disruption, or placement of facilities will be more than minor in nature. In determining whether the proposed work is more than minor in nature the director shall consider the nature and scope of the work, its location and duration, and its effect on the rights-of-way, the use thereof, and neighboring properties. 
(i)  If the applicant can show to the director's reasonable satisfaction that the work involves no interference, disruption, excavation, or damage to, or only minor interference, with, the rights-of-way, or that the work does not involve the placement of facilities or involves time-sensitive maintenance, then the director shall promptly grant the ROW permit. 
(ii)  If the director determines that the effect on the rights-of-way will be more than minor in nature and no exemption under the above paragraph (c)(i) or any other provision of this ordinance applies, the director shall schedule and coordinate the work and grant the ROW permit accordingly. When reasonable and necessary to accomplish the purposes of this ordinance, the director may postpone issuance of a ROW permit, and may give public notice of the application in an attempt to identify whether other person(s) intend to do work in the same area within a reasonable period of time, so that all ROW work in the area can be coordinated. Due regard shall be accorded applicants that are required by any law, rule, regulation, license, or franchise to provide service to the area defined in the application. The director shall not impose any coordination or scheduling requirements that prevent or unreasonably delay an applicant's access to the public ROW or that create a barrier to entry. 
(d)  Each public ROW permit issued by the director shall include: 
(i)  Projected commencement and termination dates or, if such dates are unknown at the time the permit is issued, a provision requiring the ROW user to provide the director with reasonable advance notice of such dates once they are determined; 
(ii)  Length of affected rights-of-way, number of road crossings, and identification and description of any pavement or curb cuts included in the work; 
(iii)  Information regarding scheduling and coordination of work, if necessary; 
(iv)  The location of any of the applicant's facilities, both those proposed and existing, and the location of any known facilities owned by another person that may be affected by the proposed work; 
(v)  An acknowledgement and representation by the applicant to comply with the terms and conditions of the ROW permit and this ordinance; and 
(vi)  Such conditions and requirements as are deemed reasonably necessary by the director to protect structures and other facilities in the rights-of-way from damage, to restore such rights-of-way, and any structures or facilities, to ensure the reasonable continuity and sight-lines of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and to protect property values, the aesthetics of adjoining properties and neighborhoods, and the public health, safety and welfare. 
(e)  The director may deny an application after consultation with the city administrator, if denial is deemed to be in the public interest, for the following reasons: 
(i)  Delinquent fees, costs or expenses owed by the applicant; 
(ii)  Failure to provide information required by the application or this ordinance; 
(iii)  The applicant being in violation of the provisions of this ordinance or other pertinent and applicable city ordinances; 
(iv)  Failure to return the ROW to its previous condition under previously issued ROW permits or after prior excavations by the applicant; 
(v)  For reasons of environmental, historic or cultural sensitivity, as defined by applicable federal, state or local law; 
(vi)  For the applicant's refusal to comply with alternative ROW work methods, locations, or other reasonable conditions required by the director; and 
(vii)  For any other reason to protect the public health, safety and welfare, provided that such denial does not fall within the exclusive authority of the state public service commission or interfere with a ROW user's right of eminent domain of private property, and provided further that such denial is imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis. 
3.  Permit revocation and ordinance violations. 
(a)  The director may revoke a public ROW permit, after consultation with the city administrator, without fee refund after notice and an opportunity to cure, but only in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of the permit or this ordinance. Prior to revocation the director shall provide written notice to the ROW user identifying any substantial breach and allowing a reasonable period of time not longer than 30 days to cure the problem, which cure period may be immediate if certain activities must be stopped to protect the public safety. The cure period shall be extended by the director on good cause shown by the ROW user. A substantial breach includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
(i)  A material violation of a provision of the ROW permit or this ordinance; 
(ii)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the ROW permit or this ordinance, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its residents; 
(iii)  A material misrepresentation of fact in the ROW permit application; 
(iv)  A failure to complete ROW work by the date specified in the ROW permit, unless an extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete the work is due to reasons beyond the ROW user's control; and 
(v)  A failure to correct, upon reasonable notice and opportunity to cure as specified by the director, work that does not conform to applicable national safety ordinances, industry construction standards, this ordinance or any other applicable ordinances, provided that city standards are no more stringent than those of a national safety ordinance. 
(b)  Any breach of the terms and conditions of a ROW permit shall also be deemed a violation of this ordinance, and in lieu of revocation the director may initiate prosecution of the ROW user for such violation. 
C.  Work in the public ROW. 
1.  Jurisdiction, inspection and stop work orders. 
(a)  All facilities and ROW work shall be subject to inspection by the city and the supervision of all federal, state and local authorities having jurisdiction in such matters to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations, and the ROW permit. 
(b)  The director shall have full access to all portions of the ROW work and may issue stop work orders and corrective orders to prevent unauthorized work or substandard work as established in subsection 7 hereof. Such orders: 
(i)  May be delivered personally or by certified mail to the address(es) listed on the application for the ROW permit or the person in charge of the construction site at the time of delivery; 
(ii)  Shall state that substandard work or work not authorized by the ROW permit is being carried out, summarize the substandard or unauthorized work and provide a period of not longer than 30 days to cure the problem, which cure period may be immediate if certain activities must be stopped to protect the public safety; and 
(iii)  May be enforced by equitable action in the Associate Circuit Court of Cooper County, Missouri, and in such case the person responsible for the substandard or unauthorized work shall be liable for all costs and expenses incurred by the city in enforcing such orders, including reasonable attorney's fees, in addition to any and all penalties established in this ordinance. 
2.  Underground facilities. 
(a)  In conjunction with the city's long-standing policy favoring underground construction, no person may erect, construct or install new poles or other facilities above the surface of the rights-of-way without the written permission of the city, unless the city's authority has been pre-empted by state or federal law. Such permission may be granted through a ROW permit when other similar facilities exist above-ground or when conditions are such that underground construction is impossible, impractical or economically unfeasible, as determined by the city, and when in the city's judgment the above-ground construction has minimal aesthetic impact on the area where the construction is proposed. 
(b)  During installation of facilities and to the extent authorized by law, existing underground conduits shall be used whenever feasible and permitted by the owner thereof. 
(c)  In the case of new construction or property development, the developer or property owner shall give reasonable written notice, to other potential ROW users as directed by the city, of the particular date on which open trenching will be available for installation of facilities. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring facilities within the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except that if the facilities are not installed within five working days of the date the trenches are available, as designated in the notice given by the developer or property owner, then once the trenches are thereafter closed, the cost of new trenching shall be borne by the person installing the facilities. 
3.  Above-ground facilities. 
(a)  The director may designate certain locations or facilities in the ROW to be excluded from use by the applicant for its facilities, including, but not limited to (i) ornamental or similar specially-designed street lights, (ii) designated historic areas, (iii) facilities, equipment, structures, or locations that do not have electrical service adequate or appropriate for the proposed facilities or cannot safely bear the weight or wind loading thereof, (iv) facilities, equipment, structures, or locations that in the reasonable judgment of the director are incompatible with the proposed facilities or would be rendered unsafe or unstable by the installation, and (v) facilities, equipment, structures, or locations that have been designated or planned for other use or are not otherwise available for use by the applicant due to engineering, technological, proprietary, legal, or other limitations or restrictions. 
(b)  Above-ground facilities shall be a neutral color and shall not be bright, reflective, or metallic. Black, gray and tan shall be considered neutral colors, as shall any color that blends with the surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the facilities. Facilities shall be located in such a manner as to reduce or eliminate their visibility. A sight-proof landscape screen may be required for any authorized above-ground facilities taller than three feet in height or covering in excess of four square feet in size. Such screening shall be sufficient to reasonably conceal the facility. A landscape plan identifying the size and species of landscaping materials shall be approved by the director prior to installation of any facility requiring landscape screening. The person having facilities within the ROW shall be responsible for the installation, repair, or replacement of screening materials. Alternative screening or concealment may be approved by the director to the extent it meets or exceeds the purposes of these requirements. 
(c)  Above-ground facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as not to emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise and shall comply with all other applicable regulations and standards established by the city or state or federal law. 
(d)  If the application of this subsection excludes locations for above-ground facilities to the extent that the exclusion conflicts with the reasonable requirements of the applicant, the director shall cooperate in good faith with the applicant to attempt to find suitable alternatives, but such alternatives may exceed the cost increase limitation established by section 3.B.2(b) and the city shall not be required to incur any financial cost or to acquire new locations for the applicant. 
4.  Relocation of equipment and facilities. 
(a)  In the event of an emergency, or where construction equipment or facilities create or are contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the city may, to the extent allowed by law, remove, re-lay, or relocate such construction equipment, or the pertinent parts of such facilities, without charge to the city for such action or for restoration or repair. The city shall attempt to notify the person having facilities within the ROW prior to taking such action, but the inability to do so shall not prevent same. Thereafter, the city shall notify the person having facilities within the ROW as soon as practicable. 
(b)  At the city's direction, all facilities shall be moved underground and the cost shall be solely the obligation of the person having facilities within the ROW (or as otherwise allowed or required by law). 
(c)  At the city's direction, a person having facilities within the ROW shall protect, support, disconnect, relocate, or remove facilities, at its own cost and expense, when necessary to accommodate the construction, improvement, expansion, relocation, or maintenance of streets or other public works or to protect the ROW or the public health, safety, or welfare. 
(d)  A person having facilities within the ROW shall, on the reasonable request of any person and after reasonable advance written notice, protect, support, disconnect, relocate, or remove facilities to accommodate such person, and the actual cost, reasonably incurred, of such actions shall be paid by the person requesting such action. The person having facilities within the ROW taking such action may require such payment in advance. 
(e)  Rather than relocate facilities as requested or directed, a ROW user may abandon the facilities if approved by the city as provided in subsection 6 of this section. 
(f)  No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of property, and no person shall be entitled to any compensation therefor. No location of any facilities within the rights-of-way shall be a vested interest. 
5.  Property repair and alterations. 
(a)  During any public ROW work, the person doing the work shall protect from damage any and all existing structures and property belonging to the city and any other person. Any and all rights-of-way, public property, or private property disturbed or damaged during the work shall be repaired or replaced by the person doing the work or the person on whose behalf the work is being done, and such person shall immediately notify the owner of the fact of any damaged property. Such repair or replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time specified by the director and to the director's satisfaction. 
(b)  Any alteration to the existing water mains, sewerage or drainage system or to any city, state or other public structures or facilities in the rights-of-way required on account of the construction, installation, repair or maintenance of facilities within the rights-of-way shall be made at the sole cost and expense of the owner of such facilities. 
6.  Removal, abandonment, transfer, and relocation of facilities. 
(a)  If a person having facilities within the ROW (i) installs the facilities within the ROW without having complied with the requirements of this ordinance or (ii) abandons the facilities, the city may require the removal of the facilities, remove the facilities at the expense of the person having facilities within the ROW, or require the transfer of the facilities as provided herein. 
(b)  If the city requires removal of the facilities, the person shall obtain a ROW permit and shall abide by all requirements of this ordinance. The liability, indemnity, insurance and bonding requirements required herein shall continue in full force and effect during and after the period of removal and restoration and until full compliance by the person with the terms and conditions of the ROW permit and the requirements of this ordinance. 
(c)  If the person fails to remove the facilities after having been directed to do so, the city may, to the extent permitted by law, have the removal done at the person's expense. Alternatively, the city may permit the abandonment, without removal, of the facilities if the director determines that abandonment is not likely to prevent or significantly impair the future use, repair, excavation, maintenance, or construction of the ROW. 
(d)  If the person fails to remove the facilities after having been directed to do so, the city may, to the extent permitted by law, decide that the ownership of the facilities should be transferred to the city, or to such person as directed by the city. In either case the owner of the facilities shall submit a written instrument, satisfactory in form to city, transferring to the city, or to such person as directed by the city, ownership of the facilities. The city may sell, assign, or transfer all or part of the facilities so transferred. 
(e)  The city shall not remove or seek to possess or transfer the facilities until 30 days have passed following written notice by the director to the person having facilities within the ROW of the city's intent to so act. The director may choose not to act on good cause shown by the person having facilities within the ROW. 
7.  Standards for public ROW work. 
(a)  Except for emergency ROW work as provided in section 3.B.1(a), ROW work shall be performed only upon issuance and in accordance with the requirements of a ROW permit to excavate, bore or tunnel. At all times during the work, ROW permits shall be conspicuously displayed at the work site and shall be available for inspection by the director. 
(b)  If at any time it appears that the duration or scope of the ROW work is or will become materially different from that allowed by the ROW permit, the ROW user shall inform the director. The director may issue a waiver, an extension or a revised ROW permit, or require that the ROW user reapply for a ROW permit in accordance with all requirements of this ordinance. 
(c)  ROW users shall not open or encumber more of the rights-of-way than is reasonably necessary to complete the ROW work in the most expeditious manner or allow excavations to remain open longer than is necessary to complete the work. 
(d)  All ROW work that affects vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected at the ROW user's expense. The ROW user shall be responsible for providing adequate traffic control to the area surrounding the work as determined by the director. 
(e)  The ROW user shall perform the ROW work at such times that will allow the least interference with the normal flow of traffic and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood, as permitted by the director. Unless otherwise provided by the director in the permit, non-emergency ROW work on arterial and collector streets may not be accomplished during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in order to minimize disruption of traffic flow. 
(f)  The ROW user shall notify the city no less than three (3) working days in advance of any ROW work that would require any street closure or would reduce traffic flow to less than two (2) lanes of moving traffic for more than four hours. Except in the event of emergency ROW work, no such closure shall take place without notice and prior authorization from the city. 
(g)  All ROW work shall be in accordance with all applicable sections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the National Electrical Safety Code, and other federal, state, or local laws and regulations that may apply, including, without limitation, local health, safety, construction and zoning ordinances, and laws and accepted industry practices, all as hereafter may be amended or adopted. In the event of a conflict among ordinances and standards, the most stringent ordinance or standard shall apply (except insofar as that ordinance or standard, if followed, would result in facilities that could not meet requirements of federal, state or local law). 
(h)  All facilities shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners, other ROW users and the city. Facilities shall not be placed where they will disrupt or interfere with other facilities or public improvements, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents and businesses in the city or public improvements. 
(i)  All facilities shall be of good and durable quality. 
(j)  All ROW work shall be conducted in accordance with good engineering practices, performed by experienced and properly trained personnel so as not to endanger any person or property or to unreasonably interfere in any manner with the rights-of-ways or legal rights-of-any property owner, including the city, or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic. 
(k)  All safety practices required by law shall be used during ROW work, including commonly accepted methods and devices to prevent failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public. 
(l)  Any contractor or subcontractor of a ROW user must be properly licensed under laws of the state and all applicable local ordinances, and each contractor or subcontractor shall have the same obligations with respect to its work as a ROW user would have pursuant to this ordinance. A ROW user (i) must ensure that contractors, subcontractors and all employees performing ROW work are trained and experienced, (ii) shall be responsible for ensuring that all work is performed consistent with the ROW permit and applicable law, (iii) shall be fully responsible for all acts or omissions of contractors or subcontractors, (iv) shall be responsible for promptly correcting acts or omissions by any contractor or subcontractor, and (v) shall implement a quality control program to ensure that the work is properly performed. 
(m)  A ROW user shall not place or cause to be placed any sort of signs, advertisements or other extraneous markings on the facilities or in the ROW, whether relating to the ROW user or any other person, except such necessary minimal markings approved by the city as necessary to identify the facilities for service, repair, maintenance or emergency purposes or as may be otherwise required to be affixed by applicable law or regulation. 
(n)  Unless otherwise approved in writing by the city, a ROW user shall not remove, cut, or damage any trees, or their roots, within the ROW. 
(o)  Street crossings will be bored at the direction of the director. 
8.  Restoring and maintaining the public rights-of-way. 
(a)  To complete any ROW work, the ROW user shall restore the ROW and surrounding areas, including but not limited to any pavement, foundation, concrete slabs or curbs, screening, landscaping, or vegetation and shall comply with other reasonable conditions of the director. Restoration of the ROW shall be completed within the dates specified in the ROW permit unless the director issues a waiver, extension or a new or revised ROW permit. 
(b)  It shall be the duty of any person making an excavation in the ROW to backfill such excavations and restore the surface in accordance with the city's minimum prescribed standards for such surfaces or the following standards, as determined by the director. 
(i)  If the excavations are made in the improved portion of the ROW, 12 inches of granular backfill will be placed over exposed facilities, and controlled low strength material (CLSM) will fill the hole within eight inches of the finished surface for concrete pavements. There will be a plastic membrane placed between the rock base and the CLSM to prevent the material from bleeding into the rock base. The remaining eight inches will be restored by placing a 28-day minimum strength, 4,000 psi concrete mix. 
(ii)  If the excavations are made in the improved portion of an asphalt or combination street, 12 inches of granular backfill will be placed over exposed facilities, and CLSM will fill the hole within nine inches of the finished surface. There will be a plastic membrane placed between the rock base and the CLSM to prevent the material from bleeding into the rock base. The remaining nine inches will be restored by placing a six-inch thick, 28-day minimum strength, 4,500 psi concrete mix under a three-inch asphalt concrete lift of type C mix to meet existing grades. 
(iii)  Construction of asphalt driveway entrances in residential ROW will be constructed of six inches of compacted rock base and three inches of BP-2 surface course asphalt concrete mix. Construction of asphalt driveway entrances in commercial ROW will be constructed of four inches of compacted rock base, 7.5 inches of MoDOT BP-2 wedge course and three inches of BP-2 surface course asphalt concrete mix. Concrete driveway approaches will consist of a four-inch compacted rock base and be a minimum of six inches thick in residential ROW and eight inches thick in commercial ROW. 
(c)  If a ROW user fails to restore the ROW within the date specified either by the ROW permit, or any extension thereof as granted by the director, the city may perform its own restoration. The city may also opt to perform its own restoration regardless of any failure by the ROW user, in which case the ROW permit, or any amendment or revision thereto, shall note such option. In either event, if the city performs the restoration the ROW user shall be responsible for reimbursing the city's reasonable actual restoration costs within 30 days of invoice. 
(d)  Every ROW user to whom a ROW permit has been granted shall guarantee for a period of four years the restoration of the ROW in the area where the ROW user conducted excavation. During this period the ROW user shall, upon notification from the director, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary as required by the director. Said work shall be completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 calendar days from receipt of the director's notice unless otherwise permitted by the director. If a ROW user fails to restore the ROW within the time specified, the city may perform the work and the ROW user shall be responsible for reimbursing the city's reasonable actual restoration costs within 30 days of invoice. The director may extend the cure period on good cause shown. 
(e)  A ROW user shall not be relieved of the obligation to complete the necessary right-of-way restoration and maintenance because of the existence of any performance bond required by this ordinance. 
9.  Any person performing ROW work shall provide written notice to all property owners within 185 feet of the site at least 48 hours prior to any installation, replacement or expansion of its facilities. Notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of work to be done, the location of work, and the time and duration of the work. 
D.  Bonds; insurance; surety; indemnification; penalties. 
1.  Performance and maintenance bonds. 
(a)  Prior to any public ROW work, a ROW user shall establish in the city's favor a performance and maintenance bond in an amount to be determined by the director to ensure the restoration of the rights-of-way. The bond shall continue in full force and effect for a period of 24 months following completion of the work. The director shall have the authority to extend the maintenance bond period for up to an additional 24 months. The director may waive this requirement when the work involves no or only minor disruption or damage to the rights-of-way. The director shall waive this requirement when the ROW user has $25,000,000.00 in net assets and does not have a history of noncompliance with state and local regulations. 
(b)  If a ROW user fails to complete the ROW work in a safe, timely, and competent manner, or if the completed restorative work fails without remediation within the time period for the bond (as determined by the director), then after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the ROW user and the cost of completing work within or restoring the rights-of-way, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the bond. The city may also recover against the bond any amount recoverable against a security fund or letter of credit where such amount exceeds that available under a security fund or letter of credit. 
(c)  Upon completion of ROW work to the satisfaction of the director and upon lapse of the bond period, including any extension by the director, the city shall release the bond. 
(d)  The bond shall be issued by a surety with an "A" or better rating of insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition, shall be subject to the approval of the city's attorney and shall contain the following endorsement: 
"This bond may not be cancelled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty (60) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew." 
(e)  In lieu of the bond required herein, the ROW user may establish in the city's favor such other security as the director may determine to be commensurate with the noted bonding requirements, including but not limited to an annual bond to be maintained in the minimum amount of $25,000.00. 
2.  Insurance. 
(a)  All public ROW users shall maintain, for the duration of any ROW work and, when applicable, for as long as the ROW user has facilities within the rights-of-way, at least the following liability insurance coverage: worker's compensation and employer liability insurance to meet all requirements of Missouri law and commercial general liability insurance with respect to the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facilities, and the conduct of the ROW user's business in the city, in the minimum amounts of: 
(i)  $2,000,000.00 for property damage resulting from any one accident; 
(ii)  $5,000,000.00 for personal bodily injury or death resulting from any one accident; and 
(iii)  $2,000,000.00 for all other types of liability. 
These insurance requirements shall not be construed to limit the liability of any person or to impose any liability on the city or to waive any sovereign immunity. 
(b)  All insurance policies shall be with sureties qualified to do business in the state, with an "A" or better rating of insurance by Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition, and in a form approved by the city. 
(c)  All insurance policies shall be available for review by the city, and a ROW user having facilities within the rights-of-way shall keep on file with the city current certificates of insurance. 
(d)  All general liability insurance policies shall name the city, its officers, boards, board members, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees as additional insureds and shall further provide that any cancellation or reduction in coverage shall not be effective unless 30 days' prior written notice thereof has been given to the director. A ROW user shall not cancel any required insurance policy without submission of proof that it has obtained alternative insurance that complies with this ordinance. 
(e)  The director may exempt in writing from these insurance requirements any self-insured ROW user, provided that the ROW user demonstrates to the director's satisfaction that the ROW user's self-insurance plan is commensurate with said requirements and that the ROW user has sufficient resources to meet all potential risks, liabilities and obligations contemplated by the requirements of this ordinance. The director may require a security fund or letter of credit as a condition to a self-insured's exemption. The director shall waive this requirement when the ROW user has $25,000,000.00 in net assets and does not have a history of noncompliance with applicable regulatory law. 
3.  Indemnification. 
(a)  Any ROW user granted a ROW permit, and any person having facilities within the rights-of-way, as partial consideration for the privilege granted, shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the city, its officials, boards, board members, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, and judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of (i) any ROW work, including but not limited to the construction, maintenance, repair, or replacement of the of facilities, (ii) the operation of its facilities, (iii) failure to secure consents from landowners, or (iv) any actions taken or omissions made by the person pursuant to the authority of this ordinance. 
(b)  The foregoing indemnity provisions include, but are not limited to, the city's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit, or proceeding prior to the person assuming such defense. The city shall notify a person of claims and suits within seven business days of its actual knowledge of the existence of such claim, suit, or proceeding. Once a person assumes such defense, the city may at its option continue to participate in the defense at its own expense. 
(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this ordinance, the city shall not be so indemnified or reimbursed in relation to any amounts attributable to (i) the city's own negligence, willful misconduct, intentional or criminal acts, or (ii) the city acting in a proprietary capacity to deliver service(s) within the city. 
(d)  Recovery by the city of any amounts under insurance, a performance bond, or otherwise does not limit a person's duty to indemnify the city in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a person of amounts owed to the city, or in any respect prevent the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have. 
4.  Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this ordinance shall, upon conviction by the city's municipal court, be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 or by imprisonment not to exceed 90 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day the violation continues may be charged as a separate offense. 
E.  Appeals. 
1.  The director, after consultation with the city administrator, shall make a final determination as to any matter concerning the grant, denial or revocation of a ROW permit as provided in this ordinance. On the request of an applicant or a ROW user and within a reasonable period of time, the director also shall make a final determination as to any other issue relating to the use of the ROW, the imposition of any fee or the application of any provision of this ordinance, provided, however, that this review shall not apply to matters being prosecuted in the municipal court. Any final determination of the director shall be subject to review as provided herein. 
2.  Any person aggrieved by a final determination of the director may appeal in writing to the city administrator within ten business days thereof. The appeal shall assert specific grounds for review, and the city administrator shall render a decision on the appeal within 15 business days of receipt affirming, reversing, or modifying the determination of the director. The city administrator may extend this time period for the purpose of any investigation or hearing deemed necessary. A decision affirming the director's determination shall be in writing and supported by findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision. 
3.  Any person aggrieved by the final determination of the city administrator may file a petition for review pursuant to RSMo ch. 536, as amended, in the Circuit Court of Cooper County. Such petition shall be filed within 30 days after the city administrator's final determination. 
F.  Miscellaneous. 
1.  After the completion of public ROW work the ROW user shall provide to the city as-built drawings, maps or other comparable records as determined by the director, drawn to scale and certified to the city as reasonably depicting the location of all facilities constructed pursuant to the ROW permit. Such records may be provided to the director in the form maintained by the ROW user, but when available to the ROW user, shall be submitted in automated formats that are compatible with city systems, as determined by the director, or in hard copy otherwise. 
2.  Upon failure of a ROW user to commence, pursue or complete any ROW work required by law or by the provisions of this ordinance to be done in any street, within the time prescribed and to the reasonable satisfaction of the city, the city may, at its option, after 30 days notice, cause such work to be done and the ROW user shall pay to the city the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the city to the ROW user within 30 days after receipt of such itemized report. 
3.  Upon ten days' written notice and with the supervision of the city, or as otherwise provided by law, a ROW user shall have the authority to trim trees that overhang rights-of-way of the city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with its facilities, at its own expense subject to the supervision and direction of the city. Nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the trimming of trees on private property without permission of the property owner. All cut materials shall be properly disposed. 
4.  During ROW work by a ROW user the city shall have the right to install, and to thereafter maintain, at its own cost in any excavation to or other applicable disturbance of the ROW any parallel facilities of its own that do not unreasonably interfere with the operations of other facilities. 
5.  Nothing in this ordinance shall be in preference or hindrance to the right of the city and any board, authority, commission or public service corporation of the city to use or occupy the rights-of-way or to perform or carry on any public works or public improvements of any description. 
(Ord. No. 4459, § 3, 10-16-17) 
Section 4. - Zoning and police power regulations and facilities on private property.

    Director. The city's public works director or such other person designated to administer and enforce this ordinance. 
    Facilities. A network or system, or any part thereof, used for providing or delivering a service and consisting of one or more lines, pipes, irrigation systems, wires, cables, fibers, conduit facilities, cabinets, poles, vaults, pedestals, boxes, appliances, antennas, transmitters, radios, towers, gates, meters, appurtenances, or other equipment. 
    Facilities permit. A permit granted by the city for placement of facilities on private property. 
    Person. An individual, partnership, limited liability corporation or partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, organization, corporation, or other entity, or any lawful successor thereto or transferee thereof. 
    Service. Providing or delivering an economic good or an article of commerce, including, but not limited to gas, telephone, cable television, internet, open video systems, video services, alarm systems, steam, electricity, water, telegraph, data transmission, petroleum pipelines, sanitary or storm water sewerage or any similar or related service, to one or more persons located within or outside of the city using facilities located within the city. 
B.  Facilities permits. 
1.  Any person desiring to place facilities on private property must first apply for and obtain a facilities permit, in addition to any other building permit, license, easement, franchise, or authorization required by law. The director may design and make available standard forms for such applications, requiring such information as allowed by law and as the director determines in his or her discretion to be necessary and consistent with the provisions of this ordinance and to accomplish the purposes of this ordinance. Each application shall at minimum contain the following information, unless otherwise waived by the director: 
(a)  The name of the person on whose behalf the facilities are to be installed and the name, address, and telephone number of a representative whom the city may notify or contact at any time (i.e., 24 hours per day seven days per week) concerning the facilities; 
(b)  A description of the proposed work, including a site plan and such plans or technical drawings or depictions showing the nature, dimensions, and description of the facilities, their location, and their proximity to other facilities that may be affected by their installation. 
2.  Each such application shall be accompanied by an application fee approved by the city to cover the cost of processing the application. 
3.  Application review and determination. 
(a)  The director shall promptly review each application within 31 days prior to granting or denying the application. Unless the application is denied pursuant to subparagraph (d) hereof, the director shall issue a facilities permit upon determining that the applicant (i) has submitted all necessary information, (ii) has paid the appropriate fees and (iii) is in full compliance with this ordinance and all other city ordinances. The director may establish procedures for bulk processing of applications and periodic payment of fees to avoid excessive processing and accounting costs. 
(b)  It is the intention of the city that proposed facilities will not impair public safety, harm property values or significant sight-lines, or degrade the aesthetics of the adjoining properties or neighborhood, and that the placement and appearance of facilities on private property should be minimized and limited in scope to the extent allowed by law to achieve the purposes of this section. To accomplish such purposes the director may impose conditions on facilities permits, including alternative landscaping, designs, or locations, provided that such conditions are reasonable and necessary, shall not result in a decline of service quality, and are competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory. 
(c)  An applicant receiving a facilities permit shall promptly notify the director of any material changes in the information submitted in the application or included in the permit. The director may issue a revised facilities permit or require that the applicant reapply for a facilities permit. 
(d)  The director may deny an application, if denial is deemed to be in the public interest, for the following reasons: 
(i)  Delinquent fees, costs or expenses owed by the applicant; 
(ii)  Failure to provide required information; 
(iii)  The applicant being in violation of the provisions of this ordinance or other city ordinances; 
(iv)  For reasons of environmental, historic or cultural sensitivity, as defined by applicable federal, state or local law; 
(v)  For the applicant's refusal to comply with reasonable conditions required by the director; and 
(vi)  For any other reason to protect the public health, safety and welfare, provided that such denial does not fall within the exclusive authority of the state public service commission and is imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis. 
4.  Permit revocation and ordinance violations. 
(a)  The director, after consultation with the city administrator, may revoke a facilities permit without fee refund after notice and an opportunity to cure, but only in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of the permit or this ordinance. Prior to revocation the director shall provide written notice to the responsible person identifying any substantial breach and allowing a reasonable period of time not longer than 30 days to cure the problem, which cure period may be immediate if certain activities must be stopped to protect the public safety. The cure period shall be extended by the director on good cause shown. A substantial breach includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
(i)  A material violation of the facilities permit or this ordinance; 
(ii)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the permit or this ordinance, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its residents; 
(iii)  A material misrepresentation of fact in the permit application; 
(iv)  A failure to complete facilities installation by the date specified in the permit, unless an extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete the work is due to reasons beyond the applicant's control; and 
(v)  A failure to correct, upon reasonable notice and opportunity to cure as specified by the director, work that does not conform to applicable national safety ordinances, industry construction standards, or the city's pertinent and applicable ordinances, including but not limited to this ordinance, provided that city standards are no more stringent than those of a national safety ordinance. 
(b)  Any breach of the terms and conditions of a facilities permit shall also be deemed a violation of this ordinance, and in lieu of revocation the director may initiate prosecution of the applicant or the facilities owner for such violation. 
5.  Appeals. 
(a)  Any person aggrieved by a final determination of the director and/or city administrator may appeal in writing to the city council within ten business days thereof. The appeal shall assert specific grounds for review, and the city council shall render a decision on the appeal within 15 business days of its receipt affirming, reversing or modifying the determination of the director/city administrator. The city council may extend this time period for the purpose of any investigation or hearing deemed necessary. A decision affirming the director's/administrator's determination shall be in writing and supported by findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision. Any person aggrieved by the final determination of the city council may file a petition for review pursuant to RSMo ch. 536, as amended, in the Circuit Court of Cooper County. Such petition shall be filed within 30 days after the city council's final determination. 
C.  Facilities regulations. 
1.  The following general regulations apply to the placement and appearance of facilities: 
(a)  Facilities shall be placed underground, except when other similar facilities exist above-ground or when conditions are such that underground construction is impossible, impractical or economically unfeasible, as determined by the city, and when in the city's judgment the above-ground construction has minimal aesthetic impact on the area where the construction is proposed. Facilities shall not be located so as to interfere, or be likely to interfere, with any public facilities or use of public property. 
(b)  Facilities shall be located in such a manner as to reduce or eliminate their visibility. Non-residential zoning districts are preferred to residential zoning districts. Preferred locations in order of priority in both type districts are (a) thoroughfare landscape easements, (b) rear yards, and (c) street side yards on a corner lot behind the front yard setback. Placements within side yards not bordered by a street or within front yards are discouraged. 
(c)  Facilities shall be a neutral color and shall not be bright, reflective, or metallic. Black, gray and tan shall be considered neutral colors, as shall any color that blends with the surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the facilities. Sight-proof screening, landscape or otherwise, may be required for facilities taller than three feet in height or covering in excess of four square feet in size. Such screening shall be sufficient to reasonably conceal the facility. A landscape plan identifying the size and species of landscaping materials shall be approved by the director prior to installation of any facility requiring landscape screening. The person responsible for the facilities shall be responsible for the installation, repair, or replacement of screening materials. Alternative concealment may be approved by the director to the extent it meets or exceeds the purposes of these requirements. 
(d)  Facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a safe manner and so as to not emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise and in accordance with all applicable provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the National Electrical Safety Code, and all other applicable federal, state, or local laws and regulations. 
(e)  No person shall place or cause to be placed any sort of signs, advertisements, or other extraneous markings on the facilities, except such necessary minimal markings approved by the city as necessary to identify the facilities for service, repair, maintenance or emergency purposes or as may be otherwise required to be affixed by applicable law or regulation. 
(f)  If the application of this subsection excludes locations for facilities to the extent that the exclusion conflicts with the reasonable requirements of the applicant, the director shall cooperate in good faith with the applicant to attempt to find suitable alternatives, but the city shall not be required to incur any financial cost or to acquire new locations for the applicant. 
2.  Any person installing, repairing, maintaining, removing, or operating facilities, and the person on whose behalf the work is being done, shall protect from damage any and all existing structures and property belonging to the city and any other person. Any and all rights-of-way, public property, or private property disturbed or damaged during the work shall be repaired or replaced, and the responsible person shall immediately notify the owner of the fact of the damaged property. Such repair or replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time specified by the director and to the director's satisfaction. 
3.  The applicant shall provide written notice to all property owners within 185 feet of the site at least seven days prior to any installation, replacement or expansion of its facilities. Notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of work to be done, the location of work, and the time and duration of the work. 
4.  At the city's direction, a person owning or controlling facilities shall protect, support, disconnect, relocate, or remove facilities, at its own cost and expense, when necessary to accommodate the construction, improvement, expansion, relocation, or maintenance of streets or other public works or to protect the ROW or the public health, safety, or welfare. 
5.  If a person installs facilities without having complied with the requirements of this ordinance or abandons the facilities, said person shall remove the facilities, and if the person fails to remove the facilities within 30 days, the city may, to the extent permitted by law, have the removal done at the person's expense. 
6.  Facilities shall be subject to all other applicable regulations and standards as established as part of the City Code, including but not limited to building codes, zoning requirements and rights-of-way management regulations in addition to the regulations provided herein. 
(Ord. No. 4459, § 3, 10-16-17) 
Section 5. - [Penalty.] 
    Any person found guilty of violating any provision of this ordinance shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00, or by imprisonment not to exceed 90 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment, and each day the violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 4459, § 3, 10-16-17) 
Section 6. - [Severability.] 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city council that each and every part, section and subsection of this ordinance shall be separate and severable from each and every other part, section and subsection hereof and that the city council intends to adopt each said part, section and subsection separately and independently of any other part, section and subsection. In the event that any part of this ordinance shall be determined to be or to have been unlawful or unconstitutional, the remaining parts, sections and subsections shall be and remain in full force and effect.
