filing as a candidate for any such office, a disclosure statement.
2-2

E. Any material change in such property interests of rights shall be disclosed by filing an amended disclosure
statement within thirty (30) days after such change has occurred.
F. This Code of Ethics shall not be construed to require the filing of any information relating to any person's
affiliation with, or interest in, any professional society, charitable, religious, social, fraternal, educational,
recreational, public service, civic, governmental, political, or similar organization.
Subd. 4. Violation. A willful violation shall include any willful violation of any of the provisions of this Section by any

169, that has remained for a period of more than forty-eight (48) hours on public property illegally or
lacking vital component parts, or has remained for a period of more than forty-eight (48) hours on
private property without the consent of the person in control of such property or in an inoperable
condition such that it has no substantial potential further use consistent with its usual function unless it
is kept in an enclosed garage or storage building. It shall also mean a motor vehicle voluntarily
surrendered by its owner to and accepted by the City. A classic car or pioneer car, as defined in
Minnesota Statutes, 1990, Chapter 168, shall not be considered an abandoned motor vehicle within the
meaning of this Section. Vehicles on the premises of junk yards or automobile graveyards, which are
licensed and maintained in accordance with the City Code, shall not be considered abandoned motor
vehicles within the meaning of this Section.
2. "Vital component parts" means those parts of a motor vehicle that are essential to the mechanical
functioning of the vehicle, including, but not limited to, the motor, drive train and wheels.
B. Custody. The City may take into custody and impound any abandoned motor vehicle.
C. Immediate Sale. When an abandoned motor vehicle is more than seven model years of age, is lacking vital
component parts, and does not display a license plate currently valid in Minnesota or any other state or foreign
country, it shall immediately be eligible for sale at public auction and shall not be subject to the notification,
reclamation, or title provisions of this Subdivision.
D. Notice.
1. When an abandoned motor vehicle does not fall within provisions of Subparagraph C of this
Subdivision, the City shall give notice of the taking within ten (10) days. The notice shall set forth the
date and place of the taking; the year, make, model and serial number of the abandoned motor vehicle,
if such information can be reasonably obtained; and the place where the vehicle is being held; shall
inform the owner and any lienholders of their right to reclaim the vehicle under Subparagraph F of this
Subdivision; and shall state that failure of the owner or lien holder to exercise their right to reclaim the
vehicle and contents be deemed a waiver by them of all rights, title and interest in the vehicle and a
consent to the sale of the vehicle and contents at a public auction pursuant to Subparagraph F of this
Subdivision.
2-23
2. The notice shall be sent by mail to the registered owner, if any, of the abandoned motor vehicle and to

of this Subdivision shall be sold to the highest bidder at public auction or sale, following one (1)
published notice published at least seven (7) days prior to such action or sale. The purchaser shall be
given a receipt in a form prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient title to
dispose of the vehicle. The receipt shall also entitle the purchaser to register the vehicle and receive a
certification of title, free and clear of all liens and claims of ownership. Before such a vehicle is issued
a new certificate of title, it must receive a motor vehicle safety check.
2. From the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor vehicle, the City shall reimburse itself for the
cost of towing, preserving and storing the vehicle, and all administrative, notice and publication costs
incurred pursuant to this Subdivision. Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the
owner of the vehicle or entitled lien holder for ninety (90) days and then shall be deposited in the
General Fund of the City.
G. Disposal of Vehicles Not Sold. Where no bid has been received for an abandoned motor vehicle, the City may
dispose of it in accordance with this Subdivision.

reduction, transportation or other services necessary to prepare abandoned motor vehicles and other
scrap metal for recycling or other methods of disposal.
2. Where the City enters into a contract with a person duly licensed by the Minnesota Pollution Control
Agency, the Agency shall review the contract to determine whether it conforms to the Agency's plan
for solid waste disposal. A contract that does so conform may be approved by the Agency. Where a
contract has been approved, the Agency may reimburse the City for the costs incurred under the
contract which have not been reimbursed.

Subd. 5. Right of Entry. The City has the right to enter in and upon private property, including buildings and dwelling
houses, in or upon which is installed a municipal utility, or connection therewith, at all times reasonable under the
circumstances, for the purpose of reading utility meters, for the purpose of inspection and repair of meters or a utility
system, or any part thereof, and for the purpose of connecting and disconnecting service.
Subd. 6. Meter Accuracy. All water utilities service shall be supplied through a meter which shall accurately measure
the amount thereof supplied to any consumer. The consumer shall supply a safe and proper place for the installation of
such meters. Meters shall be tested for accuracy by the City upon the request of any consumer who believes his meter to
be inaccurate. If, upon test, it appears that such meter overruns to the extent of 3% or more, the City shall pay the cost of
such tests and shall make a refund for overcharges collected since the last known date of accuracy but for not longer than
six (6) years, on the basis of the extent of the inaccuracy found to exist at the time of the tests. If, upon test, it appears
that such meter is slow to the extent of 3% or more, the consumer shall pay for undercharges since the last known date of
accuracy but for not longer than six (6) years on the basis of the extent of the inaccuracy found to exist at the time of the
test. If, when any meter is tested upon the demand of a consumer, it is found to be accurate or slow or less than 3% fast,
the consumer shall pay the reasonable cost of such testing.
Subd. 7. Unlawful Acts.
A. It is unlawful for any person to willfully or carelessly break, injure, mar, deface, disturb, or in any way interfere

utility or municipal utility system, or commit any act tending to obstruct or impair the use of any municipal
utility.
B. It is unlawful for any person to make any connection with, opening into, use, or alter in any way any municipal
utility system without first having applied for and received written permission to do so from the City.
C. It is unlawful for any person to turn on or connect a utility when the same has been turned off or disconnected
by the City for non-payment of a bill, or for any other reason, without first having obtained a permit to do so
from the City.
D. It is unlawful for any person to "jumper" or by any means or device fully or partially circumvent a municipal
utility meter, or to knowingly use or consume unmetered utilities or use the services of any utility system, the
use of which the proper billing authorities have no knowledge.
Subd. 8. Municipal Utility Services and Charges a Lien.
A. Payment for service and charges provided for herein shall be the primary responsibility of the owner of the
3-4
premises served and shall be billed to the owner unless otherwise authorized in writing by the tenant and owner
and consented to by the City of Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The City may collect the same in a civil action or, in
the alternative and at the option of the City, as otherwise provided in this Subdivision.

SECTION 3.06. CONNECTION OR TAPPING PROHIBITED - DELINQUENT ASSESSMENTS OR
CHARGES.
No permit shall be granted to tap or connect with sewer or water mains when any assessment or connection charge for
such sewer or water main against the property to be connected is in default or delinquent. If such assessment or
connection charges are payable in installments, no permit shall be granted unless all installments then due and payable
have been paid.
SECTION 3.07. CONNECTION TO WATER AND SEWER SERVICES.
Subd. 1. Certificate Required. Pursuant to the authority conferred by Minnesota Statutes 444.075, in addition to all
other charges for tapping into or connecting with the municipal sanitary sewer system or the municipal water system,
including inspection of connection, street opening fees and permit fees heretofore established by City Code provisions or
resolution, no connection permit shall be issued, nor shall any tap or other connection be installed, or made, with or into
any municipal sanitary sewer or municipal water system of the City, either directly or indirectly, from any lot or tract of
land unless the City Clerk shall have certified as follows:
A. That the lot or tract of land to be served has been assessed for the cost of construction of the main with which
the connection is made, but this shall not include lots or tracts assessed under Subdivision 5 hereof;
B. If no assessment has been levied for such construction cost that proceedings for the levying of such assessment
have been or will be commenced in due course, but this shall not include lots or tracts to be assessed under
Subdivision 5 hereof; or,
C. That the cost of construction for the main has been paid by the developer or builder platting the lot or tract of
land, but this shall not include lots or tracts served by the main which were not a part of that plat or tract
developed.
Subd. 2. Additional Connection Charges. If none of the above conditions can be certified by the City Clerk, no
permit to tap or make connection to any sanitary sewer or water main shall be issued unless the applicant shall pay an
additional connection fee. Such additional connection fee shall be charged for sanitary sewer and water main made
available by agreement with other municipalities, counties or private corporations or individuals, as well as those owned
and operated by the City itself. The additional connection fee shall be equal to the average assessment levied against like
kind property for a similar public improvement constructed and installed by the City provided, however, for a connection
to a residential property, the connection fee shall be equal to the average assessment levied against residential parcels of
one-half acre or less. The average assessment shall be determined by taking the total assessment for a similar public
3-5
improvement and dividing that total by the total number of properties assessed, such determination having regard for
construction costs current on the date of such determination. Whenever more than one (1) tap or other connection is
requested for service to any lot or tract or whenever any tap or connection is requested for a lot or tract which has
previously been part of a lot or tract for which a connection charge has already been imposed pursuant to this
Subdivision, an additional charge shall be imposed for each tap or connection requested.
Subd. 3. Separate Fund. Any sum collected and received by the City under Subdivision 2 shall be placed in a separate
fund and shall be used first to pay the normal, reasonable and current costs of operating and maintaining the municipal
sanitary sewer and municipal water system. Net revenues from time to time received in excess of such costs may be used
as otherwise provided for by law.
Subd. 4. Notice and Hearing. Before the City Manager or his designate makes a final determination of the additional
connection fee under Subdivision 2, he shall cause a written notice to be sent to the property owner affected stating the
amount of the proposed connection fee and the basis of its calculation. The notice shall also state that the owner may,
within ten (10) days of receipt of the notice, demand a hearing on the matter. If the owner requests a hearing within that
time, a hearing shall be held on the matter by the Council within a reasonable time after the date on which the request is
made. The notice shall further state that the owner may request that the charges be levied as an assessment against the lot
or tract to be served and an application for such request shall be provided with the notice. The application shall be made
within ten (10) days of receipt of the notice referred to above if no hearing is requested, or if a hearing is requested within
ten (10) days following the hearing. If as a result of the hearing, the Council finds that the proposed connection fee
complies with the requirements of Subdivision 2, it shall so determine. If it determines that the proposed fee is in excess
of an amount that would have been assessed had the property been assessed, it shall make a determination of the proper
amount of the fee with the limits specified in Subdivision 2. No connection shall be made without payment of the
connection fee unless the fee is to be assessed pursuant to Subdivision 5.
Subd. 5. Assessments. Upon application by the owner waiving his right to notice, hearing and appeal, the Council may
cause the connection fee to be levied as an assessment against the lot or tract to be served under the procedure authorized
by law with reference to other assessments for benefits of local improvements.
Subd. 6. Liability for Charge and Certification to County Auditor. All additional connection fees imposed pursuant
to this Section, including those assessed pursuant to Subdivision 5, shall be a charge against the owner of the lot or tract
of land to be served. The City Clerk shall certify all unpaid charges to the County Auditor with taxes against the lot or
tract to be served for collection as other taxes are collected.

SECTION 3.30. RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO WATER SERVICE.
Subd. 1. Deficiency of Water and Shutting Off Water. The City is not liable for any deficiency or failure in the
supply of water to customers whether occasioned by shutting the water off for the purpose of making repairs or
connections or by any other cause whatever. In case of fire, or alarm of fire, water may be shut off to ensure a supply for
fire fighting. In making repairs or construction of new works, water may be shut off at any time and kept off so long as
may be necessary.
Subd. 2. Repair of Leaks. It is the responsibility of the consumer or owner to maintain the service pipe from the curb
stop into the house or other building. In case of failure upon the part of any consumer or owner to repair any leak
occurring in his service pipe within twenty-four (24) hours after oral or written notice has been given the owner or
occupant of the premises, the water may be shut off and will not be turned on until a reconnection charge has been paid
and the water service has been repaired. When the waste of water is great or when damage is likely to result from the
leak, the water will be turned off if the repair is not proceeded with immediately.
3-6
Subd. 3. Abandoned Services Penalties. All service installations connected to the water system that have been
abandoned or, for any reason, have become useless for further service shall be disconnected at the main. The owner of
the premises, served by this service, shall pay the cost of the excavation. The City shall perform the actual disconnection
and all pipe and appurtenances removed from the street right-of-way shall become the property of the City. When new
buildings are erected on the site of old ones and it is desired to increase the old water service, a new permit shall be taken
out and the regular tapping charge shall be made as if this were a new service. It is unlawful for any person to cause or
allow any service pipe to be hammered or squeezed together at the ends to stop the flow of water or to save expense in
improperly removing such pipe from the main. Also, such improper disposition thereof shall be corrected by the City and
the cost incurred shall be borne by the person causing or allowing such work to be performed.
Subd. 4. Service Pipes. Every service pipe must be laid in such manner as to prevent rupture by settlement. The
service pipe shall be placed not less than eight (8) feet below the surface in all cases so arranged as to prevent rupture and
stoppage by freezing. Frozen service pipes between the curb stop and the building shall be the responsibility of the
owner. Service pipes must extend from the curb stops to the inside of the building; or if not taken into a building then to
the hydrant or other fixtures which they are intended to supply. A valve the same size as the service pipe shall be placed
close to the inside wall of the building, ahead of the meter and well protected from freezing. Joints on copper tubing
shall be flared and kept to a minimum. Not more than one (1) joint shall be used for a service up to seventy (70) feet in
length. All joints shall be left uncovered until inspected. Minimum size connection with the water mains shall be one (1)
inch in diameter.
Subd. 5. Private Water Supplies. No water pipe of the City water system shall be connected with any pump, well,
pipe, tank or any device that is connected with any other source of water supply; and when such are found, the City shall
notify the owner or occupant to disconnect the same and, if not immediately done, the City water shall be turned off.
Before any new connections to the City system are permitted, the City shall ascertain that no cross-connections will exist
when the new connection is made. When a building is connected to "City Water," the private water supply may be used
only for such purposes as the City may allow.
Subd. 6. Water Emergencies.
A. Definition. For purposes of this subdivision, a “water emergency” means a critical water deficiency declared by
the Governor pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 103G.291 or a declaration by the City Manager pursuant to subsection B
of this subdivision.
B. Declaration. The City Manager is authorized to declare a water emergency when he or she determines that the
water pressure and available water in the City water system reaches a level which endangers the public health or
safety of residents and other persons in the City.
C. Notice. Upon the declaration of a water emergency by the Governor or the City Manager, the City will
immediately post notice of the emergency declaration on the principal City bulletin board and on the front page
of the City website. The City will notify the public as quickly as possible of applicable water supply plans,
emergency response plans, and procedures.
D. Prohibited Uses. Upon declaration of a water emergency and notification to the public, the following uses of
water, whether from the City water system or a private water supply, are prohibited as long as the water
emergency remains in effect:
1. Irrigation of yards, gardens, golf courses, parklands, and other non-agricultural land, except for
those areas irrigated with reclaimed water.
2. Washing or spraying of sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, tennis courts, patios, or other paved
areas with water from any pressurized source, including garden hoses, except to alleviate
immediate health or safety hazards.
3. The use of any water-based play apparatus connected to a pressurized source.
3-7
4. Restaurants and other food service establishments are prohibited from serving water to their
customers, unless water is specifically requested by the customer.
5. Operation of outdoor misting systems used to cool public areas.
6. The filling of swimming pools, fountains, spas, or other exterior water features.
7. The washing of automobiles, trucks, trailers, and other types of mobile equipment, except at facilities
equipped with wash water recirculation systems, and for vehicles requiring frequent washing to protect
public health, safety, and welfare.
E. Variance. The Director of Public Works may grant a variance from the restrictions of this subdivision where
strict application of its provisions would result in serious hardship to a user. A variance may be granted only for
reasons involving health or safety. An applicant may appeal the denial of a variance within five (5) days of the
decision by submitting a written request for appeal to the City Clerk. The City Manager shall hear the appeal
within fourteen (14) days of the date the City Clerk receives the request.
F. Violations.
1. Notice. Upon determination that a person is using water in violation of the restrictions and prohibitions
imposed under this subdivision, the City will deliver a written notice to the owner of the premises on
which the use is occurring. For the purpose of giving notice, the address of such owner will be
determined by the City Clerk from records available to the public. The notice will describe the
violation, specify the required remedy, and state that failure to comply will result in a surcharge on the
water bill for the premises as provided in the following paragraph.
2. Surcharge. Failure to comply with restrictions and prohibitions imposed under this subdivision after
receipt of a written notice under the preceding paragraph will result in a surcharge for water service for
each day of violation in an amount determined by resolution of the City Council, which surcharge shall
be added to the water bill for the premises on which such violation occurs. The City shall mail a Notice
of Surcharge to the violator upon imposition of a surcharge. Continued violations after receipt of the
Notice of Surcharge shall be cause for discontinuance of water service to such premises. Receipt of the
Notice of Surcharge shall be presumed three (3) days after mailing by the City.
3. Citation. In addition to the surcharge provided for in the preceding paragraph, any person violating the
restrictions or prohibitions imposed under this subdivision may be issued a petty misdemeanor citation.

SECTION 3.50. RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO SEWERAGE SERVICE.
Subd. 1. Definitions. The following terms, as used in this Section, shall have the meanings stated:
A. "Sewage" means water-carried waste products from residences, public buildings, institutions or other buildings
or premises, including the excrement or other discharge from the bodies of human beings or animals, together
with such ground water infiltration and surface water as may be present.
B. "Sewerage system" includes all street lateral, main and intersecting sewers and structures by which sewage or
industrial wastes are collected, transported, treated and disposed of provided that this shall not include plumbing
inside or a part of a building or premises served or service sewers from a building to the street lateral.
Subd. 2. Metered Water Not Discharged. If a portion of the water furnished to any premises is not directly or
indirectly discharged into the sewerage system, the quantity of such water shall be deducted in computing the sewerage
service charge or rental provided a separate meter shall be installed and operated to register the quantity so not
discharged into the sewerage system and provided, also, that where it is not practicable to meter the portion of the water
not discharged into the sewerage system, such adjustment may be made as shall be fair and equitable in order to
determine the amount of such service charge or rental, but until such adjustment shall be effected that water consumption
basis hereinbefore prescribed shall remain in full force and effect.
Subd. 3. Unlawful Discharge. It is unlawful to discharge any roof water, ground water, or any other natural
precipitation into the sewer system.
Subd. 4. Unmetered Water Supply. If any premises discharge normal sewage or industrial waste into the sanitary
sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, obtain part or all of the water used thereon from sources other than the
City, and the water so obtained is not measured by a meter of equivalent specifications to the meters used by the City,
then in such case the City shall permit the discharge of normal sewage or industrial waste into its sanitary sewerage
system only when the owner of such premises or some other interested party shall at his own expense install and maintain
for the purpose of metering such water supply a water meter of equivalent specifications to those installed by the City in
connection with the City water system. Each water meter shall be installed to measure all water received on such
premises and the above charges and rates shall be applied to the quantity of water received as measured by such meter.
If, because of the nature of the source of the water supply, the City deems it impracticable to thus meter the water on any
premises, the Council may by resolution establish a flat charge per month in accordance with the estimated use of water
on such premises.
Subd. 5. Size, Kind and Depth of Pipe. The City may prescribe the size, kind and depth of sewerage service pipe and
connections. The minimum size when placed underground shall be four (4) inches in diameter.
Source: City Code
Effective Date: 9-17-82
SECTION 3.51. RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO DISCHARGES FROM SUMP PUMPS AND
OTHER SOURCES INTO THE SEWERAGE SYSTEM.
Subd. 1. Purpose. The Council finds that the discharge of water from roofs, down spouts, eave troughs, rain spouts,
yard drains, surfaces, groundwater, sump pumps, footing tiles or swimming pools, foundation drains, yard fountains,
ponds, cistern overflow, air conditioning units or systems, areaway drains, industrial processes, and other means of
transmitting natural precipitation and surface waters, collectively referred to as excess infiltration and inflow (I & I), into
the sewerage system as defined by Section 3.50, Subd. 1 (B), will and has in the past overloaded the sewerage system.
The owner of the interceptor sewer system and the waste water treatment facilities—Metropolitan Council Environmental
Services (MCES)—has mandated that cities remove excess I & I from the system or be subject to certain fines, penalties
and surcharges as imposed by MCES. Further, MCES has determined that failure to remove excess I & I could lead to a
3-10
moratorium on new connections to the sewerage system required for development and/or redevelopment. The Council,
therefore, finds it essential for orderly growth in the community, fiscal responsibility, compliance with the mandated
requirements of MCES and City Code requirements that the provisions of this Section be strictly enforced.
Subd. 2. Prohibition against discharges into sewerage system. No water from any roof, down spout, eave trough, rain
spout, yard drain, surface, groundwater, sump pump, footing tile or swimming pool, foundation drain, yard fountain,
pond, cistern overflow, air conditioning unit or system, areaway drain, industrial process, or other natural precipitation
shall be discharged into the sewerage system. Dwellings and other buildings and structures which require, because of
infiltration of water into basements, crawl spaces and the like, a sump pump discharge system shall have a permanently
installed discharge line which shall not at any time discharge water into the sewerage system, except as provided herein.
A “permanently installed discharge line” shall be one which provides for year-around discharge capacity to either an
appropriate drainage area on the outside of the dwelling, building or structure (in no event shall such a drainage area
include property owned by others or any public right-of-way), or is connected to the City storm sewer. The permanently
installed discharge line shall consist of a rigid discharge line, without valving or quick connections for altering the path of
discharge. It shall not be capable of connection or reconnection to the sewerage system.
Subd. 3. Disconnection. Any person having a roof surface, down spout, eave trough, rain spout, yard drain, surface,
groundwater, sump pump, footing tile or swimming pool, foundation drain, yard fountain, pond, cistern overflow, air
conditioning unit or system, areaway drain, industrial process now connected and/or discharging into the sewerage system
shall immediately disconnect and/or remove same. Any disconnects or openings in the sewerage system shall be closed
in an effective, workmanlike manner, as approved by the Director of Public Works. If a city drain tile or storm sewer
system is available to the property, connection of said discharges to these systems shall be mandatory.
Subd. 4. Compliance and Inspection. Every person owning improved real estate that discharges into the City’s
sewerage sewer system shall comply with the requirements of this Section within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date.
Within thirty (30) days after notice from the City, the property owner shall contact the City Utility Division to schedule
an inspection, at no cost to the property owner, of each building and the utility service lines located on such property by
an inspector designated by the City. The purpose of this inspection shall be to confirm that there is no sump pump or
other prohibited discharge into the sewerage system. In lieu of having the City inspect such property, the property owner
may, at the property owner’s expense, furnish a certificate from a licensed plumber, in a form acceptable to the City,
certifying that the property is in compliance with this Section.
Subd. 5. Additional Inspections. The City may require any building be re-inspected on a yearly basis in conjunction
with water meter or other inspections and/or service calls.
Subd. 6. New home inspections. All new homes will be required to have their sump pump system inspected and be in
compliance with this Section prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
Subd. 7. Waivers. The Director of Public Works shall have the power and duty of hearing and deciding requests for
waivers from the applicability of the provisions of this Section where strict enforcement would cause undue hardship
because of circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration or cause a safety problem. This may also
include cases where it would not be practical or feasible to correct an otherwise prohibited discharge in the City’s
sewerage system.
Application for waivers pursuant to this Section shall be addressed in writing to the Director of Public Works. The
applications shall at a minimum identify the subject property, the name of the property owner/applicant, and describe in
detail what characteristics of the subject property create an undue hardship. Within a reasonable time the Director of
Public Works shall make a decision on the matter and send a copy of such decision to the applicant by regular mail.
Upon approval of an application for a waiver, a property owner shall be allowed to discharge directly into the sewerage
system for a limited time specified in the written decision and in accordance with other terms and conditions specified.
The applicant will be required to pay an additional fee for the additional sewer service, along with the regular monthly
charge. Fees for this service will be based on estimated yearly average amounts discharged to the sewerage system.
Subd. 8. Surcharge. A surcharge of $100.00 per month is added to every sewer bill mailed to property owners who (a)
are found discharging I & I into the sewerage system; (b) have not obtained an inspection required by this Section within
3-11
30 days after notice by the City; (c) have not made necessary corrections within the time specified; or (d) are not
otherwise in compliance with this Section. The surcharge shall be added every month thereafter for properties not
complying with this Section until the property owner submits proof to the Director of Public Works that the property is
brought into full compliance. The full amount of the surcharge shall apply regardless of whether the non-compliance has
been for the entire month or a portion of it. All properties found during any yearly re-inspection to have violated this
Section will be subject to a $200.00 surcharge for all months between the two most recent inspections. If the surcharge is
not paid, the City reserves the right to assess the property owner the unpaid balance pursuant to Minnesota Statute
Section 429.101, as amended.

SECTION 3.75. RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO STORM WATER SEWER SYSTEM UTILITY.
Subd. 1. Findings and Determinations.
A. In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health, safety, convenience and
general welfare, the City has constructed, operated and maintained a storm water sewer system (the "system").
This section is adopted in the further exercise of such authority and for the same purposes.
B. The system, as constructed, heretofore has been financed and paid for through the imposition of special
assessments and ad valorem taxes. It is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of
recovering some or all of the future costs of improving, maintaining and operating the system through the
imposition of charges as provided in this section.
C. In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable.
Taking into account the status of completion of the system, past methods of recovering system cost, the
topography of the City and other relevant factors, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign
responsibility for some or all of the future costs of operating, maintaining and improving the system on the basis
of the expected storm water runoff from the various parcels of land within the City during a standard rainfall
event.
Subd. 2. Storm Water Sewer System Utility Established. A municipal storm water sewer system utility (the "storm
water utility") is hereby established and shall be operated pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, 1992, Section 444.075 from
which revenues will be derived subject to the provisions of this Section and other laws.
Subd. 3. Definitions. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the following words or phrases have the meanings

shall be referred to the City Council. The City Council shall consider the recommendation of the hearing

recorded and a copy provided to the acquitted violator.

Subd. 1. Findings. The Council makes the following findings regarding the need to license therapeutic massage
enterprises and therapists and to prohibit all other types of massage businesses and services to the public:
A. Persons who have bona fide and standardized training in therapeutic massage, health, and hygiene can provide a
legitimate and necessary service to the general public.
B. Health and sanitation regulations governing therapeutic massage enterprises and therapists can minimize the risk
of the spread of communicable diseases and can promote overall health and sanitation.
C. License qualifications for the restrictions on therapeutic massage enterprises and therapists can minimize the
risk that such businesses and persons will facilitate prostitution and other criminal activity in the community.
D. Massage services provided by persons with no specialized and standardized training in massage can endanger
citizens by facilitating the spread of communicable diseases, by exposing citizens to unhealthy and unsanitary
conditions, and by increasing the risk of personal injury.
5-26
E. Massage businesses which employ persons with no specialized and standardized training can tax City lawenforcement
services, because such businesses are more likely to be operated as fronts for prostitution and other
criminal activity than operations established by persons with standardized training.
F. The training of professional massage therapists at accredited institutions is an important means of ensuring the
fullest measure of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.

SECTION 5.77. SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
Source: Ordinance No. 27-2018
Effective Date: 12-13-18
Subd. 1. Purpose and Findings.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prescribe licensing requirements for sexually oriented businesses to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare and to prevent criminal activity and the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases.
B. Findings. The Eden Prairie City Council makes the following findings regarding the effect sexually oriented
businesses have on the character of the City’s neighborhoods. These findings are based on the experiences of
other cities where the businesses are located, as studied by staff.
5-64
1. Sexually oriented businesses can contribute to an increase in criminal activity in the area in which such
businesses are located, increasing the demands on City crime-prevention programs and law
enforcement services.
2. Sexually oriented businesses can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity. The
experience of other cities indicates that proper management and operation of such businesses can
minimize this risk.
3. Sexually oriented businesses can increase the risk of exposure to communicable diseases including
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), for which there is currently no cure. Experiences of
other cities indicate that such businesses can facilitate the spread of communicable diseases by virtue
of the design and use of the premises, endangering not only the patrons of such establishments but also
the general public.
4. Sexually oriented businesses can cause or contribute to public health problems by the presence of live
adult entertainment in conjunction with food or drink or both on the same premises.
5. A licensing and regulatory scheme as prescribed in this Section can minimize the risk of criminal
activity and public health problems and can aid in monitoring sexually oriented businesses for other
adverse secondary effects on the community.

Subd. 9. Small Wireless Facilities.
A. Purpose and Findings. The City desires high quality wireless services to accommodate the needs of residents
and businesses. At the same time, the City strives to minimize the negative impacts that small wireless facilities
can create. These negative impacts include, but are not limited to, interference with right-of-way user sight
lines, impacts to right-of-way user circulation, incompatible aesthetics with the surrounding area, fall zone risk,
clear zone risk, creating navigation obstacles, interference with future travel way expansion plans, interference
with the delivery of other utility services, interference with stormwater management facilities, and increased
noise pollution.
To minimize these negative impacts, any person desiring to place a new wireless support structure in the rightof-
way or collocate small wireless facilities on existing privately-owned wireless support structures in the rightof-
way shall first obtain a small wireless facility permit from the City. Any person desiring to collocate small
wireless facilities on existing wireless support structures owned or controlled by the City shall first enter into a
standard small wireless facility collocation agreement. The purpose of these requirements is to comply with
Minnesota Statutes Sections 237.162 and 237.163 while at the same time protecting the public health, safety,
and welfare.
The City will consider impacts to the public health, safety and welfare when reviewing a small wireless permit
application and a request to enter into a small wireless facility collocation agreement. The public health, safety
and welfare can be best accommodated by locating small wireless facilities in the following order, which affords
the greatest protection of the public:
1. Locate outside of the right-of-way.
2. Locate in the right-of-way on or adjacent to Principal Arterial, Other Arterial, Major Collector, or
Minor Collector roads, as classified by the Metropolitan Council Functional Classification System.
3. Collocate on existing wireless support structures within the right-of-way.
4. Locate on a new wireless support structure within the right-of-way that replaces an existing wireless
support structure of the same height.
5. Locate on a new wireless support structure within the right-of-way that replaces an existing wireless
support structure whose height is less than or equal to 50 feet.
6. Locate on a new wireless support structure within the right-of-way whose height is similar to nearby
structures.
7. Locate on a new wireless support structure within the right-of-way whose height is less than or equal to
50 feet.
The City will also consider factors such as aesthetic compatibility of the small wireless facility with surrounding
structures, ability to eliminate, underground, or screen ground-mounted equipment, dangers within the small
wireless facility fall zone, distance of the small wireless facility from roads, sidewalks, trails and bicycle lanes,
and future roadway, pedestrian, bicycle, water, wastewater, and stormwater improvement plans for the site
before issuing small wireless facility permit or entering into a standard small wireless facility collocation
agreement.
B. Small Wireless Facility Permit. No person may place a new wireless support structure within the right-of-way
or collocate a small wireless facility on an existing privately-owned wireless support structure in the right-ofway
without first obtaining a small wireless facility permit from the City.
1. Permit Application and Fee. A written application for a small wireless facility permit shall be
submitted to the Director on a form provided by the City. The applicant shall pay an application fee in

application:
(a) are located within a two-mile radius;
(b) consist of substantially similar equipment; and
(c) are to be placed on similar types of wireless support structures.
3. Permission from Owner. If the applicant seeks to collocate a small wireless facility on an existing
wireless support structure, the applicant shall, at the time of application, provide the City with proof
that it has obtained the necessary authority from the owner of the wireless support structure to
collocate the small wireless facility on the structure.
4. Issuance of Permit and Conditions. Upon the Director’s determination that the applicant has
satisfied the requirements of this Section, the Director shall issue the small wireless facility permit.
The Director may condition permit approval on compliance with the following:
(a) generally applicable and reasonable health, safety, and welfare regulations consistent with the
City’s authority to manage its public right-of-way;
(b) reasonable accommodations for decorative wireless support structures or signs; and
(c) any reasonable restocking, replacement, or relocation requirements when a new wireless
support structure is placed in the right-of-way.
In rendering a decision on a consolidated permit application, the Director may approve a permit for
some small wireless facilities and deny a permit for others, but may not use denial of one or more
permits as a basis to deny all the small wireless facilities in the consolidated application.
5. Permit Denial. The Director may deny a small wireless facility permit if he or she reasonably
determines that the applicant has not satisfied the requirements of this Section or that approval of the
permit would be contrary to generally applicable and reasonable health, safety, and welfare

SECTION 6.20 PARADES, RACES AND PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES.
Subd. 1. Purpose and Findings. The Council finds that persons and groups have a right to organize and participate in
peaceful assemblies on the streets, sidewalks, walkways and parks in the City and to engage in assembly near the object
of their protest so that they may be seen and heard, subject to reasonable restrictions designed to protect public safety,
persons and property, and to accommodate the interests of persons not participating in the assembly to use the street,
sidewalk or walkway to travel to their intended destinations and to use the parks for recreational purposes. Races,
parades and public assemblies on public grounds, including but not limited to outdoor concerts, rallies, festivals,
demonstrations, and ceremonies can potentially result in:
6-18
A. A danger to the safety and welfare of persons using public rights-of-way, including, but not limited to
pedestrians, motorists, persons entering and leaving motor vehicles and buildings, and persons performing
essential traffic control and emergency services;
B. Excessive noise likely to distract motorists and disturb the public peace;
C. A danger to the safety of the participants, as well as other persons in their vicinity;
D. Territorial disputes between competing users of public property; and
E. Damage to public parks, public grounds, streets, walkways, property and facilities.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to:
1. Protect the safe movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic contiguous to the site of the expressive
activity by advance planning and appropriate staffing;
2. Protect the rights of persons engaging in expressive activities in public areas to be free from danger,
interruption, or disruption;
3. Protect the general public by adequate staffing of necessary police, fire and rescue resources so that
the diversion of resources to a public assembly does not impair the ability of emergency responders to
provide adequate services throughout the City;
4. Protect the quiet enjoyment of private property and the dedicated use of public property;
5. Coordinate multiple, competing uses of limited public space;
6. Prevent use of public property, public grounds or facilities in a manner that is potentially dangerous,
unlawful or impermissible under City, County, State or Federal laws, rules or regulations;
7. Provide a mechanism by which there is financial accountability for private use of public property,
public grounds or facilities so as to preserve that property for the benefit of the public; and
8. Recover the costs to the City attributable to private use of public property.
Subd. 2. Definitions. The following words and terms when used in this Section shall have the following meanings
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
A. Event or Planned Event – a parade, race or public assembly as hereinafter defined.
B. Parade – any procession of pedestrians, vehicles or animals or any combination thereof traveling in unison
along or upon a street, road or highway within the City which is organized and conducted for the purposes of
attracting the attention of the general public or expressing or celebrating views or ideas by use of verbal, visual,
literary or auditory means of communication. A ‘parade’ shall not mean a procession of vehicles operated in
compliance with ordinary traffic laws or a procession of pedestrians along or upon a public sidewalk or private
property, or alongside a public street, road or highway in compliance with ordinary traffic laws.
C. Person - one (1) or more natural persons; a partnership, including a limited partnership; a corporation; a trust;

line, rally or other gathering on public grounds in a place open to the general public where the person or group
conducting or organizing the event reasonably anticipates that fifty (50) or more persons will participate in the
assembly. A public assembly does not include any immediate and spontaneous expression of views in response
to a public event occurring within the preceding five (5) days.
E. Race – any scheduled public event or gathering of persons for a planned athletic event that moves upon a public
street, sidewalk or other public grounds from one location to another such as bicycle or running races, which
may potentially interfere with the normal flow or regulation of vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
F. School (K-12) – establishments primarily engaged in providing instructional services to elementary or
secondary students with a curriculum that complies with state regulations, including public schools governed by
an elected school board, private schools and charter schools.
Subd. 3. Permit Required and Voluntary Registration. A permit shall be required before any race, parade or public
assembly may be conducted on public property within the City. No person shall conduct or engage in any parade, race or
public assembly without a permit issued by the Chief of Police. Any person or group organizing or conducting a public
assembly for which a permit is not required by this Section may voluntarily register that event with the Chief of Police at
no charge.
Subd. 4. Permit Application.
A. Filing. A person seeking issuance of a permit required by this Section must file a signed and completed
application with the Chief of Police on the forms provided by the Police Department. In order to allow sufficient
time for an appeal from a permit denial, it is suggested that applications be filed at least sixty (60) days prior to
the event. Nevertheless, any fully completed, signed application filed within the minimum filing periods set
forth below will be accepted during business hours as follows:
1. For events involving two hundred (200) or more persons or thirty (30) or more animals, not less than
seven (7) business days prior to the planned event;

seven (7) business days prior to the planned event; and
3. For all other public assemblies, not less than four (4) business days prior to the planned event.
The Chief of Police may waive the minimum filing period for good cause shown if, after due consideration of
the date, time, place and nature of the event the anticipated number of participants, and the City services
required in connection with the event, it is determined that the waiver will not adversely impact the public
health, safety or welfare.

8. Where the Chief of Police determines based upon an assessment of the location, date, time of day,
concentration of persons, vehicles, animals or equipment, use of sound amplification equipment or
other equipment generating noise, vibration, dust or smoke, that the event appears likely to interfere
with the safe and orderly movement of pedestrian or vehicular traffic contiguous to its route or
location, interfere with the movement of firefighting equipment or ambulance service, lack adequate
essential facilities for the health and safety of participants, or unreasonably interfere with the quiet
enjoyment of neighboring properties or the dedicated use of the public property on which the planned
event is to be situated, the Chief of Police may require, without reference to or consideration of the
content of the expressive activity, views expressed or anticipated to be expressed or the response it
may provoke, one or more of the following:
(a) A site plan for the location of the event, the route to be traveled, if any, including the starting
point and the termination point, and the maximum and minimum speeds of any travel. A

onlookers of the event, including any loading or unloading areas.
(b) A parking, pedestrian circulation and traffic directional plan.

within the preceding five (5) years.
16. Such other information as the Chief of Police requires in order to make a fair determination as to

charges, and personal injury, including death, resulting directly or indirectly from any act of
negligence, either active or passive, on the part of the Applicant in the Applicant’s use of public
property specified in the Application.”
Subd. 5. Fees.
A. Permit Fees. Permit fees for events shall be $15.00 per day, and the permit fee shall be submitted with the
application. Additional permits and fees may be required if the event includes public facility rental, tents or
other attributes subject to separate regulation.
B. Contractual Police Overtime Deposit. A fee for contractual police overtime must be paid prior to issuance of
the permit if the Chief of Police determines, based upon the event’s size, date, time of day, location,
concentration of persons, vehicles, animals or equipment, that additional police services, over and above that
which can be provided by regularly scheduled on-duty police personnel, is necessary to protect the public
health, safety and welfare. In making this determination, the Chief of Police may not reference or consider the
content of the expressive activity or views expressed or anticipated to be expressed or the response it may
provoke. The fee for contractual police overtime shall be based upon the established contractual overtime rates
for the patrol and supervisory officers available, which include regular salary, plus regular fringe benefits.
Contractual police overtime rates shall be those established by the City’s annual fee resolution.
C. Other City Staff Overtime Deposit. A fee for estimated City staff overtime must be paid prior to issuance of
the permit if the Chief of Police determines, based upon the event’s size, date, time of day, location,
concentration of persons, vehicles, animals or equipment, that additional City staffing is necessary to protect the
public health, safety and welfare. In making this determination, the Chief of Police may not reference or
consider the content of the expressive activity or views expressed or anticipated to be expressed or the response
it may provoke. The fee for City staff overtime shall be based upon the actual overtime rates for the City staff
available to serve the event, which shall include regular salary, plus regular fringe benefits. City staff overtime
rates shall be those established by the City’s annual fee resolution.
Subd. 6. Exemptions from Permit Fee and Application.
A. Council Findings on Exemptions. The Council makes the following findings regarding the need to exempt
certain persons from paying a permit fee and submitting a permit application for public assemblies:
1. Schools conduct and sponsor several public assemblies, such as outdoor concerts, athletic competition,
field trips and music events on a regular basis, including marching band events, sporting events with
musical components, art festivals, and student fund-raisers on property owned or leased by the school
6-22
or used pursuant to a written agreement with the City. A permit application and fee for each such
event would adversely impact the events, which benefit the community as a whole, and, in most cases,
would represent a transfer of public monies between governmental units without any corresponding
benefit to the community.
2. The City and other governmental agencies acting within the scope of their functions, sponsor many
public assemblies. Payment of permit fees for each such City or other governmental agency sponsored
event would adversely impact the events and would represent an internal transfer of public monies for
no justifiable reason.
B. Exemptions from Permit Fees for Public Assemblies. In light of the Council findings, the following persons
are exempt from the fee for a permit under this Section for public assemblies, not including races or parades:
1. Schools conducting public assemblies on property described in Subdivision 6 (A) (1) under the
immediate direction and supervision of proper school authorities;
2. Holders of a City Large Group Use permit, interim use permit or a written use agreement with the City
for a planned event where the activities are limited to the authorized use set forth in the permit or
agreement;
3. Persons who have entered into a rental or use agreement with the City for use of City parks or facilities
or persons who have entered into a rental or use agreement with another governmental agency or who
have been issued a permit from another governmental agency for use of parks or facilities located
within the City which are owned or operated by said governmental agency; and
4. The City for City sponsored events or other governmental agencies for events sponsored by such
agency acting within the scope of its functions;
C. Exemptions from Permit Application for Public Assemblies; Registration. Those persons exempt from a
permit fee in subpart (B) of this Subdivision, shall not be required to complete a permit application. However,
whenever amplified sound is a component of the event or the event may potentially interfere with the normal
flow of traffic, the exempt person must register with the City providing notice of the planned public assembly at
least five (5) business days prior to the proposed event. The registration notice shall include the name and
phone number of the person sponsoring or conducting the event; the date and time of the event; the location of
the event; a description of any sound amplification equipment, or other mechanical or electronic equipment to
be used in connection with the event; and such other information as the Chief of Police requires in the interest of
the public health, safety and welfare.
D. Responsibilities of Exempt Event Sponsors. Those persons exempt from a permit fee and application in
subpart (B) of this Subdivision are nonetheless subject to all applicable state laws and City Code provisions,
including without limitation City Code: Section 9.04 (rules and regulations governing public parks); Section
9.34 (obstructions on public property); Section 9.30 (disorderly conduct generally); Section 9.31 (disorderly
conduct on school grounds and in school buildings); Section 9.41(noise); Section 9.35 (curfew); Section 5.37
(peddlers); Section 6.03, subd. 21 (obstruction in streets) and may be required to pay the cost of any law
enforcement services over and above the level of City services available with regular on-duty staffing that are
directly attributable to their event. The City’s cost of repair, clean-up, or replacement of City property, public
grounds or facilities damaged as a direct result of the event shall also be recoverable from the exempt event
sponsor, as well as any City liability to third parties resulting from the exempt person’s event.
Subd. 7. Permit Application Verification and Consideration
A. Application Consideration. An application for a permit pursuant to this Section shall be submitted to the
Chief of Police. The Chief of Police is empowered to conduct and shall conduct investigations to verify the
6-23
information on the application. The Chief of Police shall then route the application to the Director of
Community Development, Fire Chief, Director of Parks and Recreation and City Traffic Engineer for review
and consideration based upon the applicable laws or regulations relating to the proposed public event and an
assessment of the event’s likely impact on the public health, safety and welfare. The Chief of Police may place
conditions on a permit as may be necessary to ensure adequate parking and traffic circulation, to minimize
impacts on adjacent property, to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and to otherwise protect the health,
safety and welfare of the community. A permit shall be issued when it is found by the Chief of Police that:
1. The conduct of the event will not substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other
pedestrian or vehicular traffic contiguous to its route or location;
2. The conduct of the event will not interfere with the movement of fire fighting equipment;
3. The conduct of the event will not require the diversion of so great a number of City police resources as
to pose an adverse impact on the health, welfare and safety of the public;
4. The concentration of vehicles, persons and animals at public assembly points of an event will not
unduly interfere with proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous to
such event;
5. The conduct of the event is not reasonably likely to cause injury to persons or property;
6. Adequate sanitation and other required health facilities are or will be made available in or adjacent to
any public assembly areas of the event;
7. There are sufficient parking places near the beginning and end sites of the public assembly areas of the
event;
8. The Applicant has paid all fees required under this Section;
9. The event is not being held for the primary purpose of advertising or selling any product or service
and is not designed to be held purely for commercial purposes;
10. No event permit application for the same time and location is already granted, or has been received
and will be granted, and no event listed in Subdivision 6 (B) is already scheduled for the same time
and location. In the case of competing applications simultaneously under consideration for the same
time and location, the Chief of Police will use an impartial, blind lottery to determine which Applicant
is entitled to the permit.
B. Approval or Denial. The Chief of Police shall act promptly upon a completed permit application but in no
event shall fail to grant or deny a permit more than twenty (20) days after his receipt or less than forty-eight (48)
hours prior to the event without the written consent of the Applicant. If the application is denied, in whole or in
part, the Chief of Police shall notify the Applicant of the his determination in writing, setting out the specific
reason therefore. The notice shall be mailed, e-mailed, or sent by facsimile to the Applicant at the street
address, e-mail address, or facsimile number provided in the application and it shall inform the Applicant of the
Applicant’s right, within twenty (20) days after the date the notice was mailed to request an administrative
review by the City Manager or the City Manager’s designated representative of the Chief of Police’s
determination. The Chief of Police in denying an application for a permit may authorize an alternative permit
for the parade, race, or public assembly at a date, time, location, route or under conditions different from that
named by the Applicant. An Applicant desiring to accept an alternative permit shall, within five (5) days after
notice of the denial, file a written notice of acceptance with the Chief of Police.
6-24
C. Administrative Review. An Applicant has a right to request an administrative review by the City Manager or
the City Manager’s designated representative of the Chief of Police’s determination to deny a permit within
twenty (20) days after the date the notice of denial was mailed by serving the City Manager with a written
request for administrative review along with all documents and written arguments serving as a basis for the
Applicant’s position. If a request for administrative review is timely received by the City Manager, the City
Manager or the City Manager’s designee shall issue a written decision, setting forth the reasons therefore within
a reasonable period, in no case later than twenty (20) days from the date of receipt of the request for
administrative review by the City Manager or the City’s Manager’s designated representative. The decision of
the City Manager shall be mailed to the Applicant at the address on the permit application. Exhaustion of
administrative remedies is not a precondition to judicial review.
Subd. 8. Permit Restrictions and Permit Revocation.
A. Limitations. The Applicant, along with any person acting under the Applicant’s control or direction, must
conduct and control the event so that it remains at all times in complete conformity with all conditions set forth
in the approved permit application.
B. Application of Other Laws. In addition to the provisions of this Section, parades, races and public assemblies
shall be subject to all other applicable state laws and City Code provisions, including without limitation City
Code: Section 9.04 (rules and regulations governing public parks); Section 9.34 (obstructions on public
property); Section 9.30 (disorderly conduct generally); Section 9.31 (disorderly conduct on school grounds and
in school buildings); Section 9.41(noise); Section 9.35 (curfew); Section 5.37 (peddlers); and Section 6.03,

conditions or standards for issuance as set forth in this Section, violation by any participant of City Code or state
law, or in case of a public emergency.
Subd. 9. Prohibitions.
A. No person shall stage, present, conduct or start any event without first obtaining a permit as required by this
Section.
B. No person shall unreasonably hamper, obstruct, or impede or interfere with any permitted event or person,
animal or vehicle participating therein. No driver of any vehicle shall drive between the vehicles, persons or
animals comprising a parade or race when such parade or race is in motion. The Chief of Police shall have the
authority, when reasonably necessary, to prohibit or restrict the parking of vehicles along the route of the race
or parade in areas contiguous thereto and shall post signs to such effect and it shall be unlawful for any person
to park or leave a vehicle unattended in violation thereof.
C. No person shall participate in an event for which the person knows or reasonably should have known that a
required permit has not issued.
D. No person in charge of, or responsible for the conduct of, a permitted event shall intentionally violate any
condition of the permit.
E. No person shall intentionally engage in, participate in, aid or start any event that poses a substantial hazard to
the public safety.

(1/4) inch or less in thickness and two (2) inches or less in width, or if not rectangular, not more than threequarters
(3/4) inch in its thickest dimension.

PUBLIC PROTECTION, CRIMES AND OFFENSES
SECTION 9.01. STORAGE, DEPOSIT AND COLLECTION OF REFUSE, YARD WASTE, RECYCLABLE
WASTE AND SOLID WASTE
Subd. 1. Purpose and Findings. The Council of the City of Eden Prairie finds that the practice of disposing of
Recyclable Waste in land disposal facilities commonly referred to as landfills is unacceptable because such disposal is
detrimental to the long-term capacity of public and private landfills and is detrimental to the environment in that it causes
pollution and contamination of underground and surface waters, air and natural flora and fauna; is harmful to the health
and safety of persons and property because it generates noxious and dangerous odors and gases, including methane gas
and; blowing of airborne particles and contaminants causes social and/or economic harm to persons who reside, and
property which is, in proximity to landfills and should be done only in the absence of reasonably-available alternatives.
In an effort to extend the life of landfill capacity as well as to ameliorate the social, economic and physical harm caused
by the disposal of Recyclable Waste in landfills, the Council of the City herby adopts the following provisions relating to
Recyclable Waste.

is generated and includes all activities up to the time when the material is delivered to the facility designated by
the owner of the Single Family Dwelling, Multiple Family Dwelling, Commercial Establishment or Licensee.
C. Compost - The product of a managed process through which microorganisms naturally break down organic
materials, including Yard Waste, fruit or vegetable matter, eggshells or coffee grounds, by bacteria, fungi and
other organisms into more available forms suitable for application to the soil and is used to improve soil
structure and provide nutrients to the soil.
D. Compost Area – A defined area used for composting.
E. Composting - Any above ground microbial process that converts decaying organic materials to compost, humus

mowing, trimming, gardening or raking consisting of grass clippings, twigs, tree and brush clippings, straw, pine
needles, tree branches, soft vegetative garden waste and leaves..
The definitions applicable to Section 5.36 shall govern any terms used but not defined herein.

SECTION 9.42. EDEN PRAIRIE SMOKEFREE AIR ORDINANCE OF 2002. This Section shall be known as
the Eden Prairie Smokefree Air Ordinance of 2002.
Source: Ordinance No. 31-2002
Effective Date: 11-21-2002
Subd. 1. General Provisions.
A. Findings and Intent. The Eden Prairie City Council does hereby find that:
1. Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution,
and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of
disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung
cancer. The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that secondhand smoke is responsible for the
early deaths of 65,000 Americans annually.
2. The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program has listed secondhand smoke as a
known carcinogen (U.S. DHHS, 2000, citing Cal. EPA, 1997).
9-49
3. Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular
disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with
obstructive airway disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of
asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and
cancer.
4. The Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public
places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability.
5. The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers
within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to
secondhand smoke. The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke
cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are
only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known
toxins in secondhand smoke.
6. A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who
work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a 25-50% higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of
death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and
measurable decrease in lung function.
7. Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower
productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and
increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke.
8. Smoking is a potential cause of fires.
9. Accordingly, the Eden Prairie City Council finds and declares that the purposes of this ordinance
are (1) to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in city facilities and parks.
B. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall have the meanings:
1. “City Facilities” means buildings owned or operated by the City, including owned or operated
outdoor areas of the lot or parcel on which the building is situated.
2. “E Cigarette” means any electronic-smoking device that can be used to deliver nicotine or any
other substances to the person inhaling from the device, including but not limited to electronic
cigarettes, electronic cigars, electronic pipes or any other similar device.
Source: Ordinance No. 11-2014
Effective Date: 3-13-2014
3. “Parks” means any open or enclosed land and improvements or facility wherever located which is
owned, leased or operated by the City and which is reserved, designated or used for a playground,
picnic area, garden area, beach, or other recreational or open space area.
4. "Smoking" means inhaling, exhaling, burning, or carrying any lighted cigar, cigarette, e cigarette,
pipe, weed, or plant in any manner or in any form.

9-56
Subd. 1. Declaration of Policy. The Council has determined that the health of trees is threatened by tree pests. It is
further determined that the loss of trees growing upon public and private property would substantially depreciate the
value of property within the City and impair the safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of the public. It is
declared to be the intention of the Council to attempt to control and attempt to prevent the spread of these pests and this
Section is enacted for that purpose.

Subd. 3. Tree Inspector. The City Manager may appoint a tree inspector to coordinate under the direction and control
of the Director of Parks and Recreation all activities of the City relating to the control and prevention of tree pests. The

prevention of said pests and enforce or cause to be enforced the duties incident to such a program adopted by the
Council. The term “tree inspector” includes any person designated by the City Manager or the tree inspector to carry out
activities authorized in this Section.
Subd. 4. Notice of Inspection. Except as provided in Subdivision 6, whenever a tree inspector determines with
reasonable certainty that a public nuisance, as described by this Section, is being maintained or exists on premises in the
City, the tree inspector is authorized to abate a public nuisance according to the procedures in this Subdivision.
A. The tree inspector will notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the premises that a public nuisance
exists and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The notice may be given in person or by mail. Failure
of any party to receive the mail does not invalidate the service of the notice. A copy of the notice shall be filed
in the records of the Department of Parks and Recreation.
B. The notice of abatement shall state and describe the property affected; state that if removal has not taken place
the City as a remedial action will remove or cause removal of such tree; that all costs thereof will be billed to
the property owner payable within thirty (30) days; that if payment is not received, the costs will be assessed
against the property from which such tree is removed pursuant to and in accordance with Minn. Stat. § 429.101
or any similar provision hereinafter enacted; inform the property owner of the right to a hearing before the City
Manager or the Manager’s designee to appeal the notice in accordance with Subd. 4; and inform the property
owner that upon filing of a timely appeal, the time to comply with the notice is stayed pending a decision by the
City Manager or the City Manager’s designee on the appeal. The notice shall specify the control measures to be
taken to abate the nuisance, and state the amount of time to abate the nuisance in accordance with Subdivision 6.
The notice will also state that the owner or occupant has the right to appeal the determination that a public
nuisance exists by submitting a request in writing to the City Clerk within seven (7) days after service of the
9-57
notice, or before the date by which abatement must be completed, whichever comes first and if not so filed that
the right to appeal is waived. In the interest of justice or to comply with time requirements and on his or her own
motion or the motion of the party appealing, the City Manager or City Manager’s designee may adjourn the
hearing to a more convenient time or place; but such time or place shall be fixed and determined before
adjournment so as to avoid the necessity for formal notice of reconvening. The City Manager or City Manager’s
designee may affirm, amend or reverse all or any portion of the notice and shall set a new deadline for
compliance if the order to remove the tree is affirmed.

Minnesota.
Subd. 5. Abatement of Tree Pest Nuisances. If no timely appeal is submitted, and the control measures prescribed in
the notice of abatement are not complied with within the time provided by the notice or any additional time granted, the
tree inspector or designated person shall have the authority to obtain permission to enter the property and carry out
abatement in accordance with the notice of abatement. In abating the nuisance defined in Subdivision 2, the infected tree
or wood shall be removed and burned or otherwise effectively treated so as to destroy and prevent as fully as possible the
spread of the pest. Such abatement procedures shall be carried out in accordance with current technical and expert
methods and plans as may be designated by the Commissioner of Agriculture of the State of Minnesota and with the
approval of appropriate City officials.
Subd. 6. Abatement Procedure in Event of Imminent Danger.
A. If the tree inspector determines that the danger of infestation to other shade trees is imminent or delay in control
measures may put public health, safety or welfare in immediate danger, the tree inspector may provide for
abatement without following the procedure in Subdivisions 4 and 5. The tree inspector must make a reasonable
attempt to provide written notice to the owner or occupant of the affected property of the intended action. The
notice shall also inform the owner or occupant of the right to appeal the abatement and any cost recovery by
filing an appeal with the City Manager within five (5) business days of the date of the notice in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Subdivision 4 B.

Section 9.75. REGULATION OF PET STORES Source: Ordinance No. 7-2018
Effective Date: 5-10-2018
Subd. 1. Policy.
A. The City Council finds that a significant number of puppies and kittens sold at pet stores, come from large-scale,
commercial breeding facilities where the health and welfare of the animals are not adequately provided for; and
B. The City Council finds that the documented abuses endemic to mass breeding facilities include over-breeding;
inbreeding; minimal to no-existent veterinary care; lack of adequate and nutritious food, water and shelter; lack
of socialization; lack of adequate space; lack of adequate exercise; no or limited screening of genetic diseases;
inadequate transportation and shipping protocols of puppies and kittens; and indiscriminate disposal of breeding
dogs and cats who have reached the end of their profitable breeding cycle; and
C. The City Council finds that inhumane conditions in mass breeding facilities lead to health and behavioral issues
in the animals bred in those facilities, which many consumers are unaware of when purchasing animals from pet
stores due to both a lack of education on the issue and misleading tactics of pet stores in some cases. These
health and behavioral issues, which may not present themselves until sometime after the purchase of the
animals, can impose exorbitant financial and emotional costs on consumers; and
D. The City Council finds that current Federal and State regulations do not properly address the sale of dogs and
cats in pet stores, while the City of Eden Prairie does not possess adequate resources to safeguard the health and
well-being of dogs and cats at the point of sale; and
E. The City Council finds that due in large part to pet overpopulation, numerous dogs and cats are euthanized.
Restricting the retail sale of puppies and kittens is likely to increase demand from animal shelters and rescue
organizations; and
F. The City Council finds that across the country, thousands of independent pet stores as well as large chains
operate profitably with a business model focused on the sale of pet services and supplies and not the sale of
commercially bred dogs or cats. Many of these stores collaborate with local animal shelters and rescue
organizations to offer space and support for showcasing adoptable homeless pets on their premises; and
G. The City Council finds that it is in the best interest of the City of Eden Prairie to adopt reasonable regulations to
help prevent inhumane breeding conditions, promote community awareness of animal welfare, and foster a more
humane environment in the City.
H. The City Council finds that this Section 9.75 will not adversely impact consumers' ability to obtain a dog or cat
of their choice directly from an animal shelter, or breed-specific rescue organization, or from a breeder where
the consumer can see directly the conditions in which the dogs or cats are bred or can confer directly with the
breeder concerning those conditions; and
I. The City Council finds that it is in the best interest of the City of Eden Prairie to adopt reasonable regulations to
help prevent inhumane breeding conditions, promote community awareness of animal welfare, and foster a more
human environment in the City.
J. The City Council finds that in accordance with the power granted to it by Minnesota Statutes Section
412.221, Subd. 21 to regulate the keeping of animals, and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
community, the City Council it is appropriate to adopt the regulations set forth below regarding the sale of
dogs and cats at pet stores.

5. All landscaping shall be implemented in accordance with the following:
(a) Size Requirements for Plantings: Deciduous overstory plantings shall be a minimum of two
and one-half (2½) caliper inches and a maximum of five (5) caliper inches; deciduous
understory trees shall be a minimum of one and one-half (1½) caliper inches and a maximum
of five (5) caliper inches; coniferous trees shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height and a
maximum of ten (10) feet in height; shrubs shall be a minimum five (5) gallon container size

Effective Date: 12-15-2016
11-19
(b) Total Caliper Inches Required: In order to achieve landscaping which is appropriate in scale
with the size of a building and site, the minimum number of caliper inches of trees required
shall be determined by dividing the total gross square footage of all floors of a building by
320. A single story building in excess of 20 feet in height shall be considered a two story
building for the purposes of determining its total gross square footage. A mixture of plant
material sizes shall be required as follows:
i. No more than eighty percent (80%) of trees may be of the minimum size
requirement.
ii. For the purposes of satisfying the total caliper inch requirement, coniferous trees
may be considered equivalent to overstory trees by dividing the height of a
coniferous tree 6 ft. height minimum by 2.4 to determine equivalent caliper inches.
iii. Understory trees may make up no more than twenty percent (20%) of the total tree
caliper inches required.
iv. Shrubs, perennials, or planting beds may be substituted for trees according to the
following limit: not less than ten percent (10%) and no more than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the total tree caliper inches required shall be replaced with Shrubs
and Perennials, or Planting Beds. Additional shrubs, perennials or planting beds
beyond the 25% substitution rate are allowed.
NOTE: When determination of height results in a fractional foot, any fraction of 0.5 or less
may be disregarded; a fraction in excess of 0.5 shall be counted as one foot.
Source: Ordinance No. 30-2016
Effective Date: 12-15-2016
(c) Shrubs and Perennials: Shrubs and perennials shall be provided to complete a quality
landscape treatment of the site. Replacement ratio: six (6) shrubs may replace three (3)
caliper inches of tree.
(d) Planting Beds and/or Decorative Planting Containers: Each planting bed or container shall
include a variety of plants which may include shrubs, ornamental grasses, ground cover,
vines, annuals, or perennials to provide year-round color and interest. Native plant species to
the local hardiness zone and those which provide interest and/or color in the winter are
preferred. Planting Beds must have a three (3) inch mulch application to bare soil
surrounding the plant material in order to qualify for the caliper inch replacement.
(e) Planting beds and/or decorative planting containers may replace up to twenty-five percent
(25%) of the required caliper inches for trees at a rate of three (3) caliper inches of trees per
five hundred (500) square feet of cumulative planting beds and/or decorative planting
containers. Planting beds must be planted annually in early spring and maintained throughout
the growing season. Decorative planting containers must be planted and maintained
seasonally throughout the year. Planting beds and/or decorative containers shall be planted
with spacing of species per industry standards.
(f) Species Diversity: Species diversity is required to ensure a long-term healthy landscape. Not
more than thirty percent (30%) of the required caliper inches shall be composed of one
species unless approved by the City. Plant material must be sourced from regional nurseries
to ensure healthy stock and non-invasive choices. The following trees are prohibited: a
11-20
species of the genus ulmus (elm), except those bred to be immune to Dutch Elm disease;
female gingko; box elder; willow; aspen.
(g) Naturalized Native Species: Native species, defined as those listed on the University of
Minnesota and MN Department of Natural Resources lists, are well adapted to the local
environment, require less maintenance, are healthier, and provide habitat for birds and
insects. Landscapes that include native and pollinator-friendly plant species, and provide
year-round interest with foliage color, flowers, fruits, or branching structure are required.
Landscaping that is low maintenance and requires little or no irrigation, shall be considered
as one of several grounds upon which the City Council may grant waivers from building
design or site design through the PUD process.
(h) Parking Lot Islands: Parking lot islands shall be required in lots of twenty (20) or more
spaces and shall be evenly distributed throughout the lot. Single aisle parking lots shall be
exempt from this provision. A parking lot island shall be a minimum of one hundred sixty
(160) square feet, shall stand-alone or be connected to other islands or sidewalks. No parking
lot island shall have any dimension less than five (5) feet. Parking lot islands shall be located
at the end of drive aisle rows and every 20 spaces. Five percent (5%) of the parking area,
including vehicular circulation areas, shall be comprised of parking lot islands that are
planted and not filled with only mulch, stone or paving. Planting requirements are the same
as those for Planting Beds.
(i) Method of Installation: All deciduous and coniferous trees shall be balled and burlapped,
staked, and guyed in accordance with national Nurseryman's standards. All shrubs shall be
potted.
(j) Sodding and Ground Cover: All open areas of a site not occupied by building, parking,
sidewalks, patios, storage, or other similar features shall be landscaped with a combination of
canopy trees, ornamental trees, evergreen trees, shrubs, perennial grasses, flowers, sod,
ground cover – including low/no mow grasses and perennials – and other design features to
ensure soil stabilization. Exceptions to this are seeding of future expansion areas as shown
on approved plans; undisturbed areas containing existing natural vegetation which shall be
maintained free of foreign and noxious materials; and, areas designated as open space for
future expansion area properly planted and maintained with prairie grass.
(k) Slopes and Berms: Final slopes greater than the ratio of 3:1 will not be permitted without
special approval or treatment, such as special seed mixtures or reforestation, terracing, or
retaining walls. Berming used to provide required screening of parking lots and other open
areas shall not have slopes in excess of 3:1.
(l) Installation and Maintenance of Materials: Responsibility for tree and plant growth and
maintenance is solely the responsibility of the property owner and runs with the land and is
binding on all future property owners. Owners shall be responsible for maintaining all
landscaping in a healthy condition and keeping it free from refuse and debris. Dead plant
materials shall be removed and replaced during the normal planting season. Materials must
be replaced with like species or as approved by city staff.
(m) Erosion Control: All areas of the site must be stabilized in accordance with Chapter 11.55
unless required otherwise in a federal, state or local permit.
(n) Preservation of Wetland and Woodland Areas: It is the policy of the City to preserve the
natural wetland and woodland areas throughout the City, and with respect to specific site
development, to retain as far as practical, substantial tree stands and wetlands which can be
11-21
incorporated into the Landscape Plan. No clear cutting of woodland areas shall be permitted.
Shade trees of six (6) inch or more caliper shall be saved unless it can be demonstrated that
there is no other feasible way to develop the site. The Council may require replacement of
any removed trees on a caliper inch for caliper inch basis.
(o) Placement of Plant Materials: No landscaping shall be allowed within any drainage utility
easements, road right of way, or immediately adjacent to any driveway or road intersection
when it would interfere with motorists' views of the street or roadway.
(p) Mechanical Equipment Screening:
(1) All mechanical equipment mounted on the exterior of a building and possessing one
or more of the characteristics listed below in (p) (3) shall be physically screened
from all public roads and adjacent differing land uses with factory prefinished
metal, wood laminated with metal, or other building material in a manner
architecturally integral to the building or buildings on site.
(2) All mechanical equipment located on the ground and possessing one or more of the
characteristics listed below in (p) (3) shall be physically screened from all public
roads and adjacent differing land uses with either plant material or factory
prefinished metal, wood laminated with metal, or other building material in a
manner architecturally integral to the building or buildings on site.
(3) Irregular in size and shape; Exposed and/or protruding fans, grills, pipes, tubes,
wires, vents; unfinished metal covering, exposed rivets, exposed seams.
(q) General Screening: All parking, loading, service, utility, and outdoor storage areas shall be
screened from all public roads and adjacent differing land uses as measured from eye level at
grade from public roads and adjacent differing land uses. Screening shall consist of any
combination of the following: earth mounds, fences, shrubs, compact evergreen trees, or
dense deciduous hedge. Hedge materials must be at least three (3) feet in height, at planting.
The height and depth of the screening shall be consistent with the height and size of the area
for which screening is required. When natural materials, such as trees or hedges, are used to
meet the screening requirements of this subsection, density and species of planting shall be
such to achieve seventy five percent (75) opacity year round at maturity.
(1) Well defined breaks in the screen along public roads are required to facilitate
pedestrian access from the public right of way to the building. These openings shall
align with the parking lot layout requirements for pedestrian access (Section 11.03
Subd 3. H 5 e) and shall be in addition to driveways or visually distinctive if
adjacent to a driveway. Connections to adjacent uses must be facilitated as
determined through approval process.
(2) Appropriate elements to include in screening proposals for parking lots along public
roads include transit shelters, benches, public art or similar features as part of the
screen.
(3) Parking lot screening shall be a minimum of three (3) feet in height, measured from
the parking lot surface, in order to screen cars and headlights, and shall allow breaks
for pedestrian connections as described in q (1).
(r) General Landscape for Residential Districts: In R1-44, R1-22, R1-13.5, R1-9.5, RM-6.5 and
RM-2.5 districts all exposed ground area surrounding the principal building and accessory
11-22
buildings which are not devoted to driveways, sidewalks, or patios, shall be landscaped with
grass, shrubs, trees or other ornamental landscape material. No landscaped area shall be used
for the parking of vehicles or storage or display of materials, supplies, or merchandise.
(s) Public Art: Integration of public art into private development, in addition to privately owned
amenities such as plazas, courtyards, fountains, outdoor art, roof top gardens and green roofs
and other decorative elements, which enhances the design of the landscaping may be
considered as one of several grounds upon which the City Council may grant waivers from
landscaping requirements through the PUD process. Public art on a site should be situated in
a way that it can be viewed from an adjacent right-of-way or public spaces.

Effective Date: 9-27-2018
Previous Ordinance No. 15-2016
Effective Date: 8-25-2016
Subd. 1. Purposes.
11-57
The intent of the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) zoning ordinance is to provide for development of attractive,
compact, pedestrian-friendly, high density, environmentally and economically sustainable, transit-oriented areas which
allow a complementary mix of land uses. A TOD land use pattern supports transit system investments, optimizes
development opportunities, and helps achieve many goals and policies outlined in the Eden Prairie Comprehensive Plan.
To support the intent of Transit Oriented Development (TOD), the specific purposes of the TOD zoning districts are to:
A. Promote high density development within convenient walking and biking distance of a transit station, including
increased residential densities, employee densities, and non-residential floor area ratios (FARs);
B. Accommodate a complementary mix of market-supportive land uses including residential, office, public
(buildings, plazas, open spaces), light industrial, and where appropriate, select commercial uses;
C. Ensure building and site design is oriented to public spaces – streets, sidewalks, plazas, open spaces, and the
transit station – and emphasizes a pedestrian-friendly environment;
D. Support an urban design pattern that encourages active living – the integration of physical activity into daily
routines and healthy mobility choices, including walking, biking, riding scooters, and rollerblading, and other
forms of pedestrian travel and includes accommodations for persons with disabilities to connect to transit;
E. Promote strategies and designs that decrease the need for parking, including compact/mixed-use development
patterns, on-street parking, joint use parking, structured parking, access to transit and shuttle services, bike
sharing, and car sharing;
F. Incorporate public amenities such as parks and plazas, civic spaces, public art, landscaped streetscapes,
benches, and sidewalks/trails that provide connections between development sites, transit, and the City’s overall
sidewalk/trail network;
G. Incorporate urban design principles that promote the safety and comfort of residents, employees, visitors, and
transit riders;
H. Promote high quality and aesthetically attractive building forms that contribute to a positive City image, help to
identify the unique characteristics of the location, and enhance the streetscape environment for pedestrians,
bicyclists, transit riders, and vehicular drivers; and
I. Incorporate sustainability practices relating to building lifespan such as reuse and recycling of materials, energy
and water efficiency, storm water management, and economic resilience through lower operating costs.
There are three (3) Transit Oriented Development (TOD) zoning districts:
A. The TOD-Mixed Use (TOD-MU) district encourages high-density, mixed-use, and pedestrian-oriented
development that supports transit usage.
B. The TOD-Residential (TOD-R) district allows for moderate- to high-density residential development with some
allowance for limited commercial uses.
C. The TOD-Employment (TOD-E) district allows for moderate- to high-density office, light industrial and
institutional development with some allowance for limited commercial uses.
The individual TOD district standards are described in Subdivision 4.
Subd. 2. Definitions.
11-58
A. 10-Minute Walkshed is the area surrounding each of an existing or planned commuter bus or light rail transit
station that is accessible by walking within a 10-minute timeframe.
B. Attached Building is an individual structure on a parcel consisting of multiple similar units arranged side by
side where each unit shares a common wall with the adjacent unit. All building entries are located at the ground
level facing the primary street or facing a courtyard that is open to the street.
C. Building Break – A recess in the building façade that provides facade articulation, creates the impression that
one building is two or more buildings, incorporates a unique building element, and improves the building’s
overall composition and aesthetic. Minimum requirements for a building break are a depth of two (2) feet and a
width of four (4) feet.
D. Building Stepback – A setback of a building’s upper floor(s) in order to reduce the building’s bulk, articulate
the base of the building, ensure a more comfortable street environment, and provide light and air at street level.
E. Building Street Frontage – The proportion of a lot’s frontage on a public street that is occupied by a building
as measured at the required maximum front yard setback. Corner lots must meet maximum front yard setback
requirements for both public street frontages.
F. Building Transparency – Openings in the street-facing façade of a building which are transparent, including
windows and doors that enable increased physical and/or visual interaction between street/sidewalk/plaza
activities and a building’s interior uses and activities.
G. Commercial Ready – a space constructed to meet a minimum ground floor height that accommodates
retail/commercial use as established by City Code Chapter 11. The intent of Commercial Ready standard is to
provide the flexibility to occupy ground floor space in accordance with market demand while allowing a future
transition to retail/commercial uses as the market dictates.
H. Drive-Thru Facilities – Facilities that accommodate automobiles and from which the occupants of the
automobiles may make purchases or transact business, including the stacking spaces needed for waiting
vehicles. Examples of drive-thru facilities include, but are not limited to, drive-up windows, menu boards, order
boards or boxes, drive-in restaurants and drive-up banks.
I. Flex Building is a building designed to be versatile and may be used in combination with office, research and
development, sales/showroom, industrial processing, distribution/warehousing, or high tech.
J. Flex Space: A use providing its occupants the flexibility of utilizing the space. Usually provides a configuration
allowing a flexible amount of office or showroom space in combination with manufacturing, laboratory,
warehouse distribution, etc.
K. Ground Floor Height – measurement taken from floor to floor
L. Joint Use Parking - A parking facility shared by two or more uses, tenants, or properties.
M. Liner Building is a building designed to line the outside of a parking structure along a public street frontage
with an active ground floor use. A liner building may also include active upper floors.
N. Mixed-Use Building – A multi-story building that contains allowed retail and services on the ground floor and
allowed residential and/or office uses on the upper floors.
11-59
O. Neighborhood Commercial – Small-scale retail stores and personal services primarily serving nearby
residential areas and nearby businesses and their employees and small-scale specialty shops and services. No
individual tenant space shall exceed 10,000 sq. ft. in area with the exception of grocery stores, which shall not
exceed 25,000 sq. ft. in area. Drive-thru facilities are prohibited as a neighborhood commercial use.
P. Ornamental grillwork is a decorative metal grate placed on a building façade to provide screening and
architectural interest along a street front facade.
Q. Pilaster is a shallow rectangular column placed on a building façade, typically as a decorative architectural
element to provide articulation of the building façade.
R. Public Open Space: A publicly or privately owned area designated for use by the public such as a park, trail,
sidewalk or plaza that is accessible to the public.
S. Stacked Building is a multi-level structure comprised of single-floor or multi-floor units that are stacked
vertically and connected with one or more shared entries. This building type is typically designed for residential,
hospitality, or office uses.
T. Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is commonly described as a community or development that mixes
residential, office, commercial and open space, and allows for convenient or direct access to public
transportation. The design of TOD is specifically influenced by transit and focuses on walkability and
connections to other sites as well as transit.
U. Visitor Parking: An off street, surface parking areas for motor vehicles that will be parked for short periods of
time, and visiting within the Transit Oriented Development district. Visitor parking does not include long term
or all day employee parking or parking of delivery vehicles engaged in loading or unloading goods.
Subd. 3. Applicability.
A Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) district shall apply to property zoned under this Section. Any provisions
contained in this Section 11.26, which are inconsistent with or are in conflict with any other provision of the City Code
shall supersede such other provisions. Such properties will generally be within a 10-minute walkshed (the area within a
10-minute walking distance, or roughly a half-mile) of an existing or planned commuter bus or light rail transit station
consistent with the Comprehensive Guide Plan.
Nonconformities are governed under Minnesota Statutes 462.357, Subdivision 1.e.
Development proposals will be reviewed as part of the Site Plan and Architectural Design Review and Planned Unit
Development process set out in City Code Chapter 11.
Subd. 4. District Development Standards.
The following tables and diagrams include development standards for each of the three TOD zoning districts and are
intended to illustrate the desired character, form, and scale of development within each district. Additional standards and
required conditions that apply across all of the TOD zoning districts are addressed in Subdivisions 5 through 9 of this
section.
A. Development Standards: Transit Oriented Development - Mixed Use (TOD-MU).
STATEMENT OF POLICY: The TOD-Mixed Use (TOD-MU) district encourages high-density, mixed-use,
and pedestrian-oriented development that supports transit usage. The TOD-MU district is intended to generally
be applied closest to the transit station. Buildings are mid- to high-rise structures with active ground floor uses.
11-60
A mix of office, residential, hotel, and institutional uses, along with ground floor shops, services, and restaurants
encourage activity throughout the day, and provide residents, visitors, transit riders, and employees with
amenities and services that support their day-to-day needs within convenient walking distance. The specific
permitted uses are set forth below in the chart titled Permitted Uses-TOD-MU District. The diagrams set out
below are intended to illustrate the application of the above statement of policy.
District Diagram, Land Use Character and Built Form Description: The TOD MU district features a high-density
development pattern with stacked mixed-use buildings. Requirements for street-fronted architecture, minimal
setbacks, and active ground floor uses contribute to a more safe and walkable street environment. To that end,
parking is predominantly provided in structured or underground parking and is located away from primary transit
streets.

B. Development Standards: Transit Oriented Development - Residential (TOD-R).
STATEMENT OF POLICY: The Transit Oriented Development – Residential (TOD-R) district allows for a mix
moderate to high-density housing, including stacked and attached residential building types, as well as limited
mixed-use development. Land uses in the TOD-R district shall be residential with a small amount commercial uses
(ground floor retail, services, and restaurants) that support the day-to-day needs of residents. The TOD-R district
shall generally be applied farther out from the transit station and provides more latitude in density and street
frontage requirements while still promoting transit-supportive densities and pedestrian-oriented urban design. The
specific permitted uses are set forth below in the chart titled Permitted Uses-TOD-R District. The diagrams set out
below are intended to illustrate the application of the above statement of policy. These higher density housing types,
both rental and ownership, shall be designed to optimize the district’s walkable access to retail, services, restaurants,
parks and trails, transit and community facilities. Buildings shall be located and designed to take advantage of views
of nearby natural amenities and where significant shading of lower buildings will not occur.
11-64
District Diagram, Land Use Character and Built Form Description: The TOD-R district features stacked and attached
residential building types, as well as mixed-use building with active ground-floor uses. Requirements for street-fronted
architecture and structured parking contribute to a more safe and walkable street environment. Slightly deeper setbacks
allow for additional landscaping, gardens, and small front or side yards. Street-facing architectural details such as
porches, stoops, and balconies encourage social interaction and contribute to the safety and comfort of the public realm.

Subd. 8. Landscaping and Open Space Standards.
A. All sites and buildings within the TOD district shall comply with Screening and Landscaping standards
established in Section 11.03 Subd 3(G) of Chapter 11 of the City Code, except for Items 4. (a). Minimum Size
Requirements for Plantings and 4. (b) Total Caliper Inches Required. The following standards apply within the
TOD district in lieu of said Items 4.(a) and 4.(b):
1. Minimum Size Requirements for Plantings: Deciduous overstory plantings shall be a minimum of three
(3) caliper inches; deciduous understory trees shall be a minimum of two (2) caliper inches; and
coniferous trees shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in height.
2. Total Caliper Inches Required: Sites with up to 5 acres of on-site pervious area require a minimum of
three (3) caliper inches of trees for every 500 square feet of the on-site pervious surface area. Sites
with 5 acres or greater of on-site pervious area require a minimum of three (3) caliper inches of trees
for every 750 square feet of the on-site pervious area. Pervious pavement areas, green roofs, and
undevelopable areas including but not limited to: wetlands, floodways, archeological resource areas,
and water bodies are excluded from the on-site pervious surface area calculation.
3. Planting beds and/or decorative planting containers may replace up to 50% of the required caliper
inches for trees at a rate of three (3) caliper inches of trees per 500 square feet of cumulative planting
beds and/or decorative planting containers.
4. Planting Beds and/or Decorative Planting Containers: Each planting bed or container shall include a
variety of plants which may include shrubs, ornamental grasses, ground cover, vines, annuals, or
perennials to provide year round color and interest. Native plant species to the local hardiness zone
and those which provide interest and/or color in the winter are encouraged.
5. Existing trees on the developable portions of the site that will remain after construction and/or existing
trees on the overall site that provide benefits such as screening may be considered as counting toward a
portion of the caliper inches required by this section as determined through the PUD process. Any
existing trees proposing to remain shall be determined to be healthy and of the appropriate species as
determined by the City.
6. Eco-grass, green roofs, rooftop gardens, limiting irrigation through xeriscaping and rainwater
collection and reuse, public art, and other sustainable practices related to landscaping may be
considered as counting toward a portion of the caliper inches required by this section as determined
through the PUD process.
B. Due to the urban character of the TOD District, less landscaping space will be available typically than in other
zoning districts. Therefore a higher level of landscaping design detail is required for the concentrated open
space, pervious surface areas, plazas, planters, screening areas and streetscape areas. Examples of a higher level
of landscaping design include rooftop gardens and green roofs, both of which are encouraged. A detailed
landscape plan prepared by a landscape architect shall be submitted with the development application. Other
privately owned amenities are encouraged, such as plazas, courtyards, fountains, outdoor art, roof top gardens
and green roofs, and other decorative elements.
11-74
C. The following privately owned and maintained Usable Open Space forms are permitted to meet the
requirements for usable outdoor open space:
1. Pocket Park: A Pocket Park is an open space of no less than .05 acres in size that is available for
recreation. A Pocket Park may be spatially defined by landscaping rather than building frontages and
may be linear in form or shape. A pocket park may consist of a landscaped and maintained lawn, trees,
and seating areas that are naturalistically disposed.
2. Square: An open space available for passive recreation and civic purposes. A Square Usable open
Space is spatially defined by building frontages. Its landscape shall consist of paths, lawns, trees,
hardscape, and public art formally disposed. Square Usable Open Spaces shall be located at the
intersection of important main streets. There shall be no minimum size for a square.
3. Plaza: An open space available for public use, community events, and/or commercial activities. A
Plaza Usable Open Space shall be spatially defined by building frontages. Its landscape shall consist
primarily of hardscape, plantings, public art, and trees. There shall be no minimum size for a Plaza.
4. Play Area: An open space designed and equipped for the recreation of children. A Play Area shall be
fenced and may include an open shelter. Play areas shall be interspersed within residential or mixeduse
areas and may be placed within a block. Play areas may be included within parks and greens.
There shall be no minimum or maximum size.
5. Pedestrian way: Natural or landscaped walking paths and running trails.
D. The following shall not constitute Useable Open Space: landscape strips or enlargements/enhancements of
landscaping areas adjacent to the sidewalk; shrubs, flowers and other low profile landscaping around buildings,
sidewalks and parking areas; required minimum building setback areas; yards associated with private dwellings;
or outdoor areas that prohibit public or tenant access during normal business hours. Alternative useable open
space areas may be considered as counting toward a portion of the useable open space requirement of this
section as determined through the PUD process.
Subd. 9. Supplemental Analysis or Study.
A. Traffic.
All development and zoning projects in the TOD District require documentation of the expected traffic impacts
of the development. The scope of the traffic analysis is dependent on several factors including the size, type,
and location of the development. The City Engineer should be contacted early in the project to determine the
appropriate scope of traffic analysis and to determine if a formal Traffic Impact Study is required. All
development applications, regardless of size, shall document the size and type of the proposed development and
provide Daily, AM Peak, and PM Peak traffic generation estimates for the development.
B. Travel Demand Management (TDM).
All development applications for office and light industrial uses shall include a Travel Demand Management
(TDM) plan. The plan shall document TDM measures to be implemented, a two year budget, and an evaluation
plan. TDM strategies that shall be considered in the TDM plan include, but are not limited to, financial
incentives for carpoolers, vanpoolers and bicyclists, subsidized transit passes, preferential location of
carpool/vanpool parking, bicycle racks and storage, access to shower and lockers, and promotion of commuter
programs. As a condition of approval a TDM cash escrow, letter of credit with a corporation approved by the
City Manager or other guarantee acceptable to the City Manager equal to 100% of the cost of implementing the
first two years of the TDM Plan will be required. All new residential development applications should consider
11-75
TDM strategies such as bikeshare and carshare memberships, subsidized transit passes, and an information
kiosk onsite.
C. Parking.
All zoning and development projects in the TOD District require documentation of the parking plan for the
project site including the number of required parking spaces, the number of provided parking spaces and any
proposed use of proof of parking. The location and quantity of parking will be reviewed on a case-by–case
basis as part of the development review process. Based on the specifics of the parking plan for the project site a
formal Parking Study may be required. The City Planner should be contacted prior to application and early in
the project to review the parking plan for the project and to determine if a formal Parking Study is required.

SECTION 11.27. TC TOWN CENTER DISTRICT.
Subd. 1. Purposes. The intent of the Town Center (TC) zoning district is to provide an area for development of an
attractive, compact, walkable, mixed-use town center that creates a live/work/play environment for the community.
To support the intent of the Town Center, the purposes of the TC zoning district are to:
A. Provide a mix of higher density regional uses, vertical mixed uses, more housing within walking distance of
services, and a more efficient, compact and connected development pattern;
B. Incorporate connections between the various land uses; including pedestrian, street and visual;
C. Incorporate civic amenities such as urban parks and plazas, civic and cultural spaces, sidewalks and trails, and
landscaped streetscapes;
D. Promote strategies and designs that decrease the need for parking, including compact/mixed –use development
patterns, on-street parking, joint use parking, structured parking, access to transit and shuttle services, bike
sharing, and car sharing;
E. Locate and design buildings that are oriented to public spaces, including streets, sidewalks, plazas and open
spaces, to create the feel and function of a traditional town center and to emphasize a pedestrian oriented
environment; and
F. Encourage non-automobile access and circulation, including transit, walking and biking.
11-76
G. Support an urban design pattern that encourages active living – the integration of physical activity into daily
routines and healthy mobility choices, including walking, biking, riding scooters, and rollerblading, and other
forms of pedestrian travel and includes accommodations for persons with disabilities to connect to transit.
The standards applicable to the TC zoning district are intended to implement the vision, goals and principles established
in the Eden Prairie Major Center Area Framework Plan and Major Center Area Planning Principles and the Town Center
Design Guidelines, which will be carried out through specific standards related to land use mix, site planning, building
bulk & dimensions, architecture, building materials, transportation access, parking, landscaping, signage and lighting.
Subd. 2. Definitions. The following terms, as used in this Section, shall have the following meanings:
A. “Building Break” – A recess in the building façade that provides façade articulation, creates the impression that
one building is two or more buildings, incorporates a unique building element, and improves the building’s
overall composition and aesthetic. Minimum requirements for a building break are a depth of two (2) feet and a
width of four (4) feet.
B. “Building Stepback” – A setback of a building’s upper floor(s) in order to reduce the building’s bulk, articulate
the base of the building, ensure a more comfortable street environment, and provide light and air at street level.
C. “Building Street Frontage” – The proportion of a lot’s frontage on a public street that is occupied by a building
as measured at the required maximum front yard setback. Corner lots must meet maximum front yard setback

Subd. 10. Off-Street Vehicle Parking Standards.
A. Due to the more urban pedestrian oriented character of the Town Center area, the location and quantity of offstreet
parking spaces will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis as part of the development review process. In
general, the intent is for developments to provide a reduced number of off-street parking spaces to account for
availability of joint and shared-use parking, parking efficiencies resulting from a compact mixed-use
development pattern, on-street parking, transit, walking and bicycling. Off-street parking facilities shall be
provided as established in Table 4 or as determined through the development review process, recognizing the
potential for district, shared and public parking. Table 4 establishes minimum and maximum off-street parking
standards for uses within the Town Center district.

limited to, financial incentives for car poolers, van poolers and bicyclists, subsidized transit passes, preferential
location of carpool/vanpool parking, bicycle racks and storage, access to shower and lockers, and promotion of
commuter programs. As a condition of approval a TDM cash escrow, letter of credit with a corporation
approved by the City Manager or other guarantee acceptable to the City Manager equal to 100% of the cost of
implementing the first two years of the TDM Plan will be required. All new residential development
applications should consider TDM strategies such as bikeshare and carshare memberships, subsidized transit
passes, and an information kiosk onsite.
C. Parking. All zoning and development projects in the TC District require documentation of the parking plan for
the project site including the number of required parking spaces, the number of provided parking spaces and any
proposed use of proof of parking. The location and quantity of parking will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis
as part of the development review process. Based on the specifics of the parking plan for the project site a
formal Parking Study may be required. The City Planner should be contacted prior to application and early in
the project to review the parking plan for the project and to determine if a formal Parking Study is required.

required bicycle spaces shall be covered. Coverage may be provided under roof overhangs or awnings, in
bicycle lockers, indoor room, fenced in corral, within adjacent parking structures, or within underground
parking structures.
11-83
G. Shared Bicycle Parking. Shared off-street bicycle parking facilities are allowed to collectively provide bicycle
parking in any district for more than one structure or use. The applicant shall demonstrate meeting the
requirement through a joint use, district or shared parking agreement.
H. Proof of Bicycle Parking. Any bicycle parking not constructed, as shown on the site plan, shall be
constructed when determined necessary by the City Planner. If the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the City Planner that the required bicycle parking is in excess of the actual demand, all of the required
bicycle parking need not be constructed prior to the issuance of the initial certificate of occupancy for the
building being served. The area of future parking shall be landscaped, which landscaping shall not be used
to satisfy landscaping requirements. The City Planner shall notify the property owner in writing of the need

Requirements for Plantings and 4. (b) Total Caliper Inches Required. The following standards apply within the
TC district in lieu of said Item 4.(a):
1. Minimum Size Requirements for Plantings: Deciduous overstory plantings shall be a minimum of three (3)
caliper inches; deciduous understory trees shall be a minimum of two (2) caliper inches; and coniferous
trees shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in height.
2. Total Caliper Inches Required: Sites up to up to 5 acres of on-site pervious area require a minimum of three
(3) caliper inches of trees for every 500 square feet of the on-site pervious surface area. Sites with 5 acres
or greater of on-site pervious area require a minimum of three (3) caliper inches of trees for every 750
square feet of the on-site pervious area. Pervious pavement areas, green roofs, and undevelopable areas
including but not limited to: wetlands, floodways, archeological resource areas, and water bodies are
excluded from the on-site pervious surface area calculation.
3. Planting beds and/or decorative planting containers may replace up to 50% of the required caliper inches
for trees at a rate of three (3) caliper inches of trees per 500 square feet of cumulative planting beds and/or
decorative planting containers.

5. Existing trees on the developable portions of the site that will remain after construction and/or existing
trees on the overall site that provide benefits such as screening may be considered as counting toward a
portion of the caliper inches required by this section as determined through the PUD process. Any existing
trees proposing to remain shall be determined to be healthy and of the appropriate species as determined by
the City.
6. Eco-grass, green roofs, rooftop gardens, limiting irrigation through xeriscaping and rainwater collection
and reuse, public art, and other sustainable practices related to landscaping may be considered as counting
toward a portion of the caliper inches required by this section as determined through the PUD process.
11-84
B. Landscaping shall be in substantial conformance with the Town Center Design Guidelines. Due to the urban
character of the Town Center District, less landscape space will be available than in other zoning districts.
Therefore a higher level of design detail and level of landscaping is required for the concentrated open space,
pervious surface areas, plazas, planters, screening areas and streetscape areas. Rooftop gardens and green roofs
are encouraged. A detailed landscape plan prepared by a landscape architect shall be submitted with the
development application.

11-88
A. Findings and Purpose. The Minnesota Legislature in Minn. Stat. §152.22 through §152.37 has legalized the
distribution of medical cannabis with significant restrictions. The Council finds that it is appropriate to identify
in the City Code the zoning districts in which a medical cannabis distribution facility is an allowable use. The
Council finds that as a unique and highly regulated use medical cannabis distribution requires specific

Subd. 5. Sexually Oriented Businesses. Source: Ordinance No. 24-2018
Effective Date: 12-13-2018
A. Purpose and Findings. The purpose of this Subdivision is to control, through zoning regulations, sexually
oriented businesses, which have a direct and detrimental effect on the character of the City’s residential and
commercial neighborhoods. The City Council makes the following findings regarding the effect sexually
oriented businesses have on the character of the City’s neighborhoods.
1. Sexually oriented businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending places of
worship; children attending day care facilities; and students attending public or private schools.
2. Sexually oriented businesses can contribute to an increase in criminal activity in the area in which such
businesses are located, taxing city crime-prevention programs and law-enforcement services.
3. Sexually oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential
neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area in which
such businesses are located, thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing for
City residents.
4. The concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area can have a substantially detrimental
effect on the area in which such businesses are concentrated and on the overall quality of urban life. A
cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of sexually oriented businesses. The
presence of such businesses is perceived by others as an indication that the area is deteriorating and the
result can be devastating. Other businesses move out of the vicinity and residents flee from the area.
Declining real estate values, which can result from the concentration of such businesses, erode the
city’s tax base and contribute to overall urban blight.
B. Permitted Use. Sexually oriented businesses are a permitted use in the I-2 and I-5 Industrial Park Districts as
identified on the Zoning Map of the City of Eden Prairie subject to the restrictions contained in this Subdivision.
Sexually oriented businesses are prohibited in all other districts.
C. Performance Standards. All sexually oriented businesses shall comply with the following performance
standards:
1. No sexually oriented business may be located closer than 1000 feet from any other sexually oriented
business. Measurements will be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or
objects, from the nearest point of the property line of the building occupied by the sexually oriented
business to the nearest point of the property line of the building occupied by the other sexually
oriented business.
2. No sexually oriented business may be located closer than 1000 feet from any place of worship, day
care facility, or school. Measurements will be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening
structures or objects, from the nearest point of the property line of the building occupied by the
sexually oriented business to the nearest point of the property line of the building occupied by the
place of worship, day care facility, or school.
3. No sexually oriented business may be located closer than 1000 feet from any residential use.
Measurements will be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from
the nearest point of the property line of the building occupied by the sexually oriented business to the
nearest point of the property line of the building occupied by the residential use.
D. Licensing. All sexually oriented businesses shall comply with the licensing requirements of City Code Section
5.77.
11-90
E. Sign Regulations. In addition to the sign regulations contained in Section 11.70, the following sign regulations
apply to all sexually oriented businesses in the City. Where a provision of this subsection E conflicts with a
provision of Section 11.70, the more restrictive provision will apply.
1. All signs shall be wall signs. Free-standing signs, readerboard signs, and dynamic displays are
prohibited.
2. The amount of allowable sign area is 10% of the wall area that the sexually oriented business occupies
of the wall to which it is affixed or 30 square feet, whichever is less.
3. No merchandise, photos, or pictures of the products or entertainment on the premises may be displayed
in window areas or any area where they can be viewed from the sidewalk or public right-of-way
adjoining the building in which the sexually oriented business is located.
4. No signs may be placed in any window. A one square foot sign may be placed on the door to state
hours of operation and admittance to adults only.

SECTION 11.41. CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
Subd. 1. Categories of Conditional Use.
Source: Ordinance No. 22-2017
Effective Date: 12-21-2017
A. Historic Properties.
1. Policy and Purpose. Certain buildings within the City have been included within and designated by the
City as Heritage Preservation Sites pursuant to Section 11.05 of this chapter, or are listed in the
11-99
National Register of Historic Places. The intent of this Section is to encourage preservation,
revitalization and adaptive reuse of the many Historic Properties located in the City of Eden Prairie.
The permitted uses are intended to promote preservation of the historic and architectural character by
encouraging retention and appropriate use of existing structures as civic, retail, restaurant, personal
service and office establishments. The conditional uses listed in this Section must be reviewed by the
Heritage Preservation Commission and approved by the City Council after consideration in each case,
of the impact of such uses upon the property, neighboring uses, the surrounding area and the public
need for the particular use at the particular location. Limitations and standards are herein established
to insure the use’s consistency with the character, uses and activities in the rural district. In order to
accomplish such purposes, the following provisions relating to the issuance of conditional use
permits are adopted.
2. Areas Where Conditional Use Permits May Be Granted for Adaptive Reuse. Conditional use permits
for the adaptive use of a Heritage Preservation Site, is limited to historic properties situated within an
R-Rural District.
3. Permitted Uses for Adaptive Reuse of Heritage Preservation Sites. The adaptive use proposed for the
property must be a permitted use in either the Office District, Section11.20, Subd. 2(A) or (B), or the
Commercial Districts, Section 11.25, Subd. 2(A). Examples include: restaurants, bakeries, cafes,
delicatessens, coffee houses, ice cream parlors, bed and breakfasts, reception facilities, meeting or
conference facilities, professional office uses, museums, art galleries, antique shops, craft boutiques, or
retail stores or shops.
4. Duration of Permits. A Historic Properties conditional use permit shall remain in
effect as long as the conditions agreed upon are observed, provided, however, that the City may, at its
discretion, schedule an administrative or formal review at any time to determine whether the
conditions agreed upon are being observed. Any Historic Properties conditional use permit that
contains an expiration date shall be automatically extended in accordance with this paragraph.
B. Wireless Support Structures.
Source: Ordinance No. 22-2017
Effective Date: 12-21-2017
1. Policy and Purpose. The City desires high quality wireless services to accommodate the needs of City
residents and businesses. At the same time, the City strives to minimize the negative impacts that
wireless support structures and small wireless facilities can create, especially in the public right-of-way
in single-family residential areas. The City discourages the installation of new or replacement wireless
support structures in the public right-of-way in single-family residential districts, preferring instead
that small wireless facilities be collocated on existing structures. Recognizing, however, that the
provision of high quality wireless services may not be feasible without the installation of new or
replacement wireless support structures in single-family residential districts, the following provisions
relating to the issuance of conditional use permits are adopted. The conditional uses listed in this
Section must be reviewed by the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council after
consideration in each case, of the impact of such uses upon the property, neighboring uses, the
surrounding area and compliance with the conditions set forth in this Section.
2. Areas Where Conditional Use Permits May Be Granted. Conditional use permits
for the installation of new or replacement wireless support structures for the siting of small wireless
facilities in the public right-of-way may be granted in rights-of-way located within or abutting the R-1
One Family Residential Districts.
3. Duration of Permits. A Wireless Support Structure conditional use permit shall
remain in effect as long as the conditions agreed upon are observed, provided, however, that the City
11-100
may, at its discretion, schedule an administrative or formal review at any time to determine whether the
conditions agreed upon are being observed.

SECTION 11.45 FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS. Ordinance No. 24-2016
Effective Date: 10-13-2016
Prev. Source: Ordinance No. 25-2004
Effective Date: 8-26-2004
Subd. 1. Statutory Authorization and Purpose. The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes
Chapter 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F further states that communities subject to recurrent flooding
must participate and maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. Therefore, the City does ordain as
follows:
A. Statement of Purpose. This Section regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the City. These flood
hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of this Section to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions. This ordinance is also intended
to preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood
and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide
recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development.
11-104
B. National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This ordinance is adopted to comply with the rules and
regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78,
as amended, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
Subd. 2. General Provisions.
How to Use This Section. This Section adopts the floodplain maps applicable to the City and includes three
floodplain districts: Floodway, Flood Fringe, and General Floodplain.
1. Where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps, the standards in
Subdivisions 4 or 5 will apply, depending on the location of a property.
2. Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are not delineated on the floodplain maps are
considered to fall within the General Floodplain district. Within the General Floodplain district, the
Floodway District standards in Subdivision 4 apply unless the floodway boundary is determined,
according to the process outlined in Subdivision 6. Once the floodway boundary is determined, the
Flood Fringe District standards in Subdivision 5 may apply outside the floodway.
B. Lands to Which this Section Applies. This Section applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City
shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of
the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Floodplain Districts. The Floodway, Flood Fringe and General
Floodplain Districts are overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The standards
imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other requirements in this Section. In case of a conflict,
the more restrictive standards will apply. The City Engineer may review and reasonably utilize any regional
flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source in determining the boundary of
the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Floodplain District.
C. Incorporation of Maps by Reference. The following maps together with all attached material are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the Official Zoning Map and this Section. The attached
material includes the Flood Insurance Study for Hennepin County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas, dated
November 4, 2016 and the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels enumerated below, dated November 4, 2016, all
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file in the office of the City
Engineer. Effective Flood Insurance Rate Map panels include:
27053C0319F 27053C0344F 27053C0432F 27053C0442F
27053C0338F 27053C0410F 27053C0434F 27053C0445F
27053C0339F 27053C0420F 27053C0435F
27053C0343F 27053C0430F 27053C0440F
D. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. The regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) is an elevation no
lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway.
E. Interpretation. The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by scaling distances on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map.
1. Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the official zoning map and actual
field conditions, the flood elevations shall be the governing factor. The City Engineer must interpret
the boundary location based on the ground elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first
National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the regulatory floodplain, and other
available technical data.
11-105
2. Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a reasonable opportunity to
present their case to the Planning Commission and to submit technical evidence.
F. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or other private agreements. However, where this Section imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this Section prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this Section are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
G. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. This Section does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts
or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Section does not
create liability on the part of the City or its officers or employees for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this Section or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
H. Severability. If any subdivision, clause, provision, or portion of this Section is adjudged unconstitutional or
invalid by a court of law, the remainder of this Section shall not be affected and shall remain in full force.
I. Annexations. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into Subd. 2.C may include
floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the City at the time of adoption of this Section.
If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the City after the date of adoption of this Section, the
newly annexed floodplain lands will be subject to the provisions of this Section immediately upon the date of
annexation.
J. Detachments. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into Subd. 2.C will include
floodplain areas that lie inside the corporate boundaries of municipalities at the time of adoption of this Section.
If any of these floodplain areas are detached from a municipality and come under the jurisdiction of the City
after the date of adoption of this Section, the newly detached floodplain lands will be subject to the provisions
of this Section immediately upon the date of detachment.
Subd. 3. Definitions.
A. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Section must be interpreted according to
common usage and so as to give this Section its most reasonable application.
1. Accessory Use or Structure – a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily
incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure.
2. Base Flood Elevation – The elevation of the “regional flood.” The term “base flood elevation” is used
in the flood insurance survey.
3. Basement – any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below
ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level.
4. Conditional Use – a specific type of structure or land use listed in this Section that may be allowed but
only after an in-depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in
the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that:
(a) Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.
(b) The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists
and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
5. Critical Facilities – facilities necessary to the City’s public health and safety, those that store or
produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials, and those that house occupants that may be
11-106
insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury. Examples of critical facilities include hospitals,
correctional facilities, schools, daycare facilities, nursing homes, fire and police stations, wastewater
treatment facilities, public electric utilities, water plants, fuel storage facilities, and waste handling and
storage facilities.

other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage
of equipment or materials.
7. Equal Degree of Encroachment – a method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that
floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood
flows.
8. Farm Fence – A fence as defined by Minnesota Statutes Section 344.02, Subd. 1(a)–(d). An open type
fence of posts and wire is not considered to be a structure under this Section. Fences that have the
potential to obstruct flood flows, such as chain link fences and rigid walls, are regulated as structures
under this Section.
9. Flood – a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or lake that
results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
10. Flood Frequency – the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may
be equaled or exceeded.
11. Flood Fringe – the portion of the Special Flood Hazard Area (one percent annual chance flood)

14. Floodplain – the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse which have been
or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
15. Floodproofing – a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and
structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages.
16. Floodway – the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those portions of the
adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to carry or store the regional flood discharge.
17. Lowest Floor – the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or
flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area
other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements
of 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 60.3.
18. Manufactured Home – a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent
chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required

channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in,
along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede,
retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris
carried by such water.
21. One Hundred Year Floodplain – lands inundated by the Regional Flood.
22. Principal Use or Structure – all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures.
23. Reach – a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river
influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river
between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach.
24. Recreational Vehicle – a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when
measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable
by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this Section, the
term recreational vehicle is synonymous with the term “travel trailer/travel vehicle.”
25. Regional Flood – a flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in
Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in
the magnitude of the 1% chance or 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with
the term “base flood” used in a flood insurance study.
26. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE) - an elevation not less than one foot above the
elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the
floodplain that result from designation of a floodway.
27. Repetitive Loss - Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a
ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event on the average equals
or exceeds 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
28. Special Flood Hazard Area – a term used for flood insurance purposes synonymous with “One
Hundred Year Floodplain.”
29. Start of Construction – includes substantial improvement, and means the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement that occurred before
the building permit’s expiration date. The actual start is either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such
as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does
it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not
occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual
start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
30. Structure - anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities,
including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured
11-108
homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in Subd. 10.B.2, and other
similar items.
31. Substantial Damage - means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring
the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred.
32. Substantial Improvement - within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation
(including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred
“substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term Substantial
Improvement does not, however, include either:
(a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
(b) Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.” For the purpose of this ordinance,
“historic structure” is as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.
Subd. 4. Establishment of Zoning Districts.
A. Districts.
1. Floodway District. The Floodway District includes those areas within Zones AE that have a floodway
delineated as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in Subd. 2.C. For lakes, wetlands and
other basins within Zones A and AE that do not have a floodway delineated, the Floodway District
also includes those areas that are at or below the ordinary high water level as defined in Minnesota
Statutes, Section 103G.005, subdivision 14.
2. Flood Fringe District. The Flood Fringe District includes areas within Zones AE that have a floodway
delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in Subd. 2.C, but are located outside of the
floodway. For lakes, wetlands and other basins within Zones A and AE that do not have a floodway
delineated, the Flood Fringe District also includes those areas below the 1% annual chance (100-year)
flood elevation but above the ordinary high water level as defined in Minnesota Statutes, Section
103G.005, subdivision 14.
3. General Floodplain District. The General Floodplain District includes riverine areas within Zones A
or AE that do not have a delineated floodway as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in
Subd. 2.C.
B. Applicability. Within the floodplain districts established in this Subdivision 4, the use, size, type and location
of development must comply with the terms of this Section and other applicable regulations. In no case shall
floodplain development adversely affect the efficiency or unduly restrict the capacity of the channels or
floodways of any tributaries to the main stream, drainage ditches, or any other drainage facilities or systems. All
uses not listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in Subdivisions 5, 6, and 7 are prohibited. In addition,
critical facilities are prohibited in all floodplain districts.
Subd. 5. Floodway District (FW).

Department of Natural Resources’ Area Hydrologist at least ten days prior to issuance of any permit
for such uses.
B. Standards for Floodway Permitted Uses.
1. The use must have a low flood damage potential.
2. The use must not obstruct flood flows or cause any increase in flood elevations and must not involve
structures, obstructions, or storage of materials or equipment.
3. Any facility that will be used by employees or the general public must be designed with a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and
velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a
product of four upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
C. Conditional Uses. The following uses may be allowed as conditional uses following the standards and
procedures set forth in Subdivision 11.D of this Section and City Code Section 11.41 and further subject to the
standards set forth in Subd. 5.D, if otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district or any applicable overlay
district.
1. Structures accessory to the uses listed in Subd. 5.A and the uses listed in Subd. 5.C.2 through 5.C.7.

7. Levees or dikes intended to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than
the 10-year frequency flood event.
D. Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses.
1. All Uses. A conditional use must not cause any increase in the stage of the 1% chance or regional
11-110
flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
2. Fill; Storage of Materials and Equipment:
(a) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or
potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
(b) Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain must be
protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
Permanent sand and gravel operations and similar uses must be covered by a long-term site
development plan.
(c) Temporary placement of fill, other materials, or equipment which would cause an increase to
the stage of the 1% percent chance or regional flood may only be allowed if the City
Engineer has approved a plan that assures removal of the materials from the floodway based
upon the flood warning time available.
3. Accessory Structures. Accessory structures may be permitted, provided that:
(a) Structures are not intended for human habitation;
(b) Structures will have a low flood damage potential;
(c) Structures will be constructed and placed so as to offer a minimal obstruction to the flow of
flood waters;
(d) Service utilities, such as electrical and heating equipment, within these structures must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed;
(e) Structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the
FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code. All floodproofed
structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and
designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
(f) As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or
FP4 floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code, provided the accessory
structure constitutes a minimal investment and does not exceed 576 square feet in size.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria:
(1) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of
two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the structure, with a total net area
of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding; and
(2) There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the
structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will
not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
4. Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current, or cross-section of protected
wetlands or public waters are subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245.
11-111
5. A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must not cause an increase to the 1% chance of
regional flood. The technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a
stream.
6. Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining
floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system.
Subd. 6. Flood Fringe District (FF).
A. Permitted Uses. Permitted uses in the Flood Fringe District are those uses of land or structures allowed in the
underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the standards in Subd. 6.B.
B. Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses.
1. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor, as
defined, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures must be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill
must extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure.
2. Accessory Structures. As an alternative to the fill requirements of Subd. 6.B.1, structures accessory to
the uses identified in Subd. 6.A may be permitted to be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4
floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code, provided that:
(a) The accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 576 square feet in
size, and is only used for parking and storage.
(b) All portions of floodproofed accessory structures below the Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation (RFPE) must be: (i) adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls, (ii) be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, and (iii) must have all service utilities
be water-tight or elevated to above the RFPE.
(c) Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria:
(1) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of
two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the structure, with a total net area
of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding; and
(2) There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the
structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not
satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
3. The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel must not exceed 1,000 cubic yards,
unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with Subd. 6.B.1, or if
allowed as a conditional use under Subd. 6.C.
4. The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection
elevation.
5. All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or water-tight to prevent infiltration of
11-112
floodwaters.
6. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or
potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
7. All fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly protected by the use of riprap,
vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
8. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet
below the regulatory flood protection elevation, or must have a flood warning/emergency evacuation
plan acceptable to the City Engineer.
9. Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at an elevation lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation. However, any facilities used by employees or the general public
must be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is
inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per
second) would exceed a product of four upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
10. Interference with normal manufacturing/industrial plant operations must be minimized, especially
along streams having protracted flood durations. In considering permit applications, due consideration
must be given to the needs of industries with operations that require a floodplain location.
11. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the standards of Subdivision 10.
C. Conditional Uses. The following uses and activities may be allowed as conditional uses, if allowed in the
underlying zoning district(s) or any applicable overlay district, following the procedures in Subdivision 11.D
and City Code Section 11.41.
1. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with Subds. 6.B.1 or 6.B.2.
2. Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
3. The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill when the fill is not being used to
elevate a structure in accordance with Subd. 6.B.1.
D. Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses.
1. The standards listed in Subds. 6.B.4 through 6.B.10 apply to all conditional uses.
2. Basements are subject to the following:
(a) Residential basement construction is not allowed below the regulatory flood protection
elevation.
(b) Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation
provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with Subd. 6.D.3.
3. All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be placed below the regulatory flood
protection elevation must be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing
classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP1 or FP2
floodproofing classification in the State Building Code, which requires making the structure watertight
with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components
capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
11-113
4. The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material on a parcel (other than
for the purpose of elevating a structure to the regulatory flood protection elevation) must comply with
an approved erosion/sedimentation control plan.
(a) The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event
at a minimum of the regional (1% chance) flood event.
(b) The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other
qualified individual acceptable to the City Engineer.
(c) The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the
floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
5. Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood protection elevation must comply with
an approved emergency plan providing for removal of such materials within the time available after a
flood warning.
Subd. 7. General Floodplain District (GF).
A. Permitted Uses.
1. The uses listed in Subd. 5.A are permitted uses in the General Floodplain District.
2. All other uses are permitted subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria specified in Subd.
7.B. Subd. 5 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the Floodway District. Subd. 6 applies
if the proposed use is determined to be in the Flood Fringe District.
B. Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations.
1. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the General Floodplain District,
the City Engineer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and
floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source.
2. If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, the applicant shall furnish
additional information as needed to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether
the proposed use would fall within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District. Information must be
consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards and the standards in Subd.
7.B.3.
3. The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the following factors, as applicable:
(a) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance) flood.
(b) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of
the stream channel and overbank areas.
(c) Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing
flood stages more than one-half (0.5) foot. A lesser stage increase than 0.5 foot is required if,
as a result of the stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing
floodway boundaries.
4. The City Engineer shall review the submitted information and assess the technical evaluation and the
11-114
recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary. The assessment shall include the
cumulative effects of previous floodway encroachments. The City Engineer may seek technical
assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency, including the Department of
Natural Resources. Based on this assessment, the City Engineer may approve or deny the application.
5. Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been determined, the City Engineer
shall process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of Subdivisions 5 and 6.
Subd. 8. Land Development Standards.
A. In General. Recognizing that flood prone areas may exist outside of the designated floodplain districts, the
requirements of this Subdivision 8 apply to all land within the City.
B. Subdivisions. No land may be subdivided which is unsuitable for reasons of flooding or inadequate drainage,
water supply, or sewage treatment facilities. Manufactured home parks and recreational vehicle parks or
campgrounds are considered subdivisions under this Section.
1. All lots within the floodplain districts must be able to contain a building site outside of the Floodway
District at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
2. All subdivisions shall have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no
lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation, unless a flood warning emergency
plan for the safe evacuation of all vehicles and people during the regional (1% chance) flood has been
approved by the City Engineer. The plan shall be prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified
individual, and shall demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation.
3. For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries, the
regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly
labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
4. In the General Floodplain District, applicants shall provide the information required in Subd. 7.B to
determine the regional flood elevation, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries and the
regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site.
5. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood prone area, any such
proposal must be reviewed to assure that:
(a) The proposal is consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood prone
area,
(b) All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, are located
and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and
(c) Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of flood hazard.
C. Building Sites. If a proposed building site is in a flood prone area, all new construction and substantial
improvements (including the placement of manufactured homes) shall be:
1. Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent floatation, collapse, or lateral movement
of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
2. Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
11-115
3. Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and
4. Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other
service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
Subd. 9. Public Utilities, Railroads, Roads, and Bridges.
A. Public Utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be
located in the floodplain must be floodproofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
B. Public Transportation Facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located within the floodplain shall
comply with Subdivisions 5 and 6. These transportation facilities shall be elevated to the regulatory flood
protection elevation where failure or interruption of these facilities would result in danger to the public health or
safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or
railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where the City Engineer determines that failure or interruption
of transportation services will not endanger the public health or safety.
C. On-site Water Supply and Sewage Treatment Systems. Where public utilities are not provided: 1) On-site
water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
are subject to the provisions of Minnesota Rules Chapter 4725.4350; and 2) New or replacement on-site sewage
treatment systems (i) shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters, (ii) shall not be subject to impairment or contamination during
times of flooding, and (iii) are subject to the provisions of Minnesota Rules Chapter 7080.2270.
Subd. 10. Manufactured Homes, Manufactured Home Parks, and Recreational Vehicles.
A. Manufactured Homes. New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing manufactured home parks
are prohibited in any floodplain district. For existing manufactured home parks or lots of record, the following
requirements apply:
1. Placement or replacement of manufactured homes is prohibited in the Floodway, Flood Fringe and
General Floodplain Districts.
B. Recreational Vehicles. New recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and expansions to existing recreational
vehicle parks or campgrounds are prohibited in any floodplain district. Placement of recreational vehicles in
existing recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds located in the floodplain shall meet the exemption criteria
below or be treated as new structures meeting the requirements of this Section.
1. Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this Section if they are placed in any of the
following areas and meet the criteria listed in Subd. 10.B.2:
(a) Individual lots or parcels of record.
(b) Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds.
(c) Existing condominium-type associations.
2. Criteria for Exempt Recreational Vehicles:
(a) The vehicle must have a current license required for highway use.
11-116
(b) The vehicle must be highway ready, meaning on wheels or the internal jacking system,
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities commonly used in campgrounds
and recreational vehicle parks.
(c) No permanent structural type additions may be attached to the vehicle.
(d) The vehicle and associated use must be permissible in any pre-existing, underlying zoning
district.

in the Flood Fringe District must be constructed of flood-resistant materials and be securely
anchored, meeting the requirements applicable to manufactured homes in this Subd. 10.B.2.
(f) An accessory structure must constitute a minimal investment
3. Recreational vehicles that are exempt under Subd. 10.B.2 lose this exemption when development
occurs on the site that exceeds a minimal investment for an accessory structure such as a garage or
storage building. The recreational vehicle and all accessory structures will then be treated as new
structures subject to the elevation and floodproofing requirements of Subd. 6. No development or
improvement on the parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle is allowed that would hinder the
removal of the vehicle should flooding occur.
Subd. 11. Administration.
A. City Engineer. The City Engineer or other official designated by the City Manager shall administer and
enforce this Section.
B. Permit Requirements.
1. Permit Required. A permit shall be obtained from the City Engineer prior to conducting the following
activities in the Floodway District, Flood Fringe District, or General Floodplain District:
(a) The erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation, or alteration of any building, structure, or
portion thereof. Normal maintenance and repair also requires a permit if such work,
separately or in conjunction with other planned work, constitutes a substantial improvement
as defined in this section.
(b) The change of use of a building, structure, or land.
(c) The construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system, although a permit is not required
for a farm fence as defined in this Section.

(e) The repair of a structure that has been damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or any other source.
(f) The placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of materials or equipment within
the floodplain.
(g) Relocation or alteration of a watercourse (including new or replacement culverts and
bridges), unless a public waters work permit has been applied for.
(h) Any other type of “development” as defined in this Section.
11-117
2. Application for Permit. Permit applications shall be submitted to the City Engineer on forms provided
by the City Engineer. The permit application shall include the following as applicable:
(a) A site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, existing or proposed buildings, structures, and
significant natural features having an influence on the permit.
(b) Location of fill or storage of materials in relation to the stream channel.
(c) Copies of any required municipal, county, state or federal permits or approvals.
(d) Other relevant information requested by the City Engineer as necessary to properly evaluate
the permit application.
3. Certificate of Zoning Compliance for a New, Altered, or Nonconforming Use. No new or altered
building, land, or structure shall be occupied or used in any manner until a certificate of zoning
compliance has been issued by the City Engineer stating that the use of the building or land conforms
to the requirements of this Section.
4. Certification. Upon completion of activities covered by a permit issued under this Section, the permit
holder shall submit to the City Engineer certification by a registered professional engineer, registered
architect, or registered land surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished
in compliance with the provisions of this Section. Floodproofing measures shall be certified by a
registered professional engineer or registered architect.
5. Record of First Floor Elevation. The City Engineer shall maintain a record of the elevation of the
lowest floor (including basement) of all new structures and alterations or additions to existing
structures in the floodplain. The City Engineer shall also maintain a record of the elevation to which
structures and alterations or additions to structures are floodproofed.
6. Notifications for Watercourse Alterations. Before authorizing any alteration or relocation of a river or
stream, the City Engineer shall notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit
from the DNR to work in public waters pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245, this will
suffice as adequate notice. The City Engineer shall submit a copy of the notification to the Chicago
Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
7. Notification to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase or Decrease Base Flood Elevations. As soon
as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date such supporting information becomes
available, the City Engineer shall notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of physical changes
that increase or decrease base flood elevation in the City by submitting a copy of the relevant technical
or scientific data.
C. Variances.
1. Variance Applications. An application for a variance to the provisions of this Section will be
processed and reviewed in accordance with Minnesota Statutes Section 462.357 and City Code Section
11.76.
2. Adherence to State Floodplain Management Standards. A variance must not allow a use that is not
allowed in the underlying zoning district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory
flood protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state
law.
3. Additional Variance Criteria. The following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency
11-118
Management Agency must be satisfied:
(a) The City shall not issue variances within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase
in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(b) The City shall only issue variances upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a
determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
(c) The City shall only issue variances upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
4. Flood Insurance Notice. The City Engineer shall notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) The
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and 2)
Such construction below the base or regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such
notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
5. General Considerations. The City shall consider the following factors in granting variances and
imposing conditions on variances and conditional use permits in floodplains:
(a) The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused
by encroachments;
(b) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of
others;
(c) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the ability of these systems to
minimize the potential for disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions;
(d) The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the individual owner;
(e) The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use to the community;
(f) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
(g) The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to
flooding;
(h) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development
anticipated in the foreseeable future;
(i) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and flood plain
management program for the area;
(j) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood
waters expected at the site.

B. Jurisdiction. The provisions of this Section shall apply to the shorelands of the public waters as classified in
Subd.7 of this Section. Pursuant to Minnesota Regulations, Parts 6120.2500-6120.3900. no lake, pond, or
flowage less than 10 acres in size in municipalities need be regulated in a local government's shoreland
regulations. A body of water created by a private user where there was no previous shoreland may, at the
discretion of the governing body, be exempt from this section.
Subd. 2. Declaration of Policy and Procedures. Declaration of Policy. It is hereby found and declared that
shorelands of public waters are, or may be, subject to uncontrolled use resulting in: Health and safety hazards, pollution
of public waters, loss of property, destruction of fish and wildlife, impairment of natural beauty, and impairment of local
tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare. It is, therefore, the purpose of this Section to
provide standards and criteria for the subdivision, use and development of the shorelands of public waters in order to
preserve and enhance the quality of public waters, conserve the economic and natural environmental values of
shorelands, and provide for wise utilization of water and related land resources, and thereby promote and protect the
public health, safety, and welfare.
Subd. 3. Interpretation and Severability. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Section, such provisions
shall be held to be minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, prosperity and general welfare.
It is not the intention of this Section to interfere with any other provision of the City Code, however, where this Section
imposes a greater restriction upon the use or improvement of any premises than those imposed or required by other City
Code provisions, rules, regulations or permits of the City, State, or appropriate Watershed District, the provisions of this
Section shall govern.

Section establishes four wetland classifications as defined in subdivision 3: exceptional quality, high quality,
moderate quality, and low quality.
B. The presence or absence of a wetland on the City Wetland Map does not represent a definitive determination as
to whether a wetland covered by this Section is or is not present. Wetlands that are identified during sitespecific
delineation activities but do not appear on the City Wetland Map are still subject to the provisions of
this Section.
C. Structures intended to provide access to or across a wetland or a wetland buffer strip shall be prohibited unless a
permit is obtained from the City and is in conformance with applicable state statutes, rules, and regulations.
11-141
D. Activities including, but not limited to, wetland alteration, digging, building, paving, mowing, cutting, dumping,
yard waste disposal, fertilizer application, placing of debris, planting of non-native vegetation, and removal of
vegetation are prohibited in wetland areas.
E. Native vegetation plantings, removal of weeds or removal of invasive non-native vegetation requires approval
of a Vegetation Management Plan on a form provided by the City.
Subd. 5. General Development Application Requirements.
The following provisions apply to all properties for which a development application has been submitted to the City:
A. Requirements for wetland identification, delineation, replacement, reporting, no-loss determinations, and
financial assurance within areas in which the City is the acting LGU shall be in accordance with the
requirements outlined in subdivision 14 of this Section.
B. Wetlands, wetland buffer strips and wetland replacement areas impacted by land alteration shall be seeded
and/or planted in accordance with subdivision 11 of this Section within sixty (60) days of completion of the land
alteration. All sodding, seeding or planting must be completed prior to removal of any erosion control
measures. If land alteration is completed after the end of the growing season, erosion control measures shall be
left in place and all disturbed areas shall be mulched to protect these areas over the winter or during the nongrowing
season.
C. Where wetland replacement or a wetland buffer strip is required, the applicant shall complete the following
steps before the City releases the final plat or, if there is no plat approval involved, before the City issues the
first building permit for the entire subject property:
1. Submit to the City Engineer and receive the City Engineer’s approval of a conservation easement for
protection of the wetland and approved wetland buffer strip. The conservation easement must describe
the boundaries of the wetland and wetland buffer strips; describe monuments and monument locations;
and prohibit any structures, paving, mowing, introduction of non-native vegetation, cutting, filling,
dumping, yard waste disposal, fertilizer application or removal of the wetland buffer strip monuments
within the wetland buffer strip or wetland.
2. Submit evidence to the City Engineer that the approved conservation easement document has been
recorded in the office of the Hennepin County Recorder or Registrar of Titles, as appropriate, along
with a duplicate original of the recorded document.
3. Submit to the City Engineer and receive City Engineer’s approval of a declaration of covenants and
restrictions for any wetland replacement in accordance with Minnesota Rules Chapter 8420.
4. Submit evidence to the City Engineer that the approved declaration of covenants and restrictions for
any wetland replacement has been recorded in the office of the Hennepin County Recorder or
Registrar of Titles, as appropriate.
D. Stormwater shall not be discharged directly into any natural water bodies such as wetlands, lakes or creeks
without the use of pre-treatment methods, such as pre-settlement, infiltration, or filtration. The pre-treatment
methods must be approved in writing by the Environmental Coordinator prior to the discharge of any
stormwater.
E. The applicant shall follow the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s Urban Best Management Practices to
avoid erosion and sedimentation during site grading and/or construction. In addition, the applicant shall follow
the regulations set forth in City Code Section 11.55 and the watershed district requirements for the area in which
the project is located.
11-142
Subd. 6. Identification, Evaluation and Delineation Requirements.
A. Wetland Determination. The applicant shall provide all information required by the City to determine whether a
wetland exists on a subject property or within the structure setback from a wetland on an adjacent property. The
applicant may submit a request to the Environmental Coordinator with the development application to waive the
wetland determination requirement. The Environmental Coordinator shall make a decision on the request in his
or her sole discretion. Unless the wetland determination requirement has been waived by the Environmental
Coordinator, the following report(s) shall be provided to the City based on site conditions:
1. No Wetland Determination. If no wetlands are present, the applicant must document site conditions in
a Wetland Determination Report that includes evaluation of topography, vegetation, hydrology and
soil conditions. If the no wetland determination is approved by the City, no additional documentation
is required.
2. Wetland Delineation. If a wetland(s) is present, the applicant must delineate and document the
boundary of the wetland(s) and the wetland type(s) in a Wetland Delineation Report in accordance
with City requirements and Minnesota Rules 8420 and must include information necessary for the City
to determine the wetland boundary and wetland type, including wetland delineation field data sheets,
survey of the wetland evaluation area, soil analysis data, color copies of current and historical aerial
photography, vegetation data, hydrology information both within and outside of the proposed wetland
boundary, and such other information required by the Environmental Coordinator.
B. No-Loss Determination. If the applicant is requesting a no-loss determination, the proof necessary to support
this request must be provided with the development application.
C. Wetland Buffer Strip Evaluation. If a wetland(s) is present, the wetland buffer strip conditions must be
documented in a Wetland Buffer Strip Evaluation Report and provided with the Wetland Delineation Report in
accordance with subdivision 11 of this Section.
D. Wetland Quality. If a wetland(s) is present, a determination of the function and value of the wetland(s) using
the most recent version of MnRAM or other approved assessment methodology under Minnesota Rules Chapter
8420 shall be completed by the applicant and submitted to the Environmental Coordinator with the Wetland
Delineation Report.
E. Non-Growing Season Application Submittals. Wetland Delineation Reports, Wetland Determination Reports
and MnRAM assessments conducted or completed outside of the growing season will not be accepted for final
review and approval by the City until the following growing season. Determination of non-growing season
conditions will be in accordance with the “Guidance for Submittal of Delineation Reports to the St. Paul District
Corps of Engineers (COE) and Wetland Conservation Act Local Units of Government in the State of
Minnesota” dated March 4, 2015, unless the vegetation cataloging or hydrology conditions are, in the judgment
of the Environmental Coordinator, unreliable.
Approvals may be granted for wetland delineation, Wetland Delineation Reports, Wetland Determination
Reports and MnRAM assessments conducted during the growing season but submitted during the non-growing
season, if the Environmental Coordinator determines there is sufficient information in the report and visible in
the field at the time of the field verification to assess the three wetland parameters (hydrophytic vegetation,
hydric soils and hydrology) in relation to placement of the wetland delineation line. If proper assessment of the
delineation is not possible during the non-growing season, the City will consider the development application
incomplete until such time that appropriate field verification is possible. If a MnRAM assessment is not
conducted during the growing season or if it is determined to be incomplete, the wetland quality will be assumed
as high quality.
11-143
Preliminary approval for a wetland determination, wetland delineation, MnRAM, or no-loss determination may
be requested during the non-growing season. A request for preliminary approval must be submitted with the
development application. Preliminary approvals must be verified by the City during the growing season before
any work on the project may commence. The applicant bears all risk that the City may require revisions to the
development application due to the fact that the preliminary approval review occurred during the non-growing
season.
F. Off-Site Wetland Delineation Method. An applicant shall not be required to field delineate wetlands on
adjacent property. However, an applicant shall complete a review of off-site conditions in accordance with the
publication “Guidance for Off-Site Hydrology/Wetland Determinations” from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACOE) and BWSR dated July 1, 2016. The off-site delineation must also include review of
available information, including but not limited to the City Wetland Map, County Soil Survey Map, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory Maps, and visual information such as the presence of wetland
vegetation and hydrologic evidence on an adjacent property which can be viewed from the subject property, to
estimate the wetland boundary and wetland type.
G. Water Body Identification. Prior to submission of the Wetland Determination Report or Wetland Delineation
Report, the applicant shall contact the Environmental Coordinator to obtain a wetland or water body
identification number and any information regarding the documented wetland, including any existing MnRAM
information, for inclusion with documentation provided to the City.
The applicant shall also contact the Environmental Coordinator to obtain a water body identification number for
any existing or proposed stormwater pond, stormwater infiltration areas, or wetland replacement areas within
the project area.
H. Wetland Determination Disputes. If the applicant disputes whether a wetland exists or its classification, the
applicant has the burden to supply detailed information to the Environmental Coordinator supporting the
applicant’s position. This information shall include, but is not limited to, historical aerial photography and
topographic, hydrologic, floristic, and/or soil data deemed necessary by the City or LGU under the WCA to
determine the jurisdictional status of the wetland, its exact boundary, and its classification.
I. Wetland Delineation, Wetland Determination, No-Loss Determination, and Wetland Buffer Strip Evaluation
Reports and Wetland Replacement Plans shall be prepared by a qualified wetland delineator. A qualified
wetland delineator shall either be certified in accordance with the certification requirements that are established
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or BWSR or, in the absence of such certification, as determined to be
qualified by the Environmental Coordinator
J. Wetland Delineation, Wetland Determination, No-Loss Determination and Wetland Buffer Strip Evaluation
Reports shall be valid for three (3) years from the date of the field delineation for these reports unless the
Environmental Coordinator determines that the report is no longer valid on a sooner date due to changes in site
conditions such as in hydrology, soils or vegetation.
Subd. 7. Wetland Alteration and Replacement Requirements.
For development applications involving wetland alteration, the applicant shall comply with the wetland replacement
procedures and criteria outlined Minnesota Rules Chapter 8420 and provide the following items to the Environmental
Coordinator:
A. Sequencing Analysis. Written documentation that the sequencing steps set forth in Minnesota Rule 8420.0520
have been met shall be provided with the development application. In following these steps, the applicant must
first demonstrate that alternatives to avoid and minimize wetland impacts have been evaluated. A minimum of
three alternative plans must be evaluated, one of which must be a “no-impact” alternative.
11-144
B. Wetland Replacement Analysis. Unavoidable impacts to wetlands must be restored or replaced on-site unless
the alternatives are not reasonably or practically available from an engineering standpoint or if the only feasible
and prudent sites available have greater ecosystem function and public value than the proposed wetland and the
proposed wetland would be located in an area that is to be preserved by a conservation easement or other such
instrument. Wetland restoration or expansion of existing or historic wetlands is preferred rather than creation of
new wetlands or other methods of wetland replacement.
If impacts cannot be restored or replaced on-site, the applicant must evaluate alternate sites in accordance with
the replacement siting and ratio requirements under Minnesota Rules 8420.0522 unless minimum replacement
requirements or ratio requirements established by the applicable watershed district or USACOE are greater than
the WCA requirements.
C. Sequencing Flexibility. The applicant may request sequencing flexibility after all alternatives have been
considered in accordance with Minnesota Rules 8420.0520 and subdivision 7 of this Section. The City, in its
discretion, may allow sequencing flexibility after consideration of the factors listed in Minnesota Rules
8420.0520.
D. Conceptual Wetland Replacement Plans. The applicant shall submit a conceptual Wetland Replacement Plan to
the Environmental Coordinator with the development application for any proposed impacts that require
replacement under WCA or USACOE regulatory programs. The Applicant shall contact the Environmental
Coordinator to obtain a water body identification number for use in the Wetland Replacement Plan for any
replacement wetlands constructed within the City.
E. Final Wetland Replacement Plans. The applicant shall submit a final Wetland Replacement Plan to the
Environmental Coordinator for review and approval by the Environmental Coordinator prior to submission of
the development plans to the City Council for review and approval or, if development plans are not submitted to
the City Council, prior to issuance of a building permit for the property, unless otherwise approved in writing by
the Environmental Coordinator.
Subd. 8. Reporting Requirements.
For development applications with wetlands or wetland buffers present or projects involving Wetland Alterations, the
following are required:
A. An Annual Wetland and Wetland Buffer Strip Evaluation Report (“Annual Buffer Report”) is required if a
wetland or any wetland buffer required by this Section is located on the subject property. The Annual Buffer
Report shall include items such as an evaluation of the conditions of the wetland(s) and wetland buffer strip(s),
the results of any monitoring conducted onsite, the integrity of the monuments installed and a plan for resolving
any insufficiencies including any information the Environmental Coordinator specifically requests. If an Annual
Buffer Report is required, the landowner or the developer shall submit an executed contract with a qualified
wetland consultant, as approved by the Environmental Coordinator, who will prepare the Annual Buffer Report
prior to release of the final plat for any portion of the subject property, or if there is no plat, prior to issuance of
a building permit for the property. The Annual Buffer Report shall provide both an action plan and proposed
cost for correction of all problems identified.
The first Annual Buffer Report shall be submitted no later than November 1 of the calendar year in which
construction, preparation, grading, seeding, planting and/or monumentation of the wetland(s) and/or wetland
buffer strip(s) is completed. Thereafter, the report shall be submitted by November 1 of each year until two full
growing seasons following completion of the development have passed, at which point a Final Annual Buffer
Report shall be submitted. The Final Annual Buffer Report shall evaluate the wetland(s) and/or wetland buffer
strip(s) to determine if the wetland(s) and/or wetland buffer strip(s) remain in compliance with all City
requirements.
11-145
If any unacceptable conditions or vegetation are identified within the Annual Buffer Reports or the Final Annual
Buffer Report, the developer shall correct the area(s) identified within ninety (90) days of submission of the
Report, or by June 15 of the following year if submitted during the non-growing season. Documentation that all
work has been completed shall be provided to the Environmental Coordinator.
B. Wetland Replacement Monitoring Reports are due by December 1 of each year until the wetland replacement is
determined to be complete by the LGU with advice from the Technical Evaluation Panel. The Wetland
Replacement Monitoring Report shall document that the standards outlined in Minnesota Rules Chapter
8420.0522 and subdivision 14 of this Section have been met.
C. All reports submitted for review shall be provided in electronic (PDF) format in color. All maps in PDF version
shall be developed for an 11" x17" printable format with sufficient detail that all features are legible.
Subd. 9. Wetland Buffer Strip and Setback Requirements.
A. For a lot of record or a development application approved by the City Council after February 1, 2000, the
applicant shall maintain a wetland buffer strip around the perimeter of all wetlands, including those constructed
as part of a Wetland Replacement Plan. The structure setback and wetland buffer strip provisions of this
Section shall not apply to a lot of record as of February 1, 2000, although the City strongly encourages the use
of a wetland buffer strip and setback on all lots in the City. In addition, any property located in the Lower
Minnesota River, Nine Mile Creek or Riley Purgatory Bluff Creek Watershed Districts shall comply with any
buffer and setback requirements imposed by the districts.
B. Wetland buffer strips and structure setbacks shall apply regardless of whether or not the wetland is on the same
parcel for which the development application has been submitted. For parcels on which the wetland is on an
adjacent parcel, the wetland buffer strip and structure setback requirements for the subject parcel shall be
reduced by the distance between the property line of the parcel and the wetland on the adjacent parcel. This
provision in no way reduces or eliminates any other setbacks required by the City Code or any other law or
regulation.
C. The applicant shall establish and maintain wetland and wetland buffer strip vegetation in accordance with the
requirements of subdivision 11 of this Section. Wetland buffer strips shall be identified within each lot by
permanent monumentation approved by the Environmental Coordinator in accordance with subdivision 10 of
this Section.
D. Non-native or invasive vegetation, such as European buckthorn, purple loosestrife and reed canary grass, or
dead or diseased trees that pose a hazard may be removed from a wetland buffer strip provided that a
Vegetation Management Plan is submitted to the Environmental Coordinator on a form provided by the City for
review and written approval. The Vegetation Management Plan shall comply with the wetland and wetland
buffer strip standards found in subdivision 11 of this Section or as required by the Environmental Coordinator.
E. All structures, including retaining walls, roadways and trails, shall meet the structure setback and wetland buffer
strip standards established in Table 1 below. The use of a meandering wetland buffer strip to maintain a natural
appearance shall be incorporated where feasible.
F. Filling a wetland to create a wetland buffer strip is prohibited.
G. Trails that are intended to serve an interpretive function, as determined by the Environmental Coordinator, are
exempted from the wetland buffer and structure setback requirement.
H. An existing structure, driveway or parking area shall be considered a non-conforming use if a later WCA
delineation shows that the wetland is closer to the structure than the required wetland buffer or structure
setback.
11-146
Table 1 - Wetland Buffer Strips and Structure Setbacks
Exceptional High Moderate Low
Wetland Buffer Strip Minimum Width 40' 30' 20' 10'
Wetland Buffer Strip Minimum Average Width 60' 60' 40' 20'
Structure Setback (from Wetland Buffer Strip) 25' 25' 15' 15'
Total Minimum Average 85' 85' 55' 35'
Subd. 10. Monumentation.
A monument is required at each lot line where it crosses a wetland buffer strip and shall have a maximum spacing of 200
feet along the edge of the wetland buffer strip. Additional monuments shall be placed as necessary to accurately define
the edge of the wetland buffer strip. If no wetland buffer strip is required, monuments shall be placed at the wetland
boundary.
The monument shall consist of a post and a wetland buffer strip sign. The post shall be a 1.12 to 2.0 pounds per foot
(1.12 pounds per foot is preferred) green steel channel post or other material pre-approved in writing by the
Environmental Coordinator. The post shall be a minimum of 2.25 inches wide and 6 feet 6 inches long (2.25” x 6.5’).
The sign shall have a minimum size of 3 inches by 8 inches (3” x 8”). The sign shall be mounted flush with the top of the
post and shall include the statements “Conservation Easement: No Mowing Allowed” and “Wetland and buffers filter
pollutants, reduce flooding and provide habitat” or other statement approved in writing by the Environmental
Coordinator. The post shall be mounted to a height of four feet above grade and set at least 2.5 feet in the ground.
Monuments may be waived in unusual circumstances where the Environmental Coordinator determines that such signs
would not serve a practical purpose.
Subd. 11. Vegetation Performance Standards.
A. Where acceptable native, non-invasive vegetation exists in wetland, wetland replacement and wetland buffer
strip areas, the retention of such vegetation in an undisturbed state is required unless an applicant receives
written approval from the Environmental Coordinator or any other agency which may regulate the removal or
replacement of such vegetation. A wetland and/or wetland buffer strip has acceptable natural vegetation if it:
1. Has a continuous, dense layer of perennial grasses that have been uncultivated or unbroken for at least
5 consecutive years, or
2. Has an overstory of trees and/or shrubs with at least 80 percent canopy closure that have been
uncultivated or unbroken for at least 5 consecutive years, or
3. Contains a mixture of the plant communities described in (1) and (2) above that have been uncultivated
or unbroken for at least 5 consecutive years.
B. Notwithstanding the performance standards set forth above, the Environmental Coordinator may determine
existing wetland and/or wetland buffer strip vegetation to be unacceptable if the wetland and/or wetland buffer:
1. Is composed of weeds (including, but not limited to common buckthorn, purple loosestrife, leafy
spurge and/or noxious weeds as defined by Minnesota Statutes Sections 18.76–18.88), or
2. Has topography that tends to channelize the flow of surface runoff, or
3. For some other reason is unlikely to retain nutrients and sediment.
C. Areas with unacceptable vegetation shall be re-graded, re-seeded and/or re-planted as needed and maintained in
11-147
accordance with this subdivision 11. The wetland, wetland replacement and wetland buffer strip planting
requirements must be included in the Wetland Delineation Report, Wetland Buffer Strip Evaluation Report or
Wetland Replacement Plan Monitoring Report. Wetland, wetland alteration, wetland replacement and wetland
buffer strip landscaping shall be according to the following standards:
1. Wetland buffer strips shall be planted with a diverse native, non-invasive seed mix appropriate for the
specific site conditions that contains 100 percent perennial native vegetation. A one-time planting of
an annual nurse or cover crop such as oats or rye may be included.
2. Seed mix used shall be a BWSR-approved seed mix appropriate for the area requiring reseeding or
other alternative pre-approved in writing by the Environmental Coordinator. The seeding rate shall be
at the rate recommended by the BWSR seed mix criteria or other pre-approved alternative.
3. Native shrubs may be substituted for the native seed mix where appropriate. All substitutions must be
pre-approved in writing by the Environmental Coordinator. Such shrubs may be bare root seedlings
and shall be planted at a minimum rate of 60 plants per acre. Shrubs shall be distributed so as to
provide a natural appearance and shall not be planted in rows.
4. Any groundcover or shrub plantings installed within the wetland or wetland buffer strip are
independent of landscaping required elsewhere by the City Code.
5. Native prairie grasses and forbs shall be seeded or planted by a qualified contractor in accordance with
“Native Vegetation Establishment and Enhancement Guidelines” (published June 2016 by BWSR) or
other alternate method pre-approved by the Environmental Coordinator. Determination of the
contractor’s qualifications shall be made by the Environmental Coordinator. It is the responsibility of
the applicant to have the contractor and method used approved by the Environmental Coordinator
prior to planting or seeding.
6. No fertilizer shall be used in establishing new wetland buffer strips, except when deemed necessary to
establish acceptable wetland and/or wetland buffer strip vegetation and then limited to amounts
indicated by an accredited soil testing laboratory. Determination of proper accreditation shall be made
by the Environmental Coordinator.
7. All seeded areas shall be mulched immediately with clean straw at a rate of 1.5 tons per acre. Mulch
shall be anchored with a disk or tackifier.
8. Wetland, wetland replacement and wetland buffer strip areas (both natural and created), shall be
protected by erosion control during construction in accordance with City Code Section 11.55.
9. The erosion control shall remain in place until the cover crop is established.
D. The applicant shall establish and maintain the wetland and wetland buffer strip vegetation in accordance with
the requirements of this Section, both during development and for two full growing seasons after completion of
the development. During this time, the applicant shall replant or reseed any wetland and/or wetland buffer strip
vegetation that does not survive.
E. After the second full growing season following completion of the development, if the condition of the wetland
and/or wetland buffer strip diminishes, the applicant shall not be required to reestablish the wetland and/or
wetland buffer strip to meet the standards contained in this subdivision 11. However, wetlands created for
wetland replacement must be monitored and maintained by the applicant until the wetland is reviewed and
approved by the LGU in accordance with the requirements established by subdivision 14 of this Section and
Minnesota Rules Chapter 8420.
11-148
After such times, the owner of the property on which the wetland and/or wetland buffer strip is located shall be
responsible for the maintenance of the wetland, wetland alteration, wetland replacement and/or wetland buffer
strip areas and shall:
1. Maintain and repair damage to wetland and/or wetland buffer strip areas from activities such as
mowing, cutting, grading or other prohibited activities unless approved by the City in writing as a
Vegetation Management Plan.
2. Maintain only vegetation permitted in the Vegetation Management Plan or as found in this subdivision
11 in the wetland and wetland buffer strip, including the removal of all weeds, unless allowed
otherwise in writing by the Environmental Coordinator.
3. Ensure that all soil surfaces in wetland and wetland buffer strip areas are planted with permitted
vegetation and that there are no open soil surfaces that may result in erosion.
4. Maintain the wetland and wetland buffer strip as a “no mow” area.
Subd. 12. Encroachment in Required Setback and Wetland Buffer Strip Areas.
A. Wetlands and wetland buffer strips shall be kept free of all structures.
B. A maximum of ten percent (10%) of the structure setback area may be occupied by any structures.
C. Wetlands and wetland buffer strips shall not be mowed, chemically treated or otherwise altered except as
approved by the Environmental Coordinator after submission of a Vegetation Management Plan.
D. Variances and Waivers
1. Only variances meeting the standards and criteria set forth in Section 11.76 of this Code and waivers
approved pursuant to Section 11.40 of this Code for a Planned Unit Development (PUD) process shall be
granted. All variance requests must be made to the Board of Adjustments and Appeals. All waiver
requests must be made to the Planning Commission and the City Council.
2. Variances or waivers shall not be granted which would violate state law or rule or circumvent the intent
and purposes of this Section or Minnesota Rules 8420.
Subd. 13. Financial Assurance Required.
If a development application includes wetland alteration, wetland or wetland buffer strip landscaping, or construction of a
wetland buffer strip, the applicant shall file with the Environmental Coordinator prior to release of the final plat, or, if
there is no plat approval involved, prior to the first building permit issued for the entire subject property, a performance
bond, cash escrow, or letter of credit with a corporation approved by the Environmental Coordinator, as surety thereon,
or other guarantee acceptable to the Environmental Coordinator and in an amount determined by the Environmental
Coordinator as set forth below (“Financial Assurance”). Financial Assurance requirements for Development
Applications for areas where the City is the LGU are set forth in subdivision 14 of this Section.
A. Amount - The amount of the Financial Assurance shall be for no less than one and one-half (1 ½) times the
amount estimated by the Environmental Coordinator as the cost of completing a wetland plan for monument
installation and replacement and restoration and/or correction of the wetland and/or wetland buffer strip.
B. Schedule - The Financial Assurance for the wetland plan must cover two complete growing seasons following
completion of the development and full and final restoration of all corrective actions identified in the Final
Annual Report and shall be conditioned upon complete and satisfactory implementation of the approved
11-149
Wetland Plan or Vegetation Management Plan and final inspection and approval of the wetland and wetland
buffer strip by the City.
C. Submissions – With the Financial Assurance, the applicant shall provide to the Environmental Coordinator a
copy of a signed contract with an environmental consultant to monitor construction activities and annual
compliance and certify final completion of the wetland, wetland buffer strip and wetland replacement
requirements.
D. Form of Application – The Financial Assurance shall be posted within 10 days of approval of the development
application and prior to the commencement of the work or the preparations thereof.
Subd. 14 - Special Requirements for Wetland Conservation Act (WCA) Services.
The following provisions apply to areas for which the City is the LGU for WCA. All survey information shall be
provided in the Minnesota County Coordinate System, Hennepin County North American Datum 1983 (NAD83) (1996)
projection in U.S. Survey feet. All vertical elevations shall be in North American Datum 1988 (NAVD88).
A. Wetland Evaluation / Wetland Determination Review. Applications for WCA review must include a report
documenting site conditions; wetland delineation and/or determination review procedures; a statement as to
whether wetlands are present on site; a statement as to whether an exemption is requested; and whether work is
proposed which will result in a loss or alteration of wetland. Reports must be prepared in accordance with the
following paragraph B.
B. Wetland Delineation, Wetland Determination, Wetland Exemption and No-Loss Determination Review
Application. The applicant shall complete and file with the Environmental Coordinator an “Application for
Review of Wetland Determinations” in the form required by the Environmental Coordinator (“Review
Application”). The Review Application, including the following information, must be filed with the

SECTION 11.55 - LAND ALTERATION, TREE PRESERVATION AND STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
REGULATIONS.
Ordinance No. 28-2016
Effective Date: 11-24-2016
Ordinance No. 7-2015
Effective Date: 6-25-2015
Prev. Ordinance No. 2-2006
Effective Date: 2-16-2006
Subd. 1. Declaration of Policy and Purpose.
A. Land Alterations are inherently accompanied by noise and dust, may create hazardous conditions and may result
in lasting disfigurement of the places where they are carried on and thus may affect existing land uses in nearby
areas, discourage further permanent development of the surrounding properties, impair adequate planning or
municipal development, and diminish public health, safety, and general welfare. It is, therefore, desirable to
regulate Land Alterations in the City.
B. Tree removal, damage, and destruction tends to endanger the natural character of the land from which the trees
have been removed and surrounding lands, and to diminish and impair the public health, safety and general
welfare. The Council desires to protect the integrity of the natural environment and finds that trees do so by
providing for better air quality, scenic beauty, protection against wind and water erosion, and natural insulation
for energy preservation. Further, the Council finds that trees protect privacy and provide enhancement of
property values. It is, therefore, the further purpose of this Section to provide regulations relating to the cutting,
removal or killing of trees, with the consequent damage and destruction of the wooded and forested areas of the
City, to promote the orderly development of such areas and thereby minimize public and private losses; to
insure maintenance of the natural vegetation and topography; to encourage protection and preservation of the
natural environment and beauty of the City; to encourage a resourceful and prudent approach to urban
development of wooded areas which provides for minimal tree loss and mitigation of tree removal resulting
from development; to provide an objective method to evaluate a development's impact on trees and wooded
areas and identify whether and how the impact may be reduced; to provide incentive for creative land use and
good site design which preserves trees while allowing development in wooded areas with mitigation of tree
removal and destruction; and to provide for enforcement and administration thereby promoting and protecting
the public health, safety and welfare.
C. The Council seeks to promote, preserve and enhance the natural resources within the City and protect them from
adverse effects of stormwater runoff by providing site design standards that minimize stormwater runoff to meet
the requirements of appropriate regulatory agencies.

accordance with the following criteria:
Ordinance No. 28-2016
Effective Date: 11-24-2016
1. Replacement.
Significant Tree replacement formula:
A = Total Diameter Inches of Significant Trees Lost as a Result of the Land Alteration
B = Total Diameter Inches of Significant Trees Situated on the Land
C = Tree Replacement Constant (0.5)
D = Replacement Trees (Number of Caliper Inches)
[(A/B) x C] x A = D
EXAMPLE
A = 337
B = 943
C = 0.5
D = 60
[(337/943) x 0.5] x 337 = 60
Heritage trees that are lost or damaged are to be replaced at a ratio of 2:1, replaced caliper inches to
lost or damaged Diameter-inch. Heritage Tree replacement must include a minimum of 20%
replacement trees equal to or greater than 4 caliper inches. In the case one or more Heritage trees are
saved, the amount of Diameter-inches of said saved Heritage tree(s) may be subtracted from the
replacement required by Subd. C. 1 of this Subdivision, provided however in no event shall the amount
subtracted exceed 50% of the Replacement Trees (Number of Caliper Inches) as determined by the
formula in Subd. C. 1. The not to exceed 50% limitation shall apply to applications deemed to be
complete on or after March 7, 2017.
Ordinance No. 5-2017
Effective Date: 3-30-2017

Subd. 7. Dynamic Displays.
A. Findings. Studies show that there is a correlation between Dynamic Displays on signs and the distraction of
highway drivers. Distraction can lead to traffic accidents. Drivers can be distracted not only by a changing
message, but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message. Drivers may watch a sign waiting for the
next change to occur. Additionally, drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message,
such as fade-ins and fade-outs. Time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because
the messages are short, easily absorbed, and become inaccurate without frequent changes.
Despite these public safety concerns, there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages.
Except as prohibited by state or federal law, sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies
with certain restrictions. The restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize
proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact residential character.
The City finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their
proliferation and their potential threats to public safety.
B. Permitted Sign Type and Locations. Dynamic Displays are permitted solely as Free-standing Signs and only in
the Commercial Regional (C-Reg), Commercial Regional Service (C-Reg-Ser), Community Commercial (CCom),
Neighborhood Commercial (N- Com) Office (OFC), Town Center (TC-C), Public (Pu), Industrial (I, I-2,
I-5 & I-Gen), TOD-MU (if the project includes commercial uses) and TOD-E (if the project includes industrial
uses) zoning districts.
Source: Ordinance No.25-2016
Effective Date: 10-27-2016
C. Duration of Image. A Dynamic Display’s image, or any portion thereof, may not change more often than once
every 20 minutes, except one for which changes are necessary to correct hour-and-minute, date, or temperature
information. A display of time, date, or temperature must remain for at least 20 minutes before changing to a
different display, but the time, date, or temperature information itself may change no more often than once every
three seconds.
D. Transition. If a Dynamic Display’s image or any portion thereof changes, the change sequence must
instantaneous without any special effects.
E. Prohibition on Video Display. No portion of a Dynamic Display may change any part of its sign face by a
method of display characterized by motion or pictorial imagery, or depict action or a special effect to imitate
movement, or display pictorials or graphics in a progression of frames that gives the illusion of motion of any
kind.
11-199
F. Prohibition on Fluctuating or Flashing Illumination. No portion of a Dynamic Display image may fluctuate in
light intensity or use intermittent, strobe or moving light, or light that changes in intensity in sudden transitory
bursts, streams, zooms, twinkles, sparkles or in any other manner that creates the illusion of movement.
G. Audio. Dynamic Displays shall not be equipped with audio speakers.
H. Malfunctions. Dynamic Displays must be designed and equipped to freeze the sign face in one position if a
malfunction occurs. Dynamic Displays must also be equipped with a means to immediately discontinue the
display if it malfunctions, and the sign owner or operator must immediately turn off the display when notified by
the City that it is not complying with the standards of this ordinance.
I. Brightness. All Dynamic Displays shall meet the following brightness standards:
1. No Dynamic Display may exceed a maximum illumination of 5,000 nits (candelas per square meter)
during daylight hours and a maximum illumination of 500 nits (candelas per square meter) between
dusk to dawn as measured from the sign’s face at maximum brightness.
2. All Dynamic Displays having illumination by means other than natural light must be equipped with a
dimmer control or other mechanism that automatically controls the sign’s brightness to comply with
the requirements of this Section.
3. No Dynamic Display may be of such intensity or brilliance that it interferes with the effectiveness of
an official traffic sign, device or signal.
4. The owner or controller of the Dynamic Display must adjust the sign to meet these brightness
standards in accordance with the City's instructions. The adjustment must be made immediately upon
notice of non-compliance from the City.
5. A written certification from the sign manufacturer that light intensity has been preset to conform to the
brightness levels established by code and that the preset level is protected from end user manipulation
by password protected software or other method. This would offer the advantage of ensuring that
electronic signs at a minimum cannot exceed the standards.
J. Dynamic displays are allowed only on free standing signs in the permitted districts. Dynamic displays may
occupy no more than 35% percent of the actual copy and graphic area. The remainder of the sign must not
have the capability to have dynamic displays even if not used. Only one, contiguous dynamic display area is
allowed on a sign face.

SECTION 11.76. VARIANCES.
Subd. 1. Purposes and Authorization. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, variances from the requirements
of this Chapter may be granted when the applicant for the variance establishes that there are practical difficulties in
complying with this Chapter. Variances shall only be permitted when they are in harmony with the general purposes and
intent of this Chapter and are consistent with the City’s comprehensive plan. “Practical difficulties” as used in
connection with the granting of a variance, means that the property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable
manner not permitted by this Chapter; the plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not
created by the landowner; and the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. Economic
considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties. Practical difficulties include, but are not limited to,
inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. Variances shall be granted for earth sheltered construction
as defined by statute when in harmony with this Chapter. The Board of Adjustments and Appeals or Council as the case
may be may not permit as a variance any use that is not allowed by this Chapter in the zoning district in which the subject
property is located. The Board of Adjustments and Appeals or Council as the case may be may permit as a variance the
temporary use of a one family dwelling as a two family dwelling. The Board of Adjustments and Appeal or Council as
the case may be may impose conditions in the granting of variances. A condition must be directly related to and must
bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance.

Subd. 1. Purposes and Requirements. To ensure that each new or expanded use of a structure or site and each new
structure or alteration of an existing structure complies with all applicable provisions of this Section, and in order that the
City may have a record of each new or expanded use of a structure or site, a zoning certificate is required before any
11-201
building permit may be issued or any structure or site used; and a certificate of occupancy required by the Building Code
shall be issued only for a structure that conforms with the zoning certificate.
Subd. 2. Building Permit. A building permit shall be issued only upon execution of an approved zoning certificate.
Subd. 3. Occupancy Certificate.
A. A certificate authorizing occupancy shall not be issued until all requirements of this Section and conditions
attached to any variance have been fully met.
B. A temporary certificate may be issued when certain conditions or requirements cannot be met due to weather or
other conditions beyond the control of the owner but only when occupancy will not be detrimental to the health,
safety or general welfare of the occupants or neighbors.
SECTION 11.78. AMENDMENTS.
Subd. 1. Purposes. This Chapter may be amended and the boundaries of any district may be changed in accord with
the procedure described in this Section.
Subd. 2. Initiation. An amendment may be initiated by the Council, the Planning Commission, or by petition of
affected property owners. An amendment not initiated by the Planning Commission shall be referred to the Planning
Commission for study and report and may not be acted upon by the Council until it has received the recommendation of
the Planning Commission or until 60 days have elapsed from the date of reference of the amendment without a report by
the Planning Commission.
Subd. 3. Application and Fee. Application for any changes must be made on forms provided by the City and shall
include all information and data requested. Application fee shall be established by the Council by resolution.
Subd. 4. Public Hearing. No amendment shall be adopted until a public hearing has been held thereon by the Council.
A notice of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing shall be published in the official newspaper of the City at least ten

at least ten days before the day of the hearing to each owner of affected property and property situated wholly or partly
within 350 feet of the property to which the amendment relates. For the purpose of giving mailed notice, the responsible
person may use any appropriate records to determine the names and addresses of owners. A copy of the notice and a list
of the owners and addresses to which the notice was sent shall be attested to by the responsible person and shall be made
a part of the records of the proceedings. The failure to give mailed notice to individual property owners, or defects in the
notice shall not invalidate the proceedings, provided a bona fide attempt to comply with this Subdivision has been made.
Subd. 5. Reapplication. No application for the same or substantially the same change shall be made within one (1)
year from the date of denial.

the residents of the City.
Subd. 3. An owner requesting subdivision of land for construction and maintenance thereon of fifty (50) or more
residential units may be required to dedicate a reasonable portion of such land to the City for public use as a mini-park in

portion of such land shall consist of that portion which the City will need for mini-park purposes as a result of the
approval of the subdivision and, unless otherwise determined by the City upon a showing by the subdivider, shall consist
of a minimum of one acre for each fifty (50) residential units and a proportionate part of an acre for any additional
residential units less than fifty (50) provided, however, no dedication of land for a mini-park shall be required if the total
number of residential units to be constructed on the land shall be less than fifty (50). When an owner dedicates land
to the City for a mini-park, the land encompassed in the mini-park shall be included in the total land utilized in the
calculation of densities pursuant to Chapter 11.
