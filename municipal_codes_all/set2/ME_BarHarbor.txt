of the notice, the Town Council shall conduct a public hearing
to consider whether the licensee committed a violation.
Neither the failure of any landowner actually to receive notice
nor the licensee's refusal to accept certified mail shall
necessitate another hearing or invalidate any action taken by
the Council at such hearing.
(a)
Following a hearing the Council, by a preponderance of the
evidence, shall make a determination of whether the licensee
committed a violation of this article.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 46-1. Title; when effective.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Bar Harbor Cable
Communications Regulatory Ordinance" and, pursuant to 30-A M.R.S.A.
§ 3008(2) it shall become effective immediately upon adoption.
§ 46-2. Findings and purpose.
The Town of Bar Harbor finds that the development of cable television
systems has the potential of greatly benefiting and having a positive
impact on the people of Bar Harbor. Cable technology is rapidly
changing, and cable is expected to play an essential role as part of the
Town's basic infrastructure. Cable television systems extensively make
use of scarce and valuable public rights-of-way, in a manner different
from the way in which the general public uses them, and in a manner
reserved primarily for those that provide services to the public, such as
utility companies. The Town finds that public convenience, safety, and
general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers
vested in the Town or such persons as the Town so designates to protect
the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the
public interest.
A.
In light of the foregoing, the following goals and the state policies set
forth at 30-A M.R.S.A. § 3008(1), among others, underlie the provisions
set forth in this chapter:
(1) Cable should be available to as many Town residents as possible.
A cable system should be capable of accommodating both the
present and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of
the community, to the extent economically feasible.
(2)
A cable system should be constructed and maintained during a
franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated
to the maximum extent that is economically feasible into existing
system facilities.
(3)
A cable system should be responsible to the needs and interests of
the local community.
(4)
B.
The Town intends that all provisions set forth in this chapter be
construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public
purposes and that any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter be
construed to include the foregoing findings and public purposes as
integral parts thereof.

ARTICLE II
Grant of Franchise
§ 46-4. Authority of Town.
The Town may grant one or more cable television franchises, and each such
franchise shall be awarded in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of this chapter. In no event shall this chapter be considered a contract
between the Town and a grantee.
§ 46-5. Franchise required.
No person may construct or operate a cable system without a franchise
granted by the Town unless otherwise authorized by law, and no person may
be granted a franchise without having entered into a franchise agreement
with the Town pursuant to this chapter.
§ 46-6. Franchise characteristics.
Authority granted by franchise. A franchise authorizes use of public
rights-of-way for installing cables, wires, lines, optical fiber,
underground conduit, and other devices necessary and appurtenant
to the operation of a cable system without a franchise area but does
not expressly or implicitly authorize a grantee to provide service to
or install a cable system on private property without owner consent
[except for use of compatible easements pursuant to Section 621 of the
Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 541(a)(2)] or to use publicly or privately owned
conduits without a separate agreement with the owners.
A.
B. Term of franchise. The term of a franchise may not exceed 15 years.
Nonexclusivity. A franchise is nonexclusive and will not explicitly or
implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable
systems within the Town; affect the Town's right to authorize use of
public rights-of-way by other persons to operate cable systems or for
other purposes as it determines appropriate; or affect the Town's right
to itself construct, operate, or maintain a cable system, with or without
a franchise.
C.
Franchise agreement constitutes contract. Once a franchise agreement
has been accepted and executed by the Town and a grantee, such
franchise agreement shall constitute a contract between the grantee
and the Town, and the terms, conditions, and provisions of such
franchise agreement, subject to the ordinance in effect as of the
effective date of such franchise agreement and all other duly enacted
and applicable laws, shall define the rights and obligations of the
grantee and the Town relating to the franchise. Nothing in this chapter
or a franchise agreement shall be deemed a waiver of or restriction on
the Town's police powers or a waiver of any of the terms of any Town
ordinance regarding the use or management of the public rights-of-way
or intended to protect the public's safety.
D.
§ 46-4 CABLE TELEVISION § 46-6
46:73
§ 46-7. Grantee subject to other laws and Town authority.
§ 46-8. Interpretation of franchise terms.
Use of public rights-of-way. All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall
be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of the public rights-ofway,
and the Town reserves the right to reasonably designate where a
grantee's facilities are to be placed within the public rights-of-way.
E.
Franchise personal to grantee. A franchise shall be a privilege that is
in the public trust and personal to the original grantee. No transfer
of a franchise shall occur without the prior consent of the Town and
unless application is made by the grantee and Town approval obtained,
pursuant to this chapter and the franchise agreement, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the grantee
may make assignments of collateral to a lender upon reasonable prior
notice to the Town. No such assignment of collateral shall be deemed
to permit any person to avoid any obligations under this chapter or a
franchise agreement.
F.
Exclusive contracts unenforceable. A franchise holder may not enter
into or enforce any exclusive contract with a subscriber as a condition
of providing or continuing service.
G.
Compliance with laws. A grantee shall at all times be subject to and
shall comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws. A grantee
shall at all times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power of
the Town, including all rights the Town may have under 47 U.S.C. § 552.
A.
No waiver of Town rights. No course of dealing between a grantee
and the Town, nor any delay on the part of the Town in exercising any
rights hereunder, shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the
Town or acquiescence in the actions of a grantee in contravention of
rights except to the extent expressly waived by the Town or expressly
provided for in a franchise agreement or other applicable laws, rules or
regulations.
B.
Town has maximum regulatory authority. The Town shall have the
maximum plenary authority to regulate cable systems, grantees, and
franchises as may now or hereafter be lawfully permissible; except
where rights are expressly waived by a franchise agreement, they are
reserved, whether expressly enumerated or not.
C.
Provision to Town's benefit controlling. In the event of a conflict
between this chapter as effective on the effective date of a franchise
agreement and that franchise agreement, the terms of this chapter as
effective on the effective date of that franchise agreement shall control,
except as otherwise provided in a franchise agreement.
A.
Liberal construction. To the extent permitted by law, the provisions of
this chapter and a franchise agreement will be liberally construed in

§ 46-6 BAR HARBOR CODE § 46-8

§ 46-9. Operation of cable system without franchise.
Any person who occupies public rights-of-way for the purpose of operating
or constructing a cable system and who does not hold a valid franchise from
the Town shall be subject to all provisions of this chapter, including but
not limited to its provisions regarding construction and technical standards
and franchise fees. In its discretion, the Town at any time may require such
person to enter into a franchise agreement within 30 days of receipt of a
written notice by the Town that a franchise agreement is required; require
such person to remove its property and restore the area to a condition
satisfactory to the Town within such time period; remove the property itself
and restore the area to a satisfactory condition and charge the person the
costs therefor; and/or take any other action it is entitled to take under
applicable law, including filing for and seeking damages under trespass. In
no event shall a franchise be created unless it is issued by action of the Town
and subject to a franchise agreement.
§ 46-10. Right of condemnation reserved.
Nothing in this chapter or any franchise agreement shall limit any right the
Town may have to acquire by eminent domain or otherwise any property of
the grantee.
§ 46-11. Acts at grantee's expense.
Any act that a grantee is or may be required to perform under this chapter, a
franchise agreement, or applicable law shall be performed at the grantee's
expense, unless expressly provided to the contrary in this chapter, the
franchise agreement, or applicable law.

and to promote the public interest, except as otherwise provided in a
franchise agreement.
Governing law. Except as to matters that are governed solely by federal
law or regulation, a franchise agreement will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maine.

ARTICLE III
Application for Grant, Renewal or Modification of Franchise
§ 46-12. Written application.
§ 46-13. Application for grant of a franchise other than a Cable Act
renewal franchise.
Application requirement. A written application shall be filed with the
Town for grant of an initial franchise; renewal of a franchise under
47 U.S.C. § 546(a) to (g); or modification of a franchise agreement
pursuant to this chapter or a franchise agreement. An applicant shall

chapter, any existing franchise agreement held by the applicant and all
applicable laws.
A.
Acceptability for filing. To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of
the application shall be submitted together with 12 copies. The Town
Manager may, in combination with neighboring communities, establish
a joint application procedure, provided that any such procedure
conforms to the standards of this chapter. The application must be
accompanied by the required application filing fee as set forth in
§ 46-17, conform to any applicable request for proposals, and contain
all required information. All applications shall include the names and
addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of the applicant with
respect to the application.
B.
Applications available for public inspection. All applications accepted
for filing shall be made available by the Town for public inspection in
the office of the Town Clerk during normal business hours. Upon receipt
of an application, the Town Clerk shall provide prompt public notice
that the application or proposal is available for public inspection at the
municipal offices during regular business hours for a period of at least
three weeks.
C.
Town may waive. The Town Council may waive any of the provisions
of this Article III by resolution, where application of the rule would
cause manifest injustice, except for those provisions required by state
or federal law. Any waiver granted shall explain the basis for the waiver
and shall not unduly discriminate against any applicant.
D.
Application. A person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting
an application containing the information required in § 46-15 and
requesting an evaluation of that application pursuant to Subsection B of
this section. Prior to evaluating that application, the Town shall conduct

section and may seek additional applications.
A.
§ 46-12 CABLE TELEVISION § 46-13
46:77
Factors in evaluating application for franchise or renewal of existing
franchise. In evaluating an application for a franchise, the Town shall
consider, among other things, the following factors:
The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with
the applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable
franchise for the Town.
(1)
Whether the quality of the applicant's service under an existing
franchise in the Town, including signal quality, response to
customer complaints, billing practices, and the like, has been
reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities
served.
(2)
Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal
qualifications to provide cable service.
(3)
Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements
established by the Town and is otherwise reasonable to meet the
future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking
into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.
(4)
Whether, to the extent not considered as part of Subsection D(4),
the applicant will provide adequate public, education, and
governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or financial
support, consistent with community needs and interests.
(5)
Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest
considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-ofway
and private property that would be used by the cable system,
including the extent to which installation or maintenance as
planned would require replacement of property or involve
disruption of property, public services, or use of the public rightsof-
way; the effect of granting a franchise on the ability of the
applicant and its proposed facilities to meet the cable-related needs
and interests of the community.
(6)
Whether the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant owns or
controls any other cable system in the Town or whether grant of
the application may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery
of cable service in the Town.
(7)
B.
Town determination. If the Town finds that it is in the public interest
to issue a franchise after considering the factors set forth above, and
subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate franchise
agreement, it shall issue a franchise. If the Town denies a franchise, it
will issue within 30 days a written decision explaining why the franchise
was denied. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise,
the Town may hold one or more public hearings or implement other
procedures under which comments from the public on an applicant may
be received. The Town also may grant or deny a request for a franchise
based on its review of an application without further proceedings and
C.
§ 46-13 BAR HARBOR CODE § 46-13
46:78
§ 46-14. Application for grant of a Cable Act renewal franchise.
Applications for renewal under the Cable Act shall be received and reviewed
in a manner consistent with Section 626 of the Cable Act, 427 U.S.C. § 546.
If neither a grantee nor the Town activates in a timely manner or can
activate the renewal process set forth in 47 U.S.C. § 546 (a) through (g)
(including, for example, if the provisions are repealed), and except as to
applications submitted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546(h), the provisions of
§ 46-13 shall apply and a renewal request shall be treated the same as any
other request for a franchise. The following requirements shall apply to
renewal requests properly submitted pursuant to the Cable Act:
may reject any application that is incomplete. This chapter is not
intended and shall not be interpreted to grant any applicant or existing
grantee standing to challenge the issuance of a franchise to another,
except as provided by applicable state or federal laws or regulations.
Joint review. The Town may elect to delegate review of an application to
a consortium of local governments or a formally constituted interlocal
body of which the Town is a member. Any such entity shall review the
application in accordance with the standards of Subsection B of this
section and make a recommendation to the Town. In such a case, the
Town Council shall review the recommendation of the designated body
and approve or reject it in accordance with the terms of Subsection C
of this section.
D.
Issuance of RFP. If the provisions of 47 U.S.C. § 546(a) through (g)
are properly invoked, the Town may issue an RFP after conducting a
proceeding to review the applicant's past performance and to identify
future cable-related community needs and interests. The Town
Administrator, or the Administrator's designee, shall establish
deadlines and procedures for responding to the RFP, may seek
additional information from the applicant, and shall establish deadlines
for the submission of that additional information.
Following receipt of the application responding to that RFP (and
such additional information as may be provided in response to
requests), the Town will determine that the franchise should be
renewed or make a preliminary assessment that the franchise
should not be renewed. That determination shall be in accordance
with the time limits established by the Cable Act. The preliminary
determination shall be made by order.
(1)
If the Town determines that the franchise should not be renewed
and the applicant that submitted the renewal application notifies
the Town, either in its RFP response or within 10 working days of
the preliminary assessment, that it wishes to pursue any rights to
any administrative proceeding it has under the Cable Act, then the
Town shall commence an administrative proceeding after providing
prompt public notice thereof, in accordance with the Cable Act.
(2)
A.
§ 46-13 CABLE TELEVISION § 46-14
46:79
If the Town decides preliminarily to grant renewal, it shall prepare
a final franchise agreement that incorporates, as appropriate, the
commitments made by the applicant in the renewal application.
If the applicant accepts the franchise agreement, and the final
agreement is ratified by the Town, the franchise shall be renewed.
If the franchise agreement is not so accepted and ratified within
the time limits established by 47 U.S.C. § 546(c)(1), renewal shall
be deemed preliminarily denied and an administrative proceeding
commenced if the applicant that submitted the renewal application
requests it within 10 days of the expiration of the time limit
established by 47 U.S.C. § 546(c)(1).
(3)
Administrative hearing. If an administrative hearing is commenced
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546(c), the applicant's renewal application shall
be evaluated considering such matters as may be considered consistent
with federal law. The following procedures shall apply:
The Town Council shall, by order, appoint an administrative hearing
officer or officers (referred to hereafter as "hearing officer"). The
Town Council may appoint itself as hearing officer.
(1)
The hearing officer shall establish a schedule for proceeding which
allows for documentary discovery and interrogatory responses,
production of evidence, and cross-examination of witnesses.
Depositions shall not be permitted unless the party requesting the
deposition shows that documentary discovery and interrogatory
responses will not provide it an adequate opportunity to require the
production of evidence necessary to present its case. The hearing
officer shall have the authority to require the production of
evidence as the interests of justice may require, including to
require the production of evidence by the applicant that submitted
the renewal application and any entity that owns or controls or is
owned or controlled by such applicant directly or indirectly. The
hearing officer may issue protective orders to the extent permitted
under applicable state law. Any order may be enforced by a court
of competent jurisdiction or by imposing appropriate sanctions in
the administrative hearing.
(2)
The hearing officer may conduct a prehearing conference and
establish appropriate prehearing procedures. Intervention by nonparties
is not authorized except to the extent permitted by the
Cable Act.
(3)
The hearing officer may require the Town and the applicant to
submit prepared testimony prior to the hearing. Unless the parties
agree otherwise, the applicant shall present evidence first and the
Town shall present evidence second.
(4)
Any reports or the transcript or summary of any proceedings
conducted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546(a) shall for purposes of
the administrative hearing be regarded no differently than any
(5)
B.
§ 46-14 BAR HARBOR CODE § 46-14
46:80
§ 46-15. Contents of application.
If issued by the Town, an RFP for the grant of a renewal franchise under 47
U.S.C. § 546(c) shall require, and any application for an initial or renewal
other evidence. The Town and the applicant must be afforded full
procedural protection regarding evidence related to these
proceedings, including the rights to refute any evidence introduced
in those proceedings or sought to be introduced by the other
party. Both shall have the opportunity to submit additional evidence
related to issues raised in the proceeding conducted pursuant to 47
U.S.C. § 546(a).
Following completion of any hearing, the hearing officer shall
require the parties to submit proposed findings of fact with respect
to the matters that the Town is entitled to consider in determining
whether renewal should be granted. Based on the record of the
hearing, the hearing officer shall then prepare written findings
with respect to those matters and submit those findings to the
Town Council and to the parties (unless the hearing officer is the
Town Council, in which case the written findings shall constitute
the final decision of the Town).
(6)
If the hearing officer is not the Town Council, the parties shall
have 30 days from the date the findings are submitted to the
Town Council to file exceptions to those findings. The Town Council
shall thereafter issue a written decision granting or denying the
application for renewal, consistent with the requirements of the
Cable Act and based on the record of such proceedings. A copy of
that decision of the Town Council shall be provided to the applicant.
(7)
(8) The proceeding shall be conducted with due speed.
In conducting the proceedings, and except as inconsistent with the
foregoing, the hearing officer will follow the Maine Administrative
Procedure Act4 or the successor statutes thereto unless otherwise
governed by federal law or regulations. The hearing officer may
request that the Town Council adopt additional procedures and
requirements as necessary in the interest of justice.
(9)
Informal renewal applications. This section does not prohibit any
grantee from submitting an informal renewal application pursuant to
47 U.S.C. § 546(h), which application may be granted or denied in
accordance with the provisions of 47 U.S.C. § 546(h).
C.
Consistency with Cable Act. The provisions of this chapter shall be read
and applied so that they are consistent with Section 626 of the Cable
Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546.

causing notice of the time and place of such hearing to be published in
A statement whether the modification is sought pursuant to Section 625
of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 545, and, if so, a demonstration that the

a result of franchise requirements, fails to make timely payment to the Town
of any amounts due under a franchise agreement or applicable law, fails
to make timely payment to the Town of any taxes lawfully due, or fails to
compensate the Town for any damages, costs, or expenses the Town suffers
or incurs by reason of any act or omission of the grantee in connection with
its franchise agreement, the Town may withdraw the amount thereof from
the security fund. To invoke the provisions of this section, the Town shall
give the grantee written notice of the default in the grantee's performance.
If within 30 calendar days following such written notice from the Town to
A franchise agreement may provide that, prior to the franchise's
becoming effective, the grantee shall post with the Town a cash security
deposit to be used as a security fund to ensure the grantee's faithful
performance of and compliance with all provisions of this chapter,
the franchise agreement, and other applicable laws and compliance
with all orders, permits, and directions of the Town or any agency
thereof having jurisdiction over the grantee's acts or defaults under

fees, or taxes due the Town which arise by reason of the construction,
operation, or maintenance of the system. The amount of any security
fund shall be specified in a franchise agreement.
A.
In lieu of a cash security fund, a grantee may agree to file and maintain
with the Town an irrevocable letter of credit with a bank having an
office in the State of Maine in the amount specified in the preceding
subsection to serve the same purposes as set forth therein. Said letter
of credit shall remain in effect for the full term of the franchise plus
an additional six months thereafter. The grantee and its surety shall be
jointly and severally liable under the terms of the letter of credit for the
grantee's failure to ensure its faithful performance of and compliance
with all provisions of this chapter, the franchise agreement, and other
applicable law and compliance with all orders, permits, and directions

operation, or maintenance of the system. The letter of credit shall
provide for 30 days' prior written notice to the Town of any intention on
the part of the grantee to cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise materially
alter its terms. Neither the filing of a letter of credit with the Town nor
the receipt of any damages recovered by the Town thereunder shall be
construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee or limit the
liability of the grantee under the terms of its franchise for damages,
either to the full amount of the letter of credit or otherwise.

of the Town, the Town may proceed to withdraw the amount in question
from the security fund, provided that, if by its nature the default cannot
be remedied within 30 days and the grantee has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Town that it is making a continuing good faith effort to
remedy the default, the Town shall not draw on the security fund.
§ 46-34. Notification of withdrawal.
Within 10 business days of a withdrawal from the security fund, the Town
shall mail, by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of
the amount, date, and purpose of such withdrawal to the grantee.
§ 46-35. Inadequate fund balance.
If at the time of a withdrawal from the security fund by the Town the amount
of the fund is insufficient to provide the total payment towards which the
withdrawal is directed, the balance of such payment shall continue as the
obligation of the grantee to the Town until it is paid.
§ 46-36. Replenishment.
No later than 30 days after mailing of notification to the grantee by certified
mail, return receipt requested, of a withdrawal under the security fund, the
grantee shall deliver to the Town for deposit in the security fund an amount
equal to the amount so withdrawn. Failure to make timely delivery of such
amount to the Town shall constitute a material violation of the franchise.
§ 46-37. Disposition.
Upon termination of the franchise under conditions other than those
stipulating forfeiture of the security fund, the balance then remaining in the
security fund shall be withdrawn by the Town and paid to the grantee within
90 days of such termination, provided that there is then no outstanding
material default on the part of the grantee.
§ 46-38. Grantor rights.
The rights reserved to the Town with respect to Articles IV, V and VI hereof
are in addition to all other rights of the Town, whether reserved by this

pursue the following remedies in the event a grantee or any other person
violates this chapter, its franchise agreement, or applicable state or federal
law. The Town may:
§ 46-40. Revocation or termination of franchise.
Seek a determination from a court of competent jurisdiction that a
provision of this chapter has been violated. If such a violation is found
to exist by the court the minimum fine imposed shall be $50 and
the maximum fine imposed per violation shall be $250. Each day the
violation is found to exist shall constitute a separate violation for which
the above-indicated fine may be assessed. Any violation found to exist
on the day of trial may be found, at a minimum, to have existed from the
filing date of the complaint until the day of trial and the fine assessed
accordingly, unless the grantee affirmatively proves that said violation
did not exist during any part of or all of the aforementioned time period.
If the grantee is found by the court to have been adjudicated in violation
of any provision of this chapter on more than one occasion within two
years, whether or not a violation of the same provision of this chapter,
the minimum fine per violation shall be $100 and the maximum fine per
violation shall be $500.
A.
B. Seek legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.
Apply any remedy provided for in a franchise agreement, including
enforcing provisions, if any.
C.
Town right to revoke franchise. The Town shall have the right to revoke
the franchise for a grantee's substantial failure to construct or operate
the cable system as required by this chapter or a franchise agreement,
for defrauding or attempting to defraud the Town or subscribers, if
the grantee is declared bankrupt, or for any other material violation
of this chapter or material breach of a franchise agreement. To invoke
the provisions of this section, the Town shall give the grantee written
notice of the default in its performance. If within 30 calendar days
following such written notice from the Town to the grantee the grantee
has not taken corrective action or corrective action is not being actively
and expeditiously pursued to the satisfaction of the Town, the Town
may give written notice to the grantee of its intent to revoke the
franchise, stating its reasons, provided that no opportunity to cure shall
be provided where the grantee has defrauded or attempted to defraud
the Town or its subscribers or in the event the grantee is declared
bankrupt. In the case of fraud or attempted fraud, the franchise may be
revoked after the hearing required under Subsection B of this section;
A.
§ 46-39 CABLE TELEVISION § 46-40
46:95
revocation for bankruptcy shall be governed by Subsection C of this
section.
Public hearing. Prior to revoking a franchise, the Town shall hold a
public hearing, on 30 calendar days' written notice, at which time
the grantee and the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
Following the public hearing, the Town may determine to revoke the
franchise based on the information presented at the hearing and other
information of record. If the Town determines to revoke a franchise, it
shall issue a written decision setting forth the reasons for its decision.
A copy of such decision shall be transmitted to the grantee.
B.
Revocation after assignment for benefit of creditors or appointment of
receiver or trustee.
To the extent provided by law, any franchise may, at the option of
the Town following a public hearing, be revoked 120 calendar days
after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment
of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the grantee,
whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment
for the benefit of creditors or other action or proceeding, unless
within that one-hundred-twenty-day period:
Such assignment, receivership, or trusteeship has been
vacated; or
(a)
Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the
material terms and conditions of this chapter and a franchise
agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by a
court of competent jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and a
franchise agreement and such other conditions as may be
established or as are required under Article XII of this chapter.
(b)
(1)
In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the
facilities, equipment, or property of a grantee, the Town may
revoke the franchise, following a public hearing before the Town,
by serving notice on the grantee and the successful bidder at the
sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges
of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate 30 calendar
days after serving such notice, unless the Town has approved the
transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder and the successful
bidder has covenanted and agreed with the Town to assume and be
bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and
this chapter and such other conditions as may be established or as
are required pursuant to Article VIII of this chapter.
(2)
C.
Procedures on revocation, abandonment and termination. If the Town
revokes a franchise or if for any other reason a grantee abandons,
terminates, or fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers, the
following procedures and rights are effective:
D.
§ 46-40 BAR HARBOR CODE § 46-40
46:96
§ 46-41. Obligation of compliance.
The Town's exercise of one remedy or a grantee's payment of liquidated
damages or penalties shall not relieve a grantee of its obligations to comply
The Town may require the former grantee to remove its facilities
and equipment located in the public rights-of-way and on public
premises at the former grantee's expense. If the former grantee
fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the Town may
have the removal done at the former grantee's and/or surety's
expense. The foregoing provisions shall not apply if, within three
months after expiration, termination or revocation of the franchise,
the grantee obtains certification from the FCC to operate an open
video system or any other federal or state certification to provide
telecommunications services.
(1)
In the event of revocation, the Town, by written order, may acquire
ownership of the cable system at not less than fair market value,
determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going
concern, but with no value allocated to the franchise itself, as
specified at 47 U.S.C. § 547(a)(1).
(2)
If a cable system is abandoned by a grantee or the franchise
otherwise terminates, the ownership of all portions of the cable
system in the public rights-of-way shall revert to the Town and
the Town may sell, assign, or transfer all or part of the assets
of the system. If a grantee abandons a portion of its system, the
ownership of the abandoned portions of the cable system in the
public rights-of-way shall revert to the Town and the Town may
sell, assign or transfer the abandoned facilities. A cable system or
a portion thereof shall be deemed abandoned if a grantee:
Gives the Town written notice of its decision to abandon the
system or the portion in question; or
(a)
Fails to provide cable service to subscribers served by the
system or the relevant portion thereof on a continuous basis
for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or more.
(b)
(3)
Forfeiture for failure to comply with franchise obligation.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter other than the
force majeure clause of § 46-85, where the Town has issued a franchise
specifically conditioned in the franchise agreement on the completion
of construction, system upgrade, or other specific obligation by a
specified date, failure of the grantee to complete such construction or
upgrade, or to comply with such other specific obligations as required,
will result in the automatic forfeiture of the franchise without further
action by the Town where it is so provided in the franchise agreement,
unless the Town, at its discretion and for good cause demonstrated by
the grantee, grants an extension of time.
E.
§ 46-40 CABLE TELEVISION § 46-41
46:97
with its franchise. In addition, the Town may exercise any rights it has at
law or equity.
§ 46-42. Relation to insurance and indemnity requirements.
Recovery by the Town of any amounts under insurance, the performance
bond, the security fund or letter of credit, or otherwise does not limit a
grantee's duty to indemnify the Town in any way, nor shall such recovery
relieve a grantee of its obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts
owed to the Town, or in any respect prevent the Town from exercising any
other right or remedy it may have, provided that this section shall not be
interpreted as permitting the Town to recover twice for the same damage.
In addition, any civil fine imposed pursuant to § 46-39A or other applicable
law shall not be treated as a recovery for purposes of this section.
§ 46-41 BAR HARBOR CODE § 46-42
46:98
ARTICLE VIII
Transfers
§ 46-43. Town approval required.
No transfer shall occur without prior approval of the Town; provided,
however, that no such approval shall be required for transfers resulting
from the transfer of ownership interests between existing holders of
ownership interests in a grantee, where such holders were also holders of
ownership interests in the grantee at the time of the original grant of the
franchise to the grantee.
§ 46-44. Application.
An application for a transfer shall provide complete information on the
proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical, and
other qualifications of the transferee and on the potential impact of the
transfer on subscriber rates and service. At a minimum, the information
required under federal law and in § 46-15A to D, I to K, M and O of this
chapter shall be provided with respect to the proposed transferee.
§ 46-45. Determination by Town.
In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or grant
subject to conditions an application for a transfer of a franchise, the
Town shall not unreasonably withhold its consent but shall first
consider:
The legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to
operate the system;
(1)
Whether the incumbent cable operator is in compliance with its
franchise agreement and this chapter and, if not, the proposed
transferee owns or controls any other cable system in the Town,
or whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce
competition in the delivery of cable service in the Town;
(2)
Whether the transferee owns or controls any other cable system in
the Town, or whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or
reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the Town; and
(3)
Whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer
would adversely affect subscribers, the Town's interest under this
chapter, the franchise agreement, or other applicable law or make
it less likely that the future cable-related needs and interests of the
community would be satisfied at a reasonable cost.
(4)
A.
The Town reserves the right to review the purchase price of any
transfer or assignment of a cable system. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, any negotiated sale value which the Town deems
unreasonable will not be considered in the rate base for any subsequent
request for rate increases.
B.
§ 46-43 CABLE TELEVISION § 46-46
46:99
§ 46-46. Transferee's agreement.
No application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the
transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms
of this chapter and the franchise agreement and that it will assume the
obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and omissions, known
and unknown, of the previous grantee under this chapter and the franchise
agreement for all purposes, including renewal, unless the Town, in its sole
discretion, expressly waives this requirement in whole or in part.
§ 46-47. Approval does not constitute waiver.
Approval by the Town of a transfer of a franchise shall not constitute a
waiver or release of any of the rights of the Town under this chapter or
a franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the
transfer.
§ 46-48. Processing fee.
As a condition of considering a transfer, the Town may impose a fee on the
transferee to cover its estimated out-of-pocket expenses in considering the
application for transfer of a franchise. Any amount collected in excess of the
estimated amount shall be returned to the transferee.
§ 46-46 BAR HARBOR CODE § 46-48

ARTICLE IX
Franchise Fee
§ 46-49. Finding.
The Town finds that the public rights-of-way of the Town, county, and state
to be used by a grantee for the operation of a cable system are valuable
public property acquired and maintained by the county, state, and Town at
great expense to the taxpayers. The Town further finds that the grant of
a franchise to use public rights-of-way is a valuable property right without
which a grantee would be required to invest substantial capital.
§ 46-50. Payment to Town.
As compensation for use of the public rights-of-way and in light of the
scope of any franchise, in addition to providing channels, facilities and
other support for public, educational and governmental use of the cable
system, a grantee shall pay the Town a franchise fee. The amount of the
fee shall be specified in a franchise agreement. The franchise fee shall be
paid annually, provided that provisions for more frequent payments may be
specified in a franchise agreement. At least once a year the grantee shall
provide the Town a report setting forth the total of gross revenues for the

an independent auditor to audit the records of a grantee to verify
the computation of amounts payable under this chapter or a franchise
agreement and recompute any amounts determined to be payable
under this chapter or a franchise agreement, whether the records are
held by the grantee, an affiliate, or any other entity that collects or
receives funds related to the grantee's operation in the Town, including,
by way of illustration and limitation, any entity that sells advertising on
the grantee's behalf.
The grantee shall be responsible for all reasonable costs associated
with any such audit, including the auditor's fees, as a cost

of receiving requests for service, inquiries, and complaints from
subscribers. After those hours a grantee shall arrange for the
phone to be answered so that customers can register complaints
and report service problems on a twenty-four-hour-per-day, sevenday-
per-week basis and so that the grantee can respond to service
outages as required herein.

will be made prior to the time of appointment and the appointment
rescheduled.
A.
Missed appointments. Subscribers who experience a missed installation
appointment due to the fault of a grantee shall receive standard
installation free of charge. If the installation was to have been provided
free of charge, or for other appointments, the subscriber shall receive

initial request, except installation requests, provided that a grantee
shall complete the work in the shortest time possible where, for reasons
beyond the grantee's control, the work could not be completed in those

not justify a grantee's failure to comply with this provision. Except as
federal law requires, no charge shall be made to the subscriber for this
service, except for the cost of repairs to the grantee's equipment or
facilities where it can be documented that the equipment or facility was

prior to voluntary termination or downgrade of service may be required
of subscribers by any grantee. No charge may be imposed for any
voluntary disconnection, and downgrade charges must comply with
the requirements of federal law. So long as the subscriber returns
equipment necessary to receive a service within five business days of
the disconnection, no charge may be imposed by any grantee for any
cable services delivered after the date of the request to disconnect.
Subscriber return of equipment. A subscriber may be asked, but not

Disconnection for failure to pay fee. If a subscriber fails to pay a
monthly subscriber or other fee or charge, a grantee may disconnect
the subscriber's service outlet; however, such disconnection shall not
be effected until at least 45 days after the due date of the monthly
subscriber fee or other charge and after 10 days' advance written
notice of intent to disconnect is given to the subscriber in question.
If the subscriber pays all amounts due, including late charges before
the date scheduled for disconnection, the grantee shall not disconnect

prior to implementation.

it alters services or service terms or conditions, a grantee must provide

electronic equipment. Such written notice shall be provided to the Town
at least 30 days, and to subscribers at least 30 days, before the change.

without the required 30 days' notice shall be of no force or effect, and
a grantee shall be obligated to refund any increased amount collected
without the required 30 days' notice and to restore service to the
prior existing status, at least until the required notice is provided. This
subsection shall not limit the right of a grantee to implement any rate

The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety and welfare

proliferation of residences harboring occupants who disturb the peace
and tranquillity of their neighborhoods.
A.
The Town Council finds that:
Chronic unlawful or nuisance activity of various kinds on and near
disorderly properties adversely affects the health, safety and
welfare of citizens and diminishes the quality of life in
neighborhoods where this chronic activity occurs. Chronic unlawful
or nuisance activity constitutes a public nuisance and should be
subject to abatement.
(1)
The Town has a substantial and compelling interest in protecting
the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and the neighborhoods
affected by chronic unlawful or nuisance activity.
(2)
The processes presently available do not adequately control
chronic unlawful or nuisance activity or its detrimental effects on
citizens and neighborhoods where such chronic activity occurs.
(3)
Establishing the proposed regulatory scheme will alleviate the
problems created by chronic unlawful or nuisance activity through
early intervention by the Chief of Police.

not deliberate or vote on the item concerned. For purposes of this
section, "personal interest" shall include any interest of the member
concerned as a resident, landowner or taxpayer personally affected by
the matter under consideration to an extent greater than Bar Harbor
residents generally.
D.
Deliberation and vote prohibited. No member shall, in their capacity
as a member of their agency, vote, participate in the deliberation, or
otherwise take part in the decision making process on any agenda item
in which they or a member of their immediate family has a financial or
special interest as defined by this chapter. In the absence of a financial
or special interest, members shall attempt to avoid any appearance of a
conflict of interest by disclosure, as provided below.
A.
Disclosure of conflict. Any member who believes that he or she has a
financial or special interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest,
in any agenda item before their agency shall disclose the nature and
extent of such interest, and the secretary shall make a record of such
disclosure in the minutes. In cases where a member's ability to disclose
the nature and extent of such interest is limited by the confidentiality
requirements of State or federal law, the member may refrain from
disclosing the details of the interest to the extent necessary to comply
with such confidentiality requirements. The disclosure required by this
B.
§ 78-10 BAR HARBOR CODE § 78-12
74:162
paragraph shall be made at the first meeting of the agency or
subcommittee thereof at which the agenda item concerned is to be
taken up for discussion or vote and at which the member is present.
Additionally, anyone else who believes that a member has a financial
or special interest in any agenda item before an agency may disclose
the nature and extent of such interest, and the secretary shall make a
record of such disclosure in the minutes.
Determination of conflict. Once the issue of conflict has been raised
relative to an individual member and disclosure has been made as
provided above, such individual's fellow members shall review the facts
as disclosed to them and shall vote on whether or not such individual
has a financial or special interest, or the appearance of a conflict of
interest, with respect to the agenda item concerned. All conflict of
interest questions relating to a particular agenda item shall be resolved
prior to any consideration of the item concerned, and each member
present, except the individual member who is alleged to have a conflict
of interest, shall vote on all conflict of interest questions.
All votes of conflict of interest questions shall be recorded. A
majority of those present and voting shall determine the question.
(1)
Upon determination that a conflict of interest in fact exists, the
member concerned shall be excused from participating in
discussion, deliberation or vote on the relevant agenda item at that
meeting and at all future meetings, unless the conflict is resolved,
and shall remove themselves from the meeting room as provided
below.
(2)
In the event that a majority of the agency, or subcommittee thereof,
shall require disclosure of further information not immediately
available or shall require confirmation of the information disclosed,
consideration of the relevant agenda item shall be postponed to an
appropriate time.
(3)
As provided by the Maine Freedom of Access Act, an agency may
enter executive session to discuss a potential conflict of interest,
but only upon a motion "to go into executive session as permitted
by 1 M.R.S.A. § 405.6.A for discussion or consideration of a
potential conflict of interest, since open discussion could
reasonably be expected to case damage to the reputation of the
individual or infringe on the individual's right to privacy."
(4)
C.
Influence prohibited. Once a member is determined to have a conflict of
interest in respect to any agenda item and once all conflict of interest
questions relating to the agenda item concerned have been determined
as provided above, said individual shall immediately remove themselves
from the meeting room and the sight of the remaining members to
prevent their real or apparent influence. Recused members shall not
return to their regular seat nor to the meeting room until deliberation
and action on the item is completed.

Personal interest. Nothing in this section shall prohibit any member,
on behalf of his/her personal interest, from appearing before any Town
agency, but such member shall leave his/her seat at the table and shall
not deliberate or vote on the item concerned. For purposes of this
section, "personal interest" shall include any interest of the member
concerned as a resident, landowner or taxpayer personally affected by
the matter under consideration to an extent greater than Bar Harbor
residents generally.
E.
Consent agendas. Nothing herein shall require an individual member to
recuse himself or herself for any item contained on a "consent agenda"
on which:

candidates for elected office or as private citizens, nor prohibit the
member from promoting causes officially endorsed by a recorded vote
of the Council.
E.
Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit agencies or their
members from discussing local, state or national issues that may affect

GENERAL REFERENCES
Building construction  See Ch. 36. Land use  See Ch. 125.
§ 90-1. Purpose; establishment.
Certain areas of the Town of Bar Harbor, Maine, are subject to periodic
flooding, causing serious damages to properties within these areas.
Relief is available in the form of flood insurance as authorized by the
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. Therefore, the Town of Bar
Harbor, Maine, has chosen to become a participating community in
the National Flood Insurance Program, and agrees to comply with the
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488,
as amended) as delineated in this Floodplain Management Chapter.
It is the intent of the Town of Bar Harbor, Maine, to require the
recognition and evaluation of flood hazards in all official actions
relating to land use in the floodplain areas having special flood
hazards.
(1)
The Town of Bar Harbor has the legal authority to adopt land use
and control measures to reduce future flood losses pursuant to
Title 30-A M.R.S.A. §§ 3001 through 3007, 4352 and 4401 through
4407; Title 38 M.R.S.A. § 440. [Amended 6-21-2016 by Ord. No.
2016-01]
(2)
The National Flood Insurance Program, established in the
aforesaid Act, provides that areas of the Town of Bar Harbor having
a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and that floodplain management measures
be applied in such flood hazard areas. This chapter establishes a
flood hazard development permit system and review procedure for
development activities in the designated flood hazard areas of the
Town of Bar Harbor, Maine.

application of an aggrieved party, hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or
determination made by, or failure to act by the Code Enforcement Officer
or Planning Board in the administration of the provisions of this chapter.
The Board of Appeals may grant a variance from the requirements of this
chapter consistent with state law and the following criteria:
Any proposed development plan must include a condition of plan
approval requiring that structures on any lot in the development having
any portion of its land within a special flood hazard area are to be
constructed in accordance with § 90-6 of this chapter. Such
requirement will be included in any deed, lease, purchase and sale
agreement, or document transferring or expressing an intent to
transfer any interest in real estate or a structure, including but not
limited to a time-share interest. The condition shall clearly articulate
that the municipality may enforce any violation of the construction
requirement and that fact shall also be included in the deed or any
other document previously described. The construction requirement
shall also be clearly stated on any map, plat, or plan to be signed by
the Planning Board or local reviewing authority as part of the approval
process.
E.
Variances shall not be granted within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.
A.
Variances shall be granted only upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause; and
A determination that should a flood comparable to the base flood
occur, the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, public expense, or
create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
(2)
A showing that the issuance of the variance will not conflict with
other state, federal, or local laws or ordinances; and
(3)
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
undue hardship, which in this subsection means:
That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return
unless a variance is granted; and
(a)
That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances
of the property and not to the general conditions in the
neighborhood; and
(b)
(4)
B.
§ 90-9 BAR HARBOR CODE § 90-10
85:194
That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential
character of the locality; and
(c)
That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the
applicant or a prior owner.
(d)
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief,
and the Board of Appeals may impose such conditions to a variance as
it deems necessary.
C.
Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development for the conduct of a functionally
dependent use, provided that:
(1) Other criteria of this § 90-10 and § 90-6K are met; and
The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threats to public safety.
(2)
D.
Variances may be issued for the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
or restoration of historic structures upon the determination that:
The development meets the criteria of § 90-10A though D above;
and
(1)
The proposed repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(2)
E.
Any applicant who meets the criteria of § 90-10A through E, shall be
notified by the Board of Appeals, in writing, over the signature of the
Chairman of the Board of Appeals that:
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in greatly increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 per $100 of insurance
coverage;
(1)
Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property; and
(2)
The applicant agrees in writing that the applicant is fully aware of
all the risks inherent in the use of land subject to flooding, assumes
those risks and agrees to indemnify and defend the municipality
against any claims filed against it that are related to the applicant's
decision to use land located in a floodplain and that the applicant
individually releases the municipality from any claims the applicant
may have against the municipality that are related to the use of
land located in a floodplain.

GENERAL ASSISTANCE ADMINISTRATOR  A municipal official
designated to receive applications, make decisions concerning an
applicant's right to receive assistance, and prepare records and
communications concerning assistance. He or she may be an elected
overseer or an authorized agent such as a town manager, welfare director,
or caseworker [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(12)].
GENERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM  A service administered by a
municipality for the immediate aid of persons who are unable to provide
the basic necessities essential to maintain themselves or their families. A
general assistance program provides a specific amount and type of aid for
defined needs during a limited period of time and is not intended to be a
continuing "grant-in-aid" or "categorical" welfare program. This definition
shall not in any way lessen the responsibility of each municipality to provide
general assistance to a person each time that the person is in need and is
found to be otherwise eligible to receive general assistance [22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4301(5)].
HOUSEHOLD  An individual or a group of individuals who share a
dwelling unit. When an applicant shares a dwelling unit with one or more
individuals, even when a landlord-tenant relationship may exist between
individuals residing in the dwelling unit, eligible applicants may receive
assistance for no more than their pro rata share of the actual costs of the
shared basic needs of that household according to the maximum levels of
assistance established in the municipal ordinance. The pro rata share is
calculated by dividing the maximum level of assistance available to the
entire household by the total number of household members. The income of
household members not legally liable shall be considered as available to the
applicant only when there is a pooling of income [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(6)].
INCOME 
Any form of income in cash or in kind received by the household
including:
(1) Net remuneration for services performed.
(2) Cash received on either secured or unsecured credit.
(3) Payments received as an annuity, retirement or disability benefits.
(4) Veterans' pensions and/or benefits.
(5) Retirement accounts or benefits.
(6) Workers' compensation.
(7) Unemployment benefits.
(8) Federal and/or state tax returns.

such as TANF, supplemental security income, social security and
any other payments from governmental sources (unless specifically
prohibited by any law or regulation).

(11) Income from pension or trust funds.
Household income from any other source, including relatives or
unrelated household members.
(12)
(13)Student loans.
(14)Rental income.
The following items shall not be considered as income or assets that
must be liquidated for the purposes of deriving income:
Real or personal income-producing property, tools of trade,
governmental entitlement specifically treated as exempt assets by
state or federal law;
(1)
Actual work-related expenses, whether itemized or by standard
deduction, such as taxes, retirement fund contributions, union
dues, transportation costs to and from work, special equipment
costs and child care expenses; or
(2)
Earned income of children below the age of 18 years who are fulltime
students and who are not working full time.
(3)
B.
In determining need, the period of time used as a basis for the
calculation shall be a thirty-day period commencing on the date of
the application. This prospective calculation shall not disqualify an
applicant who has exhausted income to purchase basic necessities,
provided that the income does not exceed the income standards
established by the municipality [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(7)].
C.
Certain public benefit programs are specifically exempt from being
counted as income for purposes of GA. These programs include:
(1) Food stamps [7 U.S.C.A. § 2017(b)].
(2) Li-Heap (42 U.S.C.A. § 8624).
(3) Family development accounts (22 M.R.S.A. § 3762).
(4) Americorp VISTA program benefits [42 U.S.C.A. § 5044(f)].
Property tax rebates issued under the Maine Property Tax Fairness
Credit program, only so long as the money is spent on basic
necessities [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(7)].

§ 102-3 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-3
85:222
INITIAL APPLICANT  A person who has not applied for assistance in this
or any other municipality is considered an initial applicant.
JUST CAUSE  A valid, verifiable reason that hinders an individual from
complying with one or more conditions of eligibility or from attending a
scheduled fair hearing [22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4301(8) and 4316-A(5)].
LUMP SUM PAYMENT  A one-time or typically nonrecurring sum of
money issued to an applicant or recipient. Lump sum payment includes,
but is not limited to, retroactive or settlement portions of social security
benefits, workers' compensation payments, unemployment benefits,
disability income, veterans' benefits, severance pay benefits, or money
received from inheritances, lottery winnings, personal injury awards,
property damage claims or divorce settlements. A lump sum payment
includes only the amount of money available to the applicant after payment
of required deductions has been made from the gross lump sum payment. A
lump sum payment does not include conversion of a nonliquid resource to
a liquid resource if the liquid resource has been used or is intended to be
used to replace the converted resource or for other necessary expenses [22
M.R.S.A. § 4301 (8-A)].
MATERIAL FACT  A material fact is a fact that necessarily has some
bearing on the determination of an applicant's general assistance eligibility,
and which would, if disclosed to the administrator, have some determinable
effect on the calculation of eligibility or the issuance of a grant of assistance.
MAXIMUM LEVELS OF ASSISTANCE  The amount of financial assistance
for a commodity or service as established in § 102-34 of this chapter or the
actual cost of any such basic necessity, whichever is less.
MISCONDUCT  For purposes of the GA work requirement (see 22
M.R.S.A. § 4316-A), "misconduct" shall have the same meaning as
"misconduct" defined in 26 M.R.S.A. § 1043(23). (See Appendix I9 of this
chapter for the official definition of "misconduct.") Generally, employees
are guilty of misconduct when the employee violates his or her duties
or obligations to the employer. Employees who engage in a pattern of
irresponsible behavior to the detriment of the employer's interest may also
be found guilty of misconduct.
MUNICIPALITY  Any city, town or plantation administering a general
assistance program.
MUNICIPALITY OF RESPONSIBILITY  The municipality which is
financially liable for the support of an eligible person at the time of
application [22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4301(9) and 4307].
NEED  The condition whereby a person's income, money, property, credit,
assets or other resources available to provide basic necessities for the
individual and the individual's family are less than the maximum levels of
assistance [22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4301(10) and 4308].
9. Editor's Note: Appendix I is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 102-3 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-3
85:223
NET GENERAL ASSISTANCE COSTS  Those direct costs incurred by
a municipality in providing assistance to eligible persons according to
standards established by the municipal officers. These do not include the
administrative expenses of the general assistance program [22 M.R.S.A.
§§ 4301(11) and 4311].
PERIOD OF ELIGIBILITY  The time for which a person has been granted
assistance. The period of eligibility may vary depending on the type of
assistance provided; however, in no event shall this period extend beyond
one month [22 M.R.S.A. § 4309(1)].
POOLING OF INCOME  The financial relationship among household
members who are not legally liable for mutual support in which there occurs
any commingling of funds or sharing of income or expenses. Municipalities
may by ordinance establish as a rebuttable presumption that persons
sharing the same dwelling unit are pooling their income. Applicants who are
requesting that the determination of eligibility be calculated as though one
or more household members are not pooling their income have the burden
of rebutting the presumed pooling of income.
REAL ESTATE  Any land, buildings, homes, mobile homes and any other
things affixed to the land [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(13)].
RECIPIENT  A person who has applied for and is currently receiving
general assistance.
REPEAT APPLICANTS  All applicants for general assistance that are
not initial applicants are repeat applicants. For purposes of this chapter,
"repeat" and "subsequent" shall have the same meaning.
RESIDENT  A person who is physically present in a municipality with the
intention of remaining in that municipality in order to maintain or establish
a home and who has no other residence. A person who applies for assistance
in a municipality who is not a resident of that municipality or any other
municipality is the responsibility of the municipality where the person first
applies. That municipality must take an application and grant assistance to
the applicant if he/she is eligible, until he/she establishes a new residence
in another municipality (22 M.R.S.A. § 4307).
RESOURCES 
Any program, service, or other sources of support which are an
alternative to or supplement for general assistance. There are two
kinds of resources: "available" and "potential." Potential resources are
programs, services, nonliquid assets, or trusts that typically require
people to apply in writing and/or wait a period of time before eligibility
is determined or the potential income is released.
A.
Potential resources include but are not limited to any state or federal
assistance program, employment benefits, governmental or private
pension program, available trust funds, support from legally liable
relatives, child support payments, and jointly held resources where
the applicant or recipient share may be available to the individual
(22 M.R.S.A. § 4317). Potential resources include the TANF (previously
B.
§ 102-3 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-3
85:224
THIRTY-DAY NEED  An applicant's thirty-day need is the sum of the
household's prospective thirty-day costs, from the date of application, for
the various basic necessities. For the purpose of this calculation, the thirtyday
cost for any basic need shall be the household's actual thirty-day
cost for the basic necessity or the maximum thirty-day cost for the basic
necessity as established by this chapter, whichever is less.
UNFORESEEN REPEAT APPLICANTS  Repeat applicants who have not
applied for assistance within the last 12 months and who have been
regularly employed or receiving support from a public benefit or private
source and who have unexpectedly become unemployed through no fault
of their own or whose benefits (e.g., through an available resource) have
ceased through no fault of their own.
UNMET NEED  An applicant's unmet need is the household's thirty-day
need as established by § 102-32 of this chapter less the household income
as calculated pursuant to § 102-33 of this chapter, provided that such a
calculation yields a positive number. If the household income is greater
than the household's thirty-day need, the household does not have an unmet
need.
WORK REQUIREMENTS  Work requirements are those obligations the
municipal administrator places on applicants for general assistance as
directed and/or authorized by 22 M.R.S.A. § 4316-A to the extent that such
obligations ensure a continuing potential eligibility for general assistance
when complied with, result in ineligibility when violated, and are not merely
optional, discretionary, or advisory. Work requirements include registering
for work, looking for work in good faith, accepting all suitable job offers,
maintaining employment, performing workfare, and participating in
training, educational, or rehabilitation programs that will assist the
participant in securing employment.
known as AFDC) program, food stamps, fuel assistance (HEAP),
subsidized housing, and similar programs.
Available resources include resources which are immediately available
to the applicant or which can be conveniently secured by the applicant
without delay, such as cash on hand or in bank accounts, assets for
which there is an immediate and available market, or support from
relatives which is being made available at the time of application and
for which the applicant does not have to take any unreasonable steps to
secure (e.g., relocation beyond the immediate region). At the discretion
of the GA administrator a necessary minimum balance required by a
financial institution in order to obtain free checking or in order to
maintain the account shall not be considered an available resource.
C.
The municipal GA administrator reserves the right to inform GA clients
of services, commodities or facilities made available by private
organizations or charities. Although GA applicants/recipients may be
informed of the existence of a charitable resource and/or organization,
GA eligibility shall not be based or conditioned on the use of a private
charitable resource(s).

Case records will not include information or material that is
irrelevant to either the applicant's or recipient's application or the
administrator's decisions.
(2)
Retention of records. General assistance records shall be retained for a

ARTICLE IV
Application Procedure
§ 102-7. Right to apply.
Who may apply. Anyone may apply for general assistance. The head of
the family, any other responsible household member, or an authorized
representative must apply in person, except in special emergency
situations as provided in § 102-15 of this chapter or except when the
applicant is a resident of an emergency shelter and the municipality has
made an agreement with that emergency shelter to presume shelter
residents to be eligible for general assistance [22 M.R.S.A. § 4304(3)].
In such cases, the administrator may require a representative to
present a signed statement documenting that he/she is in fact
authorized to apply for general assistance on behalf of the named
applicant. The applicant or representative must complete a written
application and any other required forms so that the administrator
can determine eligibility (22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4305 and 4308). With notice,
all members of the household receiving general assistance may be
required to physically present themselves to the administrator. Note
that fugitives from justice are ineligible for general assistance.
A.
Application via telephone. When a person has an emergency but is
unable to apply in person due to illness, disability, lack of child care,
lack of transportation or other good cause, and he/she cannot send an
authorized representative, the administrator will accept an application
by telephone. The telephone application process will include the
administrator receiving written verification by mail and visiting the
applicant's home with his or her permission (22 M.R.S.A. § 4304).
B.
Written application upon each request. Each request for assistance will
be administered in accordance with these guidelines. The administrator
will make an independent determination of eligibility for general
assistance each time a person applies (22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4308 and 4309).
C.
Applications accepted; posted notice. Application forms will be
available during regular business hours at the municipal office and
when the general assistance administrator is conducting interviews
with applicants. Notice will be posted stating when and where people
may apply for assistance and the name of the administrator available
to take emergency applications at all other times. In addition, the
posted notice shall include the fact that the municipality must issue a
written decision on all applications within 24 hours, and the DHHS tollfree
telephone numbers for reporting alleged violations or complaints.
Completed applications will be accepted and interviews given only
during the regular hours established and posted by the administrator.
In an emergency, however, the administrator or his or her designee will
be available to accept applications for assistance whenever necessary
(22 M.R.S.A. § 4304).
D.
§ 102-7 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-8
85:231
§ 102-8. Application interview.

interview each applicant personally before making a decision. The interview
will be conducted in private, although the applicant may be accompanied by
a legal representative, friend or family member.

provided a reasonable amount of time, e.g., five working days, in order
to obtain copies of identification records. Provided that the initial
applicant makes a good-faith effort to obtain the item/record sought,

informed that an application will only be accepted when his or her
conduct is under control.
A.
§ 102-11 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-14
85:235
§ 102-15. Emergencies.
If the administrator believes that an applicant's behavior presents a
threat to the health or safety of the public or to a municipal employee,
or if such behavior is violent, or if an applicant has engaged in abusive,
disruptive or harassing behavior and has been required to leave on
more than one occasion, then the applicant may be required to
designate a third party to apply for assistance on his or her behalf and
the applicant may be prohibited from entering the municipal building.
B.
When a third person applies for assistance on behalf of the applicant,
that person may be required to provide written verification that he/she
has been duly authorized to act as a representative for the applicant (22
M.R.S.A. § 4308).
C.
An emergency is considered to be any life threatening situation or a
situation beyond the control of the applicant which, if not alleviated
immediately, could reasonably be expected to pose a threat to the
health or safety of the applicant or a member of the household [22
M.R.S.A. § 4301(4)]. Although they may be considered otherwise
ineligible to receive general assistance, persons who apply for
assistance to alleviate an emergency may be granted assistance, except
as provided below, if they do not have sufficient income and resources
to meet an actual emergency need and have not had sufficient income
and resources to avert the emergency (22 M.R.S.A. § 4308).
A.
A municipality may provide emergency assistance when the
municipality determines that an emergency is imminent and that failure
to provide assistance may result in undue hardship and unnecessary
costs to either the client or the municipality.
B.
Disqualification.
A person who is currently disqualified from receiving General
Assistance due to a violation of §§ 102-22, 102-23, 102-24, 102-25,
102-26 or 102-30 of this chapter is ineligible to receive emergency
assistance [22 M.R.S.A. § 4308(2)(A)]. However, dependents of a
disqualified person may be eligible for assistance. For the purposes
of this section, "dependents" are defined as:
(a) A dependent minor child;
(b) An elderly, ill or disabled person; or
A person whose presence is required to provide care for any
child under the age of six years or any ill or disabled member
of the household [22 M.R.S.A. § 4309(3)].
(c)
(1)
In the event that one or more members of a household are
disqualified and assistance is requested for the remaining
dependents, the eligibility of those dependents will be calculated
(2)
C.
§ 102-14 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-15
85:236
by dividing the maximum level of assistance available to the entire
household by the total number of household members.
Assistance prior to verification. Whenever an applicant informs the
administrator that he/she needs assistance immediately, the
administrator will grant, pending verification, the assistance within 24
hours, provided that:
After interviewing the applicant, the administrator has determined
that the applicant will probably be eligible for assistance after a
verification of information is completed; and
(1)
The applicant submits documentation, when possible, to verify his
or her need. The administrator may contact at least one other
person to confirm the applicant's statements about needing
emergency assistance. No further assistance will be authorized
until the applicant's eligibility is confirmed (22 M.R.S.A. § 4310).
(2)
D.
Telephone applications.
If a person has an emergency need and cannot apply in person due
to illness, disability, lack of transportation, or other good cause, and
if there is no authorized representative who can apply on behalf
of the applicant, the administrator shall accept an application over
the telephone (22 M.R.S.A. § 4304).
(1)
The administrator will not grant any assistance as the result of
a telephone application if the applicant refuses to allow the
administrator to verify the information either by visiting his or her
home or by mail and the administrator cannot determine his or her
eligibility through any other means.
(2)
E.
Limitation on emergency assistance.
Applicants are not automatically eligible for emergency assistance.
If applicants had income which could have been used to prevent all
or part of an emergency, but they spent that income on items which
are not basic necessities, they will not be eligible to receive general
assistance to replace the misspent money [22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4308(2)
and 4315-A].
(1)
All applicants have the responsibility to provide the administrator
with verifiable documentation demonstrating that the applicant
did not have sufficient income to avert the emergency situation.
According to the following criteria, the administrator may limit
emergency assistance to cover only the difference between the
amount of money necessary for the household to avoid the
emergency and the amount of income available to the household
during the applicable time period.
The applicable time period shall be the 30 days preceding the
application for emergency assistance, except in those cases
(a)
(2)
F.
§ 102-15 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-15
85:237
§ 102-16. Residence.
where the emergency was created by a negative account
balance for a commodity or service (such as rent, mortgage
or utility payments), and the negative account balance was
created over a longer period of time. In such cases, the
applicable time period shall be the consecutive length of time
the account balance has been in the negative.
The administrator shall seek from the applicant all information
pertinent to the applicant's ability to provide for his or her
basic necessities for the applicable time period, including
evidence of all income and resources received over that period
of time.
(b)
The administrator shall calculate all costs for the household's
basic necessities during the applicable time period, per month,
in accordance with the maximum levels established by this
chapter for the specific basic necessity or the actual monthly
cost, whichever is less, including all costs associated with
averting the particular emergency situation for which the
applicant is seeking assistance.
(c)
From the total household costs for basic necessities during
the applicable time period, the administrator shall subtract
the total income and lump sum payments available to the
household for the applicable time period as well as the total
general assistance actually received during the applicable time
period.
(d)
The administrator may restrict the issuance of emergency
assistance to the difference yielded by the computation in
Subsection F(2)(d), even when such a grant will not totally
alleviate the emergency situation.
(e)
The administrator may waive this limitation on emergency
assistance in life-threatening situations or for initial
applicants; that is, persons who have never before applied for
general assistance.
(f)
Nothing in these criteria may be construed as prohibiting a
municipality from electing to alleviate an emergency situation
in the most cost-effective manner available, provided such a
determination of eligibility for emergency assistance is in
conformance with general assistance law.
(g)
The administrator shall provide general assistance to all eligible
persons applying for assistance who are residents of this municipality.
A resident is a person who has no other residence and is physically
present in this municipality and who intends to remain here and
establish a household.
A.
§ 102-15 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-16
85:238
The municipality also recognizes its responsibility to provide assistance
to eligible persons who apply here and who are not residents of this
municipality or any other municipality. If a person who is not a resident
of any municipality applies in this municipality first, the administrator
will determine his or her eligibility and, if eligible, will grant assistance
until he/she establishes a residence in another municipality (22
M.R.S.A. § 4307).
B.
Moving/relocating. The municipality will not consider moving or
transporting an applicant or recipient into another municipality unless
the person requests assistance to relocate to another municipality.
If the administrator determines the applicant is eligible and grants
financial assistance to help with the requested relocation, this
municipality will be responsible for providing assistance to the
applicant for 30 days after he/she moves, provided that the recipient
remains eligible.
C.
Institutions. If a resident of this municipality enters an institution
located in another municipality (such as a group home, shelter,
rehabilitation center, nursing home, or hospital) and requests
assistance while at the institution, he/she will be the responsibility of
this municipality for up to six months after he/she enters the institution
if the conditions of 22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4307 and 4313 are met. The
municipality thereafter retains responsibility for an applicant in an
institution only if the applicant has maintained a home in this
municipality to which he/she intends to return. The municipality also
recognizes its responsibility for applicants residing in an institution in
this municipality if such an applicant had no residence prior to entering
the institution [22 M.R.S.A. § 4307(4)].
D.
Temporary housing. Hotels/motels and similar places of temporary
lodging are considered institutions if the municipality grants financial
assistance for, makes arrangements for, or advises or encourages an
applicant to stay in temporary lodging. (NOTE: Municipalities which
illegally deny housing assistance and, as a result of the denial, the
applicant stays in temporary lodging are responsible for the applicant
for up to six months and may be subject to other penalties [22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4307(4)].)
E.
Disputes. When the administrator believes that an applicant is a
resident of another municipality but that municipality disputes its
responsibility, the administrator will notify the DHHS in Augusta
(287-3654 or 1-800-442-6003). If the applicant applies in this
municipality first, the administrator will determine his or her eligibility
and, if eligible, will grant assistance until the DHHS has concluded
which municipality is responsible for providing assistance. If another
municipality was responsible, the DHHS will recover the amount due
from the other municipality [22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4307(5) and 4307(6)].

ARTICLE V
Eligibility Factors
§ 102-17. General eligibility.
A person will be eligible for general assistance if he/she is in need and has
complied with the eligibility requirements set forth below.
§ 102-18. Initial application; subsequent applicants.
§ 102-19. Eligibility for categorical assistance.
Initial Application.
For initial applicants, except as provided immediately below, need
will be the sole condition of eligibility. The exception to this general
rule, as provided by law, applies to all applicants, including initial
applicants, who are disqualified for a defined period for quitting
employment without just cause or for being discharged from
employment for misconduct [22 M.R.S.A. § 1043(23)] (see § 102-22
of this chapter) and to fugitives from justice as defined in 15
M.R.S.A. § 201(4) [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(3)]. An initial applicant is a
person who has never before applied for general assistance in any
municipality in Maine [22 M.R.S.A. § 4308(1)].
(1)
"Need" means that the applicant's income (including prorated
income, where applicable), property, credit, assets or other
resources are less than the overall maximum level of assistance
contained in § 102-34 of this chapter or the applicant's thirty-day
need, whichever is less, and he/she does not have adequate income
or other resources available to provide basic necessities.
(2)
A.
Subsequent applicants. Persons who are not initial applicants are
repeat applicants. Repeat applicants are people who have applied for
general assistance at any time in the past. Repeat applicants are also
people on whose behalf a general assistance application was made at
any time in the past, provided that at such a time the applicant was
not a dependent minor in the household. For repeat applicants to be
eligible for general assistance, they must be in need and meet all other
eligibility requirements. The eligibility of repeat applicants may also be
adversely affected to the extent that they have not used their income
and resources to secure basic necessities.
B.
Receipt of categorical assistance will not disqualify a person from
receiving general assistance if the applicant is otherwise eligible.
Benefits received from other assistance programs will be considered
as income when determining need, with the exception of food stamps,
which will not be counted as income or resources or otherwise taken
into consideration when determining need [7 U.S.C. § 2017(b)].
A.
§ 102-17 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-19
85:241
§ 102-20. Personal property.
In addition, any fuel assistance (HEAP/ECIP) received by an applicant
will not be considered as income; that is, the administrator will always
compute the heating needs of an applicant who has received HEAP or
ECIP as if that applicant paid all costs associated with his or her fuel
needs [42 U.S.C. § 8624(f)]. The calculation of general assistance for
heating energy needs when an applicant has received HEAP or ECIP
shall be accomplished in accordance with Subsection C(3) under "Types
of income" at § 102-33 of this chapter. For several additional exceptions
please refer to the definition of "income" in this chapter. (See § 102-3.)
B.
Applicants or recipients must apply for other program benefits within
seven days after being advised in writing to do so by the general
assistance administrator. Persons who, without just cause, make no
good-faith effort to obtain a potential resource will be disqualified from
receiving assistance until they make a good-faith effort to obtain the
benefit (22 M.R.S.A. § 4317).
C.
Liquid assets. No person owning assets easily convertible into cash,
including but not limited to bank deposits, stocks, bonds, certificates
of deposit, retirement accounts, life insurance policies and other
marketable security, will be eligible for general assistance unless and
until he or she uses these assets to meet his or her basic needs,
and thereby exhausts them. At the discretion of the GA administrator,
liquid assets do not mean a reasonable minimum balance necessary for
obtaining free checking. Although one checking account per household
may be allowed, any monies over the minimum required to obtain free
checking are to be considered available liquid assets.
A.
Tangible assets. No person owning or possessing personal property,
such as but not limited to a motor vehicle (except as provided
immediately below in Subsection C), or a boat, trailer, recreation
vehicle or other assets that are convertible into cash and are
nonessential to the maintenance of the applicant's household, will be
eligible for general assistance. Exceptions may be made when a person
is making an initial application or is an unforeseeable repeat applicant
as defined in § 102-3 or when reasonable efforts to convert assets to
cash at fair market value are unsuccessful. Tools of a trade, livestock,
farm equipment and other equipment used for the production of income
are exempt from the above category and are not considered available
assets.
B.
Automobile ownership.
Ownership of one automobile per household will not make a person
ineligible for assistance if such vehicle is essential for
transportation to employment or for seeking employment,
obtaining medical care, rehabilitation or training facilities, or for
any other reason the GA administrator determines reasonable for
the maintenance of the applicant's household. Recipients of
(1)
C.
§ 102-19 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-20
85:242
§ 102-21. Ownership of real estate.
general assistance who own an automobile with a market value
greater than $8,000 may be required, with written, seven-day
notice, to make a good-faith effort to trade that automobile for an
automobile with a market value of less than $8,000. Any income
received by the applicant by virtue of such a trade down must
be used for his or her basic necessities. Failure to liquidate or
trade down the excess value of any automobile asset can result in
disqualification (22 M.R.S.A. § 4317).
The municipality will neither pay nor consider as necessary any
car payment or vehicle maintenance cost, including insurance for
which the applicant is responsible. However, provided that the
vehicle value is $8,000 or less and the applicant is utilizing the
vehicle for any of the above mentioned "essential" reasons, the
municipality in its discretion may choose to not consider
reasonable car payments, reasonable car insurance and reasonable
associated costs of maintenance as "misspent" income. General
assistance for travel-related needs shall be computed in
accordance with § 102-34B(7)(g) and (h), regarding Work-Related/
Travel Expenses.
(2)
Insurance. Insurance that is available to an applicant on a
noncontributory basis or that is required as a condition of employment
will not be a factor in determining eligibility for general assistance. Life
insurance with a cash surrender value may, at the discretion of the GA
administrator, be considered as a tangible asset.
D.
Transfer of property. Applicants who transfer assets for less than fair
market value to someone else solely for the purpose of establishing
eligibility for general assistance will not be granted general assistance
to replace the uncompensated value of the transferred asset. Assistance
will be denied within a one-hundred-twenty-day limit up to the
uncompensated value of the asset which was transferred unless the
transfer of asset is fraudulently misrepresented, in which case a onehundred-
twenty-day disqualification will be issued. There will be a
presumption that the applicant transferred his or her assets in order
to be eligible for general assistance whenever property is sold for less
than the fair market value or when the transfer occurred within 30
days prior to applying for general assistance unless the applicant can
demonstrate the existence of a good faith transaction.
E.
Principal Residence.
For purposes of general assistance solely, the applicant's principal
residence, including any adjoining land, is considered an exempt
resource, even if temporarily unoccupied because of employment,
job training, education, illness or disaster, provided that there is
demonstrated an intent to return. If the applicant owns land in
excess of the minimum lot size for the zone or district in which
(1)
A.
§ 102-20 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-21
85:243
the home is located, then that land may be considered a potential
resource if:
The applicant has received general assistance for the last 120
consecutive days; and
(a)
The applicant has the legal right to sell the land (e.g., any
mortgagee will release any mortgage, any co-owners agree to
the sale, zoning or other land use laws do not render the sale
illegal or impracticable); and
(b)
The applicant has the financial capability to put the land into
a marketable condition (e.g., the applicant can pay for any
necessary surveys); and
(c)
The land is not utilized for the maintenance and/or support of
the household; and
(d)
A knowledgeable source (e.g., a realtor) indicates that the land
in question can be sold at fair market value, for an amount
which will aid the applicant's financial rehabilitation; and
(e)
No other circumstances exist which cause any sale to be
unduly burdensome or inequitable.
(f)
If the above conditions are met, then the administrator may
condition the receipt of future assistance on the applicant's goodfaith
efforts to sell, or render salable, land which could be used
to provide necessary support for the applicant (e.g., the applicant
owns 100 "excess" acres; sale of 10 of the acres would provide for
the necessary support and therefore not all the land need be sold
at the present time). Assistance shall not be denied during the time
that the applicant is making a good-faith effort to sell or render
salable the land in question.
(2)
Once the applicant ceases to receive assistance, the obligations
under this section shall also cease.
(3)
Other property.
If the applicant or dependents own real property other than that
occupied as the principal residence, continued eligibility will
depend on the applicant making a reasonable effort to:
Dispose of the property at fair market value in order to convert
the property into cash which can be applied toward meeting
present need; or
(a)
Obtain a loan against such property which may be used to meet
present need. Applicants who transfer their excess property to
a third party in order to become eligible for general assistance
will be ineligible.
(b)
(1)
B.
§ 102-21 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-21
85:244
§ 102-22. Work requirement.
All general assistance recipients are required to register for work, look for
work, work to the extent of available employment, and otherwise fulfill the
work requirements, unless the applicant is exempt from such requirements
as provided below.
If an applicant is granted assistance in the form of a mortgage
payment or capital improvement payment, the municipality may
claim a lien against the property. The lien shall not be enforceable
until the time of sale of the property or upon the death of the
recipient (see also § 102-34 of this chapter) (22 M.R.S.A. § 4320).
(2)
Employment; rehabilitation.
All unemployed applicants and members of their households who
are 16 years of age or older and who are not attending a fulltime
primary or secondary school intended to lead to a high school
diploma will be required to accept any suitable job offer and/
or meet with job counselors, attend employment workshops and
rehabilitative services, except as provided below. (See Subsection
I, Exemptions.) Applicants must demonstrate to the administrator
that they are available for work and are actively seeking
employment.
(1)
A "suitable job" means any job which the applicant is mentally
and physically able to perform. "Available for work" means that
applicants must make themselves available for work during normal
business hours prevailing in the area, and show that no
circumstance exists which would prevent them from complying
with the work requirement.
(2)
A.
Verification.
Unemployed applicants or applicants employed on a part-time basis
will be required to provide verifiable documentation of their pursuit
of employment at the time of each application. At a minimum, such
documentation shall consist of a list of the employers contacted,
the date and time of the application contact, and the name of
the employer representative contacted. "Pursuit of employment"
means actually submitting a written application or applying for a
job in person when reasonable, or submitting a written application
or letter of inquiry to employers.
(1)
For the duration of any repeat applicant's period of unemployment
or partial employment, the administrator will establish the number
of employers per week to whom each nonexempt applicant shall
be required to apply in order to fulfill his or her work search
requirements. The number of weekly employer contacts required
by the administrator shall be reasonably related to the number
of potential employers in the region and the number of hours in
(2)
B.
§ 102-21 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-22
85:245
the week the applicant has available for work search activities
after considering all time the applicant must devote to existing
employment obligations, workfare obligations, and required
classroom or on-site participation in job training, educational, or
rehabilitation programs. Fulfillment of these requirements will not
be expected at the time of the initial application, but will be a
condition of eligibility for subsequent assistance.
Ineligibility. After being granted assistance at the time of initial
application, applicants will be considered ineligible for further
assistance for 120 days if they, without just cause:
(1) Refuse to register for employment with the Maine Job Service;
Refuse to search diligently for employment when the search is
reasonable and appropriate; recipients who unreasonably seek
work at the same places repeatedly will not be considered to be
performing a diligent work search and will be disqualified;
(2)
(3) Refuse to accept a suitable job offer;
Refuse to participate in an assigned training, education or
rehabilitation program that would assist the applicant in securing
employment;
(4)
(5) Fail to be available for work; or
Refuse to participate or participate in a substandard manner in the
municipal work program. (See § 102-23.)
(6)
C.
Ineligibility due to job quit or discharge for misconduct. No applicant,
whether an initial or repeat applicant, who has quit his or her full-time
or part-time job without just cause or who has been discharged from
employment for misconduct (see Appendix I,10 26 M.R.S.A. § 1043(23),
for the definition) will be eligible to receive general assistance of any
kind for a one-hundred-twenty-day period from the date of separation
from employment [22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4301(8) and 4316-A(1-A)].
D.
Just cause. Applicants will be ineligible for assistance for 120 days
if they refuse to comply with the work requirements of this section
without just cause. With respect to any work requirement, just cause
will be considered to exist when there is reasonable and verifiable
evidence that:
The applicant has a physical or mental illness or disability which
prevents him/her from working;
(1)
(2) The work assignment pays below minimum wages;
(3) The applicant was subject to sexual harassment;
E.
10.Editor's Note: Appendix I is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 102-22 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-22
85:246
The applicant is physically or mentally unable to perform required
job tasks, or to meet piece work standards;
(4)
The applicant has no means of transportation to or from work or a
training or rehabilitation program;
(5)
The applicant is unable to arrange for necessary child care or care
of ill or disabled family members; or
(6)
Any reason found to be good cause by the Maine Department of
Labor, or any other verifiable reason the administrator considers
reasonable and appropriate will be accepted as just cause [22
M.R.S.A. § 4316-A(5)].
(7)
Applicant's burden of establishing just cause. If the administrator finds
that the applicant has violated a work-related rule without just cause, it
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to establish the presence of
just cause (22 M.R.S.A. § 4316-A).
F.
Eligibility regained.
Persons who are disqualified for 120 days because they violated a
work requirement may regain their eligibility if and only when they
become employed or otherwise satisfy the administrator that they
are complying with the work requirement by fulfilling the work
requirement or requirements they violated.
(1)
For the purpose of regaining eligibility by becoming employed,
"employment" shall mean employment by an employer as defined
in 26 M.R.S.A. § 1043 et seq., or the performance of a service for
an employer who withholds from the employee a social security tax
pursuant to federal law.
(2)
The special provisions regarding the opportunity to regain
eligibility after a disqualification for workfare violations are
detailed in § 102-23 of this chapter, under "Eligibility Regained".
(3)
G.
Dependents.
Failure of an otherwise eligible person to comply with the work
requirements shall not affect the eligibility of any member of the
person's household who is not capable of working, including:
(a) A dependent minor child;
(b) An elderly, ill, or disabled person; and
A person whose presence is required in order to provide care
for any child under six years of age or for any ill or disabled
member of the household [22 M.R.S.A. § 4309(3)].

In the event that one (or more) member(s) of a household is
disqualified and assistance is requested for those remaining
members of the household who are dependents, the eligibility of

85:247
§ 102-23. Municipal work program.
Each applicant and any member of the household who is capable of working
may be required to perform work for the municipality, including work for a
nonprofit organization, as a condition of receiving assistance [22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4316-A(2)]. As part of the municipal work program, the municipality can
require recipients to participate in training, education, or rehabilitative
programs that will assist the recipient in securing employment. The work
requirement provisions found in § 102-22 regarding just cause, dependents,
and exemptions also apply to the municipal workfare program.
those dependents will be calculated by dividing the maximum level
of assistance available to the entire household by the total number
of household members.
Exemptions.
The above work requirements do not apply to any person who is
elderly, physically or mentally ill or disabled. Any person whose
presence is required to care for any pre-school age child or for any
ill or disabled member of the household is also exempt from these
requirements.
(1)
The requirements of this section will not be imposed so as to
interfere with an applicant's existing employment, ability to pursue
a bona fide job offer, ability to attend an interview for possible
employment, classroom participation in a primary or secondary
educational program intended to lead to a high school diploma,
classroom or on site participation in a training program which
is either approved by the Department of Labor or determined by
the Department of Labor to be expected to assist the applicant
in securing employment, or classroom participation in a degreegranting
program operated under the control of the Department of
Labor.
(2)
I.
Consent. Persons assigned to the work program are required to sign
a form stating that they understand the requirements of general
assistance and the work program. Prior to signing the form, the
administrator will read it to the applicants, or the applicants will read it
themselves. The form will also state the number of hours the applicants
must work and the hourly rate by means of which the duration of
the work assignment is calculated. In addition, the consent form shall
describe the consequences of failing to adequately perform part or all
of the workfare or workfare-first assignment.

Subtracting value of workfare performed from client's GA debt.
Pursuant to 22 M.R.S.A. § 4318, individuals owing the municipality
funds for general assistance provided to them are obligated to repay
the municipality when and if they become able. (See Article VIII.)
However, persons performing workfare shall have the value of the
workfare performed deducted from any and all GA debt, including GA
B.
§ 102-22 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-23
85:248
liens (e.g., workers' compensation settlement, SSI retroactive payment,
capital improvement, home mortgage) that might exist against their
settlements, payments or other such property.
Limitations. The work requirement is subject to the following
limitations [22 M.R.S.A. § 4316-A(3)].
No person shall, as a condition of eligibility, be required to do any
amount of work that exceeds the value of the net general assistance
that the person receives under municipal general assistance
standards. Any person performing work under this subsection shall
be provided with net general assistance, the value of which is
calculated at a rate of at least the prevailing minimum wage under
state or federal law at the time the workfare was performed.
(1)
No workfare participant shall be required to work for a nonprofit
organization if that work would violate the participant's basic
religious beliefs.
(2)
In no case shall eligible persons performing work under this
subsection replace regular municipal employees.
(3)
In no case will work performed under this subsection interfere with
an eligible person's:
(a) Existing employment;
(b) Ability to follow up on a bona fide job offer;
(c) Attendance at an interview for possible employment;
Classroom participation in a primary or secondary educational
program intended to lead to a high school diploma; or
(d)
Classroom or on-site participation in a training program which
is approved by the Department of Labor or determined by the
Department of Labor to be reasonably expected to assist the
person in securing employment, or classroom participation in
a degree-granting program administered by the DHHS or the
Department of Labor.
(e)
(4)
In no case may an eligible person be required to work more than
40 hours per week. An eligible person who has full- or part-time
employment shall be exempt from the work requirement to the
extent that the work requirement in combination with his or her
regular employment would result in the person working more than
40 hours per week.
(5)
In no case will an eligible person be required to perform work
beyond his or her capabilities. However, when an illness or
disability is claimed, an eligible person may be required as a
condition of receiving assistance to present a doctor's statement
detailing the extent of the disability or illness (22 M.R.S.A. § 4309).
(6)
C.
§ 102-23 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-23
85:249
If the administrator requires a doctor's statement to verify an
applicant's illness or disability and the applicant is not currently
under the care of a provider, the municipality may pay for the
doctor's evaluation if the applicant has no means to pay for the
exam. However, in such a case, the administrator will choose the
doctor. If there is a no-cost or low-cost health care option, the
municipality may elect to refer the client to such a resource. The
administrator will not require verification of medical conditions
which are apparent or which are of such short duration that a
reasonable person would not ordinarily seek medical attention [22
M.R.S.A. § 4316(5)].
In no case may an eligible person with an immediate need (i.e.,
a person in an emergency situation who has not been disqualified
from receiving assistance for committing a program violation) be
required to perform work under this subsection prior to receiving
general assistance. The administrator shall meet immediate needs
upon receiving written assurance from the eligible person that he/
she is willing to work to maintain eligibility for general assistance.
When the recipient has no immediate need, workfare participation
may be required prior to receiving general assistance in
accordance with the following "workfare first" policy.
(7)
"Workfare first" policy. Under the authority of 22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4316-A(2)(D), the administrator may, in accordance with the following
guidelines, require a recipient of general assistance to perform a
workfare assignment prior to the actual issuance of the general
assistance benefit conditionally granted.
In no circumstance will emergency general assistance for which
an applicant is eligible be withheld pending the satisfactory
performance of workfare.
(1)
All workfare participants under this policy will be provided a
written decision, as otherwise required by law, within 24 hours
of submitting an application for general assistance and prior to
performing any workfare for the municipality associated with that
request for assistance. That written decision must include:
A specific description of the amount of general assistance
being conditionally granted to the household, and for which
basic needs;
(a)
The period of eligibility for which the general assistance grant
is being issued (in days or weeks, but not to exceed 30 days);
(b)
The rate, at a dollar-per-hour basis (but not less than the
prevailing minimum wage), upon which the duration of the
workfare assignment is calculated;
(c)
(2)
D.
§ 102-23 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-23
85:250
The actual duration of the workfare assignment that must be
performed, in hours, before the general assistance grant will
be actually issued;
(d)
The specifics of the workfare assignment(s), including the
general nature of the type of work being assigned, location(s)
of work site, date(s) and time(s) of assigned workfare, workfare
supervisors' names and contact telephone numbers; and
(e)
Any other pertinent information related to the workfare
assignment(s) the recipient will be expected to perform.
(f)
As previously provided in this section, all workfare participants
under this policy must sign a consent form that informs the
participant of his or her workfare-related rights and
responsibilities, including the consequences of failing to perform
all or part of the workfare assigned without just cause.
(3)
If a portion of the workfare-first assignment is satisfactorily
performed but there has been a failure to perform the remainder
of the assignment, without just cause, the administrator shall issue
a grant of general assistance in the amount of the number of
workfare hours satisfactorily performed times the hourly rate used
to calculate the duration of the workfare assignment. In addition
to any disqualification penalty that may apply, the remaining value
of the conditionally issued general assistance grant shall be
terminated, and notice of the partial termination, and the reasons
therefor, will be issued to the workfare participant in accordance
with § 102-36 of this chapter.
(4)
Any amount of the workfare assignment that is not performed
because the workfare participant was temporarily unable to
perform the assignment for just cause reasons shall be reassigned
or excused at the discretion of the GA administrator.
(5)
Work-Related Expenses. A participant's expenses related to work
performed under this section will be added to the amount of net general
assistance to be provided to the person [22 M.R.S.A. § 4316-A(2)(E)].
The municipality will provide any special clothes or equipment the
recipient needs to perform his or her work assignment.
E.
Disqualification. Any person who either willfully fails to perform or
willfully performs below average standards the work assigned by the
municipality, will be ineligible for assistance for 120 days [22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4316-A(1)]. As soon as the administrator knows that a recipient failed
to fulfill the work assignment, the administrator will notify the recipient
in writing that he/she is disqualified for 120 days starting from the last
date of authorized assistance unless the recipient can show just cause.
The burden of demonstrating a just cause failure to perform a workfare
assignment falls on the workfare participant.
F.
§ 102-23 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-23
85:251
Eligibility regained. Recipients who are disqualified from receiving
assistance because they have violated the requirements of the
municipal work program may regain their eligibility under the following
conditions:
Recipients who fail to complete the first municipal work
assignment they have been given will be disqualified from receiving
assistance during the next 120 days, although dependents in the
household may be eligible. (See § 102-22, Dependents.)
(1)
If during the one-hundred-twenty-day disqualification period the
recipient requests an opportunity to perform the work assignment
which he or she, without just cause, failed to perform, the
disqualified recipient will be given one opportunity to regain
eligibility. The administrator will give the recipient a work
assignment as soon as possible.
(2)
If under such a set of circumstances the recipient has an
emergency need and the administrator is unable to schedule a
work assignment in time to alleviate the emergency, the
administrator will provide sufficient assistance to the recipient to
avert the emergency. However, the provision of such emergency
assistance will not bar the administrator from subsequently
enforcing the previously issued one-hundred-twenty-day
disqualification if the recipient fails to regain eligibility by
satisfactorily performing the work assignment. The amount of
emergency assistance granted will be considered in the
computation of the total number of hours the recipient must work.
(3)
Recipients who have asked for the opportunity to regain their
eligibility during a one-hundred-twenty-day disqualification period
and who agreed to fulfill the assignment which they previously
failed to perform and who, without just cause, fail to fulfill their
municipal work assignment will be considered to have acted in bad
faith. In such a circumstance, the administrator will enforce the
one-hundred-twenty-day disqualification for the term of its initial
duration.
(4)
If a workfare participant regains eligibility under this section but is
subsequently disqualified within the initial one-hundred-twenty-day
period of ineligibility for failing to comply with the municipal work
program, that participant will be ineligible for a new one-hundredtwenty-
day period beginning with the new disqualification date, but
will be provided no opportunity to requalify.
(5)
Any recipient who intentionally causes damage to property,
harasses or harms other employees or who otherwise conducts
themselves in a disruptive manner and is discharged by the work
supervisor will not be entitled to regain eligibility by returning
to the work program. Eligibility may be regained by otherwise
becoming employed and meeting the definition of need.
(6)
G.
§ 102-23 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-23
85:252
§ 102-24. Use of resources.
Each applicant has the responsibility to make a good-faith effort to utilize
every available or potential resource that may reduce his or her need for
general assistance. (See § 102-3 for the definition of "resources.") People
who refuse or fail to make a good-faith effort to secure a potential resource
after receiving written notice to do so are disqualified from receiving
assistance until they make an effort to secure the resource. Applicants are
required to prove that they have made a good-faith effort to secure the
resource (22 M.R.S.A. § 4317).
Reports. The administrator will itemize the assistance that has been
provided to persons who work for the municipality in reports to the
DHHS [22 M.R.S.A. § 4316-A(2)].
H.
Minors.
A minor under the age of 18 who has never married and is applying
independently for general assistance and who is pregnant or has
a dependent child or children will be eligible to receive general
assistance only if the minor is residing in the home of his or her
parent, legal guardian or other adult relative, in which case the
entire household will be evaluated for eligibility. Exceptions to this
limitation on eligibility will be made when:
The minor is residing in a foster home, maternity home, or
other adult-supervised supportive living arrangement; or
(a)
The minor has no living parent or the whereabouts of the both
parents are unknown; or
(b)
(c) No parent will permit the minor to live in the parent's home; or
The minor has lived apart from both parents for at least one
year before the birth of any dependent child; or
(d)
The DHHS determines that the physical or emotional health or
safety of the minor or the minor's dependent child or children
would be jeopardized if the minor and his or her child or
children lived with a parent; or
(e)
The DHHS determines, in accordance with its regulation, that
there is good cause to waive this limitation on eligibility [22
M.R.S.A. § 4309(4)].
(f)
(1)
Any person under the age of 25 who is applying independently
from his or her parents for general assistance will be informed
that until he or she reaches the age of 25, the applicant's parents
are still legally liable for his or her support and the municipality
has the right to seek recovery from the parents of the cost of all
assistance granted to such a recipient to the extent his or her
(2)
A.
§ 102-23 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-24
85:253
parents are financially capable of repaying the municipality (22
M.R.S.A. § 4319).
With regard to such application, the municipality may seek
verification of the applicant's need for general assistance by
contacting his or her parents. If the applicant's parents declare a
willingness to provide the applicant with his or her basic needs
directly, and there is no convincing evidence that the applicant
would be jeopardized by relying on his or her parents for basic
needs, the administrator may find the applicant not to be in need
of general assistance for the reason that his or her needs can be
provided by a legally liable relative.
(3)
Mental or physical disability. Any applicant who has a mental or
physical disability must make a good-faith effort to utilize any medical
or rehabilitative services which have been recommended by a
physician, psychologist or other professional retraining or
rehabilitation specialist when the services are available to the applicant
and would not constitute a financial burden or create a physical risk to
the individual.
B.
Written notice; disqualification. The administrator will give each
applicant written notice whenever the applicant is required to utilize
any specific potential resource(s). Any applicant who refuses to utilize
potential resources, without just cause, after receiving written sevenday
notice will be ineligible for further assistance until he/she has made
a good-faith effort to utilize or obtain the resources. General assistance
will not be withheld from the applicant pending receipt of a resource
if the applicant has made, or is in the process of making, a good-faith
effort to obtain the resource.
C.
Forfeiture of benefits.
Any applicant who forfeits receipt of or causes a reduction in
benefits from another public assistance program due to fraud,
misrepresentation, a knowing or intentional violation of program
rules or a refusal to comply with that program's rules without just
cause will be ineligible to receive general assistance to replace
the forfeited benefits. To the extent the forfeited benefits can be
considered income under general assistance law, the worth of the
forfeited benefits will be considered income that is available to the
applicant for the duration of the forfeiture.
(1)
To the extent the forfeited benefits were provided not in the form
of income but, rather, in the form of a specific, regularly issued
resource of a calculable value, that resource, up to its forfeited
value, need not be replaced with general assistance for a period
of 120 days from the date of the forfeiture, unless the municipality
is prohibited by federal or state law from considering the forfeited
resource as available with respect to local public assistance
programs (22 M.R.S.A. § 4317).
(2)
D.
§ 102-24 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-25
85:254
§ 102-25. Period of ineligibility.
No one will have his or her assistance terminated, reduced, or suspended
prior to being given written notice and an opportunity for a fair hearing (22
M.R.S.A. §§ 4321 through 4322). Each person will be notified in writing of
the reasons for his or her ineligibility, and any person disqualified for not
complying with the ordinance will be informed in writing of the period of
ineligibility.
§ 102-26. Unemployment fraud.
An applicant who is found ineligible for unemployment compensation
benefits because of a finding of fraud by the Department of Labor pursuant
to 26 M.R.S.A. § 1051(1) is ineligible to receive general assistance to
replace the forfeited unemployment compensation benefits for the duration
of the forfeiture established by the Department of Labor (22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4317).
Work requirement. Applicants/recipients who do not comply with a
work requirement are disqualified from receiving assistance for a
period of 120 days (unless they regain their eligibility). (See §§ 102-22
and 102-23.) If an applicant/recipient is provided assistance and does
not comply with the work requirement, the applicant/recipient shall
be disqualified for 120 days following the end of the period covered
by the grant of assistance. The administrator shall give recipients
written notice that they are disqualified as soon as the administrator
has sufficient knowledge and information to render a decision of
ineligibility.
A.
Fraud. People who commit fraud are disqualified from receiving
assistance for a period of 120 days. (See § 102-30, Fraud.) The
administrator shall give recipients written notice that they are
ineligible as soon as the administrator has sufficient knowledge and
information to render a decision. If the disqualification for fraud is
issued before the expiration of a grant of assistance, the period of
ineligibility shall commence on the day following the end of the period
covered by the grant of assistance. If fraud is discovered after the
period covered by the grant of assistance has expired, the period
of ineligibility will commence on the day of the written notice of
ineligibility.

§ 102-25 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-26
85:255

ARTICLE VI
Determination of Eligibility
§ 102-27. Recognition of dignity and rights.
Any determination or investigation into an applicant's eligibility will be
conducted in a manner that will not violate the applicant's privacy or
personal dignity or violate his or her individual rights.
§ 102-28. Determination; redetermination.
§ 102-29. Verification.
The administrator will make an individual, factual determination of
eligibility each time a person applies or reapplies for general
assistance. The administrator will make a redetermination of eligibility
at least monthly but may do so as often as necessary to administer the
program efficiently and meet the needs of the applicants. Upon any
application, the administrator will determine the applicant's eligibility
on the basis of a thirty-day prospective analysis, but may elect to
disburse that applicant's assistance periodically, e.g., weekly,
throughout a thirty-day period of eligibility pursuant to that initial
eligibility determination.
A.
The administrator may redetermine a person's eligibility at any time
during the period he or she is receiving assistance if the administrator
is notified of any change in the recipient's circumstances that may alter
the amount of assistance the recipient may receive. Once a recipient
has been granted assistance, the administrator may not reduce or
rescind the grant without giving prior written notice to the recipient
explaining the reasons for the decision and offering the recipient an
opportunity to appeal the decision to the fair hearing authority (22
M.R.S.A. § 4309).
B.
Eligibility of applicant; duration of eligibility. The overseer shall
determine eligibility each time a person applies or reapplies for general
assistance. The period of eligibility will not exceed one month. At
the expiration of this period applicants/recipients may reapply for
assistance and the person's eligibility will be redetermined.
A.
Applicant's responsibilities.
Applicants and recipients for general assistance are responsible for
providing to the overseer all information necessary to determine
eligibility. If further information or documentation is necessary
to demonstrate eligibility, the applicant must have the first
opportunity to provide the specific information or documentation
required by the overseer. When information required by the
overseer is unavailable, the overseer must accept alternative
available information, which is subject to verification.
(1)
B.
§ 102-27 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-29
85:257
Each applicant and recipient has the responsibility at the time
of application and continuing thereafter to provide complete,
accurate and current information and documentation concerning
his/her:
(a) Need.
(b) Income.
(c) Employment.
(d) Use of income.
(e) Expenses.
(f) Assets and liabilities.
(g) Use of available resources.
(h) Household composition.
(2)
Initial applicants. Persons who have not applied for assistance in this or
any other municipality are considered initial applicants and must have
their eligibility determined solely on the basis of need. Initial applicants
are not subject to eligibility conditions placed on repeat applicants (see
below). However, such applicants are still responsible for providing the
GA administrator with reasonably obtainable documentation adequate
to verify that there is a need for assistance. In addition, initial
applicants must also comply with both lump sum and relevant work
rules (e.g., job quit).
C.
Repeat Applicants.
All applicants for general assistance that are not initial applicants
are repeat applicants. The eligibility of repeat applicants must
be determined on the basis of need and all other conditions of
eligibility established by law and this municipal ordinance.
(1)
The administrator will require documentation of a repeat
applicant's income, use of income, assets and resources plus actual
bills and receipts for rent, utilities, fuel, telephone, medical
services and other basic necessities. In addition, repeat applicants
instructed to seek employment shall verify their work search
results, e.g., provide a list of the employers contacted, the date
and time of the application contact, and the name of the employer
representative contacted, as required by the GA administrator.
(2)
Repeat applicants are also responsible for providing any changes
of information reported on previous applications including changes
in his/her household or income that may affect his/her eligibility.
(3)
D.
Unforeseen repeat applicants. Unforeseen repeat applicants are
applicants who have not applied for assistance within the last 12
months and who have been regularly employed or receiving support
E.
§ 102-29 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-29
85:258
from a public benefit or private source who have unexpectedly become
unemployed through no fault of their own or whose income and/or
benefits (e.g., through an available resource) have ceased through
no fault of their own. Such unforeseen repeat applicants may be
considered initial applicants for purposes of verification requirements
and misspent income if the administrator finds that imposing the
general verification requirements and misspent income rules imposed
on repeat applicants would be unreasonable or inappropriate.
Overseer's responsibilities.
In order to determine an applicant's eligibility for general
assistance, the overseer first must seek information and
documentation from the applicant. Once the applicant has
presented the necessary information, the overseer is responsible
for determining eligibility. The overseer will seek verification
necessary to determine eligibility. In order to determine eligibility,
the overseer may contact sources other than the applicant for
verification only with the specific knowledge and consent of the
applicant, except that the overseer may examine public records
without the applicant's knowledge and consent.
(1)
Appropriate sources, which the overseers may contact, include, but
are not limited to:
DHHS and any other department/agency of the state or
nonprofit organizations.
(a)
(b) Financial institutions.
(c) Creditors.
(d) Utility companies.
(e) Employers.
(f) Landlords.
(g) Physicians.
(h) Persons with whom the applicant/recipient is a cohabitant.
(i) Legally and nonlegally liable relatives.
(2)
Assistance will be denied or terminated if the applicant is unwilling
to supply the overseer with necessary information, documentation,
or permission to make collateral contacts, or if the overseer cannot
determine that eligibility exists based on information supplied by
the applicant or others.
(3)
F.
Redetermination of eligibility. The overseer may redetermine a person's
eligibility at any time during the period that person is receiving
assistance if the overseer is informed of any change in the recipient's
circumstances that may affect the amount of assistance to which the
G.
§ 102-29 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-29
85:259
§ 102-30. Fraud.
recipient is entitled or that may make the recipient ineligible, provided
that once a determination of eligibility has been made for a specific
time period, a reduction in assistance for that time period may not be
made without prior written notice to the recipient with the reasons for
the action and an opportunity for the recipient to receive a fair hearing
upon the proposed change.
Penalty for refusing to release information. Any person governed by
22 M.R.S.A. § 4314 who refuses to provide necessary information to
the administrator after it has been requested must state in writing
the reasons for the refusal within three days of receiving the request.
Any such person who refuses to provide the information, without just
cause, commits a civil violation and may be subject to a fine of not
less than $25 nor more than $100, which may be adjudged in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Any person who willfully renders false
information to the administrator is guilty of a Class E crime [22
M.R.S.A. §§ 4314(5), 4314(6) and 4315].
H.
It is unlawful for a person to make knowingly and willfully a false
representation of a material fact to the administrator in order to receive
general assistance or cause someone else to receive general assistance
(22 M.R.S.A. § 4315).
False representation shall consist of any individual knowingly and
willfully:
Making a false statement to the general assistance
administrator, either orally or in writing, in order to obtain
assistance to which the applicant or the applicant's household
is not entitled;
(a)
Concealing information from the general assistance
administrator in order to obtain assistance to which the
applicant or applicant's household is not entitled; or
(b)
Using general assistance benefits for a purpose other than that
for which they were intended.
(c)
(1)
No person may be denied assistance solely for making a false
representation prior to being given an opportunity for a fair
hearing.
(2)
A.
Period of Ineligibility.
When the general assistance administrator finds that a person
has knowingly and willfully misrepresented material facts for the
purpose of making himself or herself eligible for general
assistance, the administrator shall notify that applicant in writing
that he or she has been disqualified from receiving assistance
for 120 days. For the purpose of this section, a material
(1)
B.
§ 102-29 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-30
85:260
§ 102-31. Period of eligibility.
misrepresentation is a false statement about eligibility factor in the
absence of which some or all of the assistance would not be or
would not have been granted.
The notification of ineligibility issued by the administrator shall
inform the applicant of his or her right to appeal the
administrator's decision to the fair hearing authority (FHA) within
five working days of receipt. The period of ineligibility shall
commence on the day following the end of the period covered by
the grant of assistance fraudulently received or upon the date of
notification of ineligibility, whichever is later.
(2)
Right to a fair hearing. Any applicant who is denied assistance for
making a false representation will be afforded the opportunity to appeal
the decision to the fair hearing authority (FHA) in accordance with
Article VII of this chapter. No recipient shall have his or her assistance
reduced or revoked during the period of eligibility before being notified
and given the opportunity to appeal the decision. Any person who is
dissatisfied with the decision of the FHA may appeal that decision to
the Superior Court pursuant to Rule 80-B of the Maine Rules of Civil
Procedure [22 M.R.S.A. § 4309(3)].
C.
Reimbursement. If a recipient does not appeal the decision or if the
fair hearing authority determines that a recipient did make a false
representation, the recipient will be required to reimburse the
municipality for any assistance received to which he/she was not
entitled.
D.
Dependents. In no event will the ineligibility of a person under this
section serve to disqualify any eligible dependent in that household
[22 M.R.S.A. § 4309(3)]. In the event that one or more members of
a household are disqualified and assistance is requested for the
remaining dependents, the eligibility of those dependents will be
calculated by dividing the maximum level of assistance available to the
entire household by the total number of household members.
E.
The administrator will grant assistance to all eligible persons for a
period that is sufficient to meet their need but in no event may a
grant of assistance cover a period in excess of one month (22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4309). Upon receiving a completed and signed application the
administrator will determine the applicant's eligibility on the basis of a
thirty-day prospective analysis.
A.
When an applicant submits an incomplete or unsigned application,
due to the twenty-four-hour decision requirement placed on the GA
administrator, the GA administrator shall render a notice of ineligibility
and advise the applicant that he or she has a right to reapply as soon as
he or she has the necessary information and/or as soon as is practicable
for the applicant.
B.
§ 102-30 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-31
85:261
§ 102-32. Determination of need.
Although eligibility is determined on a thirty-day basis, for reasons
of administrative efficiency the administrator may elect to disburse
an applicant's assistance for shorter periods of time, such as weekly,
throughout the thirty-day period of eligibility. When the administrator
elects to disburse general assistance for a period of time less than
30 days, subsequent grants of assistance during that thirty-day period
may be issued pursuant to the initial determination of need unless the
applicant's financial situation changes substantially enough to warrant
a redetermination of eligibility.
C.
Calculation.
The period of time used to calculate need will be the next thirtyday
period from the date of application [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(7)]. The
administrator will calculate applicants' expenses according to the
actual expense of the basic necessity or the maximum levels for the
specific necessities allowed in § 102-34, whichever is less. The sum
of these expenses, as calculated for a prospective thirty-day period,
is the applicant's thirty-day need. Applicants will not be considered
eligible if their income and other resources exceed this calculation
except in an emergency [22 M.R.S.A. § 4308(2)]. (See § 102-15 of
this chapter.)
(1)
Applicants will also not be considered in need of general assistance
if their income, property, credit, assets or other resources available
to provide basic necessities for their household are greater than
the applicable overall maximum level of assistance set forth in
the beginning of § 102-34 [22 M.R.S.A. §§ 4301(10) and 4305(3-B)].
The difference between the applicant's income and the overall
maximum levels of assistance established by this chapter is the
applicant's deficit.
(2)
Once an applicant's deficit has been determined, the specific
maximum levels of assistance for each basic necessity (see
Appendixes A through H11 of this chapter) shall be used by the
administrator to guide the distribution of assistance for which the
applicant is eligible. The specific maximum levels of assistance for
each basic necessity are intended to be reasonable and sufficient
to help recipients maintain a standard of health and decency [22
M.R.S.A. § 4305(3-A)].
(3)
A.
Income for basic necessities. Applicants are required to use their
income for basic necessities. Except for initial applicants, no applicant
is eligible to receive assistance to replace income that was spent within
the thirty-day period prior to an application for assistance on goods and
services that are not basic necessities. All income spent on goods and
services that are not basic necessities will be considered available to
B.
11.Editor's Note: Said appendixes are included as attachments to this chapter.
§ 102-31 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-32
85:262
the applicant and combined with the applicant's prospective thirty-day
income for the purposes of computing eligibility (22 M.R.S.A. § 4315-A).
Applicants who have sufficient income to provide their basic necessities
but who use that income to purchase goods or services which are not
basic necessities will not be considered eligible for assistance. Persons
who exhaust their income on basic necessities and who still need
assistance with other basic necessities will be eligible, provided that
their income does not exceed the overall maximum level of assistance.
Use-of-income requirements.
The administrator may require that anyone applying for general
assistance provide documentation of his or her use of income.
This documentation can take the form of cancelled checks and/or
receipts which demonstrate that the applicant has exhausted all
household income received over the last thirty-day period. Except
as is deemed appropriate by the GA administrator for "unforeseen"
repeat applicants (see § 102-29 of this chapter), repeat applicants
may be required to verify that expenditure of income was for basic
necessities. Income expended that cannot be verified will generally
be considered available and in such case will be added to the thirtyday
prospective income.
(1)
Allowable expenditures include reasonable shelter costs (rent/
mortgage); the cost of heating fuel, electricity, and food up to
the ordinance maximums; telephone costs at the base rate if the
household needs a telephone for medical reasons; the cost of
nonelective medical services as recommended by a physician which
are not otherwise covered by medical entitlement; hospital free
care or insurance; the reasonable cost of essential clothing and
nonprescription drugs; and the costs of any other commodity or
service determined essential by the administrator.
(2)
Items not considered to be basic necessities and thus will not be
allowed in the budget computation include:
(a) Internet services.
(b) Cable or satellite television.
(c) Cellular phones.
(d) Cigarettes/alcohol.
(e) Gifts purchased.
(f) Pet care costs.
(g) Costs of trips or vacations.
(h) Paid court fines.
(i) Repayments of unsecured loans.
(3)
C.
§ 102-32 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-32
85:263
(j) Legal fees.
(k) Late fees.
(l) Credit card debt.
The municipality reserves the right to apply specific use-of-income
requirements to any applicant, other than an initial applicant, who
fails to use his or her income for basic necessities or fails to
reasonably document his or her use of income (22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4315-A). Those additional requirements will be applied in the
following manner:
The administrator may require the applicant to use some or all
of his or her income, at the time it becomes available, toward
specific basic necessities. The administrator may prioritize
such required expenditures so that most or all of the
applicant's income is applied to housing (i.e., rent/mortgage),
energy (i.e., heating fuel, electricity), or other specified basic
necessities;
(a)
The administrator will notify applicants in writing of the
specific use-of-income requirements placed on them;
(b)
If upon subsequent application it cannot be determined how
the applicant's income was spent, or it is determined that some
or all of the applicant's income was not spent as directed
and was also not spent on basic necessities, the applicant will
not be eligible to receive either regular or emergency general
assistance to replace that income; and
(c)
If the applicant does not spend his or her income as directed,
but can show with verifiable documentation that all income
was spent on basic necessities up to allowed amounts, the
applicant will remain eligible to the extent of the applicant's
eligibility and need.
(d)
(4)
Calculation of income and expenses.
When determining eligibility, the administrator will subtract the
applicant's net income from the overall maximum level of
assistance found at the beginning of § 102-34. If income is greater
than the overall maximum level of assistance, the applicant will not
be eligible except in an emergency. (See § 102-15.) If income is less
than the overall maximum level of assistance, the applicant has a
deficit.
(1)
The municipality will provide assistance in an amount up to the
deficit to the extent the applicant also has an unmet need and is in
need of basic necessities. The municipality will not grant assistance
in excess of the maximum amounts allowed in § 102-34 of this
chapter for specific basic necessities except in an emergency or
(2)
D.
§ 102-32 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-32
85:264
§ 102-33. Income.
when the administrator elects to consolidate the applicant's deficit,
as provided immediately below.
Consolidation of deficit. As a general rule and to the extent of their
deficit, applicants will be eligible for assistance for any basic necessity
up to, but not exceeding, the maximum amount allowed for that
necessity in this chapter or the actual thirty-day cost of the necessity,
whichever is less. Under certain circumstances, however, and in
accordance with the following conditions, the administrator may
consolidate the applicant's deficit and apply it toward a basic necessity
in an amount greater than the ordinance maximum for that necessity.
The practice of consolidating the deficit and applying it toward a
basic necessity in amounts greater than the ordinance maximum
shall be the exception rather than the rule;
(1)
The total general assistance grant cannot exceed the total deficit
unless the applicant is in an emergency situation; and
(2)
The need for the application of the recipient's consolidated deficit
toward a basic necessity was not created by the recipient's
misspending his or her income or resources in violation of the useof-
income requirements of this chapter.
(3)
E.
Income standards. Applicants whose income exceeds the overall
maximum level of assistance provided in § 102-34 shall not be eligible
for general assistance except in an emergency. The administrator will
conduct an individual factual inquiry into the applicant's income and
expenses each time an applicant applies.
A.
Calculation of income.
To determine whether applicants are in need, the administrator
will calculate the income they will receive during the next thirtyday
period commencing on the date of application and identify
any assets or resources that would alleviate their need. For all
applicants other than initial applicants, the administrator will also
consider as available income any income that was not spent during
the previous thirty-day period on basic necessities, as well as any
income that was spent on basic necessities in unreasonable excess
of the ordinance maximums for specific basic necessities. If a
household's income exceeds the amount of the household's need for
basic necessities, up to the maximum levels contained in § 102-34,
applicants will not be considered in need.
(1)
Exceptions will be made in emergency situations, which may
necessitate that the maximum levels be exceeded (22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4308). (See § 102-15 of this chapter.) To calculate weekly income
and expenses, the administrator will use actual income received or
actual anticipated income.
(2)
B.
§ 102-32 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-33
85:265
Types of income. Income that will be considered in determining an
applicant's need includes:
Earned income. Income in cash or in kind earned by the applicant
through wages, salary, commissions, or profit, whether selfemployed
or as an employee, is considered earned income. If a
person is self-employed, total income will be computed by
subtracting reasonable and actual business expenses from gross
income. When income consists of wages, the amount computed
will be the income available after taxes, social security and other
payroll deductions required by state, federal, and local law. Rental
income and profit from produce that is sold is considered earned
income. Income that is held in trust and unavailable to the
applicant or the applicant's dependents will not be considered
as earned income. (NOTE: Actual work-related expenses such as
union dues, transportation to and from work, special equipment
or work clothes, and child care costs will be deducted from an
applicant's income [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(7)].)
(1)
Income from other assistance or social services programs.
State/federal categorical assistance benefits, SSI payments,
social security payments, VA benefits, unemployment
insurance benefits, and payments from other government
sources will be considered as income, unless expressly
prohibited by federal law or regulation. Federal law prohibits
food stamps and fuel assistance payments made by the Home
Energy Assistance Program (HEAP and ECIP) from being
considered income. The value of the food stamps or fuel
assistance will not be used to reduce the amount of general
assistance the applicant is eligible to receive. Although
applicants may have only a limited or reduced need for general
assistance for heating fuel or electricity if a recently received
HEAP/ECIP benefit has sufficiently credited their account or
otherwise prevented the fuel-related costs for the prospective
thirty-day period.
(a)
The administrator's obligation is to always compute the
heating needs of an applicant who has received HEAP or ECIP
as if that applicant paid for his or her total fuel costs.
Accordingly, in such cases, the administrator will budget for
the household's heating energy needs according to actual
usage, up to the ordinance maximums, but the administrator
may, with written notice to the applicant, hold in reserve the
heating energy portion of the applicant's deficit until such a
time during the period of eligibility that the applicant has a
demonstrable need for the disbursement of heating energy
assistance; that is, the applicant's fuel tank can accept a
minimum fuel delivery or the applicant no longer has a positive
credit balance with his or her utility company. The municipality
is not obligated to divert any recipient's heating energy
(b)
(2)
C.
§ 102-33 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-33
85:266
allowance toward non-heating purposes solely on the basis of
the recipient's receipt of HEAP/ECIP.
Other programs whose income cannot be counted for purposes
of GA eligibility include:
[1] Family development accounts (22 M.R.S. § 3762).
[2] Americorp VISTA program benefits [42 USCS § 5044(f)].
Property tax rebates issued under the Maine Property Tax
Fairness Credit program, only so long as the money is
spent on basic necessities [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(7)].
[3]
(c)
Court-ordered support payments. Alimony and child support
payments will be considered income only if actually received by
the applicant. The general assistance administrator will refer cases
where support payments are not actually received to the State
Department of Health and Human Services' Child Support
Enforcement Unit. In order to be eligible for future GA, applicants
being referred to DHHS for such enforcement services shall be
required to follow through with such services. Because child
support payments are considered a resource, applicants must make
a good-faith effort to secure such payments.
(3)
Income from other sources. Payments from pensions and trust
funds will be considered income. Payments from boarders or
lodgers will be considered income as will cash or in-kind
contributions provided to the household from any other source,
including relatives [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(7)].
(4)
Earnings of a son or daughter. Earned income received by sons
and daughters below the age of 18 who are full-time students and
who are not working full time will not be considered income. The
unearned income of a minor in the household will be considered
available to the household.
(5)
Income from household members. Income from household
members will be considered available to the applicant, whether or
not the household member is legally obligated for the support of
the applicant, if the household members pool or share their income
and expenses as a family or intermingle their funds so as to provide
support to one another.
(6)
The pooling or non-pooling of income.
When two or more individuals share the same dwelling unit
but not all members of the household are applying for general
assistance, the administrator shall make a finding under a
rebuttable presumption that the entire household is pooling
income [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(12-A)].
(a)
(7)
§ 102-33 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-33
85:267
One or more applicants for assistance can successfully rebut
the presumption that all household income is being pooled
by providing the administrator with verifiable documentation
affirmatively demonstrating a pattern of non-pooling for the
duration of the shared living arrangement. Such
documentation would include evidence of the entire household
expenses as well as bank statements, cancelled checks,
receipts, landlord statements or other vendor accounts clearly
supporting a claim that the applicant has been and is presently
solely and entirely responsible for his or her pro-rata share of
household costs.
(b)
If the applicant is unable to successfully rebut the
municipality's presumption that all household income is being
pooled, eligibility of the entire household will be determined
based on total household income. If the applicant successfully
rebuts the municipality's presumption that all household
income is being pooled, the applicant's eligibility will be
determined on the basis of his or her income and his or her
pro-rata share of actual household expenses.
(c)
Lump sum income.
A lump sum payment received by any GA applicant or recipient
prior or subsequent to the date of application for general
assistance will be considered as income available to the
household. However, verified required payments (i.e., any
third-party payment which is required as a condition of
receiving the lump sum payment, or any payments of bills
earmarked for the purpose for which the lump sum payment
was made) and any amount of the lump sum payment which
the applicant can document was spent on basic necessities, as
described below, will not be considered available income.
(a)
Where a household receives a lump sum payment at any time
prior or subsequent to the date of application for general
assistance, the administrator will assess the need for prorating
an applicant's eligibility for general assistance according to the
following criteria [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(7) and (8-A)]:
[1] Identify the date the lump sum payment was received;
Subtract from the lump sum payment all required
payments;
[2]
Subtract from the lump sum any amount the applicant
can demonstrate was spent on basic necessities, including
all basic necessities as defined by the general assistance
program, such as reasonable payment of funeral or burial
expenses for a family member; any reasonable travel costs
related to the illness or death of a family member; repair
or replacement of essentials lost due to fire, flood or other

natural disaster; repair or purchase of a motor vehicle
essential for employment, education, training or other dayto-
day living necessities. Repayments of loans or credit,
the proceeds of which can be verified as having been spent
on basic necessities, and payment of bills earmarked for
the purpose for which the lump sum is paid must also be
subtracted [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301(7), (8-A)];
Add to the remainder all income received by the household
between the date of receipt of the lump sum payment and
the date of application for general assistance; and
[4]
Divide the sum created in Subsection C(8)(b)[4] by the
verified actual monthly amounts for all of the household's
basic necessities [22 M.R.S.A. § 4305(3-B)].
[5]
This dividend represents the period of proration determined by
the administrator to commence on the date of receipt of the
lump sum payment. The prorated sum for each month must be
considered available to the household for 12 months from the
date of application or during the period of proration, whichever
is less.
(c)
The household of an initial applicant that is otherwise eligible
for emergency assistance may not be denied emergency
assistance to meet an immediate need solely on the basis of the
proration of a lump sum payment (22 M.R.S.A. § 4308).
(d)
Overall maximum levels of assistance.
Notwithstanding any of the maximum levels of assistance for
specific basic necessities listed in Appendices B through H12 of
this chapter, an applicant's eligibility for general assistance will
be first determined by subtracting his or her income from the
overall maximum level of assistance designated in Appendix A13
for the applicable household size [22 M.R.S.A. § 4305 (3-B)]. The
difference yielded by this calculation shall be the applicant's
deficit.
(1)
Applicants will be eligible for general assistance up to the
calculated deficit to the extent the applicant is unable to otherwise
provide the basic necessities essential to maintain themselves or
their families. Applicants with no deficit shall be found ineligible for
general assistance unless they are in an emergency, in which case
eligibility for emergency general assistance will be determined
according to § 102-15 of this chapter.

§ 102-33 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-34
85:269
Maximum levels of assistance for specific basic necessities.
The municipality will grant assistance to eligible applicants for
basic necessities according to the maximum levels for specific
types of assistance set forth below. The administrator, in
consultation with the applicant, may apply the amount of the
applicant's deficit toward assistance with any one or combination
of necessities not to exceed the total deficit. These maximum levels
will be strictly adhered to unless the administrator determines
that there are exceptional circumstances and an emergency is
shown to exist, in which case these absolute levels will be waived
in order to meet immediate needs. In all cases either the actual
expenses the applicant incurs for basic necessities or the maximum
amount allowed in each category, whichever is less, will be used in
determining need.
In roommate situations, the applicant's need for common living
expenses for rent, fuel, electricity, etc., will be presumed to be
reduced by an amount equal to the other household members'
proportionate fair share of the common living expenses. No
applicant will be allowed to claim a need for any expense which
has been or will be paid by another person. In addition, as a
general rule the municipality will not provide a benefit toward
a basic need by paying a bill that is issued to a person not
living with the applicant's household or that has otherwise
been incurred by a person who has not been found eligible to
receive assistance.
(a)
Temporary exceptions to this general rule may be made by the
administrator in the following circumstances:
A recent, unplanned separation has occurred in the
household resulting in the sustained or permanent
absence of a former household member in whose name the
bill was customarily issued;
[1]
The applicant and members of the applicant's household
were or will be the sole recipients of the commodities or
services covered by any bill to be paid or partially paid
with general assistance; and
[2]
The applicant will make a good-faith effort to direct the
vendor to issue future bills in the name of the applicant or
other responsible person residing in the household.
[3]
(b)
(1)
Food.
The administrator will provide food assistance to eligible
persons up to the allowed maximum amounts designated by
the U.S.D.A. Thrifty Food Plan for the appropriate household
size. For this purpose, the municipality hereby incorporates by
reference the U.S.D.A. Thrifty Food Plan, as distributed by the
(a)
(2)
B.
§ 102-34 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-34
85:270
Maine Department of Health and Human Services on or about
October of each year. See Appendix B14 of this chapter for the
current year's food maximums.
In determining need for food the administrator will not
consider the value of the food stamps an applicant receives
as income [22 M.R.S.A. § 4301.7(A); 7 U.S.C. § 2017(b)]. The
municipality will authorize vouchers to be used solely for
approved food products.
(b)
The administrator will exceed the maximums when necessary
for households having members with special dietary needs.
The administrator may require a doctor's statement verifying
there is a special dietary need requiring an expenditure for
food that is greater than the ordinance maximums.
(c)
Housing. The administrator will provide assistance with rent or
mortgage payments that are reasonable and/or within the allowed
maximum levels. See Appendix C15 of this chapter for the current
year's housing maximums. It is the applicant's responsibility to
find suitable housing, although the administrator may help the
applicant find housing when appropriate. The administrator will
inform the applicant of the allowed housing maximums to assist the
applicant in his or her search for housing. The allowed maximum
for any applicant will be the categorical housing maximum
representing the minimum dwelling unit space necessary to
adequately shelter the applicant household. Applicants requesting
assistance for housing that contains more bedrooms than are
necessary for the number of household members will be provided
assistance according to the maximum level for the number of rooms
actually needed.
Rental payments to relatives. The municipality may elect to
not issue any rental payment to an applicant's relatives unless
the rental relationship has existed for at least three months
and the applicant's relative(s) rely on the rental payment for
their basic needs. For the purpose of this section, a "relative"
is defined as the applicant's parents, grandparents, children,
grandchildren, siblings, parent's siblings, or any of those
relative's children [22 M.R.S.A. § 4319(2)].
(a)
Rental payments to nonrelatives.
When applicants are living in private homes with the
owner or sharing dwelling units with people who are not
pooling income or who are not legally liable relatives,
the amount allowed as the applicant's shelter expense
will be the applicant's pro rata share of the actual, total
[1]

15.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 102-34 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-34
85:271
shelter cost, up to the ordinance maximum [22 M.R.S.A.
§ 4301(6)].
Any housing assistance issued to a recipient in such a
circumstance will be issued, whenever reasonably
possible, to the landlord or property owner with the most
superior interest in the property; i.e., to a landlord before
a tenant, or to a mortgagee before a mortgagor.
[2]
When the municipality issues in aggregate more than $600
in rental payments to any landlord in any calendar year, a
1099 form declaring the total amount of rental payments
issued during the calendar year will be forwarded to the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to IRS regulation.
(See § 6041(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.)
[3]
Any landlord wishing to regularly receive rental payments
from the municipality on behalf of applicants renting
rooms from the landlord's own residence must, at a
minimum, make a good-faith effort to obtain a lodging
license from the Department of Health and Human
Services, Division of Health Engineering, pursuant to
10-144A Code of Maine Regulations, Chapter 201, as a
condition of that landlord receiving future general
assistance payments on behalf of his or her tenants.
[4]
Mortgage payments.
In the case of a request for assistance with a mortgage
payment, the general assistance administrator will make
an individual factual determination of whether the
applicant has an immediate need for such aid. In making
this determination, the administrator will consider the
extent and liquidity of the applicant's proprietary interest
in the housing. Factors to consider in making this
determination include:
[a] The marketability of the shelter's equity;
[b] The amount of equity;
The availability of the equity interest in the shelter to
provide the applicant an opportunity to secure a shortterm
loan in order to meet immediate needs;
[c]
The extent to which liquidation may aid the applicant's
financial rehabilitation;
[d]
A comparison between the amount of mortgage
obligations and the anticipated rental charges the
applicant would be responsible for if he/she were to be
dislocated to rental housing;
[e]
[1]
(c)
§ 102-34 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-34
85:272
The imminence of the applicant's dislocation from
owned housing because of his or her inability to meet
the mortgage payments;
[f]
The likelihood that the provision of housing assistance
will prevent such dislocation; and
[g]
[h] The applicant's age, health, and social situation.
These factors shall be considered when determining
whether the equity in the shelter is an available asset
which may be substituted for the assistance the
municipality would otherwise be required to provide.
[2]
The administrator shall consider issuing a benefit in
response to the applicant's request for mortgage
assistance to the extent the applicant is otherwise eligible
for general assistance if after reviewing the above criteria
the administrator determines that:
The monthly mortgage obligation is in accordance
with the maximum levels of assistance available for
housing appropriate to the applicant's household size;
[a]
There is no capacity in the accumulated equity in
the property, when considered in the context of the
applicant's borrowing capacity with the mortgagee or
the general lending community, to suspend the
mortgage obligation temporarily or reamortize the
mortgage in such a way as to suspend or reduce the
mortgage obligation; and
[b]
The failure to provide a mortgage payment in a timely
manner could jeopardize the applicant's continued
right of possession of the property.
[c]
[3]
If a mortgage payment is necessary, the administrator will
pay the actual amount due, up to the amount allowed
according to the maximum levels listed below. After an
initial application, assistance with such payments will be
given only after the applicant has made all reasonable
efforts to borrow against the equity of his or her home.
If there is not sufficient equity in the home with which
to secure a loan, and if the monthly mortgage payments
are not realistically in line with the rental rates for similar
housing in the area that could meet the applicant's needs,
the administrator will inform the applicant that he/she
is responsible for finding alternative housing within his
or her ability to pay and will be obligated to make all
reasonable efforts to secure such housing.
[4]
(d) Liens.
§ 102-34 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-34
85:273
The municipality may place a lien on the property in order
to recover its costs of granting assistance with mortgage
payments. In addition, a municipality may claim a lien
against the owner of real estate for the amount of money
spent by it to make capital improvements to the real estate
(22 M.R.S.A. § 4320). No lien may be enforced against
a recipient except upon his or her death or the transfer
of the property. Further, no lien may be enforced against
a person who is currently receiving any form of public
assistance, or who would again become eligible for general
assistance if the lien were enforced.
[1]
If the municipality determines that it is appropriate to
place a lien on a person's property to recover its costs of
providing general assistance for a mortgage payment or
capital improvement it must file a notice of the lien with
the county registry of deeds where the property is located
within 30 days of making the mortgage payment. That
filing shall secure the municipality's or the state's interest
in an amount equal to the sum of that mortgage or capital
improvement payment and all subsequent mortgage or
capital improvement payments made on behalf of the same
eligible person, plus interest and costs.
[2]
Not less than 10 days prior to filing the lien in the registry,
the municipal officers must send notice to the owner of
the real estate, the general assistance recipient, and any
record holder of the mortgage by certified mail, return
receipt requested, that a lien on the property is going to
be filed with the registry. This notice must clearly inform
the recipient of the limitations upon enforcement plus the
name, title, address and telephone number of the person
who granted the assistance. The municipal officers must
also give written notice to the recipient each time the
amount secured by the lien is increased because of an
additional mortgage payment. This notice must include the
same information that appeared on the original intent-tofile
notice sent to the recipient.
[3]
The municipality may charge interest on the amount of
money secured by the lien. The municipal officers will
establish the interest rate not to exceed the maximum rate
of interest allowed by the State Treasurer to be charged
against delinquent taxes. The interest will accrue from the
date the lien is filed.
[4]
Property Taxes. In the event that an applicant requests
assistance with his or her property taxes, the administrator
will inform the applicant that there are two procedures on the
local level to request that relief: the poverty abatement process
[36 M.S.R.A. § 841(2)] and general assistance. If the applicant
(e)
§ 102-34 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-34
85:274
chooses to seek property tax assistance through general
assistance, or if the applicant is denied a poverty tax
abatement, the administrator may consider using general
assistance to meet this need only if:
The property tax in question is for the applicant's place of
residence;
[1]
There is a tax lien on the property which is due to mature
within 60 days of the date of application;
[2]
As a matter of municipal policy or practice, or on the basis
of information obtained from the applicant's mortgagee,
if any, it is reasonably certain that a tax lien foreclosure
will result in subsequent eviction from the residential
property; and
[3]
The applicant, with sufficient notice, applies for property
tax relief through the Maine Property Tax Fairness Credit
program, when available.
[4]
Housing maximums.
The maximum levels of housing assistance contained in
this chapter have been derived either from a locally
accomplished fair market rental survey or the fair market
rental values developed by the United States Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). If the
maximum levels of housing are derived from the HUD
values made effective as of every October 1 and adjusted
to disregard the current and averaged utility allowances
as developed by the Maine State Housing Authority, those
levels are hereby incorporated by reference. See Appendix
C16 of this chapter for the current year's housing
maximums.
[1]
If and when the maximum levels of housing contained
in this chapter are derived from a locally developed fair
market rental survey, a record of that survey will be
submitted to the DHHS, General Assistance Unit, and the
maximum levels of housing assistance will be incorporated
into this chapter pursuant to the ordinance adoption and
amendment procedures found at 22 M.R.S.A. § 4305.

Utilities.
General.
Expenses for lights, cooking, and hot water will be
budgeted separately if they are not included in the rent.

16.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 102-34 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-34
85:275
Applicants are responsible for making arrangements with
the utility company regarding service, including entering
into a special payment arrangement if necessary.
Assistance will be granted to eligible applicants on the
basis of their most recent bill. The municipality is not
obligated to pay back bills or utility security deposits.
Exceptions may be made in emergency situations pursuant
to § 102-15.
[2]
Disconnection of utility service will not be considered an
emergency in all cases. The administrator will make an
individual, factual analysis to determine if the termination
of utility service constitutes an emergency. The
administrator will consider the household composition, the
time of year, the age and health of the household members,
and other appropriate factors in reaching a decision.
Applicants who had sufficient income, money, assets or
other resources to pay their utility bill when it was
received, but who spent all or part of their income on items
which were not basic necessities, will not be eligible to
receive general assistance to replace those funds.
[3]
Applicants have the burden of providing evidence of their
income and use of income for the applicable time period
[22 M.R.S.A. § 4308(2)]. (See §§ 102-15 and 102-29.) The
administrator will notify applicants in writing that they
must give the administrator prompt notice if their utility
service is to be terminated or if their fuel supply is low.
It is the applicant's responsibility to attempt to make
arrangements with the utility company to maintain their
service and to notify the administrator if assistance is
needed with a utility bill prior to service being terminated.

Electricity.
Electricity maximums for households without electric hot
water. See Appendix D17 of this chapter for the current
year's electricity maximums.

Electricity maximums for households that use electrically
heated hot water. See Appendix D18 of this chapter for the
current year's electricity maximums.

Nonelectric utilities. The allowed amount for water and sewer
utility service will be budgeted at a thirty-day reasonable
usage rate.

§ 102-34 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-34
85:276
Expenses for home heating will be budgeted according to the
actual need for fuel during the heating season (September
through May), provided that such expenses are reasonable,
and at other times during the year when the administrator
determines the request for fuel assistance is reasonable and
appropriate.
(a)
Assistance will be granted to eligible applicants on the basis
of their most recent bill. The municipality is not responsible
for back bills except in an emergency as provided in § 102-15.
Applicants are responsible for monitoring their fuel supply
and requesting assistance prior to depleting their fuel supply.
When applicants who have been informed of this responsibility
run out of fuel nonetheless, and can show no just cause for
failing to give the administrator timely notice of their need
for fuel, the administrator shall find that the emergency was
not beyond the applicants' control, and process the emergency
request accordingly, pursuant to § 102-15 of this chapter.
(b)
See Appendix E19 of this chapter for the current year's fuel
maximums.
(c)
Personal care and household supplies. Expenses for ordinary
personal and household supplies will be budgeted and allowed
according to the applicant's actual need for these items. Personal
and household supplies include hand soap, toothpaste, shampoo,
shaving cream, deodorant, dish detergent, laundry supplies and
costs, household cleaning supplies, razors, paper products such
as toilet paper, tissues, and paper towels, garbage/trash bags,
light bulbs and supplies for children under five years of age. See
Appendix F20 of this chapter for the current year's personal care
and household supplies maximums.
(6)
Other basic necessities. Expenses falling under this section will
be granted when they are deemed essential to an applicant's or
recipient's health and safety by the general assistance
administrator and, in some cases, upon verification by a physician.
Assistance will be granted only when these necessities cannot be
obtained through the utilization of available resources.
Clothing. The municipality may assist a household with the
purchase of adequate clothing. Before assistance will be
granted for clothing, the general assistance administrator
must be satisfied that the applicant has utilized all available
resources to secure the necessary clothing. In some
circumstances, clothing will be a postponable item. Exceptions
to this would be, for example, if fire, flood or unusually cold
weather makes extra clothing an immediate necessity, special

§ 102-34 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-34
85:277
clothing is necessary for the applicant's employment, or a
household member is without adequate clothing.
Medical.
The municipality will pay for essential medical expenses,
other than hospital bills (see below), provided that the
municipality is notified and approves the expenses and
services prior to their being made or delivered. Medical
expenses include prescriptions, devices, treatments, or
services that are determined to be "medically necessary"
by a licensed physician. The municipality will grant
assistance for medical services only when assistance
cannot be obtained from any other source and the
applicant would not be able to receive necessary medical
care without the municipality's assistance. The applicant
is required to utilize any resource, including any federal or
state program, that will diminish his or her need to seek
general assistance for medical expenses. The municipality
will grant assistance for nonemergency medical services
only if a physician verifies that the services are essential.
Provided that there is no cost to the applicant, the
administrator may require a second medical opinion from
a physician designated by the municipality to verify the
necessity of the services.
[1]
Generally, the municipality will issue general assistance
at the established Medicaid rates for all medical services,
prescriptions, or other medical commodities. Before
authorizing general assistance for any medical expenses,
the administrator will inform the pharmacy or medical
service provider of the municipality's intention to pay for
the medical service at the Medicaid rate, and ask to be
billed accordingly.
[2]
Ordinary medical supplies/nonprescription drugs will be
budgeted at the actual amount when the applicant can
demonstrate a need for such items. Allowable supplies
include bandages, aspirin, cough syrup, and other generic
brand, non-prescription medicines. In addition, the basic
monthly rate for telephone service will be budgeted when
a telephone is essential to the health and safety of the
household. In order for telephone service to be considered
an allowable expense, the applicant must provide a written
statement from a physician certifying that the telephone is
essential.
[3]
(b)
Hospital bills.
In the event of an emergency admission to the hospital, the
hospital must notify the administrator within five business
[1]
(c)
§ 102-34 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-34
85:278
days of the admission. Notification must be by telephone,
confirmed by certified mail, or by certified mail only. If a
hospital fails to give timely notice to the administrator, the
municipality will have no obligation to pay the bill.
Any person who cannot pay his or her hospital bill must
apply to the hospital for consideration under the hospital's
free care program as provided in 22 M.R.S.A. § 1716.
Anyone who is not eligible for the hospital's free care
program may apply for general assistance. Applicants
must apply for assistance within 30 days of being
discharged from the hospital and provide a notice from
the hospital certifying that they are not eligible for the
hospital's free care program.
[2]
Before the administrator will consider whether to allow a
hospital bill as a necessary expense, the applicant must
enter into a reasonable payment arrangement with the
hospital. The payment arrangement will be based upon
the Medicaid rate. In determining an applicant's eligibility,
the municipality will budget the monthly payment to the
hospital the applicant has agreed to pay. The applicant's
need for assistance with a hospital bill will be considered
each time he/she applies by including the amount of the
bill in the applicant's monthly budget, but the recipient
will be responsible for making any necessary payments to
the hospital pursuant to the use-of-income requirements
found at § 102-32 of this chapter.
[3]
Dental. The municipality will pay for medically necessary
dental services only. As is the case with medical services
generally, the municipality will issue general assistance for
dental services at the established Medicaid rates for those
services, and before authorizing the general assistance benefit
for dental services, the administrator will inform the dentist
or dental surgeon of the municipality's intention to pay at
the Medicaid rate. If full mouth extractions are necessary, the
municipality will pay for dentures, provided that the applicant
has no other resources to pay for the dentures. The applicant
will be referred to a dental clinic in the area whenever
possible. The administrator will expect the applicant to bear
a reasonable part of the cost for dental services, including
extractions and dentures, taking into account the applicant's
ability to pay.
(d)
Eye care. In order to be eligible to receive general assistance
for eyeglasses, an applicant must have his or her medical
need certified by a person licensed to practice optometry. The
general assistance administrator will provide assistance for
eyeglasses to eligible persons only after the applicant has
(e)
§ 102-34 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-34
85:279
exhausted all other available resources and generally only at
the Medicaid rate.
Telephone charge. A payment for basic telephone will only
be allowed if a telephone is necessary for medical reasons
as verified by a physician. At the discretion of the GA
administrator, minimum/basic telephone services may be
allowed for households with children, for households where job
search or job-related reasons exist and/or for any other reasons
the administrator deems necessary.
(f)
Work-related expenses. In determining need, reasonable and
actual work-related expenses will be deducted from earned
income. These expenses include childcare costs, work clothes,
supplies and transportation at the actual costs not to exceed
the ordinance maximum. (See Appendix G21 for this year's
maximum mileage allotment.) The applicant is required to
provide documentation substantiating the costs and that the
expenses were necessary.
(g)
Travel expenses. In determining need, necessary travel which
is not work-related will be budgeted if the applicant can satisfy
the administrator that the prospective need for travel is
necessary. For applicants in rural areas, weekly transportation
to a supermarket will be considered, as will any medically
necessary travel. See Appendix G22 for the current rate at
which such necessary travel will be budgeted. This rate shall
be construed to subsidize all costs associated with automobile
ownership and operation, including gas/oil, tires, maintenance,
insurance, financing, licensing/registration, excise tax, etc.
(h)
Burials, Cremations. Under the circumstances and in
accordance with the procedures and limitations described
below (see § 102-35), the municipality recognizes its
responsibility to pay for the burial or cremation of eligible
persons. See Appendix H23 for the current maximums.
(i)
Capital improvements.
The costs associated with capital improvements/repairs
(e.g., heating/water/septic system repair) will generally
not be budgeted as a basic necessity. Exceptions can be
made only when the capital improvement/repair has been
pre-approved by the administrator as a necessary expense
and the monthly cost of the capital improvement/repair
has been reduced as far as reasonably possible; for
example, by means of the applicant entering into an

installment payment arrangement with the contractor. The
administrator may grant general assistance for capital
improvements when:
The failure to do so would place the applicant(s) in
emergency circumstances;
[a]
There are no other resources available to effect the
capital repair; and
[b]
There is no more cost-effective alternative available
to the applicant or municipality to alleviate an
emergency situation.
[c]
In some cases, the entire immediate cost of the capital
improvement can be mitigated by the applicant entering
into an installment payment arrangement with a
contractor. The municipality reserves the right to place
a lien on any property pursuant to 22 M.R.S.A. § 4320
when general assistance has been used to effect a capital
improvement. The lien process shall be accomplished in
the same manner as for mortgage payments, as described
in Subsection B(3)(d), Liens, above.
[2]
Funeral director must give timely notice. In order for the municipality
to be liable for a burial or cremation expense, the funeral director must
notify the administrator prior to the burial or cremation or by the end
of three business days following the funeral director's receipt of the
body, whichever is earlier [22 M.R.S.A. § 4313(2)]. This contact by the
funeral director shall begin the process of developing an application
for burial/cremation assistance on behalf of the deceased. It is the
funeral director's responsibility to make a good-faith effort to determine
if the family or any other persons are going to pay all or part of
the burial expenses. If family members or others are unable to pay
the expenses, and the funeral director wants the municipality to pay
all or part of the expenses, the funeral director must make timely
contact to the municipal administrator. In addition, the funeral director
may refer legally liable relatives to the administrator so that a timely
determination of financial capacity may be accomplished.
A.
Application for assistance shall be calculated on behalf of the deceased.
For the purposes of determining residency, calculating eligibility and
issuing general assistance for burial or cremation purposes, an
application for assistance shall be completed by the administrator on
behalf of the deceased.
With regard to residency, the municipality of responsibility for
burial expenses shall be the municipality in which the eligible
(1)
B.
§ 102-34 FIRE PREVENTION § 102-35
85:281
deceased person was a resident at the time of death as residency is
determined under § 102-16 of this chapter.
Although legally liable relatives may be asked to provide
information regarding their income, assets, and basic living
expenses, that information will not be construed as an application
for general assistance inasmuch as living persons are not eligible
for burial assistance. To clarify this point of law, although legally
liable relatives have a financial responsibility to pay for the burial
or cremation of their relatives, that financial responsibility only
exists to the extent the legally liable relatives have a financial
capacity to do so. Therefore, legally liable relatives who are eligible
for general assistance, by virtue of their eligibility, have no legal
obligation to pay for the burial or cremation of their relatives. For
these reasons, all general assistance issued for burial or cremation
purposes shall be issued on behalf of, and in the name of, the
deceased.
(2)
Financial responsibility of certain family members. Grandparents,
parents, children and grandchildren of the deceased, who live in Maine
or own property in Maine, are financially responsible for the burial or
cremation of the deceased to the extent those relatives, individually or
as a group, have a financial capacity to pay for the burial or cremation
either in lump sum or by means of a budgeted payment arrangement
with the funeral home. Accordingly, at the request of the administrator,
all legally liable relatives must provide the municipal administrator with
any reasonably requested information regarding their income, assets,
and basic living expenses.
C.
Consideration of the financial responsibility of family members.
Generally, when the administrator can make a finding that one or
more of the deceased's legally liable relatives have an obvious and
demonstrable financial capacity to pay for the burial or cremation, by
lump sum payment or by means of a reasonable payment arrangement,
the municipality will not grant the requested burial or cremation
assistance. When the administrator is unable to make such a finding,
the following proration of familial responsibility will be implemented.
D.
Proration of familial responsibility. A proration of familial financial
responsibility will be used when no legally liable relative possesses an
obvious and demonstrable capacity to pay for the burial or cremation,
but one or more of the financially liable relatives is found to have
a financial capacity to make a partial financial contribution, or the
administrator is unable to determine the financial capacity of one or
more of said relatives. Under these circumstances, each legally liable
relative is considered to be responsible for his or her pro rata share
of the total municipal contribution that would exist if no legally liable
relatives had a financial capacity to contribute. Furthermore, and as
long as all other eligibility factors have been satisfied, the municipality
will provide as a burial or cremation benefit the aggregate of all pro
rata shares less the share of any legally liable relative who refuses
E.
§ 102-35 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-35
85:282
to cooperate with the administrator by providing information or
documentation reasonably necessary to determine that relative's
financial capacity, and less any share or part of a share attributable
to a legally liable relative who can financially contribute or partially
contribute toward the burial or cremation to the extent of that relative's
share.
Eight days to determine eligibility. The administrator may take up to
eight days from the date of contact by the funeral director to issue a
written decision regarding the amount of the municipal contribution
toward the burial or cremation. The eight-day eligibility determination
period from the date of contact by the funeral director shall be used as
necessary to make third-party collateral contacts, verify the listing of
legally liable family members and determine their respective financial
capacities to contribute to the burial or cremation, contact the personal
representative of the deceased's estate, if any, and other related
administrative tasks. The administrator shall not use this eight-day
period allowed by law to unreasonably delay the municipality's
decision.
F.
Municipal obligation to pay when legally liable relatives or others can
contribute. The figures provided in this section are the maximum
benefits provided by the municipality when no contributions toward
the burial or cremation are available from any other source. To the
extent any legally liable relatives of the deceased have a financial
capacity to pay for the burial or cremation, that financial capacity
shall be deducted from the maximum burial costs allowed by this
section. In addition, any other benefits or resources that are available,
such as social security burial benefits, veterans' burial benefits, or
contributions from other persons, will be deducted from the maximum
amount the municipality will pay, except there will be no deduction from
the municipal benefit level with respect to any contribution provided
for the purpose of publishing an obituary notice up to an aggregate
contribution limit for this purpose of $75 when a paid receipt
demonstrating the purchase of an obituary notice is provided to the
administrator.
G.
Burial expenses. The administrator will respect the wishes of family
members with regard to whether the deceased is interred by means
of burial or cremated. See Appendix H24 for the maximum levels of
assistance granted for the purpose of burials.
H.
Cremation expenses. In the absence of any objection by any family
members of the deceased, or when neither the administrator nor the
funeral director can locate any family members, the administrator may
issue general assistance for cremation services. See Appendix H25 for
the maximum levels of assistance granted for the purpose of
cremations.

§ 102-36. Notice of decision.
Written decision. The administrator will give a written decision to each
applicant after making a determination of eligibility each time a person
applies. The decision will be given to the applicant within 24 hours of
receiving a completed and signed application [22 M.R.S.A. § 4305(3)].
(See Article IV, § 102-12.)
When an applicant submits an incomplete or unsigned application,
due to the twenty-four-hour decision requirement placed on the GA
administrator, the GA administrator may decide to render a notice
of ineligibility and provide the applicant with another application
to submit as soon as is practicable for the applicant.
(1)
In order to ensure that applicants understand their rights, it is the
responsibility of the general assistance administrator to explain the
applicant's right to a fair hearing in the written notice of decision.
(2)
A.
Contents. After an application has been completed, applicants will be
given written notice of any decision concerning their eligibility for
assistance. In addition to the contents of a written decision listed in
§ 102-12 of this chapter, the notice will state that applicants:
Have the right to a fair hearing and the method by which they may
obtain a fair hearing; and
(1)
Have the right to contact the DHHS if they believe the municipality
has violated the law. The decision will state the method for
notifying the department.
(2)
B.
Disbursement of general assistance. Except when determined
impractical by the administrator, all general assistance will be provided
in the form of a voucher or purchase order payable to a vendor or
through direct municipal payment to a provider of goods or services.
General assistance will not be issued in the form of a cash payment
to an applicant unless there is no alternative to making such a cash
payment, in which case the administrator shall document the
circumstances for issuing general assistance in the form of cash [22
M.R.S.A. § 4305(6)].

Fair Hearing
§ 102-37. Right to fair hearing.
Within five working days of receiving a written notice of denial, reduction
or termination of assistance, or within 10 working days after any other act
or failure to act, the applicant or his or her authorized representative has
the right to request a fair hearing (22 M.R.S.A. § 4322). The right to review
a decision of the general assistance administrator is a basic right of the
applicant to a full evidentiary hearing and is not limited solely to a review
of the decision.
§ 102-38. Method of obtaining fair hearing.
Upon receiving notification of the decision of the general assistance
administrator, all claimants will be informed of the method of obtaining a
fair hearing. All complaints that are not clear requests for a fair hearing
will be answered by a personal interview or in writing by the general
assistance administrator. If the client is satisfied with the adjustment or
explanation, the administrator will make an entry in the case record and file
any correspondence involved.
Written request.
To obtain a fair hearing, the claimant, or his or her authorized
representative, must make a written request within five working
days of receiving the administrator's decision to grant, deny,
reduce or terminate assistance, or within 10 working days after any
other act or failure to act. The administrator will make available
a printed form for requesting a fair hearing and will assist the
claimant in completing it if necessary. On the printed form, the
claimant will give the following information:
(a) The decision on which review is sought;
The reason(s) for the claimant's dissatisfaction and why the
claimant believes he/she is eligible to receive assistance; and
(b)
(c) The relief sought by the claimant.
(1)
The administrator cannot deny or dismiss a request for a hearing
unless it has been withdrawn (in writing) by the claimant.
(2)
A.
Scheduling the fair hearing.
Upon receipt of the completed written request, the fair hearing
authority must meet and hold the hearing within five working days.
The administrator will notify the claimant in writing when and
where the hearing will be held (22 M.R.S.A. § 4322). In addition to

sent to the claimant shall include, at a minimum, the claimant's
rights to:
Be his or her own spokesperson at the fair hearing, or be
represented by legal counsel or other spokesperson at the
hearing, at the claimant's own expense;
(a)
Confront and cross-examine any witnesses presented at the
hearing against the claimant; and
(b)
(c) Present witnesses on his or her own behalf.
Arrangements for the date, time, and place of the hearing will take
into consideration the convenience of the claimant and hearing
authority. The claimant will be given timely notice to allow for
preparation and will also be given adequate preliminary
information about the hearing procedure to allow for effective
preparation of his or her case.
(2)
The municipal officers will appoint a fair hearing authority (FHA) that
will determine, based on all the evidence presented at the fair hearing,
whether the claimant(s) were eligible to receive assistance at the time
they applied for GA. The FHA is charged with the responsibility of
ensuring that general assistance is administered in accordance with the
state law and local ordinance.
A.
The fair hearing authority may consist of the municipal officers, one or
more persons appointed by the municipal officers to act as the FHA,
or, if designated, the board of appeals created under 30-A M.R.S.A.
§ 2691 (22 M.R.S.A. § 4322). In determining the organization of the fair
hearing authority, the municipal officers will use the following criteria.
The person(s) serving as FHA must:
Not have participated in the decision which is the subject of the
appeal;
(1)
(2) Be impartial;
Be sufficiently skilled in interviewing techniques to be able to
obtain evidence and the facts necessary to make a fair
determination; and
(3)
Be capable of evaluating all evidence fairly and realistically,
explaining to the claimant the laws and regulations under which
the administrator operated, and interpreting to the administrator
any evidence of unsound, unclear, or inadequate policies, practices
or actions.

B.
§ 102-38 BAR HARBOR CODE § 102-40
85:286
When a claimant requesting a fair hearing is notified of the date,
time, and place of the hearing in writing, he/she will also be given
adequate preliminary information about the hearing procedure to allow
for effective preparation of his or her case. The claimant shall be
permitted to review his or her file prior to the hearing. At a minimum,
the claimant will be told the following information, which will govern all
fair hearings. All fair hearings will:
Be conducted privately, and will be open only to the claimant,
witnesses, legal counsel, or others whom the claimant wants
present, and the general assistance administrator, his or her
agents, counsel and witnesses;
(1)

recipient, or his or her executors or administrators in a civil action.
However, prior to recovering assistance granted, the municipality shall
offset the value of any workfare performed by a GA recipient, at a rate

A.
Prior to taking a recipient to court to recover the amount of assistance,
the municipality will seek voluntary repayment from the recipient by
notifying him/her in writing and discussing it with the recipient. The

the repayment, the person would again become eligible for general
assistance (22 M.R.S.A. § 4318).

The municipality shall claim a lien for the value of all general assistance
payments made to a recipient on any lump sum payment made to that
recipient under the Workers' Compensation Act or similar law of any
other state (22 M.R.S.A. § 4318 and 39-A M.R.S.A. § 106). After issuing
any general assistance on behalf of a recipient who has applied for or is
receiving workers' compensation, the municipality shall file a notice of
the municipal lien with the general assistance recipient and the Office
of Secretary of State, Uniform Commercial Code Division.
A.
The notice of lien shall be filed on a UCC-1 form which must be
signed by the recipient of general assistance who has applied for or
is receiving workers' compensation. Any general assistance applicant

and who refuses to sign a properly prepared UCC-1 form will be found
ineligible to receive general assistance until he or she provides the
required signature. The municipality shall also send a photocopy of that
filing to the recipient's worker's compensation attorney, if known, the
applicant's employer or the employer's insurance company, and, at the
administrator's discretion, to the Workers' Compensation Board. The
lien shall be enforced at the time any lump sum workers' compensation

ARTICLE II
Establishment of Districts
§ 125-11. Policy statements for establishing districts.
It is the policy of the Town of Bar Harbor to guide public and private
land use decisions in accordance with state law and the wishes of the
citizens of Bar Harbor as set forth in the Bar Harbor Comprehensive Plan,
to preserve, enhance and protect the character of the Town, the social
way of life desired for the next 20 years and the cultural, historic and
natural resources of Bar Harbor. To implement this policy, the Town of Bar
Harbor is hereby divided into districts of such number and character as
are necessary to achieve compatibility of uses within each district. Each
district is intended to preserve the character of existing neighborhoods and
developments under construction at the time of the adoption of this chapter
in order to prevent these neighborhoods from becoming nonconforming
under the terms of this chapter. It is also intended to provide for limited
development of existing neighborhoods consistent with their zoning and
character at the time of enactment of this chapter. Such neighborhoods are
relatively uniform in character and stable. The regulations permit future
development consistent with the existing character. Areas identified as
having a stable and fixed character will be allowed to continue to exist
and develop under the general regulations governing their design and
construction or the actual plot plans previously approved. The general
classifications of districts shall be as follows:
Residential district. The residential district is intended to provide an
area that restricts intensive uses so that residents may enjoy a measure
of quietness and privacy in their homes.
A.
Corridor district. The corridor district is intended to provide
landscaped transportation linkages between neighborhood districts
and to accommodate part of the future growth in the commercial/
business sector. This district provides regulations which permit
development of a generally suburban character. It provides for
moderate-density residential development and for highway-oriented
commercial, institutional and light industrial uses. Excluded from this
district are uses of higher density or intensity, or major industrial
activities.
B.
Business district. The business district is intended to serve as the
community focal point for cultural, business and service activities. In
general, the district provides for uses of regional importance. This
district is intended to be an area of high-intensity use on which a
full range of public facilities, including water, sewer, schools, police
and fire protection, will be focused. The standards and high densities
prescribed for this district are designed to optimize utilization of inplace
facilities and thus to reduce the fiscal burden of new
infrastructure construction on all citizens of Bar Harbor.
C.
§ 125-11 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-11
109:309
Shoreland general development district. [Amended 11-5-1991;
5-4-1992]
The purpose of the shoreland general development district is to
promote and encourage the maintenance of the established
commercial activities which have traditionally been associated with
the Bar Harbor and Hulls Cove waterfronts. These districts are
designed to accommodate a variety of tourist-oriented and
waterfront recreational opportunities in close proximity to the
downtown and Hulls Cove areas.
(1)
The shoreland general development district includes the following
types of areas:
Areas of two or more contiguous acres devoted to commercial,
industrial or intensive recreational activities, or a mix of such
activities, including but not limited to the following:
Areas devoted to manufacturing, fabricating or other
industrial activities;
[1]
Areas devoted to wholesaling, warehousing, retail trade
and service activities, or other commercial activities;
[2]
Areas devoted to intensive recreational development and
activities, such as, but not limited to, amusement parks,
racetracks and fairgrounds.
[3]
(a)
Areas otherwise discernible as having patterns of intensive
commercial, industrial or recreational uses.
(b)
(2)
Portions of the shoreland general development district may also
include residential development. However, no area shall be
designated as a shoreland general development district based
solely on residential use.
(3)
In areas adjacent to great ponds classified GPA and adjacent to
rivers flowing to great ponds classified GPA, the designation of an
area as a shoreland general development district shall be based
upon uses existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter. There
shall be no newly established shoreland general development
districts or expansions in area of existing shoreland general
development districts adjacent to great ponds classified GPA or
adjacent to rivers which flow into ponds classified GPA.
(4)
D.
Historic and historic corridor districts. The purpose of the historic
and historic corridor districts is to promote, encourage and assist the
educational, cultural, economic and general welfare and amenity of
Bar Harbor through the preservation and protection of historic sites,
buildings, corridors and neighborhoods through their maintenance as
landmarks in the history and architecture of Bar Harbor, and through
E.
§ 125-11 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-11
109:310
the protection and development of appropriate settings for such
buildings, places and neighborhoods.
Industrial district. The purpose of the industrial district is to provide
land which is conveniently located with respect to transportation
corridors and where municipal services are available and other
conditions are favorable to the development of industry, and which at
the same time is so located as to prevent undesirable conflict with
residential and other types of business uses. Processing,
manufacturing, warehousing and other industrial uses which are not
injurious or noxious by reason of noise, smoke, vibration, gas, fumes,
odor, dust, fire or explosion hazard are typical permitted uses with site
plan approval, but not residential uses.
F.
Resource protection district. The purpose of the resource protection
district is to preserve wetlands, stream corridors and areas subject to
flooding, and other areas in which development would adversely impact
water quality, productive habitat, biological ecosystems, or scenic or
natural values, and to provide a minimum setback from these
significant natural areas. This district shall include the following areas
when they occur within the limits of the shoreland zone, exclusive of
the stream protection district, except that areas which are currently
developed and areas which meet the criteria for the shoreland general
development district need not be included within the resource
protection district: [Amended 11-5-1991]
Areas within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of
freshwater wetlands, salt marshes and salt meadows, and wetlands
associated with great ponds and rivers, which are rated "moderate"
or "high" value waterfowl and wading bird habitats, including
nesting and feeding areas, by the Maine Department of Inland
Fisheries and Wildlife that are depicted on a geographic
information system (GIS) data layer maintained by either the Maine
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or the Department as
of May 1, 2006. For the purposes of this subsection, "wetlands
associated with great ponds and rivers" shall mean areas
characterized by nonforested wetland vegetation and hydric soils
that are contiguous with a great pond or river and have surface
elevation at or below the water level of the great pond or river
during the period of normal high water. Wetlands associated with
great ponds or rivers are considered to be part of that great pond
or river. [Amended 11-4-2008]
(1)
Floodplains along rivers and floodplains along artificially formed
great ponds along rivers, defined by the one-hundred-year
floodplain as designated on the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard
Boundary Maps, or the flood of record, or in the absence of these,
by soil types identified as recent floodplain soils. This district shall
also include one-hundred-year floodplains adjacent to tidal waters

G.
§ 125-11 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-11
109:311
as shown on FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard
Boundary Maps.
Areas of two or more contiguous acres with sustained slopes of
20% or greater.
(3)
Areas of two or more contiguous acres supporting wetland
vegetation and hydric soils, which are not part of a freshwater or
coastal wetland as defined, and which are not surficially connected
to a water body during the period of normal high water. (Inasmuch
as these types of areas are not adequately mapped by any federal,
state or local agency, it may not be possible to identify them prior to
the detailed evaluation of a specific site.) [Amended 11-4-2008]
(4)
Land areas along rivers subject to severe bank erosion,
undercutting, or river bed movement, and lands adjacent to tidal
waters which are subject to severe erosion or mass movement,
such as steep coastal bluffs.
(5)
Rural district. The rural district is intended to preserve areas which
are presently rural or agricultural in character and use. This district
is designed to accommodate a variety of residential development
opportunities for those who desire low-density living and are willing to
live in more remote locations and to assume the costs of providing many
of their own services and amenities.
H.
Shoreland limited residential district. The shoreland limited residential
district includes those areas suitable for residential and recreational
development. It includes areas other than those in the resource
protection or stream protection districts and areas which are used less
intensively than those in the shoreland general development district.
[Amended 11-5-1991]
I.
District for scientific research and eleemosynary purposes. The purpose
of this district is to promote and encourage the continuation of
scientific research and development activities on land owned by
eleemosynary and charitable entities and/or used solely for nonprofit
purposes, or, if used for profit purposes, then said profits are in turn
devoted to eleemosynary and charitable purposes. This district provides
for a diversity of uses associated with comprehensive scientific and
educational institutions and/or activities.
J.
Stream protection district. The stream protection district includes all
land areas within 75 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high water
line of a stream, exclusive of those areas within 250 feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high water line of a great pond or river or within
250 feet, horizontal distance, or the upland edge of a freshwater or
coastal wetland. Where a stream and its associated shoreland area are
located within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the above water bodies
or wetlands, that land area shall be regulated under the terms of the

ARTICLE IV
Nonconformity
§ 125-52. Defined.
A legally existing (grandfathered) nonconforming lot, structure or use is
a lot, structure or use that lawfully existed immediately prior to the
enactment of this chapter, or any subsequent amendment, and which, as
a result of the enactment of this chapter, or any subsequent amendment,
presently fails to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter or
its amendments, including, but not limited to, the use restrictions and lot
standards for the district in which it is located, or any standards set forth in
Article V. Any other lot, structure or use that fails to comply with any of the
requirements of this chapter or its amendments is an illegal nonconformity.
§ 125-53. General policies.
All nonconformities shall be encouraged to convert to conformity
whenever possible and, when required by this chapter, shall convert to
conformity.
A.
Any nonconformity not expressly allowed to exist by this article is
hereby deemed illegal and shall cease or be corrected immediately.
B.
The burden of establishing that any nonconformity is a legal
nonconformity shall, in all cases, be upon the owner of such
nonconformity and not upon the Town of Bar Harbor.
C.
Any legally existing nonconformity may be transferred and the new
owner may, subject strictly to the requirements of this article, continue
such nonconformity; provided, however, that nothing contained herein
shall be construed to permit any person or entity to occupy or use any
lot or structure or to continue any use in violation of any other federal,
state or municipal statute, ordinance or regulation.
D.
Once converted to conformity, no lot, structure or use shall revert to
nonconformity.
E.
Nothing herein shall require any change in the plans, construction, size
or designated use for any building, structure or part thereof for which
a completed application for a local permit is pending, or for which a
permit has been issued and upon which construction has been lawfully
commenced, prior to the adoption of this chapter or any amendment.
F.
Any relief sought under this article to the Board of Appeals shall adhere
to the process found in Article IX, § 125-102C(1), (2), and (3),
respectively, as well § 125-102D, E, F, and G, respectively. [Added
6-10-2008]

§ 125-54. Nonconforming uses of land or structures.
The use of any land or structure which is made nonconforming as a result
of the enactment of this chapter, or any subsequent amendment, may be
continued, but only in strict compliance with the following:
No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than such use occupied when it became
nonconforming.
A.
No existing structure devoted partially or entirely to a nonconforming
use shall be extended or enlarged.
B.
Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which, at the time such use became a nonconformity, were
arranged or designed for such use; provided, however, that no
nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such
building.
C.
Any nonconforming use of land or a structure may be changed to
another nonconforming use provided first that the Board of Appeals
finds that the proposed use will have no greater adverse impact on
the subject and adjacent properties and resources, including waterdependent
uses, than the existing use, and second that the Planning
Board grants site plan approval upon a finding that the proposed use
meets all standards set forth in Article V except those that cause
the existing use to be nonconforming. In determining that no greater
adverse impact will occur, the Board of Appeals, in dealing with uses
in resource protection, shoreland limited residential, shoreland general
development and stream protection districts, shall, at a minimum,
require written documentation from the applicant regarding the
probable effects on public health and safety, erosion and sedimentation,
water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative cover, visual and
actual points of public access to waters, natural beauty, floodplain
management, archaeological and historic resources, and commercial
fishing and maritime activities, and other functionally water-dependent
uses. [Amended 11-5-1991]
D.
If any nonconforming use of land or of a structure housing a
nonconforming use ceases or is discontinued for any reason for a period
of 12 or more consecutive months, any subsequent use of such land
or structure shall conform to the requirements of this chapter in all
respects. [Amended 11-4-2003]
E.
A nonconforming use or a structure housing a nonconforming use may
be moved within a lot provided that the Board of Appeals finds that the
proposed new location and design are more appropriate with regard to:
(1) Location, character, and natural features;
(2) Fencing and screening;

compliance with the following:
(3) Landscaping and topography;
(4) Traffic and access;
(5) Signs and lighting; and
(6) Potential nuisance.
55Transient accommodations.
Transient accommodations that are nonconforming uses may be
enlarged, extended and occupy a GREATER area of land, provided
that no additional guest rooms are added and that the Board of
Appeals finds that: [Added 6-13-2006]
(a) There will be no greater adverse impacts; and
The proposed construction is appropriate with regard to:
[1] Location, character and natural features;
[2] Fencing and screening;
[3] Landscaping and topography;
[4] Traffic and access;
[5] Lighting; and
[6] Potential nuisance.
(b)
(1)
In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the Board
of Appeals, in dealing with transient accommodation in resource
protection, shoreland limited residential, shoreland general
development and stream protection districts, shall, at a minimum,
require written documentation from the applicant regarding the
probable effects on public health and safety, erosion and
sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative
cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural
beauty, floodplain management, archaeological and historic
resources, and commercial fishing and maritime activities, and
other functionally water-dependent uses.

constructed under a nonconforming structure, the structure and
new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement
is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the
Planning Board or its designee, basing its decision on the criteria
specified in § 125-55C(3) below. If the completed foundation does
not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure, except
for expansion in conformity with § 125-55A(3) below, and the
foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more
than three additional feet as measured from the uphill side of the
structure (from original ground level to the bottom of the first-floor
sill), it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure.
]
(1)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A(1), no structure
which is less than the required setback from the normal high-water
line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland
shall be expanded toward the water body, tributary stream, or
wetland.
(2)
After January 1, 1989, if any portion of a structure is less than the
required setback from the normal high-water line of a water body
or tributary stream or the upland edge of a wetland, that portion
of the structure shall not be expanded, as measured in floor area
or volume by 30% or more during the lifetime of the structure.
If a replacement structure conforms with the requirements of §
125-55B below, and is less than the required setback from a water
body, tributary stream or wetland, the replacement structure may
not be expanded if the original structure existing on January 1,
1989, had been expanded by 30% in floor area and volume since
that date.
(3)
Any structure may be razed and rebuilt up to the dimensions (length,
width and height) of the individual structure that was razed plus any
enlargements, alterations or extensions permitted by Subsection A(1),
provided rebuilding is begun within one year and completed within
two years after the structure is razed; provided, however, that such
rebuilding of any nonconforming structure which is located less than
the required setback from the normal high water line of a water body,
tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland is in compliance with
the water setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as
determined by the Planning Board in accordance with the purposes of
B.

this chapter. In no case shall a structure rebuilt under this subsection
be combined with another structure or be reconstructed or replaced
so as to increase its nonconformity. [Amended 5-7-1991; 11-5-1991;
5-6-1996; 11-2-1999; 11-4-2003; 11-7-2006; 11-4-2008]
Any nonconforming structure which is located less than the
required setback from the normal high water line of a water body,
tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland and which is removed
by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by
50% or less of the market value of the structure, excluding normal
maintenance and repair, may be reconstructed in place if a permit
is obtained from the Code Enforcement Officer within one year of
such damage, destruction, or removal.
(1)
Any nonconforming structure which is located less than the
required setback from a water body, tributary stream, or wetland
and which is removed, or damaged or destroyed, regardless of the
cause, by more than 50% of the market value of the structure
before such damage, destruction or removal may be reconstructed
or replaced, provided that a permit is obtained within one year
of the date of said damage, destruction, or removal, and provided
that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the
water body, tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to
the greatest practical extent, as determined by the Planning Board
or its designee in accordance with the § 125-55C below and the
physical condition and type of foundation present, if any. In no case
shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase
its nonconformity. If the reconstructed or replacement structure
is less than the required setback, it shall not be any larger than
the original structure, except as allowed pursuant to § 125-55A(1)
above, as determined by the nonconforming floor area and volume
of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location. If
the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure
can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback
area, no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall
be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement
for a new structure. When it is necessary to remove vegetation
in order to replace or reconstruct a structure, vegetation shall be
replanted in accordance with § 125-55C. [Amended 11-3-2009;
6-8-201056]

A nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries
of the lot on which the structure is located, provided that the Board
of Appeals finds that the proposed new location and design are more
appropriate with regard to location, character and natural features;
fencing and screening; landscaping and topography; traffic and access;
signs and lighting; and potential nuisance, provided that the site of

replacement met setback to the greatest practical extent.
§ 125-55 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-55
109:459
relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest
practical extent, as determined by the Board of Appeals, and provided
that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage
disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the State of
Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules (rules), or that a new
system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules.
In no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes
the structure to be more nonconforming. In determining whether the
building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent,
the Board of Appeals shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of
the land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of other structures
on the property and on adjacent properties, the location of the septic
system and other on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type
and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation.
When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland
setback area in order to relocate a structure, the Planning Board shall
require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed
vegetation. In addition, the area from which the relocated structure
was removed must be replanted with vegetation. Replanting shall be
required as follows: [Amended 11-5-1991; 11-4-2008]
Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted
with at least one native tree, three feet in height, for every tree
removed. If more than five trees are planted, no one species of
tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted.
Replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or
wetland than the trees that were removed. Other woody and
herbaceous vegetation, and ground cover, that is removed or
destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be reestablished.
An area at least the same size as the area where vegetation and/
or ground cover was disturbed, damaged, or removed must be
reestablished within the setback area. The vegetation and/or
ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or
ground cover that was disturbed, destroyed or removed.
(1)
Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel, the
original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation
which may consist of grasses, shrubs, trees, or a combination
thereof.
(2)
The use of a nonconforming structure located in any shoreland district
may not be changed to another use unless the Board of Appeals, after
receiving a written application, determines that the new use will have
no greater adverse impact on the water body, tributary stream, or
wetland, or on the subject or adjacent properties and resources, than
the existing use. In determining that no greater adverse impact will
occur, the Board of Appeals shall require written documentation from
the applicant regarding the probable effects on public health and safety,
erosion and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitats,
vegetative cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters,

structures accessory thereto which are nonconforming with
respect to a dimensional requirement may be enlarged or extended
in any other direction in compliance with this chapter, by issuance
of a building permit. That part of an existing nonconforming
dwelling which is nonconforming with respect to a dimensional
requirement may be enlarged or extended in that direction,
provided the Board of Appeals grants a finding that all of the
following conditions are met:
The existing or proposed degree of nonconformity is not
greater than 50% of the dimensional requirement in Article III
of the chapter.

so far as possible to the lot standards of the district in which the
parcels are located. If possible, the lots shall be consolidated so that no
nonconforming lot or lots are formed.
One or more nonconforming vacant parcels of land that adjoin a
conforming parcel containing a building or structure shall be
consolidated to the extent necessary to bring the lots into conformity
so far as possible. If the remaining portion of the vacant parcel(s)
constitutes a conforming lot, said remaining portion shall constitute a
separate lot; otherwise combined lots shall constitute one lot. [Added
6-8-201057]
D.
One or more vacant parcels of land that adjoin a nonconforming lot
in common ownership and containing a building or structure shall be
consolidated with said improved lot to the extent necessary to bring the
improved lot into conformity so far as possible. If the remaining portion
of the vacant parcels constitutes a conforming lot, said remaining
portion shall constitute a separate lot. Otherwise, the combined lots
shall constitute one lot.
E.
If two or more principal uses or structures exist on a single lot of
record, each may be sold on a separate lot provided that the State
Minimum Lot Size Law (12 M.R.S.A. §§ 4807-A through 4807-D) and
the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied
with. [Added 6-8-201058]

§ 125-62. Standard conditions.
All activities, uses or developments approved pursuant to this Article V shall
comply with the standard conditions set forth in Article VIII.
§ 125-63. Waiver of submissions.
The Planning Board may, for good cause shown and only upon the written
request of an applicant specifically stating the reasons therefor, waive
any of the application requirements set forth in § 125-66 provided such
waiver will not unduly restrict the review process. The Planning Board
may condition such a waiver on the applicant's compliance with alternative
requirements. Good cause may include the Board's finding that particular
submissions are inapplicable, unnecessary, or inappropriate for a complete
review. Notwithstanding the waiver of a submission requirement, the
An applicant may submit one minor site plan or minor subdivision
plan in any three-year period per parcel of land. If an applicant
wishes to submit more than one minor site plan or minor
subdivision plan on the same parcel of land within a three-year
period, the Planning Board shall be consulted to determine the
appropriate review per § 125-58B(4). [Added 11-4-2008]
(6)
Other permits. The granting of site plan approval does not relieve
the applicant from the need to obtain any other permits or approvals
required prior to the commencement of any activity or use described
in §125-58. Such other required permits or approvals may include,
but are not limited to, subdivision approval, building, plumbing and
electrical permits, licenses granted pursuant to 38 M.R.S.A. §1022,
Maine Department of Environmental Protection and United States
Army Corps of Engineers' approvals, subsurface wastewater disposal
permits, sewer connection permits, Maine Department of
Transportation approvals, and the like. The fact that the applicant may
have obtained or may have been granted such permits or approvals
prior to site plan review may be considered by the Planning Board as
evidence as to the plan's compliance with applicable review standards
but shall not be deemed conclusive evidence as to compliance. Site plan
approval shall not be granted, however, until zoning compliance has
been confirmed or any necessary relief and/or finding from the Board of
Appeals has been received or certificates of appropriateness reviewed
by the Design Review Board pursuant to Article XIII, Design Review,
as applicable, have been granted. [Amended 11-2-1999; 5-5-2003;

time requirements set forth herein shall constitute a denial of the
application.
J.
§ 125-61 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-63
109:470
Planning Board may, at any later point in the review process, rescind such
waiver if it appears that the submission previously waived is necessary for
an adequate review. A request for a submission previously waived shall not
affect the pending status of an application.
§ 125-64. Modification of standards. [Amended 5-5-2003]
The Planning Board may, only upon the written request of an applicant
specifically stating the reasons therefor, modify the site plan review
standards when necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare
or to address particular site characteristics. In no event shall the Planning
Board grant a modification that has the effect of altering or nullifying
the purpose or intent of municipal zoning, the Comprehensive Plan, or
Article III of this chapter. In granting modifications under this section, the
Planning Board may impose performance conditions reasonably necessary
to promote the purposes, goals and objectives of the Land Use Ordinance
and the Comprehensive Plan.
§ 125-65. Fees.
General. No application for site plan review shall be deemed complete
until the applicant has paid all fees as required by this section. All fees
shall be payable to the Town of Bar Harbor and shall be for the cost
of processing the site plan review application and, except as otherwise
specifically provided, shall not be refundable regardless of the final
decision to grant or deny site plan approval.
A.
Administrative and notice fees. Each application for site plan review
shall be accompanied by an administrative fee and a public notice fee,
which fees shall, from time to time, be set by the Bar Harbor Town
Council.
B.
Late fees. Each application for site plan review submitted after a
violation of this chapter has occurred on the property in question shall
be accompanied by a late fee which shall, from time to time, be set by
the Bar Harbor Town Council.
C.
Technical assistance fees. Because of the complexity of development
requirements today, it is often desirable for the Town to employ
independent expert assistance in reviewing a development. Costs
thereof shall be paid by the developer. In addition to such other fees
as are otherwise imposed by this chapter, the Town shall assess to
an applicant fees sufficient to cover 100% of its costs related to
independent geotechnical, hydrologic, engineering, planning,
architectural, legal and similar professional consulting costs. Such fees
shall be subject to the following limitations:
Such consultation shall be limited to reasonable and necessary
review or inspection that exceeds the expertise of the Town
Planning Department or its ability to review the application
materials or to inspect the project within reasonable time limits or
(1)
D.
§ 125-63 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-65
109:471
within such limits as are otherwise established by this chapter or
by law.
Such fees shall be assessed only to recover costs directly
associated with review of the application for a major site plan
submitted by the applicant to whom they are assessed or with the
inspection of the work prosecuted by such applicant pursuant to
said application. [Amended 5-5-2003]
(2)
Such fees shall be reasonable in amount, based upon the consulting
time involved and the complexity of the review or inspection.
(3)
The results of any consultation for which such fees are assessed
shall be available for public review, but such results shall be
deemed to have been made solely for the benefit of the Town of Bar
Harbor and shall remain its property.
(4)
Such fees shall be assessed for the privilege of pursuing an activity
requiring site plan approval and shall be payable without regard
to the decision rendered on the application or to the consultation
results.
(5)
Within 15 days of an application for site plan review being
determined complete, an applicant shall establish with the Town
a non-interest-bearing escrow account to guarantee payment of
actual fees pursuant to this section. The original deposit into said
account shall be in the amount set forth in the following subsection.
If the balance of the account shall be drawn down by 75%, the Town
shall notify the applicant and require that an additional amount,
reasonably estimated to cover the cost of the remaining review or
inspection, be deposited therein. The Town shall continue to notify
the applicant and require an additional amount to be deposited
each time the account is drawn down to less than 25% of the
original deposit.
(6)
The sum that an applicant shall originally deposit into said escrow
account shall be determined according to a schedule that shall,
from time to time, be established by the Bar Harbor Town Council.
(7)
Upon the denial of site plan approval, or upon an applicant's
completion of a project, the Town shall provide the applicant with
an accounting of expenditures from said escrow account and shall
return to the applicant any unused portion of the funds originally
deposited. In the event that the amount originally deposited in
said escrow account is insufficient to cover all costs incurred by
the Town and directly and reasonably related to said review and
inspection, the applicant shall pay to the Town the difference
between the amounts the applicant has already paid and the
amount ultimately expended.
(8)
In lieu of the establishment of an escrow account as aforesaid, an
applicant may provide the Town with a letter of credit, in form and

avoid queuing of entering vehicles on any street.
(b)
The proposed development shall not cause unreasonable
highway or public road congestion or unsafe conditions with
respect to the use of highways or public roads, existing or
proposed.
(c)
Where necessary to safeguard against hazards to traffic or
pedestrians, or to avoid traffic congestion, provision shall be
made for turning lanes, traffic directional islands, frontage
roads, driveways and traffic controls within public streets or
for the connection of internal pedestrian walkways to the
nearest public sidewalk when such sidewalk is reasonably
close to the proposed development and it is reasonably
anticipated that the users of the proposed development will
regularly use such sidewalk in connection with their use of the
proposed development. [Amended 5-4-1992]
(d)
Layout.
Proposed streets shall conform, as far as practical, to the Bar
Harbor Comprehensive Plan.
(a)
All streets within subdivisions shall be so designed that they
will provide safe vehicular travel while discouraging movement
of through traffic.
(b)
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location
of all streets shall be considered in their relation to existing
or planned streets, to topographical conditions and to public
convenience and safety and their appropriate relation to the
proposed use of the land to be served by such streets. Grades
of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original
topography.
(c)
In the case of dead-end streets, where needed or desirable, the
Planning Board may require the reservation of a twenty-footwide
easement in the line of the street to provide continuation
of pedestrian traffic or utilities to the next street. The Planning
Board may also require the reservation of a fifty-foot easement
in line with the street to provide for continuation of the street
where future adjoining subdivision is possible.
(d)
Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is definitely placed in the Town
under conditions approved by the Planning Board.

Where a development borders an existing narrow road (below
standards set herein) or when the Comprehensive Plan
indicates plans for realignment or widening of a road that
would require use of some of the land in the development,
the developer shall be required to show areas for widening or
realigning such roads on the plan, marked "Reserved for Road
Realignment (or Widening) Purposes." It shall be mandatory
to indicate such reservation on the plan when a proposed
widening or realignment is shown on the Official Map. Land
reserved for such purposes may not be counted in satisfying
setback or yard or area requirements of this chapter.
(f)
Where a development abuts or contains an existing or
proposed arterial street, the Planning Board may require
marginal access streets (street parallel to arterial street
providing access to adjacent lots), reverse frontage (that is,
frontage on a street other than the existing or proposed
arterial street) with screen planting contained in a non-access
reservation along the rear property line, or such other
treatments as may be necessary for adequate protection of
residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic.
(g)
Two street connections with existing public streets, streets
shown on the Official Map, or streets on an approved
subdivision plan for which a performance guarantee has been
filed and accepted: [Amended 11-7-2006]

J.
§ 125-67 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-67
109:510
Groundwater. All site plans shall demonstrate that the proposed
development shall not, alone or in conjunction with existing activities,
adversely affect the quality or quantity of groundwater or of a body
or course of water and that the development shall comply with the
following standards:
No activity shall locate, store, discharge, or permit the discharge
of any treated, untreated, or inadequately treated liquid, gaseous,
or solid materials of such nature, quantity, obnoxious, toxicity, or
temperature that run off, seep, percolate, or wash into surface or
ground waters so as to contaminate, pollute, or harm such waters
or objectionable shore deposits, floating or submerged debris, oil
or scum, color, odor, taste, or unsightliness to be harmful to human,
animal, plant or aquatic life.
(1)
All aboveground storage facilities for fuel, chemicals, chemical
or industrial wastes, and biodegradable raw materials shall be
located on impervious pavement and shall be completely enclosed
by an impervious dike which shall be high enough to contain the
total volume of liquid kept within the storage area, plus the rain
falling into this storage area during a twenty-five-year storm, so
that such liquid shall not be able to spill onto or seep into the

home heating oil and diesel fuel, not exceeding 275 gallons in size,
are exempted from this requirement.
(2)
All below-ground tanks must meet the standards of the Maine
Department of Environmental Protection.
(3)
No development shall directly or indirectly cause an increase in
any contaminant concentration in the groundwater at the property
boundary with adjacent existing lots to more than one-half of the
difference between the existing water quality and the EPA National
Primary Drinking Water Regulations (primary standards)or the
Maine Maximum Exposure Guidelines for Drinking Water (MEGs),
whichever is more restrictive. No development shall increase any
contaminant concentration in the groundwater to more than the
EPA National Secondary Drinking Water Regulations standards.
[Amended 6-10-2008]
(4)
If existing groundwater quality already exceeds the primary
standards and MEGs and the development is to be served by on-site
groundwater supplies, the applicant shall demonstrate how water
quality will be improved or treated. [Amended 6-10-2008]
(5)
If existing groundwater quality already exceeds the primary
standards, MEGs, and/or secondary standards, the quality of any

Subsurface wastewater disposal systems and drinking water wells
shall be constructed as shown on the map submitted with the
hydrogeologic assessment of groundwater impacts, if one has been
required. If construction standards for drinking water wells are
recommended in the assessment, those standards shall be included
as a note on the final plan and as restrictions in the deeds to the
affected lots.
(7)
Nitrate analysis. Unless a more site-specific groundwater modeling
analysis demonstrates that the minimum lot size is adequate to
protect groundwater, the Board shall require lot sizes larger than
the minimum lot size required by this chapter where soil conditions
warrant the additional dilution potential to meet groundwater
quality standards identified above. The following formula shall be
used to calculate minimum allowable lot sizes: [Amended
6-10-2008]
Nitrate Analysis Formula
A = (qs x Cs) / [Rrecharge x (Cnitrate  Cb)]
A = Lot size (acres per dwelling).
qs = Average septic discharge rate = 270 gpd/dwelling =
0.19 gpm/dwelling (if more than three bedrooms per dwelling,
use the design flows for single-family dwellings provided by
the Maine Department of Health and Human Services in the
Maine Subsurface Waste Water Disposal Rules, 10-144 CMR
241).
Cs = Assumed concentration of nitrate-nitrogen reaching the
water table from septic discharge = 40 mg/l.
Cnitrate = Limiting concentration of nitrate-nitrogen in
groundwater = 5 mg/l (equal to half the EPA primary drinking
water standard).
Cb = Background concentration of nitrate-nitrogen in the
ambient groundwater (if not known, assume = 0.25 mg/l)
Rrecharge = Rate of natural groundwater recharge, averaged
over the year in gpm/acre; some representative numbers,
based on soil types and Bar Harbor average annual
precipitation, are:

*NOTES:
1 Average annual precipitation in Bar Harbor equals 55 inches/year
(USGS, 2002).
2 Glaciomarine clay-silt soils are not only limiting in their ability
to treat residential wastewater, but they also have limitations
relating to other site engineering issues such as slope stability,
drainage, and siltation potential.
The quantity of water to be taken from groundwater sources will
not lower the groundwater table at the property lines by more than
two feet to the surficial aquifer, 10 feet to the bedrock aquifer
or to the detriment of any existing groundwater, cause saltwater
intrusion to any existing well, cause undesirable changes in
groundwater flow patterns, or cause unacceptable ground
subsidence. [Amended 6-10-2008]
(9)
Salt water intrusion analysis shall be based on a drought year
occurring between average years with a total precipitation in the
drought year of 70% of average annual precipitation of 55 inches.
The proposed development shall not cause chloride concentrations
to exceed 250 mg/l at the proposed well and/or existing wells.
[Amended 6-10-2008]
(10)
The proposed development shall not be within the defined source
water protection area of a public water supply, unless notice is
given to the operator thereof and the Board has considered any
information supplied by the operator and finds that no adverse
effect on a public water supply will result. [Amended 6-10-2008]
(11)
Nothing in this procedure nor any decision by the Planning Board
shall be deemed to create groundwater rights other than those
rights which the applicant may have under Maine law.
(12)
§ 125-67 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-67
109:513
The proposed development shall not otherwise cause undue water
pollution, taking into consideration at least the following factors:
[Amended 6-10-2008]
The elevation of the land above sea level and its relation to the
floodplains.
(a)
The nature of the soils and subsoils and their ability to
adequately support waste disposal.
(b)
The slope of the land and its effect on effluents, infiltration
capacity, and potential for wastewater breakouts to the land
surface.
(c)
The ecological impact on surface water bodies when waste
water originating at the site eventually discharges.
(d)
Any applicable state and local health and water resource rules
and regulations.
(e)
(13)
Increase in lake phosphorous concentration prohibited. The longterm
cumulative effects of the proposed development will not
unreasonably increase a great pond's phosphorus concentration
during the construction phase or during the life of the
development. The development shall meet the phosphorus
requirements of Maine Department of Environmental Protection
Rules, Chapter 500, Stormwater Management, and Chapter 502,
Direct Watersheds of Waterbodies Most at Risk From New
Development, and Sensitive or Threatened Regions or Watersheds.
The development shall use the Maine Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual published by the Maine
Department of Environmental Protection in the control of
phosphorus. [Added 5-6-1996; amended 6-10-2008]
(14)
Stormwater management. All site plans shall demonstrate that the
proposed development shall provide for adequate stormwater
management in compliance with the following standards and must
be maintained as necessary to ensure proper functioning: [Amended
11-5-1991; 6-10-2008; 11-3-2009; 6-8-2010]
All new construction and development, whether or not served by a
stormwater collection and transportation system, shall be designed
to reflect or resemble, as nearly as possible, natural runoff
conditions in terms of volume, velocity and location of runoff. If
runoff into receiving waters other than direct discharge to the
ocean after development would exceed by 10% predevelopment
runoff conditions, the off-site impact must be evaluated in terms
of potential soil erosion and sedimentation, drainage capacity, land
use and land cover characteristics. Appropriate methods of
reducing off-site impact shall be employed. Stormwater
management evaluations and designs shall be based on a twentyfour-
hour, twenty-five-year recurrence interval storm except
(1)
L.
§ 125-67 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-67
109:514
detention pond spillways, which shall be designed for the onehundred-
year, twenty-four-hour storm event.
Stormwater runoff systems should be designed to facilitate aquifer
recharge when it is advantageous to compensate for groundwater
withdrawals or reductions in infiltration. Conversely, designs
should avoid recharge where groundwater effects might be
harmful. The development shall use the Maine Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual in the control of stormwater,
published by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
Design of permanent storage facilities should consider safety,
appearance, recreational use, and cost and effectiveness of
maintenance operations, in addition to the primary storage
function. Natural overland flows and open drainage channel and
swale locations should be the preferred alignments for major
components of a residential drainage system. The use of enclosed
components, such as underground piping, should be minimized
where the existing natural systems are able to accommodate storm
runoff. Energy dissipaters, to reduce high flow velocities, and other
forms of outfall protection shall be employed where enclosed
drains discharge onto erodible soils. Stormwater and surface water
runoff, whether channelized or not, shall not be diverted onto
adjacent properties without an easement, unless in a natural or
previously existing channel.
(2)
The stormwater management system shall be designed to
accommodate upstream drainage, taking into account existing
conditions and approved or planned developments not yet built,
and shall include a surplus design capacity factor of 25% for
potential increases in the peak twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour
upstream runoff rate.
(3)
Downstream drainage requirements shall be studied to determine
the effect of the proposed development, including the twenty-fivepercent
surplus design capacity factor as required above. The
storm drainage shall not overload existing or future planned storm
drainage systems downstream from the development. The
applicant shall be responsible for financing any improvements to
existing drainage systems required to handle the increased storm
flows.
(4)
The minimum pipe size for any storm drainage pipe shall be 12
inches. Maximum trench width at the pipe crown shall be the
outside diameter of the pipe plus two feet. Pipe shall be bedded in
crushed stone or widely graded gravel with a uniformity coefficient
of greater than six and less than 10% passing the #200 sieve and
containing no stones larger than three inches, lumps of clay, or
organic matter, reaching a minimum of six inches below the bottom
of the pipe and extending to six inches above the top of the pipe.
(5)

Catch basins shall be installed where necessary and located at the
curbline, but at no greater horizontal intervals than 300 feet.
(6)
Drain inlet alignment shall be straight in both horizontal and
vertical alignment unless specific approval of a curvilinear drain is
obtained in writing from the Public Works Director.
(7)
Manholes shall be provided at all changes in vertical or horizontal
alignment and at all junctions. On straight runs, manholes shall be
placed at a maximum of two-hundred-fifty-foot intervals.

carbon steel castings, AASHTO M 105, Class 30, for gray iron
castings or AASHTO M 183 (ASTM A 283, Grade B or better)
for structural steel. Frames and grates shall be brought to
grade with a minimum of two courses and a maximum of five
courses of brick. Catch basins shall be provided with a two
sump.
(f)
Stormwater drainage systems shall be designed so as to prevent
the infiltration of stormwater into the public sewer system and shall
be maintained as necessary to ensure proper functioning.
(11)
Wherever a stormwater drainage system, including a natural
watercourse or drainageway, is not within a public right-of-way,
perpetual easements shall be provided to the Town allowing
maintenance and improvement of the system. Such easement shall
be at least 30 feet in width. In no event shall the granting of such
an easement be deemed to require maintenance or improvement of
the stormwater drainage system by the Town.
(12)
All site plans shall demonstrate in the form of signed affidavits from
the Public Works Department that the proposed development shall
not place an unreasonable burden on the municipal stormwater
drainage system, if such system is to be used, and that the Public
Works Department has approved the design specifications of any
stormwater drainage system that shall be connected to the
municipal system.
(13)
Municipal sewer facilities. All site plans shall demonstrate that the
proposed development will provide for adequate sewage waste disposal
and that it shall not cause an unreasonable burden on the municipal
sewage waste disposal facilities, if such facilities are to be utilized,
and that the Public Works Department has approved the design
specifications for any new sewer facilities to be connected to the
municipal facilities. [Amended 5-4-1992]
M.
Sewage disposal. All site plans shall demonstrate that the proposed
development will provide for adequate sewage waste disposal, subject
to the following standards:
N.
§ 125-67 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-67
109:517
All developments shall be connected to municipal sewage waste
disposal facilities when required by the Bar Harbor Sewer
Ordinance set forth in Chapter 165.
(1)
Industrial or commercial wastewaters may be discharged to
municipal sewers only in such quantities or of such quality as to
be compatible with municipal sewage treatment operations. Such
wastes may require pretreatment at the industrial or commercial
site in order to render them amenable to municipal treatment
processes. Pretreatment includes, but is not limited to, screening,
grinding, sedimentation, pH adjustment, surface skimming,
chemical oxidation, and reduction and dilution. The disposal of
industrial or commercial wastewaters by means other than the
municipal sewerage system shall comply with the laws of the State
of Maine concerning water pollution. Wash water or other process
water carrying stone dust, stone particles, silt or other mineral
matter will not be accepted into the municipal system.
(2)
When a development will produce sewage and when the
development will not be serviced by municipal sewage waste
disposal facilities, the applicant shall present a Maine Department
of Human Services Bureau of Health Engineering site evaluation
form, completed by a licensed site evaluator, evidencing adequate
soil conditions for sufficient subsurface wastewater disposal and
shall also present sufficient evidence that the proposed subsurface
wastewater facilities, when considered with other such facilities in
the vicinity, will not have an undue adverse environmental effect.
All subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be installed or
replaced in conformance with the State of Maine Subsurface
Wastewater Disposal Rules. If soils are in Design Class A according
to the licensed site evaluators report, at least five subsurface
probes or test pits are required in each proposed leachfield area.
[Amended 11-5-1991; 5-2-2005; 6-10-2008]
(3)
When two or more lots or buildings in different ownership share
a common subsurface disposal system, the system shall be owned
and maintained in common by an owners' association. Covenants in
the deeds for each lot shall require mandatory membership in the
association and provide for adequate funding of the association to
assure proper maintenance of the system.
(4)
Soils. No activity shall be permitted in any area where the soil is
rated severe or very severe for the proposed activity according to the
County Soil Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture Soil
Conservation Service, unless satisfactory evidence is presented that
construction methods will overcome soil inadequacies.
O.
Landscaping. All site plans shall provide for the landscape to be
preserved in its natural state, insofar as practicable, by minimizing tree
and soil removal and grade changes. Landscaping shall be designed to
soften, buffer, screen or enhance the physical design of structures and
P.

abutting uses. In addition, activities located within the Design Review
Overlay District that require a certificate of appropriateness pursuant
to Article XIII, Design Review, are subject to additional requirements
set forth in the standards of Article XIII. [Amended 11-2-1999]
Erosion. All site plans shall demonstrate that the proposed development
will not cause unreasonable soil erosion or a reduction in the land's
capacity to hold water so that a dangerous or unhealthy condition
results and further that the following standards will be met during
construction and after completion:
Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way as to minimize erosion;
(1)
Development shall preserve salient natural features, keep cut and
fill operations to a minimum and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff;
(2)
The top of a cut or the bottom of a fill section shall not be closer
than 10 feet to an adjoining property, unless otherwise specified in
this chapter, and in no instance shall a cut or a fill exceed a threeto-
one slope;
(3)
The development shall not unreasonably increase the rate or
volume of surface water runoff from the proposed site;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum;
(6)
(7) Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(8) Dust control methods shall be employed during dry conditions;
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be used to protect exposed
critical areas during development;
(9)
The permanent vegetation and mechanical erosion control
measures shall be installed as soon as practicable on the site, but
in no event later than six months after completion of construction;
(10)
Until the disturbed area is stabilized, sediment in the runoff water
shall be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt
traps or other acceptable methods;

Land reserved for open space purposes shall be of a character,
configuration and location suitable for the particular use intended.
A site intended to be used for active recreation purposes, such as a
playground or a play field, should be relatively level and dry, have a
total frontage on one or more streets of at least 200 feet, and have
no major dimensions of less than 200 feet. Sites selected primarily
for scenic or passive recreation purposes shall have such access
as the Planning Board may deem suitable and no less than 25 feet
of road frontage. The configuration of such sites shall be deemed
adequate by the Planning Board with regard to scenic attributes to
be preserved, together with sufficient areas for trails, lookouts, and
the like where necessary and appropriate.
(3)
Where the proposed subdivision is located on a lake, pond, river,
stream or the sea coast, a portion of the waterfront area, when
feasible, shall be included as reserved open space. The land so
reserved shall be at least 200 feet wide measured perpendicularly
from the normal high water mark.
(4)
Reserved land acceptable to the Planning Board and developer may
be dedicated to the Town as a condition of approval.

in amount, or where the applicant prefers, a payment in lieu of
dedication shall be calculated at the market value of the developed
land at the time of the subdivision, as determined by the Municipal
Tax Assessor, and deposited by the applicant into a municipal land
acquisition or improvement fund, which fund shall be used
exclusively for the purchase and development of neighborhood
sites for parks, playgrounds and other recreational purposes.
(6)
Heat. No radiant heat shall be perceptible beyond the lines of the lot on
which it originates.

Nonconforming signs.
Defined. A legally existing (grandfathered) nonconforming sign
is a sign that lawfully existed immediately prior to July 2009
which, as a result of the enactment of the 2009 Bar Harbor
Land Use Ordinance, or any subsequent amendment, presently
fails to comply with any of the requirements of the Land Use
Ordinance. Any other sign that fails to comply with any of the
requirements of this chapter or its amendments is an illegal
nonconformity.

to continue is hereby deemed illegal and shall cease or be
corrected immediately.
[2]
The burden of establishing that any nonconformity is a
legal nonconformity shall, in all cases, fall upon the owner
of such nonconformity and not upon the Town of Bar
Harbor.
[3]
Any legally existing nonconformity may be transferred and
the new owner may continue such nonconformity; however
nothing contained herein shall be construed to permit any
person or entity to display any sign in violation of any
other federal, state or Town of Bar Harbor statute,
ordinance or regulation.
[4]
Once converted to conformity, no sign shall revert to
nonconformity.
[5]
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
legally existing nonconforming signs shall be required to
comply with all other pertinent sections.
[6]
Continued use of nonconforming signs. The use or display of
any legally existing nonconforming sign may be continued, but
only in strict compliance with the following:
No nonconforming sign shall be enlarged, increased or
extended to occupy a greater area than it occupied when it
became nonconforming or changed in any other way that
increases its nonconformity.
[1]
A legally existing nonconforming sign may be replaced
only with a sign that complies with this chapter in all
respects, except that a legally existing nonconforming
sign, the replacement of which is necessitated by the
vandalism of persons other than the owner or his or her
agents, or by a force of nature, or by normal wear from
the elements, may be replaced or maintained with a sign
identical in all respects to the one being replaced.
[2]
Any sign removed pursuant to the provisions herein may
be replaced only with a sign that complies with this
chapter in all respects.
[3]
(c)

water.
(e)
No new structure shall be built on, over or abutting a pier,
wharf, dock or other structure extending below the normal
high-water line of a water body or within a wetland unless the
structure requires direct access to the water body or wetland
as an operational necessity. Buildings which are constructed
and used for the purpose of providing public safety services
that are related in any way to activities on or near a water
body shall be deemed to require direct access to the water
body as an operational necessity and shall be exempt from the
provisions of § 125-68.

Permanent structures extending over or below the shoreline
shall require a permit from the Department of Environmental
Protection pursuant to the Natural Resources Protection Act,
38 M.R.S.A. § 480-C.
(i)
Lot standards. All site plans for property located entirely or
partially in a shoreland zone shall demonstrate that all lots shall
comply with the following:
Land below the normal high water line of a water body or
upland edge of a wetland and land beneath roads serving
more than two lots shall not be included toward calculating
minimum lot area.
(a)
Lots located on opposite sides of a public or private road shall
be considered each a separate tract or parcel of land unless
such road was established by the owner of land on both sides
thereof after September 22, 1971.
(b)
The minimum width of any portion of any lot within 100 feet,
horizontal distance, of the normal high water line of a water
body or upland edge of a wetland shall be equal to or greater
than the shore frontage requirement for a lot with the
proposed use.
(c)
If any lot in a proposed subdivision has shore frontage on a
river, stream, brook, great pond or coastal wetland, none of
the lots created within the subdivision shall have a lot depth to
shore frontage ratio greater than five to one.
(d)
(7)
Roads and driveways. All site plans for development, including
roads, shall demonstrate that such roads shall be located,
constructed and maintained so that minimal soil erosion and
sedimentation of surface water results. Further, all roads,
driveways, drainage systems, culverts and related features
constructed in a shoreland area shall comply with the following:
Water crossings shall be kept to the minimum number
necessary;
(a)
(b) Bottoms of culverts shall be installed at stream bed elevation;

§ 125-68 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-68
109:543
All cut or fill banks and areas of exposed mineral soil shall be
revegetated or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible; and
(c)
Bridges or culverts of adequate size and design shall be
provided for all road crossings of watercourses which are to be
used when surface waters are unfrozen. The requirement for
a bridge or culvert may be waived by obtaining a permit from
the Planning Board.
(d)
Roads and driveways shall be set back at least 100 feet,
horizontal distance, from the normal high water line of a great
pond classified GPA or a river that flows to a great pond
classified GPA; 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal
high water line of other water bodies, tributary steams, or the
upland edge of a freshwater wetland; 25 feet from a significant
vernal pool; and 25 feet from the upland edge of a forested
wetland, unless no reasonable alternative exists, as
determined by the Planning Board, Planning Department or
Code Enforcement Officer, as applicable. If no other
reasonable alternative exists, the Planning Board, Planning
Department or Code Enforcement Officer, as applicable, may
reduce the road and/or driveway setback requirement, which
shall be to no less than 50 feet, horizontal distance, upon clear
showing by the applicant that appropriate techniques will be
used to prevent sedimentation of the water body, tributary
stream, or wetland. Such techniques may include but are not
limited to the installation of settling basins and/or the effective
use of additional ditch relief culverts and turnouts placed so
as to avoid sedimentation of the water body, tributary stream,
or wetland. On slopes of greater than 20%, the road and/
or driveway setback shall be increased by 10 feet, horizontal
distance, for each five-percent increase in slope above 20%.
This subsection shall apply neither to approaches to water
crossings nor to roads or driveways that provide access to
permitted structures and facilities located nearer to the
shoreline or tributary stream due to an operational necessity,
excluding temporary docks for recreational uses. Roads and
driveways providing access to permitted structures within the
setback area shall comply fully with the requirements of this
section, except for that portion of the road or driveway
necessary for direct access to the structure.
(e)
Existing public roads may be expanded within the legal road
right-of-way regardless of their setback from a water body,
tributary stream or wetland.
(f)
New roads and driveways are prohibited in a resource
protection district, except that the Planning Board may grant
a permit to construct a road or driveway to provide access to
permitted uses within the district. A road or driveway may also
be as approved by the Planning Board in a resource protection
(g)
§ 125-68 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-68
109:544
district, upon a finding that no reasonable alternative route
or location is available outside the district. When a road or
driveway is permitted in a resource protection district, the
road and/or driveway shall be set back as far as practicable
from the normal high water line of a water body, tributary
stream, significant vernal pool, or upland edge of a wetland.
Road and driveway banks shall be no steeper than a slope
of two horizontal to one vertical and shall be graded and
stabilized in accordance with the provisions for erosion and
sedimentation control contained in Subsection B(4) of this
section.
(h)
Road and driveway grades shall be no greater than 10%,
except for segments of less than 200 feet.
(i)
In order to prevent road and driveway surface drainage from
directly entering water bodies, tributary streams or wetlands,
roads and driveways shall be designed, constructed, and
maintained to empty onto an unscarified buffer strip at least
50 feet plus two times the average slope in width between the
outflow point of the ditch or culvert and the normal high water
line of a water body, tributary stream, significant vernal pool or
upland edge of a wetland. Surface drainage which is directed
to an unscarified buffer strip shall be diffused or spread out to
promote infiltration of the runoff and to minimize channelized
flow of the drainage through the buffer strip.
(j)
Ditch relief (cross-drainage) culverts, drainage dips and water
turnouts shall be installed in a manner effective in directing
drainage onto unscarified buffer strips before the flow in the
road or ditches gains sufficient volume or head to erode the
road, driveway, or ditch. To accomplish this, the following shall
apply:
Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and associated water
turnouts shall be spaced along the road or driveway at
intervals no greater than indicated in the following table:
Grade
Spacing
(feet)
0% to 2% 250
3% to 5% 200 to 135
6% to 10% 100 to 80
11% to 15% 80 to 60
16% to 20% 60 to 45
21% + 40
[1]
(k)
§ 125-68 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-68
109:545
Drainage dips may be used in place of ditch relief culverts
only where the grade is 10% or less.
[2]
On sections having slopes greater than 10%, ditch relief
culverts shall be placed at approximately a thirty-degree
angle downslope from a line perpendicular to the center
line of the road or driveway.
[3]
Ditch relief culverts shall be sufficiently sized and properly
installed in order to allow for effective functioning, and
their inlet and outlet ends shall be stabilized with
appropriate materials.
[4]
Ditches, culverts, bridges, dips, water turnouts and other
stormwater runoff control installations associated with roads
and driveways shall be maintained on a regular basis to assure
effective functioning.
(l)
Subsurface wastewater. All subsurface sewage disposal systems
shall be installed in conformance with the State of Maine
Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules and the following: a) the
clearing or removal of woody vegetation necessary to site a new
system and any associated fill extensions, shall not extend closer
than 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line
of a water body or the upland edge of a wetland and b) a holding
tank is not allowed for a first-time residential use in the Shoreland
District. All site plans for Shoreland areas shall demonstrate that
all subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be located in areas
of suitable soil of at least 1,000 square feet in size. The minimum
setback for subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be no less
than 100 horizontal feet from the shoreline of a perennial water
body. These requirements shall not be reduced by variance.
(9)
Soils. All land uses shall be located on soils in or upon which
the proposed uses or structures can be established or maintained
without causing adverse environmental impacts, including severe
erosion, mass soil movement, improper drainage and water
pollution, whether during or after construction. Proposed uses
requiring subsurface waste disposal, and commercial or industrial
development and other similar intensive land uses, shall require
a soils report, prepared by a state-certified professional based
on an on-site investigation. A certified professional may include
Maine certified soil scientist, Maine professional engineer, Maine
state-certified geologist or any other person who has training and
experience in the recognition and evaluation of soil properties. The
report shall be based upon the analysis of the characteristics of the
soil and surrounding land and water areas, maximum groundwater
elevation, presence of ledge, drainage conditions and other
pertinent data which the evaluator deems appropriate. Suitability
considerations shall be based primarily on criteria employed in the
National Cooperative Soil Survey as modified by on-site factors
(10)
§ 125-68 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-68
109:546
such as depth to water table and depth to refusal. The soils report
shall include recommendations for a proposed use to counteract
soil limitations where they exist.
Seasonal conversion. Before a seasonal dwelling located in a
shoreland area may be converted to a year-round principal
dwelling, a seasonal conversion permit shall be obtained from the
local Plumbing Inspector in accordance with 30-A M.R.S.A.
§ 4215(2). The granting of such a permit shall not be construed so
as to exempt the conversion from any other applicable provisions
of this chapter.
(11)
Principal and accessory structures. All site plans shall demonstrate
that all principal and accessory structures in a shoreland district
shall comply with the following:
All new principal and accessory structures shall be set back
at least 100 feet, horizontal distance, from the shoreline of
great ponds classified GPA and rivers that flow to great ponds
classified GPA and 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the
normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary
streams, significant vernal pools or the upland edge of a
wetland, and for properties located in the Shoreland General
Development III and IV District; except that in the Shoreland
General Development I and II Districts, the setback from the
shoreline shall be at least 25 feet, horizontal distance. In the
Resource Protection District, the setback requirement shall
be 250 feet, horizontal distance, except for structures, roads,
parking spaces or other regulated objects specifically allowed
in that district, in which case the setback requirements
specified above shall apply. In the Stream Protection District
any structure associated with a "municipal facility or grounds"
or with "uses or small structures accessory to permitted uses
or structures" be set back 75 feet, horizontal distance, from
the shoreline, unless a variance is obtained from the Board of
Appeals. In Resource Protection the setback requirement from
the shoreline for wind turbines shall be 250 feet horizontal
distance unless a variance is obtained from the Board of
Appeals. In the Stream Protection District the setback
requirement from shoreline for wind turbines or municipal
facilities and grounds shall be 75 feet horizontal distance
unless a variance is obtained from the Board of Appeals. In
addition: [Amended 11-8-2011; 6-12-2018]
The water body, tributary stream, or wetland setback
provision shall not apply to structures which require direct
access to the water body or wetland as an operational
necessity, such as piers, docks and retaining walls, nor to
other functionally water-dependent uses.
[1]
(a)
(12)
§ 125-68 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-68
109:547
Principal and accessory structures are exempt from
setbacks from a forested wetland of any size on lots in
existence prior to or on September 6, 2005, or from a
freshwater wetland less thatn 10 acres in size on lots in
existence prior to or on September 6, 2005.
[2]
For principal structures, water and wetland setback
measurements shall be taken from the top of a coastal
bluff that has been identified on coastal bluff maps as
being "highly unstable" or "unstable" by the Maine
Geological Survey pursuant to its "Classification of Coastal
Bluffs" and published on the most recent Coastal Bluff
Map. If the applicant and the permitting official(s) are
in disagreement as to the specific location of a highly
unstable or unstable bluff, or where the top of the bluff is
located, the applicant may, at his or her expense, employ a
Maine registered professional engineer, a Maine certified
soil scientist, a Maine state geologist, or other qualified
individual to make a determination. If agreement is still
not reached, the applicant may appeal the matter to the
Board of Appeals.
[3]
On a nonconforming lot of record on which only a
residential structure exists, and it is not possible to place
an accessory structure meeting the required water body,
tributary stream or wetland setbacks, the Code
Enforcement Officer may issue a permit to place a single
accessory structure, with no utilities, for the storage of
yard tools and similar equipment. Such accessory
structure shall not exceed 80 square feet in area nor eight
feet in height and shall be located as far from the shoreline
or tributary stream as practical and shall meet all other
applicable standards, including lot coverage and
vegetation-clearing limitations. In no case shall the
structure be located closer to the shoreline or tributary
stream than the principal structure.
[4]
Notwithstanding the dimensional, setback and coverage
requirements of the applicable district and the requirements of
§ 125-67H, stairways or similar structures may be allowed with
a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer for structures
400 square feet or less in area and from the Planning Board
for structures greater than 400 square feet in area to provide
shoreline access in areas of steep slopes or unstable soils
provided that the structure is limited to a maximum of four
feet in width; that the structure does not extend below or
over the normal high water line of a water body or upland
edge of a wetland (unless permitted by the Department of
Environmental Protection pursuant to the Natural Resources
Protection Act, 38 M.R.S.A. § 480-C); and that the applicant
(b)
§ 125-68 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-68
109:548
demonstrates that no reasonable access alternative exists on
the property.
Clearing or removal of vegetation for activities other than timber
harvesting. All site plans shall demonstrate that clearing of
vegetation for purposes of development shall be accomplished in
accordance with the following:
In a shoreland area zoned as a resource protection district
abutting a great pond, there shall be no cutting of vegetation
within the strip of land extending 75 feet, horizontal distance,
inland from the normal high water line, except to remove
safety hazards. Elsewhere, in any resource protection district,
the cutting and removal clearing of vegetation shall be limited
to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that
district.
(a)
Except in areas as described in Subsection B(13)(a) above, and
except to allow for the development of permitted uses, within
a strip of land extending 100 feet, horizontal distance, inland
from the normal high water line of a great pond classified
GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, 75
feet, horizontal distance, from any other water body, tributary
stream, stream, significant vernal pool or the upland edge
of a freshwater wetland, and 25 feet from the upland edge
of a forested wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be
preserved as follows:
There shall be no cleared opening greater than 250 square
feet in the forest canopy (or other existing woody
vegetation if a forested canopy is not present), as
measured from the outer limits of the tree or shrub crown.
However, a footpath not to exceed six feet in width, as
measured between tree trunks and/or shrub stems, is
allowed, provided that a cleared line of sight to the water
through the buffer strip is not created.
[1]
Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed,
provided that a well-distributed stand of trees and other
natural vegetation is maintained.
For the purposes of this section, a "well-distributed
stand of trees" adjacent to a great pond classified GPA,
or a river or stream flowing to a great pond classified
GPA, shall be defined as maintaining a rating score
of 24 or more in each twenty-five-foot by fifty-foot
square (1,250 square feet) area, as determined by the
following rating system:
[a]
[2]
(b)
(13)
§ 125-68 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-68
109:549
Diameter of Tree at 4 1/2
Feet Above Ground Level
(inches) Points
2 to less than or equal to 4 1
4 to less than or equal to 8 2
8 to less than or equal to 12 4
12 or greater 8
NOTES:
As an example, adjacent to a great pond, if a twentyfive-
foot by twenty-five-foot plot contains five trees
between two and four inches in diameter, four trees
between four and 12 inches in diameter, and two
trees over 12 inches in diameter, the rating score is:
(5 x 1) + (4 x 2) + (2 x 4) = 21 points. The twentyfive-
foot by twenty-five-foot plot contains trees worth
21 points.
Trees totaling nine points (21 - 12 = 9) may be
removed from the plot provided that no cleared
openings are created.
Adjacent to other water bodies, tributary streams,
significant vernal pools, and wetlands, a "welldistributed
stand of trees" is defined as maintaining
a minimum rating score of 16 per twenty-five-foot by
fifty-foot rectangular area.
The following shall govern in applying this point
system:
The twenty-five-foot by fifty-foot rectangular
plots must be established where the
landowner or lessee proposes clearing within
the required buffer;
[A]
Each successive plot must be adjacent to but
not overlap a previous plot;
[B]
Any plot not containing the required points
must have no vegetation removed except as
otherwise allowed by this chapter;
[C]
Any plot containing the required points may
have vegetation removed down to the
minimum points required or as otherwise
allowed by this chapter; and
[D]
[i]
[b]
§ 125-68 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-68
109:550
Where conditions permit, no more than 50%
of the points on any twenty-five-foot by fiftyfoot
rectangular area may consist of trees
greater than 12 inches in diameter.
[E]
For the purposes of this Subsection B(13)(b)[2],
"other natural vegetation" is defined as retaining
existing vegetation under three feet in height and
other ground cover and retaining at least five
saplings less than two inches in diameter at 4 1/
2 feet above ground level for each twenty-fivefoot
by fifty-foot rectangle area. If five saplings do
not exist, no woody stems less than two inches in
diameter can be removed until five saplings have
been recruited into the plot.
[ii]
Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than
40% of the total volume of trees four inches or more in
diameter, measured at 4 1/2 feet above ground level,
may be removed in any ten-year period.
[c]
In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitats,
existing vegetation under three feet in height and other
ground cover, including leaf litter and the forest duff layer,
shall not be cut, covered, or removed except to provide
for a footpath or other permitted uses as described in
Subsection B(13)(b)[1] and [2]. [Amended 6-12-2018]
[3]
Pruning of tree branches on the bottom 1/3 of the tree is
allowed.
[4]
In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation, when the
removal of storm-damaged, diseased, unsafe, or dead trees
results in the creation of cleared openings, these openings
shall be replanted with native tree species unless existing
new tree growth is present.
[5]
Subsection B(13)(b)[2] does not apply to those portions of
public recreational facilities adjacent to public swimming
areas as long as cleared areas are limited to the minimum
area necessary.
[6]
At distances greater than 100 feet, horizontal distance, from
a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond
classified GPA and 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the
normal high water line of any other water body, tributary
stream, significant vernal pools, or the upland edge of a
wetland, there shall be allowed on any lot, in any ten-year
period, selective cutting of not more than 40% of the volume
of trees four inches or more in diameter, measured 4 1/2 feet
above ground level. Tree removal in conjunction with the
(c)
§ 125-68 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-68
109:551
development of permitted uses shall be included in the fortypercent
calculation. For the purposes of these standards,
volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area. In no
event shall cleared openings for any purpose, including but not
limited to principal and accessory structures, driveways, lawns
and sewage disposal areas, exceed in the aggregate 25% of
the lot area within the shoreland district or 10,000 square feet,
whichever is greater, including land previously cleared. This
provision shall not apply to the shoreland general development
districts.
Legally existing nonconforming cleared openings may be
maintained but shall not be enlarged, except as allowed by this
chapter.
(d)
Fields and other cleared openings which have reverted to
primarily shrubs, trees, or other woody vegetation shall be
regulated under the provisions of Subsection B(13).
(e)
Water quality. No activity shall deposit on or into the ground or
discharge to the waters of the state any pollutant that, by itself
or in combination with other activities or substances, will impair
designated uses or the water classification of the water body,
tributary stream or wetland. [Amended 11-4-2008]
(14)
Archaeological sites. Any proposed land use activity involving
structural development or soil disturbance on or adjacent to sites
listed on or eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, as determined by the permitting authority, shall be
submitted by the applicant to the Maine Historic Preservation
Commission for review and comment at least 20 days prior to
action being taken by the Planning Board, the Code Enforcement
Officer or the Planning Department. The Planning Board, the Code
Enforcement Officer and the Planning Department shall consider
comments received from the Commission prior to rendering a
decision on the application.
(15)

Planned Unit Development - Outlying Area (PUD-O). [Amended
6-13-200678]
Purpose and intent.
The purpose of the Planned Unit Development - Outlying Area
is to provide an opportunity for residential subdivision
developments on large tracts of land to embody the principles
of:
Clustering of dwelling units to create buffers, open space
and recreation areas;
[1]
[2] Reduce infrastructure needs; and
Reducing negative impacts to the environment from the
development.
[3]
(a)
A PUD-O is also offered to seek development projects that:
[Amended 11-4-2008]
[1] Include affordable housing; or
Follow the applicable guidelines for the Great American
Neighborhood; and/or
[2]
[3] Follow the guidelines of low-impact development.
(b)
The intent of PUD-O is to encourage development which
benefits the Town as a whole by offering financial incentives.
The PUD seeks to provide for enhanced planned developments
by:
[1] Allowing greater freedom of design;
Improving the opportunity for flexibility and creativity in
the land development process; and
[2]
Undertaking techniques which foster community and
pedestrian access.
[3]
(c)
(1)
District and authority.
The Planned Unit Development-Outlying Area is an overlay
option to zoning in existing neighborhood districts. The
districts in which the PUD-O overlay is permitted are Bar

with a portion of land in the Shoreland Residential, Resource
Protection and Stream Protection Neighborhood Districts may
apply for a PUD-O; however these properties must still meet
shoreland standards contained in § 125-68. [Amended
6-8-2010]
Applicants may choose to permit a project as a PUD-O;
otherwise the underlying zoning requirements apply.
(b)
The Planning Board is the permitting authority for a PUD-O;
however, any other permits and approvals required must be
sought and received by the applicant. A PUD-O does not relieve
the applicant from obtaining any local, state and/or federal
permits that may be required.
(c)
PUD-O process.
The PUD-O process shall include the requirements of a
subdivision approval process as outlined in Articles V and VI.

diagram graphically identifying major physical features of the
site, including but not limited to existing structures and
improvements, land cover type, wetlands, watercourses and
significant vernal pools, slopes greater than 20%, and district
boundaries. The site analysis shall identify the context of the
neighborhood surrounding the project area by showing
graphically the relationship of proposed new structures or
alterations to nearby preexisting structures in terms of
character and intensity the of use (e.g., scale, materials,
setbacks, roof and cornice lines, and other major design
elements). The analysis shall also include a graphic illustration
of the visual impacts and viewshed alterations that the
proposed development will have on neighboring properties
because of the location and configuration of proposed
structures, parking areas, open space, and gradient changes.
[Amended 11-4-2008]
(b)
At the sketch plan submission, the Planning Board may require
the applicant to prepare a plan to show a possible layout for
a conventional subdivision application. This plan may be used

Permitted uses. The Planning Board may consider the allowance
of multifamily dwellings not otherwise allowed in the underlying
district when the construction of multifamily dwelling structures
will result in the creation and/or retention of larger buffers, open
space and recreation areas that might not be possible otherwise in
the development, reduce negative impacts on the environment and
will be consistent with the purpose and intent of this provision.
(5)
Intensity of development.
Number of allowable dwelling units.
Applications shall show the density allowed for a
conventional subdivision application. This density shall be
used in calculations for requisite open space, affordable

gardens;
[1]
[2] Compatible design;
Providing adequate access to local goods, services and
employment; and
[3]
Reducing negative impacts to the environment from the
development.
[4]
A PUD-V is also offered to seek development projects that:
[1] Include affordable housing;
Follow the guidelines for the Great American
Neighborhood;
[2]
[3] Complement the visual character of the district; and
Encourage infill development, specifically allowing for
growth where Town services, roads, and pedestrian access
already exist.
[4]
(b)
The intent of PUD-V is to encourage development which
benefits the Town as a whole by offering financial incentives.
The PUD seeks to provide for enhanced planned developments
by:

to zoning in existing neighborhood districts. The districts in
which the PUD-V overlay is permitted are Downtown Village
I and II; Downtown Residential; Bar Harbor Residential; and
Village Residential, where served by the Town sewer system;
and Hulls Cove Business, where served by the Town sewer
system. Properties in the above-noted neighborhood districts
with a portion of land in the Shoreland Residential, Shoreland
Commercial I and II, Resource Protection and Stream
Protection Neighborhood Districts may apply for a PUD-V;
however, these properties must still meet shoreland standards
contained in § 125-68. [Amended 6-8-2010]

prepare a site analysis diagram graphically identifying major
physical features of the site, including but not limited to
existing structures and improvements, land cover type,
wetlands, watercourses and significant vernal pools, slopes
greater than 20%, and district boundaries. The site analysis
shall identify context of the neighborhood surrounding the
project area by showing graphically the relationship of
proposed new structures or alterations to nearby preexisting
structures in terms of character and intensity of use (e.g.,
scale, materials, setbacks, roof and cornice lines, and other
major design elements). The analysis shall also include a
graphic illustration of the visual impacts and viewshed
alterations that the proposed development will have on
neighboring properties because of the location and

Lot area requirement. A wireless communications tower may be
placed on a legally nonconforming lot that does not meet the
dimensional requirements of the districts it is in after a finding by
the Board of Appeals that such a tower siting will not jeopardize
the health, safety and welfare of surrounding lot owners. This
requirement does not apply to towers and antennas that are
exempted in § 125-69T(2).
(5)
Setbacks.
The center of the base of any wireless communications tower
must be set back a minimum of 105% of the tower height or the
required minimum setback of the district in which it is located,
whichever is greater.

Co-location requirements.
Existing towers. Applicants for site plan review for a new
communications tower must send written notice by prepaid
first-class United States Mail to all other communications
tower owners and licensed communications providers in the
Town utilizing existing towers, stating their siting needs and/
or co-location capabilities in an effort to meet the tower colocation
requirement. Evidence that this notice requirement
has been fulfilled shall be submitted to the Planning Board
and shall include a name and address list, copy of the notice
which was sent, and a statement, under oath, that the notices
were sent as required. An application for a new wireless
communications tower must include evidence that existing or
previously approved towers cannot accommodate the
communications equipment (antennas, cables, etc.) planned
for the proposed tower. Such evidence would be:
Planned, necessary equipment would exceed the
structural capacity of existing and approved towers,
considering the existing and planned use of those towers,
and existing and approved towers cannot be reinforced to
accommodate planned or equivalent equipment.
[1]
Planned equipment will cause electromagnetic frequency
interference with other existing or planned equipment for
that tower, and the interference cannot be prevented or
mitigated.
[2]
Existing or approved towers do not have space on which
planned equipment can be placed so it can function
effectively.

will be primarily viewed against soils or trees shall be painted
colors matching these landscapes, while elements which rise
above the horizon shall be painted a blue gray that matches
the typical sky color at that location unless the Planning Board
determines that an alternative proposal will minimize visibility.
(e)
The applicant shall provide a plan to camouflage the proposed
facility to the greatest extent possible.
(f)
The Planning Board may require special design of the facilities
where findings of particular sensitivity are made (e.g.,
proximity to historic or aesthetically significant structures,
views and/or community features).
(g)

preventing access to the site shall be incorporated into the
(h)
(9)
§ 125-69 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-69
109:588
facility, as needed, to reduce the potential for trespass and
injury.
Only security lighting is permitted. All outdoor lighting shall
employ full cutoff (i.e., night-sky friendly) fixtures to prevent or
reduce light pollution and glare. Signals, lights, or illumination
shall not be permitted on a communications tower unless
required by the Federal Communications Commission, Federal
Aviation Administration, or other federal agency.
(i)
Advertising and commercial signs shall not be permitted on a
communications facility.
(j)
Guy wires shall not be permitted as part of a communications
facility.
(k)
Location. All communications facilities shall be located so as to
minimize their visibility and to minimize the total number of towers
in the Town. The following measures shall guide the location.
Communications facilities shall not be sited in areas of high
visibility as determined by the Planning Board to meet the
purpose of this chapter unless the facility is designed to
minimize its profile by blending with the surrounding existing
natural and man-made environment in such a manner as to
be effectively unnoticeable. A communications tower that is
located within the viewshed of a scenic vista, scenic landscape,
or scenic road as determined by the Planning Board shall not
exceed the height of vegetation at the proposed location.
(a)
No facility shall be located so as to create a significant impact
to the health or survival of rare, threatened or endangered
plant or animal species. [Amended 11-4-2008]

(c) No facility shall be located within a shoreland district.
No facility shall be located within 1,500 feet of a municipal
school, private compulsory school or child-care center as
defined in this chapter, at the time of application. [Amended
11-4-2008]
(d)
(10)
Standards. In addition to the criteria and standards listed in
§ 125-67, these additional criteria and standards shall be utilized
by the Planning Board in reviewing applications for site plan review
of proposed communications facilities:
Mitigation measures have been utilized to screen antennas and
towers from view from public rights-of-way or scenic vistas,
either by landscaping, fencing or other architectural
screening.
(a)
Antennas shall be as small as technically possible in order to
minimize visual impact.
(b)
(11)
§ 125-69 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-69
109:589
Creative design measures have been employed to camouflage
facilities by integrating them with existing buildings and
among other uses.
(c)
Other technically feasible sites have been investigated, and if
available, the proposed facility has been relocated in order to
minimize the effect of the location on visually sensitive areas
such as residential communities, historical areas, open space
areas and sites identified on the Favorite Places and Distinctive
Features Map in the Comprehensive Plan.
(d)
Co-location, where technically feasible and visually desirable,
on an existing tower, has been investigated, and if technically
and financially feasible, the proposed facility is co-located.
(e)
Use of an existing community facility site, such as utility poles,
has been investigated as a potential site for a tower, antennas
and other equipment and, if available and technically feasible
and visually desirable, is proposed as the site for the facility.
(f)
Adequate bonding for removal of the communications tower,
required as set forth below in § 125-69T(13)(c) has been
submitted.
(g)
Amendments. Any change to proposed towers requires site plan
approval. Once a tower has been erected and is operational,
changes to the facility that do not increase the height of the facility
shall not require site plan approval unless such changes exceed
the design criteria and additional standards and criteria previously
approved in the original site plan approval. If the height of the
facility will not increase and the design standards and additional
standards and criteria previously approved in the original site plan
approval remain consistent, changes to the facility shall require a
permit from the Code Enforcement Officer.
(12)
Removal of communications facilities.
If the tower ceases to be used or if the use of the tower
is abandoned for any reason, it shall be the responsibility
of the owner of the facility to notify the Code Enforcement
Officer of the date of abandonment or cessation of use. If the
owner fails to give the required notice, the CEO shall make
a determination of such date, which determination shall be
conclusive as to the date of abandonment or cessation of use.
(a)
In the case of a tower which is abandoned or the use of which
ceases, it shall be removed within one year of its abandonment
or cessation of use. All aboveground structures, equipment,
foundations, guy anchors, utilities and access roads or
driveways specifically constructed to service the tower,
structures, equipment or utilities shall be removed and the
(b)
(13)
§ 125-69 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-69
109:590
land returned to a condition as near to the original
preconstruction condition as possible.
At the time of approval, the applicant for a new tower shall
submit to the Town a bond or other financial surety outlined
in Article IX, Performance Guarantees, of the Land Use
Ordinance, to be approved by the Finance Director, in the
amount of 150% of the estimated demolition cost of the tower
and the removal of all accessory facilities as described above,
such cost to be determined by an independent registered
professional engineer in the State of Maine and the amount
shall be acceptable to the Town's Finance Director. The bond
or other financial surety shall be in effect for as long as the
tower is in place.
(c)
The bond shall be used by the Town to demolish a tower
which is abandoned or the use of which has ceased, accessory
facilities and associated abandoned structures only if the
owner has not done so within the required one-year period.
(d)
The owner may apply to the Finance Director for release of the
bond at such time that the owner or assigns remove the tower,
accessory facilities and associated abandoned structures as
described above and such completed removal is found to be
satisfactory by the Code Enforcement Officer. The cost of
inspection by the Code Enforcement Officer shall be borne by
the owner.
(e)
Inspections and monitoring. The following procedure shall be
undertaken by the owner of the tower:
Inspection of towers by an independent tower inspection firm
shall be performed to insure structural integrity. Such
inspections shall be performed as follows:
Monopole towers at least once every seven years following
completion of construction. The inspection shall take place
between the sixth and seventh year of the repeat
sequence.
[1]
Self-supporting towers at least once every five years
following completion of construction. The inspection shall
take place between the fourth and fifth year of the repeat
sequence.
[2]
(a)
The inspection report shall be submitted to the Code
Enforcement Officer within 30 days of its receipt by the tower
owner. Based upon the results of the inspection, the CEO may
require repair or demolition of the tower.
(b)
The cost of such inspections, reports, repairs or demolition
required under this Subsection T shall be borne entirely by the
(c)
(14)
§ 125-69 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-69
109:591
tower owner. Required repairs shall be completed within 90
days or less as required by the CEO for safety reasons.
Failure to provide required inspection reports in the required
time schedule shall be deemed prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
(d)
The owner of a wireless communications facility shall pay for
an independent radio frequency engineer approved by the
Town in accordance with § 125-65D of the Land Use Ordinance
to evaluate the electromagnetic radiation emitted from all
users of the wireless communications facility every year, with
the first evaluation occurring within 30 days after transmission
begins. The levels of electromagnetic radiation emissions must
comply with the most up-to-date FCC standards at the time
of the monitoring test. A report detailing the monitoring test
shall be submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer within 30
days of completion of the monitoring test. Failure to provide
required inspection reports in the required time schedule shall
be a violation of the Land Use Ordinance.
(e)
Should the monitoring of a facility reveal that the
electromagnetic radiation emitted from the site exceeds the
current FCC standards and guidelines, the owner(s) of all
facilities utilizing the site shall be notified. In accordance with
FCC requirements, the owner(s) must immediately reduce
power or cease operation as necessary to protect persons
having access to the site, tower, or antennas. In addition, the
owner(s) shall submit to the Town an analysis of what caused
the problem and a plan for the reduction of emissions to a
level in compliance with the current FCC standards within
10 business days. Failure to accomplish this reduction of
emissions within 15 business days of initial notification of
noncompliance shall be a violation of the Land Use Ordinance.
(f)

(10)
Purpose of conditional use. The purpose of this section is to establish
procedures and standards to enable the Planning Board to review
applications for conditional uses. A "conditional use" is a structure
or use that is generally not appropriate in a given district, but with
restrictions and if controlled as to location, size and off-site impacts
may have no adverse effects upon the public health, safety or welfare,
surrounding properties, the natural environment, or on municipal
services. The only structures or uses that shall be permitted as
conditional uses are those approved as conditional uses by the Planning
Board. Conditional use may not be applied to uses in the Shoreland
Districts. [Added 11-2-2010; amended 6-12-2018]
Conditional use approval required. A building, structure or parcel
of land may be used for a conditional use if the use is specifically
listed as a conditional use within a specified land use district.
Conditional use approval is granted by the Planning Board. The
process for conditional use approval shall include all pertinent
sections of Article V and Article XIII.
(1)
Process for review of conditional use.
A conditionally permitted use shall be subject to the review
procedures for major site plan included in § 125-61 of Article
V.

A conditionally permitted use shall be eligible for a
modification of standards pursuant to § 125-64 of Article
V.
[2]
(b)
Action on the application for a conditional use permit. The Planning
Board may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the
application for a conditional use permit. In addition to the findings
required by § 125-67, the Planning Board may authorize issuance
of a conditional use permit based upon the following findings:
The proposed use will not create hazards to vehicular or
pedestrian traffic on the streets, roads and sidewalks serving
the proposed use as determined by the size and condition
of such streets, roads, sidewalks, lighting, drainage, intensity
of use by both pedestrians and vehicles, and the visibility
afforded to pedestrians and the operators of motor vehicles;
(a)
The proposed use will not create nuisances to neighboring
properties because of odors, fumes, glare, hours of operation,
noise, vibration or fire hazard, or unreasonably restricted
access of light and air to neighboring properties. Furthermore,
the proposed use will allow abutting property owners
continued peaceful enjoyment their land;
(b)
The proposed location for the use has no peculiar physical
characteristics due to its size, shape, topography, or soils that
will create or aggravate adverse environmental impacts on
surrounding properties;
(c)
The proposed use will not have an adverse impact on
significant scenic vistas or on significant wildlife habitat that
could be avoided by reasonable modification of the plan.
(d)
The proposed use will not adversely affect the value of adjacent
properties; and
(e)
The design and external appearance of any proposed building
will constitute an attractive and compatible addition to its
neighborhood as determined by the Design Review Board
pursuant to § 125-114.
(f)
(3)
Conditions of approval.
The Planning Board shall attach conditions to its approval of a
conditional use to ensure the findings noted above will be met.
(a)
(4)

conditions of approval be recorded in the Hancock County
Registry of Deeds prior to issuance of a building permit.
(b)
Duration of conditional use approval.
Provided that all conditions and standards of approval are met,
a conditional use shall be a continuing grant of permission
for as long as the property is used for such purposes. The
conditional use shall expire if the owner:
Physically alters the property and/or structure so it can no
longer be used for the conditional use; or
[1]
Ceases to use the property for the approved conditional
use for one year or more; or
[2]
Fails to initiate the operation or conduct of the conditional
use within one year of the date of the Planning Board's
vote to grant said approval.
[3]
(a)
A conditional use may be expanded in area or function only
with the granting of a new conditional use approval by the
Planning Board. Other modifications to an approved plan shall
be subject to § 125-61G on minor site plan.

completion or that progress has been prevented by reasons beyond the
control of the developer and that any required performance guarantees
have been updated accordingly and revised to provide for increased
costs. Failure of the developer to abide by the time requirements of
this subsection shall render the approval null and void and require the

or use may proceed further. The Planning Board reserves the right to
refuse an extension for commencement or completion if the applicant

Example of a set with an odd number of values:
Set: {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
There are five values in this set.
Median = (n+1)/2th value, where n = the number of values in the
set
M = (5+1)/2
M = 6/2
Median = 3, the third number in the set.
The median value is 5.

Example of a set with an even number of values:
Set: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
M = (6+1)/2
M = 7/2
M = 3.5
The two middle values are 3 and 5.
The median value is the average of these two numbers, or 4, i.e.
(3+5)/2.

Application submission and review procedures. The applicant shall
prepare and submit an application for a certificate of appropriateness
together with supporting documentation that meets the requirements
set forth below, provided that all time limits provided in this section
may be extended by the mutual agreement of the applicant and the
Board. The submission shall be processed as follows:
The application shall be submitted to the Planning Department at
least seven days prior to the meeting of the Review Board at which
the application will be considered.
(1)
Upon receipt of an application, the Planning Department shall
give the applicant a dated receipt and review the submission for
completeness within three days.
(2)
If the Planning Department finds that the application is complete,
that all required information has been submitted, the Planning
Department shall place the application on the agenda for the next
scheduled meeting of the Board.
(3)
If the Planning Department finds the application to be incomplete,
it shall return it to the applicant with a written indication of the
additional information and/or revisions needed and shall inform
the applicant that the application will not be processed until a
complete application is submitted. If an application is returned to
the applicant on the basis that it is incomplete, the applicant may
appeal this decision, in writing, to the Design Review Board and the
Board shall consider the completeness of the application at its next
meeting. If the Board finds that the application is complete, it shall
continue with the review of the application.
(4)
The Board shall consider an application at its next scheduled
meeting after it is determined to be complete. The applicant and/or
his/her representative(s) shall attend the meeting and shall explain
the proposed activities to the Board and answer any questions
about the application. The burden is on the applicant to
demonstrate that the application meets the requirements of
§ 125-114. The applicant and/or his/her representative(s) may
present any information to the Board that he/she feels will
demonstrate compliance with the standards.
(5)
The Board shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or deny
an application within 30 days of its initial consideration. The Board
may extend this period to 45 days for projects involving the
construction of a new building or an addition to an existing
building. If the Board fails to act within the period provided the
application shall be deemed to have been denied.
(6)

Code Enforcement Officer of its decision and instruct the Code
Enforcement Officer as to whether a certificate of appropriateness
shall be issued.
Coordination with site plan review.
The design review and site plan review requirements deal with
different aspects of a project. Some of the activities subject to
design review may also require that the applicant obtain site plan
approval from the Planning Board. These include the construction
of a new building, projects involving the expansion or renovation of
an existing building, and situations in which the use of the building
is being changed.
(1)
Prior to preparing an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, the applicant should review this chapter and/or
meet with the Town Planner to determine if site plan approval is
required in addition to design review. If site plan review is also
required, the applicant may submit concurrent applications to the
two Boards and may request that the two applications be reviewed
concurrently.
(2)
The application for design review must be consistent with the
activities and design submitted as part of the site plan review
application. If either Board's review and approval of the plan
results in revisions or conditions which affect aspects of the project
subject to the other Board's review, both the applications must
be modified accordingly. Projects subject to both design review
and site plan review must comply with both approvals and any
conditions imposed as part of the approvals.

issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, while the second allows for
delayed demolition if a certificate of appropriateness is not issued.
Immediate demolition.
If the owner of a building or structure classified as historic
seeks to demolish the building or structure in whole or in part,
the Review Board may approve the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness for the demolition if the property owner shows
that the application meets the standards of § 125-114F(2).
(a)
If a certificate of appropriateness is approved, the applicant
may immediately apply to the Code Enforcement Officer for a
demolition permit. If the Board fails to approve the issuance
of a certificate of appropriateness permitting the demolition,
the applicant may proceed under the delayed demolition
procedures.
(b)

§ 125-113 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-113
109:683
Delayed demolition.
If the Board fails to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the
owner of a building or structure classified as historic may
apply for a permit to demolish the building in accordance with
the following procedures. The building may be demolished;
provided, however, that before a demolition permit is issued,
four months' notice of the proposed demolition shall be given.
(a)
The objective of this provision is to further the purposes of this
article by preserving historic buildings which are important to
the education, culture, traditions, and the economic values of
the Town and to afford the Town, interested persons, historic
societies or organizations the opportunity to acquire or to
arrange for the preservation of such buildings.
(b)
The Board may at any time during such stay approve a
certificate of appropriateness in accordance with
§ 125-114F(2) in which event a demolition permit shall be
issued without further delay.
(c)
Public notice of the pending demolition shall be provided as
follows:
Notice of the proposed demolition shall be posted on the
premises of the building or structure proposed for
demolition in a location clearly visible from the street,
shall be mailed to the Maine State Historic Preservation
Office, and shall be delivered to the Bar Harbor Historical
Society.
[1]
Notice shall be published in a newspaper of general local
circulation at least three times prior to demolition, the
final notice of which shall be not less than 15 days prior to
the date of the permit, and the first notice of which shall
be published no more than 15 days after the application
for a permit to demolish is filed.

(2)
Submission requirements.
The activities covered by design review vary widely in their scope
and complexity and, hence, in the type and amount of information
needed by the Review Board to determine if the proposed activities
are consistent with the standards of this section.
(1)
In all cases, the burden is on the applicant to provide the Board
with adequate information to determine the appropriateness of the
project.
(2)
To aid the applicant in preparing his/her application, the minimum
submission requirements shown in the following table have been
established. Applicants should submit additional information if they

feel that is necessary or helpful in demonstrating that the proposed
activities are consistent with the standards.
The following exhibits128 shall be submitted as part of an
application for a certificate of appropriateness. Projects involving
more than one activity must submit the exhibits required for each
of the proposed activities. For example, a project involving the
painting of an existing building and the installation of a new sign
is required to submit the exhibits required for both aspects of the
project.
(4)
In reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the
Design Review Board shall approve the issuance of a certificate if
it finds the application and proposed activities are consistent with
the following standards, or that they will be consistent as a result of
conditions of approval imposed on the application.
The standards are broken down into five categories:
(a) Standards relating to visual compatibility;
Standards for materials and design details for structural
projects;
(b)
Standards for materials and design details for accessory
projects;
(c)
(d) Standards for signs; and
(e) Standards for historic buildings.
(1)
In reviewing applications, the Board shall consider the appropriate
sections of each of these categories and shall find the project
in conformance with all relevant provisions before approving the
issuance of a certificate of appropriateness.
(2)
Appendix B contains a list of locally significant buildings within
the district that reflect the type of design that these standards
are intended to foster. These buildings should be viewed as the
standard of design against which proposed projects are judged.
The intention of providing this list is not that new proposals should
seek to replicate the specific design of one of these buildings but
rather to provide examples of the overall level of design that is
deemed to be appropriate within the district. In addition, pictorial
examples of acceptable treatments of various features are provided
for many of the standards in the Design Review Handbook.
(3)
A.
Standards relating to visual compatibility. The following standards for
visual compatibility shall apply to all activities subject to a certificate
B.
128. Editor's Note: See Table 2 included at the end of this chapter.
§ 125-113 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-114
109:685
of appropriateness within the Design Review Overlay District. These
standards are intended to guide the design, construction, and
maintenance of buildings, improvements, signs, and other visual
features within the district to assure that they complement the visual
character of the district and to serve as a foundation for the review
of an application for a certificate of appropriateness. These standards
are intended to be general statements of design principles to which
activities within the district are required to conform.
Building height. The height of new buildings and additions or
modifications to existing buildings shall be visually compatible with
adjacent buildings as seen from public streets. Where an
established pattern of building heights exists, the height or
apparent height of new, expanded, or modified buildings as seen
from the public street shall maintain a complementary pattern.
(1)
Building scale and design.
The size of a building and the building mass in relationship
to the site and surrounding features shall visually complement
the buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually
related.
(a)
Where there is an established pattern of building size or scale
as viewed from a public street, new buildings or modifications
to existing buildings shall be designed to maintain the existing
(b)
(2)
§ 125-114 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-114
109:686
pattern. If there is an established pattern of buildings with
narrow facades on the street, a new building shall maintain
this visual pattern by limiting the size of the street facade or by
designing the facade to appear as a number of narrow facades
or through other approaches.
The design of buildings shall visually complement the district.
The design of buildings shall also conform to the following
standards:
The facade facing the street shall be treated as a front
facade. The facade shall incorporate pedestrian-scale
design features such as doors and windows to create a
character that complements the district. Windows or
architectural treatments designed to simulate windows
shall comprise no less than 20% of the exterior wall
surface. The facade shall be designed to avoid large areas
of blank wall space.
[1]
Ground floor facades facing a public street must
incorporate arcades, display windows, awnings, or other
features to add visual interest to the building.
[2]
Buildings used for retail or other public uses shall be
designed to have clearly defined entrances that are
visually compatible with the visual character of the
district.
[3]
Roofs shall be designed to complement visually the overall
visual character of the district. A new building shall have
a roofline that is similar to adjacent buildings if there
is an established pattern of rooflines. If there is not an
established pattern, new buildings shall have pitched or
gabled roofs to the extent practical. If a pitched roof is
not practical, false fronts or other design elements shall be
used to create the appearance of a pitched roof. Accessory
buildings, canopies, and other structures shall have
rooflines that are visually compatible with the roofline of
the principal building.
[4]
The treatment of accessory buildings and structures shall
be compatible with the principal building and shall use
similar materials, details, and level of trim.
[5]
New buildings with more than 5,000 square feet of first
floor area shall be designed so that the building scale
is visually compatible with the character of the district.
The overall mass of the building shall be visually broken
into smaller elements through the physical layout of the
building and/or the design of the facades.
[6]
(c)
§ 125-114 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-114
109:687
Proportionality of the front or street facade.
The ratio of the width of the front or street facade to the
building height shall complement the visual character of the
district.
(a)
Where an established pattern of facade proportion exists, new
or modified buildings shall maintain the established pattern.
If there is a pattern of tall, narrow buildings, a new building
that is wider than it is tall is inappropriate unless the facade
is broken into segments that maintain the established
proportions.
(b)
(3)
§ 125-114 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-114
109:688
Proportionality of windows.
The ratio of the width of windows to the height of the windows
shall complement the visual character of the district.
(a)
Modifications to existing buildings shall maintain the existing
proportionality. The modification of the facade of existing
buildings to change or eliminate windows shall be done in a
manner that maintains the established relationship of windows
to wall. The "bricking up" of windows is discouraged unless the
relationship can be maintained in other ways.
(b)
Where an established pattern of window proportions exists
among a group of buildings or along a block face, new or
modified buildings shall maintain the established pattern.
(c)
(4)
§ 125-114 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-114
109:689
Building spacing. In the Downtown Village Districts, where an
established pattern exists with respect to the placement of
buildings on the lot vis-a-vis the lot lines, new or modified buildings
shall reflect the established pattern to the extent allowed by the
setback provisions of the district in which they are located. In an
area where the existing buildings all extend the full width of the lot,
constructing a new building so that it is set back from the lot line
is not consistent with this guideline unless the setback is required
to meet zoning requirements. [Amended 11-3-2009; 6-8-2010]
(5)
Relationship of the building to the street.
The relationship of a new or modified building or structure
with the street shall visually complement neighboring
buildings, the overall character of the district, and other
buildings to which it is visually related to the extent permitted
by the setback requirements of the district in which it is
located.
(a)
Where there is an established front setback pattern, new
buildings or structures shall be located to maintain the
established pattern if permitted by the zoning requirements.
If an established pattern does not exist, new buildings shall
be located in a manner that is compatible with the overall
(b)
(6)
§ 125-114 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-114
109:690
character of the district. New or reconstructed buildings shall
be located on the lot so that the building is set back from the
street no more than the average of the setbacks for buildings
in similar locations in the district.
For buildings on corner lots, the setback relationship on both
streets shall be maintained through the placement of buildings
and other site features.
(c)
Pedestrian relationships and facilities.
Where sidewalks exist in front of the parcel, the site shall be
designed to provide for pedestrian access to the front entrance
of the building without the need to cross parking areas or
access drives.
(a)
The walkway to the front entrance shall be constructed with
materials which contrast with the paving of the vehicular
areas, that provide a safe and inviting access to the building,
and that are visually compatible with other pedestrian facilities
in the neighborhood.
(b)
If a sidewalk along the street is interrupted or crossed by a
proposed driveway, access road, or other vehicular facility, the
sidewalk material must be maintained across the driveway or
another visually compatible method used to clearly delineate
the sidewalk from the drive.
(c)

§ 125-114 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-114
109:691
§ 125-114 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-114
109:692
Motor vehicle facilities and services. The location and design of
facilities for motor vehicles, including parking lots, driveways,
access roads, drive-through facilities, and service and fueling
areas, shall visually complement the overall character of the
district. The design of the site shall also conform to the following
standards:
Vehicular facilities shall not be located between the front of the
building and the street.
(a)
Access drives, driveways, and entrances or exits to drivethrough
services shall not pass between the building and the
sidewalk where a sidewalk exists.
(b)
(c) Parking lots shall be located to the side or rear of the building.
Overhead doors and service areas shall be located on the side
or rear of the building and must be screened from view from a
public street.
(d)
Drive-through services shall be designed to keep vehicular
activity to the side and/or rear of the building and shall prevent
the queuing of vehicles between the front of the building and
the street or in other areas where it is visually incompatible.
(e)
(8)
Multiple buildings on a lot in the Town Hill Business District. In
the Town Hill Business District, the layout of buildings on a lot
shall reflect the layout of other lots in the district with multiple
buildings. The arrangement of the buildings should be visually
compatible with the street and with the buildings on the lot.
[Added 11-3-2009]
(9)
Viewshed in Town Hill Business District. Building height and
placement are subject to further review in the Town Hill Business
District to determine any visual impacts to retain the vista along
Route 102 from the Crooked Road intersection to the Pine Heath
Road intersection. [Added 11-3-2009]
(10)
Standards for materials and design details for structural projects. The
following standards are intended to assure that proposals conform to
the quality of design that has historically been associated with buildings
within the district. The structural standards have been designed to
promote compatibility with Bar Harbor's historic character and its
scenic location. Certain types of design are inappropriate within the
designated Design Review Overlay Districts since they will not meet
these standards and thus do not enhance the existing visual character
or preserve Bar Harbor's uniqueness. [Amended 11-3-2009]
Construction standards. With the advent of many new exterior
materials, the standards are not intended to prohibit the use of
all new materials. Therefore, any quality material that simulates
traditional features will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The
(1)
C.
§ 125-114 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-114
109:693
following standards apply to the construction of new buildings,
additions to existing buildings, reconstruction, and major
renovations:
Siding material.
Siding is applied as the exposed surface on the outside
walls of buildings to provide a barrier against the
penetration and infiltration of weather and at the same
time enhance the visual and architectural quality of the
structure in keeping with other buildings in the district.
The selected siding should be visually compatible with
other exterior finishes on the building and with those
buildings to which it is visually related.
[1]
The siding used on the building should be a material that
is in common use within the overlay district. The following
are appropriate siding materials:
[a] Clapboards/shiplap.
[b] Shingles/shakes.
Stucco/concrete. Stucco with wood trim interruption
(English Tudor) is acceptable. Concrete block and
poured or precast concrete are acceptable for
foundation and fire walls but are generally not
appropriate for wall surfaces that can be seen from a
public street. Masonry products designed to replicate
other appropriate materials are acceptable siding.
[c]
[d] Brick.
[e] Stone.
Vinyl/metal siding. Vinyl or metal siding designed to
replicate traditional siding material is appropriate but
flat or corrugated metal or plastic panels are
inappropriate as siding within the district.
[f]
In the Town Hill Business District, barn board, and
board and batten.
[g]
[2]
Unfinished plywood or composite flat sheet products such
as T-111 are not appropriate siding materials, except for
areas that cannot be seen from a public street.
[3]
(a)
Exterior finishes. The exterior finish of a structure represents
the final completion stage. Although this stage is one of the
simplest to alter, it is one of the most visible aspects of a
building, therefore great care must be taken in the selection of
the exterior finish for any structure. The following standards
shall be used for determining acceptable finish choices:
(b)
§ 125-114 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-114
109:694
The colors shall be based upon the architectural style of
the structure as well as the period in which it was built;
[1]
The selected colors shall reflect hues and shades which
were available in the era and style depicted;
[2]
The paint colors shall be harmonious to and blend in with
the immediately adjacent structures in the area.
[3]
Windows.
Windows are glassed openings in the exterior walls of
buildings to admit light and air, allow for viewing, permit
merchandise display, and to enhance the architectural
beauty of the structure. The windows in a building shall
be visually compatible. Almost any style is appropriate
as long as the size is proportional to the building and
maintains the architectural continuity of the building.
[1]
Materials are appropriate if they simulate traditional
materials or are visually compatible with other
components of the building.
[2]
(c)
Doors and doorways (in the Downtown Village Districts only).
[Amended 6-8-2010]
Doors are a means of safe and orderly entrance to and
egress from buildings. As the entrance to the building, the
front or main door is often the focal point of the principal
facade. Therefore, care must be taken in designing the
doorway and selecting a door that is visually compatible
with the structure.
[1]
Doors and doorways shall conform to the following
standards:
Major store entrance doors shall be recessed from the
property line so as not to interfere with pedestrian
traffic when they are opened.
[a]
Front doors shall have transoms above to the full
height of store windows if this is consistent with the
established pattern of other entrance doors.
[b]
[2]
(d)
Roofing.
Roofing is intended to protect the horizontal portions of a
building from the penetration and infiltration of weather
while maintaining the architectural integrity of the
structure. The roofing material and color, if visible from a
public street, shall be selected to be visually compatible
with the style of the building and the other exterior
finishes and colors.
[1]
(e)
§ 125-114 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-114
109:695
In the Downtown Village Districts, brightly colored metal,
plastic or fiberglass roofing is visually incompatible with
the character of the district and therefore inappropriate.
[Amended 6-8-2010]
[2]
Other materials are appropriate if it is demonstrated that
they are visually compatible with the overall building and
its environs.
[3]
In the Downtown Village Districts, appropriate roof colors
include neutral shades such as earth tones, greys, and
black. Bright or primary colors are not appropriate.
[Amended 6-8-2010]
[4]
Trim.
Trim is the molded and projecting woodwork or stonework
which frames a building and its changes in direction in an
aesthetically pleasing or bold fashion. The trim shall be
visually compatible with the style of the building and the
other exterior finishes.
[1]
The following materials are appropriate for use as trim:
wood, stone, brick, vinyl, and metal.
[2]
Other materials are appropriate if it is demonstrated that
they are visually compatible with the overall building.
[3]
Trim materials may be mixed and matched as long as
the style and color of the trim are consistent and visually
compatible with the other elements of the building.
[4]
(f)
Entrances.
In the Downtown Village Districts, an entrance is much
more than a doorway. It is a means of getting from the
street to the front door and may include changes in grade,
protection from the elements, and/or a degree of
landscaping and lighting. The entrance to the building
shall be visually compatible with the overall building
treatment and should be the focal point of the facade.
The entrance shall be designed and placed to have both
a visual and functional relationship to the street and
sidewalk. [Amended 6-8-2010]
[1]
The following are appropriate design treatments for
entrances: porticos, porches, decks, steps/ramps, and
canopies/awnings. Awnings and canopies must be
attached to the structure and shall function as an
extension of the building. Freestanding accessory
structures such as tents or canopies at the front of the
building are incompatible with the existing visual
[2]
(g)
§ 125-114 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-114
109:696
character of the district and shall not be allowed.
Standards for awnings and canopies are in a later
section.129
The following are appropriate materials for use in
entrances: wood, vinyl, tile, stucco, stone, brick, concrete,
canvas, fiberglass, and metal.
[3]
Other materials are appropriate if it is demonstrated that
they are visually compatible with the overall building.
[4]
Relocation/demolition standards. The demolition or relocation of
the building should occur in a timely manner. After the relocation
or demolition has occurred, the lot must be cleared, graded, and
replanted within 30 days of the completion of the work and
maintained until the lot is reused.
(2)
Standards for seasonal closures.
The Town of Bar Harbor discourages the seasonal boarding up
of businesses. No matter how much effort is put into making
these closures look attractive, they give the Town the
appearance of being shut down, which is detrimental not only
to those businesses that remain open and to potential
customers, but also to local citizens and guests who view them
during the off-season. The Board strongly discourages the
placement of closure treatments involving the covering of
display windows before January 1.
(a)
Provisions for the seasonal closure of a business shall:
[1] Be visually compatible with the building.
Be architecturally similar to the building materials, design,
and color.
[2]
[3] Fit appropriately in the space being enclosed.
[4] Be safely and securely attached.
[5] Have a neat and clean appearance.
(b)
The most appropriate approach to the seasonal closure of a
business is for signs and window displays to remain in place.
Where this is not possible or desirable, other appropriate
approaches include leaving display spaces and windows empty,
installing storm doors and windows, and installing wood panels
or shutters over openings.
(c)
(3)
129. Editor's Note: See Subsection D(1) of this section.
§ 125-114 HEALTH AND SANITATION § 125-114
109:697
Closure provisions that cover windows or display spaces with
materials such as bed sheets, paper, tarps, cardboard, or
bubble wrap or soaped or painted glass are inappropriate.
(d)
Signs shall be left in place or removed. The covering or
wrapping of signs with tarp or other plastic materials is not
appropriate. The use of a canvas cloth covering the sign, and
bearing the name of the business, is encouraged.
(e)
Standards for materials and design details for accessory projects. The
following standards apply to projects that do not involve the actual
structure of the building but significantly impact upon the visual
environment and the compatibility of the building with the character
of district. Separate standards are provided for awnings, canopies, and
umbrellas, outdoor displays, lighting, and landscaping. The accessory
standards have been designed to promote compatibility with the
district's historic character and its scenic location.
Standards for awnings, canopies, and umbrellas. The objective of
the Town is to encourage property owners and businesses to make
permanent improvements to the property in the district. Therefore,
the use of temporary structures is discouraged. At the same time,
the Board recognizes that awnings, canopies, and umbrellas can
provide cover, add color, provide shade, and serve as a transition
between the storefront and the upper facade in the case of awnings
and canopies.
General standards.
Rigid or fixed awnings, sunscreens, umbrellas, or
permanent canopies are not appropriate on any portion
of the premises or building unless the proposed awning,
sunscreen, umbrella, or permanent canopy is visually
compatible with the building and its surrounding area
considering the following:
[a] Its compatibility with the topography of the area.
That it is customary and incidental to the activity
being housed in the building or appropriate for that
location due to unique circumstances.
[b]
Its compatibility with similar elements of adjacent
properties.
[c]
That it is designed so that it will not cover unique or
architecturally significant building features.130

awning or canopy, which immediately followed this subsection, was repealed 11-3-2009.
§ 125-114 BAR HARBOR CODE § 125-114
109:698
Awnings shall extend at least the full width of existing
window and door frames on the first floor.
[1]
Awnings on upper-floor windows shall be installed over
individual windows and shall complement the window
design, building architecture, and color.
[2]
Canopies or awnings shall be attached to the building and
not extend more than 12 feet from the wall (toward the
street) to which they are attached. In the case where an
awning follows another existing wall of the building at
right angles (such as an L or a U), it may extend out to the
point where it is parallel with the portion of the building
closest to the street.
[3]
Freestanding canopies or tents are inappropriate for
ongoing use. Tents are appropriate for use for periods of
not more than 72 hours with prior approval of the Code
Enforcement Officer and shall only be used for appropriate
outdoor functions, such as art shows, festivals, fairs,
weddings, and similar events.
[4]
A street level awning shall be at least 18 inches behind the
curb.
[5]
Awning design.
Awning construction and materials offer different patterns
and shapes. There are three basic shapes: 1/4 barrel, shed,
and domes.
[1]
The design review standards are not intended to restrict
the shape of awnings; however, the design shall be visually
compatible with and maintain the character of the
building. Side panels on awnings are discouraged but are
permitted if they are graphically treated so as to make the
panel compatible with the overall design of the building.
[2]
(c)
Awning color. The color of the material, and any graphics,
stripping, or pattern, shall be compatible with the building
architecture, materials, and color.
(d)
Awning materials.
The most common awning materials are canvas, vinyl,
vinyl-coated canvas, and canvas-like synthetic materials.
Glossy finish vinyl is not appropriate. Synthetic canvas is
available in acrylics, polyesters, nylons, and other manmade
materials. Any of these materials are appropriate.
[1]
Metal awnings and glass canopies detract from the
historic character of the community and are not
appropriate.

Awning lighting. Lighting shall conform to the requirements in
§ 125-67Z, Lighting Ordinance. [Amended 6-9-2009]
(f)
(2) (Reserved)131
Landscaping standards. The landscaping standards are intended
to maintain and enrich the character and beauty of the Town
through the regulation of landscaping which provides aesthetically
pleasing scenery, shelter and food for wildlife, natural boundaries
and buffers for people, and the control of erosion. The landscaping
in conjunction with the construction of a new building or an
addition to existing buildings, or major landscaping projects that
significantly alter the exterior appearance of a building that is
used in whole or in part for nonresidential purposes, is subject to
approval by the Design Review Board.
Materials.
Materials and types of vegetation for landscaping are too
numerous to list and most are acceptable; however, the
material chosen shall be visually compatible with the
building.
[1]
The use of invasive species as listed by the University
of Maine Cooperative Extension is discouraged. [Added
11-3-2009]
[2]
(a)
Design. The design of the landscape should enhance the
appearance of the building as well as the grounds.
Landscaping shall not block unique architectural features of
the building or appear disproportional to the lot and building
size.
(b)
Town Hill Business District plantings shall include street tree
plantings. Parking areas shall be screened from Route 102.
Shrubs and other materials shall enhance the buildings. All
other requirements in § 125-67H shall be followed. [Added
11-3-2009]
(c)
(3)
132Standards for historic buildings. The standards, as applicable in the
opinion of the Design Review Board, outlined in the United States
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic

the Bar Harbor Town Council to accept the applicability of 30-A M.R.S.A.
§§ 3441 to 3445, regarding assessments and fees for new sewer
construction, to the Town.
§ 165-53. Expense of construction.
Estimate and assessment of costs; notice. Once the Town has
constructed and completed a public drain or common sewer, the Town
Council shall determine what lots or parcels of land are benefited by the
drain or sewer and shall estimate and assess upon the lots and parcels
of land and against the owner of the land or person in possession, or
against whom the taxes on the land are assessed, whether the person to
whom the assessment is so made is the owner, tenant, lessee or agent
and whether the land is occupied or not, the sum not exceeding the
benefit it considers just and equitable towards defraying the expenses
of constructing and completing the drain or sewer, together with any
necessary sewage disposal units and appurtenances. The whole of the
assessments may not exceed 1/2 the cost of the drain or sewer and
sewage disposal units, unless 75% or more of the landowners that will
be benefited by the expansion petition the Town Council to construct
the drain or sewer and sewage disposal unit and agree to pay a higher
assessment that must be identified in the petition. The Town, through
its employees and assigns, shall maintain and keep the drain or sewer
in repair.
Farmland, as defined by 36 M.R.S.A. §1102, Subdivision 4, is
exempt from assessment under this subsection when no benefits
are derived from the common sewer or drain. The owner of the
farmland must notify the Town Council that farmland property
may qualify for this exemption. The Town Council shall revise
the assessments against qualified farmland to exempt it from
assessment. Any revision of assessment provided by this subsection
must be in writing and recorded by the Clerk.
When the use of the land is changed from farmland, the owner
shall, within 60 days, notify the Town Council, in writing, of the
change. The Town Council shall assess this land in an amount
equal to the assessment which would have been due but for
this subsection. The Town Council shall notify the owner of the
assessment due, which the owner shall pay within 60 days of
notice or as provided by the Town Council under its authority

When any assessment made under § 165-53 is paid by any person against
whom the assessment has been made, who is not the owner of the lot or
parcel of land, then the person paying the assessment has a lien upon the
lot or parcel of land with the buildings on the land for the amount of the
assessment paid by that person, and incidental charges. The lien may be
Installment payments. The Town Council may adopt an order generally
authorizing the Assessor and the Tax Collector to assess and collect
those assessments and charges over a period of time not exceeding 10
years.
The Assessor and Collector may exercise this authority only when
the person assessed has agreed to installment payments in writing
and notice of that fact has been recorded by the Town Clerk in the
appropriate Registry of Deeds.
(1)
The Town Council shall annually file with the Tax Collector a list of
installment payments due the Town, which must be collected with
interest at a rate determined by the Town Council. If, within 30
days after written notice of the total amount of the assessments and
charges, or annual installment payment and interest, the person
assessed fails, neglects or refuses to pay the Town the expense
incurred, the Assessor may assess a special tax, equal to the
amount of the total unpaid assessment and charges, upon each lot
or parcel of land so assessed and buildings upon the lot or parcel of
land. This assessment must be included in the next annual warrant
to the Tax Collector for collection and must be collected in the same
manner as county and municipal taxes are collected.
Interest at the same rate used for delinquent property taxes
as established by 36 M.R.S.A. §505, Subdivision 4, on the

are not paid and the Town does not proceed to collect the assessments
by a sale of the lots or parcels of land upon which the assessments are
made or does not collect or is in any manner delayed or defeated in
collecting the assessments by a sale of the real estate so assessed, then
the Town may maintain a civil action in its name against the party so
assessed for the amount of the assessment in any court competent to
try the action. In this action, the Town may recover the amount of the
assessment with 12% interest on the assessment from the date of the
assessment and costs.

Watercraft or vehicles and the equipment located on

Officer has a reasonable suspicion of a violation of the Town
Shellfish Conservation Ordinance by the licensed individual.
(a)
Conservation time requirements for commercial shellfish license.
No resident or nonresident commercial license shall be issued until
the applicant has completed the minimum number of mandatory
conservation hours. Qualifying conservation time includes
attending Marine Resources Committee meetings, clam flat
population and recruitment surveys, reseeding and any other
approved activity. Any member of the Bar Harbor Marine
Resources Committee may verify hours for approved activities. The
minimum required conservation hours will be established by the
Marine Resources Committee at least six months prior to current
license expiration date. Conservation time must be accumulated
in the previous licensing year; however, if an individual obtains
the appropriate conservation time, but is unable to obtain a
commercial license, their conservation time will rollover to the next
year or until they are offered a license.
(7)
Commercial license eligibility. Individuals possessing Bar Harbor
commercial shellfish harvesting licenses for four of the previous
five years and who have accumulated the required conservation
time are eligible to obtain their licenses two weeks in advance
of the next license year. The Marine Resources Committee shall
determine the number of advance licenses available for the next
year no later than 12 months in advance. If the number of eligible
individuals exceeds the number of advance licenses available,
those licenses shall be assigned through a lottery. Any licenses not
issued before the first working day of the new license year will be
available to any eligible individual that has met the conservation
time requirement.

of an affidavit and must contain the applicant's name, current

conservation hours and any other information the municipality may

shall be used by the Town for shellfish management, conservation and
enforcement. Fifty cents may be retained by the Town Clerk's office, or
a designated agent, at point of purchase.
Limitation of diggers. Because the shellfish resources are limited and
a commercial or recreational digger can be expected to harvest a
certain volume of clams per year, the number of diggers must be
controlled. This number will vary from year to year depending upon
estimates of the resource capabilities and management requirements
consistent with good resource utilization. The following procedures will
be followed to exercise the control:
Number of licenses established. Prior to May 1 the Town Marine
Resources Committee, with the approval of the Maine
Commissioner of Marine Resources, will establish the number of
commercial and recreational licenses to be permitted following the
requirements of 12 M.R.S.A. § 6671(3-A).
(1)
Notice to Town Clerk. Prior to June 1 the Town Marine Resources
Committee will notify the Town Clerk in writing of the number of
licenses to be issued.
(2)
Public notice. Not less than 10 days prior to the period of issuance
notice of the number of licenses to be issued and the procedure
for application shall be published in a trade or industry publication,
or in a newspaper or combination of newspapers with general
circulation, effective in reaching persons affected. Notice shall also
be posted in the municipal offices until the period of issuance
concludes.
(3)
Dates of issuance. The Town Clerk shall issue licenses to residents
and nonresidents as allocated from the first day of July until the
28th day of September, after which licenses shall be issued to
residents and nonresidents on a first come, first served basis.
(4)
E.
License expiration date. Each license issued under the authority of this
chapter expires at midnight on the 30th day of June following the date
of issue.

Suspension. Any shellfish licensee convicted of a violation of this
chapter shall have his/her shellfish license automatically suspended for
a period of 30 days. Any subsequent conviction shall result in loss of
shellfish license for one year.
Reapplication. A licensee whose shellfish license has been
suspended pursuant to this chapter may reapply for a license only
after the suspension period has expired.
