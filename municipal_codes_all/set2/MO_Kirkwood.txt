DIVISION 3. Architectural Review Board
§ 2-531. Created; purpose.
[Ord. No. 8173, § 1, 12-3-1992; Ord. No. 8512, § 1, 5-16-1996]
An Architectural Review Board is hereby created and established for the purpose of promoting high
standards of architectural design, thereby serving the general welfare of the community. The
Architectural Review Board will review building plans for new construction, exterior renovations, or
additions as designated by this Division as well as the City of Kirkwood Zoning Code.[1] The
Architectural Review Board will also review certain signs in all zoning districts. The intent of
architectural review is to attempt to insure that the architectural scheme of proposed new construction,
exterior renovation, or additions in designated areas and proposed new signs in all zoning districts are
in harmony with the architectural scheme of the building, site, and surrounding area while striving not
to destroy individual creativity for the sake of conformity and avoiding the precise standards that direct
attention to superficialities of style rather than general aspects of design.
Editor's Note: See Appendix A, Zoning.

§ 2-536. Definitions.
As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES, MAJOR
Structures greater than 120 square feet or 15 feet in height.
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES, MINOR
Structures that are 120 square feet or less and 15 feet or less in height.
ARCHITECTURAL DETAILING
Unique details and components, such as decorative moldings or architectural ornamentation,
which define the nature and quality of the building.
BUILDING ELEMENTS
The building character is composed of many different elements, such as roofs, coping, doors, and
windows. Building's architectural style should determine relationships between these various
building elements. A change in the wall plane of a facade should be in keeping with the
architectural style of the building and should be significant enough to affect the building mass.
Repeating elements, such as dormers (bays/display windows/storefronts), can be more effective
when they are equally sized and the spaces between them are of an equal proportion. Where
effective, there is also often a relationship to other elements on the facade or roof. It is also very
effective to maintain a relationship to other elements on the facade or roof.
CHARACTER
Building, site, or element that plays an important role in determining the purpose and/or the
function of a streetscape or structure.
COMMISSIONER
The City of Kirkwood Building Commissioner.
CONSISTENT WITH THE ARCHITECTURAL STYLE
Elements identified as being characteristic of a particular architectural style that are described in
the "Identifying Features, Principal Subtypes, and Variants and Details" contained in "A Field
Guide to American Houses" by Virginia and Lee McAlester.

The City of Kirkwood Building Department.
FACADE
An exterior building wall.
HISTORIC FEATURES
Building elements or features that were part of the structure for over 50 years, or elements that
have been indicated as character defining by the Secretary of the Interior, Landmarks Commission
of the City, or the Architectural Review Board.[1]
HUMAN SCALE
Building, site, or architectural element that is scaled in relation to pedestrians.
INFILL LOT
A lot located adjacent to or between two improved lots.

PARAPET
A wall extending above a roof around the exterior.
PRIMARY FACADE
The side of the building that faces the public right-of-way, and/or is the primary entrance to the
structure. Depending on how a building is placed on the site can have a great deal of influence on
what will ultimately become its primary facade. Traditionally, the primary facade is the facade
which faces the street on which it is located and which displays its street address; however, multitenant
or mixed-use developments may result in the primary facade facing an interior court,
parking lot, or pedestrian way which is separate from its street frontage/street address. With these
types of developments particular attention will be paid to how equal weight is placed on both the
primary and street frontage so as not to interrupt the original streetscape.[3]

A wall not visible from any public right-of-way.
ROOF, GABLE
A roof created from straight slopes falling from the ridge to eave, creating a triangle part of a
building on the side or front facade.
ROOF, HIP
A roof formed by four triangular shaped sides which meet at a pointed peak.
ROOF, MANSARD
A hipped roof containing a flat top and two roof pitches. A low-sloped roof pitches from the flat top
then breaks to a steep pitch (almost vertical) above the exterior wall.
ROOF, PRIMARY
The roof over largest volume of the house.

The continuation of the building massing of the primary facades at the front of the site helps to
create the street wall. Effective streetscapes have a consistent front setback, are pedestrian
friendly, and are not largely concealed or interrupted by parking.
TRADITIONAL MASONRY UNIT SIZES
In order to be in keeping with the context of other brick masonry buildings within Kirkwood a
traditional unit size should be used. A traditional masonry unit size (standard/modular/norman) will
result in three courses being equal to approximately eight inches in height for the vertical coursing.

§ 2-539. Residential building permit review.
Process. The Architectural Review Board shall provide an advisory review of all building permit
applications for new single-family residences and their accessory structures and all additions to
existing homes for the purpose of advising the applicant on design modifications as follows:
A meeting between the applicant and the Architectural Review Board will facilitate design
review of the proposed improvements and promote quality residential design, and applicants
are encouraged to file an application with the Architectural Review Board for an early design
phase meeting so that the Architectural Review Board can review and comment on the design
and suggest design changes before design and construction documents are finalized. An
early design phase meeting is encouraged but not required;
Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the Architectural Review Board shall review and
comment on the design based upon the guidelines set forth herein within 180 days of the date
on which such building permit application is filed with the Building Commissioner's office
unless the applicant and the Architectural Review Board jointly agree to extend the time for
review. Any agreed upon design changes or conditions will be written into the building permit
requirements. If the Architectural Review Board and the applicant fail to reach an agreement
on design modifications to a new single-family residence, their accessory structures, or
addition, the Building Department shall process the permit as submitted by the applicant;
If the building is in a local or national historic district or if the building is a local or national
historic structure, a joint meeting of the Architectural Review Board and the Landmarks
Commission will take place to review and comment on the design based upon the guidelines
set forth herein. If there is any contradiction between the historic district design guidelines and
the preferred items listed herein, the historic district design guidelines shall govern.
Purpose. New residential development will impact how existing residents, visitors, and potential
residents and businesses perceive and experience Kirkwood's community character. Keeping the
size, location, and design of new development consistent with the community's existing image and
preferred character is important. New residential development also impacts the quality of life of our
residents, particularly those that live in direct proximity to the development. Ensuring that the size,
location, and design of new development fits with the desired neighborhood character, scale,
activity, and lifestyle is imperative as to how our residential neighborhoods look, feel, and function
and directly affects the day-to-day quality of life of our residents. Accordingly, all residential
development shall meet the minimum standards set forth in the Zoning Code[1] in addition to the
guidelines and objectives set forth herein.

To achieve the preferred character of residential infill development, designers and builders
need to incorporate the following goals and objectives set forth herein into their residential
developments, additions, and renovation projects:
Protect and enhance the community's overall image and character by:
Creating elegant and lush streetscapes.
Forming a cohesive neighborhood scale.
Utilizing high quality architectural character.
Respect the neighbors' quality of life by:
"Fitting" with the design character of the existing neighborhood.
Building to a neighborly sense of scale.
Protecting and forming a cohesive landscape.
Design principles. Because it is possible to follow all of the individual guidelines contained
herein and still assemble the design in a way that does not achieve the goals and objectives,
designers and builders need to incorporate a design that is compatible within the
neighborhood context.
Classification. Kirkwood has had a rich and diverse history of residential development for
more than 150 years. As the community moves forward into the 21st century, continuing that
diversity will be essential to maintaining the character and quality of life and meeting the goals
and objectives described herein. Accordingly, a system for guiding the design of homes has
been developed that allows for flexibility while also protecting the essence of what makes
Kirkwood's neighborhoods special. At the core of this system is the use of the following
project element classifications:
Preferred elements are those the City finds to be highly compatible with and contributing
to the existing character and quality of life in the single-family zoning districts and for
achieving the preferred character of residential infill development. Appropriately
incorporating these elements into a project significantly increases the likelihood that the
project will be viewed favorably by the Architectural Review Board.
Discouraged elements are those the City finds to be potentially incompatible with and
detracting from the existing character and quality of life of the single-family zoning
districts and the preferred character of residential infill development. Incorporating
discouraged elements into a project decreases the likelihood that the project will be
viewed favorably. Because discouraged elements have the potential to be disruptive to
the existing character of a neighborhood, applicants shall demonstrate how their use in
the context of their total project design is consistent with:
The existing character of Kirkwood's neighborhoods;
The preferred character of infill residential development;
The goals and objectives set forth herein;
The overview and purpose for the particular element;
The general architectural style/design of the structure; and
The use of all other elements on the structure or site.

Exceptions. The specific character of individual neighborhoods varies widely throughout
the City. Design guidelines for various project elements are presented generally, but
certain exceptions may be allowed based on the character and design of existing homes
within the neighborhood context.
Similar elements. Because the number and types of building products are virtually infinite
and ever changing, the project elements described herein are those most commonly
used. Thus, the elements classified as being preferred or discouraged are not intended to
be an all-inclusive list. In those instances where a proposed element is not listed, the
Architectural Review Board shall determine whether the particular element is
substantially similar to any of those that are listed and classify it accordingly. In making
such a determination, the Architectural Review Board shall consider similarities in terms
of:
Finished appearance;
Quality of construction;
Durability;
Consistency with the overview and purpose statement associated with the element;
and
Consistency with the preferred character of infill residential development.
Conformance to Code. When constructing a dwelling, the design must comply with all of the
requirements of the Zoning Code,[2] including height, setback and size, and the design must
consider the neighborhood context.
Editor's Note: See Appendix A, Zoning.
Historic districts and landmark structures. The design guidelines contained herein are
intended to be applied to all single-family homes in all single-family zoning districts. However,
for properties and structures within designated historic districts, additional guidelines may
apply. Further, additional guidelines also may apply to those properties and structures which
have been designated as landmarks. In the event the historic district or landmark design
guidelines contained in Division 8 of this article conflict with those of these guidelines, the
guidelines in Division 8 shall prevail.
Editor's Note: See Appendix A, Zoning.
Design guidelines. All design elements not identified as "preferred" should be discussed with the
Architectural Review Board at the early design phase meeting.
Building form and articulation. Houses are shaped and articulated by roof form, the number
and placement of rooflines, the shape and proportion of building masses/features, the
configuration of exterior walls, and the character of these elements. These design elements
influence the perception of a home's scale, its stylistic character, and the fit with its neighbors
and should be consistent with the neighborhood's desired character. To be consistent with the
preferred character of residential infill development, houses should present a simple overall
building form (see Fig. 1) and roof geometry in character with its neighbors (houses of a
mature suburb rather than a new one). Exterior walls should be articulated, not monotonous,
or consist of overly complex facade treatments. Further, the building form and articulation
should be based on an authentic architectural style.

Building materials and material quality. Materials, material quality, and finishes include all
exposed exterior surfaces of foundations, siding, trim, soffits, other detailing, and roofing. To
be consistent with the preferred character of residential development, houses should have a
limited, simple palette of materials, which should also be durable and maintain their form and
color over time.
Predominant material palette. Determine the contextual predominant material palette by
identifying the primary materials used on the exterior of the front facades of existing houses
within the neighborhood context. Any material present on 20% or more of the existing houses
within your neighborhood context is considered a predominant material, so there may be
more than one. If a single material (e.g., brick, clapboard, etc.) is dominant (present on more
than 70% of houses within the site context), that material is considered to be the single
dominant material.
Preferred.
Brick, stone or clapboard (wood or fiber cement) where there is not a single
dominant material or a predominant material palette within the neighborhood
context.

Purpose. New development will impact how existing residents, visitors, and potential residents and
businesses perceive and experience Kirkwood's community character. Keeping the size, location,
and design of new development consistent with the community's existing image and preferred
character is important. New commercial development also impacts the quality of life of our
residents, particularly those that live in direct proximity to the development. Ensuring that the size,
location, and design of new development fits with the desired neighborhood character, scale,
activity, and lifestyle is imperative as to how our neighborhoods look, feel, and function and
directly affects the day-to-day quality of life of our residents. Accordingly, all commercial
development shall meet the minimum standards set forth in the Zoning Code[1] in addition to the
guidelines and objectives set forth herein.
To achieve the preferred character of commercial development, designers and builders need
to incorporate the following goals and objectives set forth herein into their commercial
developments, additions, and renovation projects:
Protect and enhance the community's overall image and character by:
Creating elegant streetscapes.
Forming a cohesive neighborhood scale.

Utilizing high quality architectural character.
Respect the neighbors' quality of life by:
"Fitting" with the design character of the existing neighborhood.
Building to a neighborly sense of scale.
Protecting and forming a cohesive landscape.
Design principles. Because it is possible to follow all of the individual guidelines contained
herein and still assemble the design in a way that does not achieve the goals and objectives,
designers and builders need to incorporate a design that is compatible within the
neighborhood context.
Classification. Kirkwood has had a rich and diverse history of commercial development for
more than 150 years. As the community moves forward into the 21st century, continuing that
diversity will be essential to maintaining the character and quality of life and meeting the goals
and objectives described herein. Accordingly, a system for guiding the design of commercial
development has been developed that allows for flexibility while also protecting the essence
of what makes Kirkwood's neighborhoods special. At the core of this system is the use of the
following project element classifications:
Preferred elements are those the City finds to be highly compatible with and contributing
to the existing character in the business and industrial zoning districts. Appropriately
incorporating these elements into a project significantly increases the likelihood that the
project will be viewed favorably by the Architectural Review Board.
Discouraged elements are those the City finds to be potentially incompatible with and
detracting from the existing character of the business and industrial zoning districts.
Incorporating discouraged elements into a project decreases the likelihood that the
project will be viewed favorably. Because discouraged elements have the potential to be
disruptive to the existing character of a neighborhood, applicants shall be required to
demonstrate how their use in the context of their total project design is consistent with:
The existing character of Kirkwood neighborhoods and business districts;
The preferred character of infill commercial development;
The goals and objectives set forth herein;
The overview and purpose for the particular element;
The general architectural style/design of the structure; and
The use of all other elements on the structure or site.
Exceptions. The specific character of individual neighborhoods, business districts, and
commercial developments varies widely throughout the City. Design guidelines for
various project elements are presented generally, but certain exceptions may be allowed
based on the character and design of existing businesses and their respective districts or
commercial developments within the neighborhood context.
Similar elements. Because the number and types of building products are virtually infinite
and ever changing, the project elements described herein are those most commonly
used. Thus, the elements classified as being preferred or discouraged are not intended to
be an all-inclusive list. In those instances where a proposed element is not listed, the
Architectural Review Board shall determine whether the particular element is
substantially similar to any of those that are listed and classify it accordingly. In making

of:
Finished appearance;
Quality of construction;
Durability, warranty;
Consistency with the overview and purpose statement associated with the element;
and
Consistency with the preferred character of business districts and commercial
developments.
Conformance to Code. When constructing a building, the design must comply with all of the
requirements of the Zoning Code[2] and the design must consider the neighborhood context.
Editor's Note: See Appendix A, Zoning.
Historic districts and landmark structures. The design guidelines contained herein are
intended to be applied to structures within the business and industrial zoning districts.
However, for properties and structures within designated historic districts, additional
guidelines may apply. Further, additional guidelines also may apply to those properties and
structures which have been designated as landmarks. In the event the historic district or
landmark design guidelines contained in Division 8 of this article conflict with those of these
guidelines, the guidelines in Division 8 shall prevail.
Editor's Note: See Appendix A, Zoning.
Design guidelines. All design elements not identified as "preferred" should be discussed with the
Architectural Review Board at the early design phase meeting.
Site context. The design of commercial structures should relate to character-defining
elements in the neighborhood. Downtown Kirkwood has a different motif than commercial
design at the intersection of Big Bend Road and Kirkwood Road as well as along Manchester.
The neighborhoods can be broken down into four main context groups. Throughout the
Commercial Design Guild these groupings will be referred to as follows:
HD — National Historic Downtown District (see Figure 1: District Map, below)
NB — Neighborhood Business (Zoning Districts B-1, B-2, and B-4)
HB — Highway Business (B-3 and B-5)
I — Industrial (I-1)

a. (HD) National Historic Downtown District:
The Downtown Kirkwood Historic District (HD) includes portions of eight blocks with 72
buildings, nine sites and one sign. The HD in the heart of Kirkwood is surrounded by
residential buildings adjacent to the district and newer commercial development along
Kirkwood Road to the north and south. Arranged in a standard grid pattern, the district is
an irregular T-shape with Kirkwood Road forming the leg of the T and Argonne Drive and
Jefferson Avenue forming the arms of the T. Most of the HD is bounded on the south by
the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, but the district extends further south along the west
side of Kirkwood Road, including City Hall and a block of commercial buildings, ending
just south of Monroe Avenue. The eastern boundary is one block east of Kirkwood Road
at Taylor Avenue. Most of the northern boundary includes the north side of Jefferson
Avenue but several of the properties east of 105-109 East Jefferson are parking lots so
from that point east the north side is excluded. The western boundary is one block west
of Kirkwood Road at Clay Avenue and runs south to the railroad tracks, then the western
boundary moves east to the rear of City Hall and the back lots of the commercial
buildings facing Kirkwood Road.
The streets of the commercial area are lined with a mixture of one-story and two-story
commercial buildings. A few buildings date from the late 1800s; however, most of the
construction dates are after 1900 and span into the early 1960s. In the 1920s and '30s
many of the older buildings were faced with brick or stucco, apparently in an attempt to
update the community's image. Nearly a third of the HD represents post World War II
construction or new facades, an indication of the continued growth and prosperity of the
community in the mid-20th century. The design motifs of the Downtown Kirkwood
National District should be referenced as buildings are designed through the entire City.
Preferred.
Buildings within the National Historic Downtown District shall follow the
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation by the National Park
Service when rehabilitating or modifying the materials and features of a
property.
Retention and preservation of the historic character of a property.
Preservation of distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction
techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize the building period of
origin.
Repair and restoration of deteriorated historic features.
New features to match the old if replacement is needed of a distinctive feature,
such as, design, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible,
materials.
Maintenance of the first floor as a retail store front.
Screening for all loading docks and trash storage with contextual materials.
Service elements, such as loading doors, should be integrated with the building
elevation designed so to minimize the visual impact of such elements.
Discouraged.
The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property.
Use of cleaning or patching treatments that cause damage to historic materials.

Downtown Kirkwood Historic District
St. Louis County, Missouri
Neighborhood Business (NB, Zoning Districts B-1, B-2, B-4). The streets of downtown
Kirkwood are lined with trees and are laid out in a grid pattern that continues out of the
district into the residential areas surrounding it. The buildings have a relatively uniform
setback, extending to the public sidewalk. Most of the buildings on Kirkwood Road
directly abut the neighboring buildings. Some of the buildings facing the east-west streets
(addressed on Argonne or Jefferson) are on individual lots with at least some space
between the buildings and an occasional parking lot often developed historically before
1945. Most are simply one- or two-part, brick commercial storefront buildings with onestory
buildings interspersed with two-story buildings to create an undulating skyline. The
uniform setbacks, relatively consistent size of the buildings, and the use of similar
materials give the district a degree of continuity that allows 1870s and 1960s buildings to
complement one another and create a visual cohesiveness to the district that further
differentiates the business district from the surrounding residential neighborhoods and

Industrial. Building in the industrial zone should follow the recommendations of the area
that abuts it. For example, if an industrial zone is next to an NB area, then that building or
development needs to follow the requirements of the adjacent NB area; if it is next to a
residential area, then it will need to follow the requirements of an NB area and take
particular care to the size, massing, setback, and overall siting as it relates to the overall
neighborhood and streetscape.
Kirkwood Downtown Motif
Building massing and articulation (mass, alignment, pattern, proportions). Building massing is
looking at its three-dimensional form and evaluating it for relative scale, bulkiness and
relationship to exterior spaces, and to the overall streetscape. Massing that is "broken up" to
reduce bulkiness is usually more successful. The massing of buildings with larger footprints
can appear oppressive or overly bulky if care is not taken to articulate the mass.
Preferred.
Design building masses which help to continue or establish a streetscape.
Well-scaled elements or structures that are sensitive to the site context.
Break large projects into a series of appropriately scaled masses so that no building
is more than 30 feet in length without a break in the massing.
Buildings in the NB context group should maintain a consistent street wall along their
street frontages. Variety in massing is encouraged between neighboring buildings
although significant differences in massing will receive much greater scrutiny.

Retaining walls greater than five feet in height.
Materials, texture, and color. The choice of materials and texture has great visual significance.
Coordinating materials within a development can tie buildings of different sizes, uses, and
forms together, while contrasting materials, textures, or colors within a large building may add
visual interest and reduce its scale. In an effort to perpetuate Kirkwood's unique character and
to reinforce its local identity, it is important that new development be compatible with and
respectful of the strengths of the City's current and historical development fabric. New
structures within the various commercial districts of Kirkwood shall be compatible with their
neighbors in regard to exterior building materials, particularly when adjacent structures are
substantially in compliance with the guidelines. This does not imply uniformity of architectural
style; rather, a similarity to exterior building materials of nearby "conforming" structures and
environment.
Materials. High quality building construction begins with durable and aesthetic materials.
Building materials, textures and colors shall be used in a consistent manner on the
exterior of the building.
Materials, textures, and colors on all exposed facades shall be given equal values;
this includes the many other architectural features which make up the design. The
materials on the sides of the building as well as those used on these other
architectural features should form a cohesive design and should not be sacrificed,
overlooked, or neglected.
Industrial areas are to be held to a similar standard as commercial, especially on
arterial and collector streets, except for "remote walls."
Color. Color is an integral element of the overall design. Brick, stone, and concrete have
an inherent color created by nature or during the manufacturing process. Other surfaces
will get their color from applied materials such as paint.
The color palette of the building and any material patterns (such as a brick or stone
color mix or pattern) should be limited and display a subtle color range with the color
saturation, brightness, and texture not to vary more than 20%.
The colors of exposed exterior components of a building are to be of low reflectance,
subtle, neutral, or simple earth-tone colors. The use of accent colors should be
limited to architectural detail elements or trim (metal or wood detailing), but again
these should also be of low reflectance, subtle, earth-tone colors. High-intensity
colors, primary colors, or metallic colors are not recommended for any part of the
development.

landmark or property within a historic district until the plans have been submitted to the Landmarks
Commission for review and approval. Upon submission to the Commission of any such application
for a demolition permit or a relocation permit, the Commission shall have the power to review and
withhold approval for a period of 270 days. During this period, the Commission shall confer with
the owner, occupant, or other person having an interest in such building or structure for the
purpose of making suggestions and recommendations with respect to any or all means or
methods considered feasible and proper for the preservation of such landmark. It shall be the duty
of the Commission within this review period to make suggestions and recommendations whereby
the landmark in question may be preserved and maintained in a state which will not deface, mar,
materially alter, or destroy in whole or in part the historical significance or aesthetic value of such
landmark or historic district. The "period of review" shall begin the date the application for review is
submitted to the Landmarks Commission. The Commission may grant its approval prior to the
completion of the 270 days, but in no case shall the Commission terminate its review within 60
days of its initial review.
The Landmarks Commission may request advisory review of public improvements that affect
landmarks and historic districts on the Kirkwood Landmarks Register. The improvement or project
should be located within a historic district, on the site of or within 200 feet of any landmark or
within 200 feet of any boundary of a historic district. The Commission shall have at least 30 days
to complete its review and report its recommendations to the City Council, except when the
directing agency of the City, if necessary to accelerate the design review process, may specify a
time less than 30 days within which the Commission shall complete its review and report to the
City Council, except as dictated by public safety.
The report of the Commission, while advisory in nature, shall be furnished to any other person,
board, commission or entity having jurisdiction over the proposed change, and shall be given due
consideration by such person, board, commission or entity.
No demolition permit, building permit, or permit for relocation shall be issued until such time as the
Commission shall advise the Building Commissioner that it has terminated its review hereunder
and has recommended approval of such permit provided. However, in the event the Commission
fails to make a determination within the identified review period, the application shall be deemed to
be approved by the Commission and the study shall be terminated. The Building Commissioner
shall then grant or deny the permit in accordance with all applicable code provisions.

the meeting on its website in addition to its principal office and shall notify the public how to
access that meeting. Reasonable notice shall include making available copies of the notice to any

governmental body concurrent with the notice being made available to the members of the
particular governmental body and posting the notice on a bulletin board at City Hall or other
prominent place which is easily accessible to the public and clearly designated for that purpose at
the City Hall.
The notice shall be given at least 24 hours, exclusive of weekends and holidays when the City Hall
is closed, prior to the commencement of any meeting of a governmental body unless for good
cause such notice is impossible or impractical, in which case as much notice as is reasonably
possible shall be given.
When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than 24 hours' notice, or at a place that is not
reasonably accessible to the public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the public,
the nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall be stated

the public governmental body following the closed session.
In the event any member of a public governmental body makes a motion to close a meeting, or a
record, or a vote from the public and any other member believes that such motion, if passed,
would cause a meeting, record or vote to be closed from the public in violation of any provision in
Chapter 610, RSMo., or this article, such latter member shall state his or her objection to the
motion at or before the time the vote is taken on the motion. The public governmental body shall
enter in the minutes of the public governmental body any objection made pursuant to this
subsection. Any member making such an objection shall be allowed to fully participate in any
meeting, record or vote that is closed from the public over the member's objection. In the event the
objecting member also voted in opposition to the motion to close the meeting, record or vote at
issue, the objection and vote of the member as entered in the minutes shall be an absolute
defense to any claim filed against the objecting member pursuant to Chapter 610, RSMo.

All votes by members of a public governmental body at any meeting shall be recorded. When a
roll call vote is taken, the minutes shall attribute each "yea" and "nay" vote, or abstinence if not
voting, to the name of the individual member of the body. Any votes taken during a closed meeting
shall be taken by roll call and the minutes of the closed meeting, sufficient to reflect the vote
pursuant to this subsection, shall be recorded. All votes taken by roll call in meetings of a public
governmental body consisting of members who are all elected, except for the Missouri General
Assembly and any committee established by a public governmental body, shall be cast by
members of the public governmental body who are physically present and in attendance at the
meeting or who are participating via video conferencing. When it is necessary to take votes by roll
call in a meeting of the public governmental body due to an emergency of the public body, with a
quorum of the members of the public body physically present and in attendance and less than a
quorum of the members of the public governmental body participating via telephone, facsimile,
internet, or any other voice or electronic means, the nature of the emergency of the public body
justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall be stated in the minutes. Where such
emergency exists, the votes taken shall be regarded as if all members were physically present
and in attendance at the meeting.[1]

If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure as well as material which is
exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make
the nonexempt material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies provided
herein. When designing a public record, the custodian shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a
separation of exempt from nonexempt information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person
requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe the material
exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat
the purpose of the exemption.
§ 2-611. Custodian designated; response to request for access to
records.
[Ord. No. 9804, 11-6-2008]
The City Clerk shall be the Custodian of Records and will be responsible for maintenance and

records and meetings in accord with the policies enumerated herein.
Except as otherwise provided by law, the City shall provide access to and, upon request, furnish
copies of the City's public records subject to the provisions of the Code of Ordinances relating to
copying fees. No person shall remove original public records from the City Hall or from the office
of the Custodian of Records without written permission of the Custodian. No public governmental
body shall grant to any person or entity, whether by contract, license, or otherwise, the exclusive
right to access and disseminate any public record unless the granting of such right is necessary to
facilitate coordination with or uniformity among industry regulators having similar authority.
The Custodian of Records may require persons seeking access to public records to submit such
request in writing and/or on a form designated by the Custodian for such purpose. Such written
request shall be sufficiently particular to reasonably apprize the Custodian of the records sought.
Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon as possible, but in no
event later than the end of the third business day following the date the request is received by the
Custodian of Records. If records are requested in a certain format, the public body shall provide
the records in the requested format if such format is available. If access to the public record is not
granted immediately, the Custodian shall give a detailed explanation of the cause for further delay
and the place and earliest time and date that the record will be available for inspection. This period
for document production may exceed three days for reasonable cause.
If a request for access is denied, the Custodian of Records shall provide, upon request, a written
statement of the grounds for such denial. Such statement shall cite the specific provision of law
under which access is denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of the
third business day following the date that the request for the statement is received.
Any member of a public governmental body who transmits any message relating to public
business by electronic means shall also concurrently transmit that message to either the
member's public office computer or the Custodian of Records in the same format. The provisions
of this subsection shall only apply to messages sent to other members of that body so that, when
counting the sender, a majority of the body's members are copied. Any such message received by
the Custodian or at the member's office computer shall be a public record, subject, however, to the
exceptions for closed records as provided by law.

A public governmental body or record custodian in doubt about the legality of closing a particular
meeting, record or vote may, subject to approval by the City Council, bring suit in the Circuit Court for
the County of St. Louis to ascertain the propriety of such action. In addition, subject to approval by the
City Council, the public governmental body or custodian may seek a formal opinion of the Attorney
General or an attorney for the City regarding the propriety of such action. In such events, the proposed
closed meeting or public access to the record or vote shall be deferred for a reasonable time pending
the outcome of the actions so taken.

clerical staff of the City. Research time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at
the actual cost of research time. Based on the scope of the request, the City shall produce the
copies using employees of the City that result in the lowest amount of charges for search,
research, and duplication time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the person
requesting the records may request the City to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. The custodian shall receive (or may require) payment prior to duplicating
and/or searching for documents.
Fees for providing access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or
disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual
items or devices, and for paper copies larger than nine inches by 14 inches shall include only the
cost of copies, staff time, which shall not exceed the average hourly rate of pay for staff of the City
required for making copies and programming, if necessary, and the disk or tape or other medium
used for the duplication. Fees for maps, blueprints, or plats that require special expertise to
duplicate may include the actual rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to
duplicate such maps, blueprints, or plats. If programming is required beyond the customary and
usual level to comply with a request for records or information, the fees for compliance may
include the actual costs of such programming.

accused is found not guilty, or imposition of sentence is suspended in the court in which the action is
prosecuted, official records pertaining to the case shall thereafter be closed records when such case is

had closed such records to certain agencies or for certain purposes. All records which are closed
records shall be removed from the records of the Police Department and Municipal Court which
are available to the public and shall be kept in separate records which are to be held confidential
and, where possible, pages of the public record shall be retyped or rewritten omitting those
portions of the record which deal with the defendant's case. If retyping or rewriting is not feasible
because of the permanent nature of the record books, such record entries shall be blacked out
and recopied in a confidential book.
As used in this section, the term "child care" includes providers and youth services agencies as
those terms are defined in Section 43.540, RSMo., elementary and secondary school teachers,

The Architectural Review Board is empowered to review or modify the Building Commissioner's order
or determination with respect to signs covered by this article. In addition, the Architectural Review
Board may grant variances from this article as provided by this section.
Guidelines for overturning or modifying Commissioner's decision. The Architectural Review Board
shall, in considering appeals from the Commissioner's order or determination, establish that the
sign or application in question complies with all of the requirements of this article. If it is
determined that the Building Commissioner's interpretation or application of this article to the
appellant's sign or request for a permit is erroneous, then the Architectural Review Board may
overturn or modify the Building Commissioner's decision.
Grounds for granting variances. The Architectural Review Board may grant variances from this
article where it is found that, because of the limitations on character, size, or dimensions of a sign;
or the regulations controlling the erection or installation of a sign, the permittee would be subject to
undue hardship. Undue hardship is not a mere loss of a possible advantage or convenience to the
applicant. If it is determined that the applicant for a variance is subject to an undue hardship, then
the Architectural Review Board shall also determine that the proposed sign:
Will not be inappropriate to the type of activity to which it pertains; to the scale of the building
to which it is related; or to the aesthetic environment of the surrounding structures and land
use.
Will not adversely affect the visual character of the neighborhood.

variances shall be completed within 35 days of the determination of the Building Commissioner.

guidelines, grounds and procedures enumerated herein shall govern with respect to fences covered by
the article, and in the event the provisions of Appendix A, Zoning, § A-1110, Board of Adjustment, are
inconsistent with these provisions, then the provisions herein shall control.
Guidelines for overturning or modifying Commissioner's decision. The Board of Adjustment shall,
in considering appeals from the Commissioner's order, decision or determination, establish that
the fence or application in question complies with all of the requirements of this article. If it is
determined that the Building Commissioner's interpretation or application of this article to the
appellant's fence or request for a permit is erroneous, then the Board of Adjustment may overturn
or modify the Building Commissioner's decision.
Grounds for granting variances. The Board of Adjustment may grant variances from this article
where it is found that the applicant would be subject to an undue hardship because of the
limitations on character, size, or dimensions of a fence; or the regulations controlling the erection
or installation of a fence; or the fence is an historic restoration of the property; or due to the nature,
shape, size or area of the lot, such as through lots or three-frontage lots, no reasonable area is
available for the use and privacy of the resident, the permittee would be subject to undue
hardship. Undue hardship is not a mere loss of a possible advantage or convenience to the
applicant. If it is determined that the applicant for a variance is subject to an undue hardship, then
the Board of Adjustment shall also determine that the proposed fence:[1]
Will not be inappropriate to the scale of the building to which it relates or to the aesthetic
environment of the surrounding structures and land use;
Will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to the adjacent property;
Will not adversely affect the character of the neighborhood; and
Will not adversely affect the general health, safety and welfare of the community.
The Board's decision on an appeal shall be incorporated on the fence permit by reference to
the decision number and date of decision.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Procedure for requesting and hearing appeals and variances. Application for appeal or variances
shall be completed within 30 days of the determination of the Building Commissioner. The
application for appeal or variances shall specify the grounds for such appeal or variance and shall
be accompanied by a fee as established in the Fee Schedule of § 5-109.
The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable period of time for hearing the appeal or variance. It
shall give due notice to the parties in interest. The Board of Adjustment shall also give notice by
first class mail to all property owners, as shown by the tax records of the City, within 100 feet of
the boundaries of the tract of land for which the application is filed. All hearings shall be open to
the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member
upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of
its examinations and other official actions. All ordinances of the City, zoning enactments of the City
and the district maps which may have been or may hereafter be in force shall automatically be
part of each hearing to the extent applicable without being specifically introduced at a hearing. The
Board shall make findings together with the decision within a reasonable period of time. The
applicant shall be provided a written copy of the finding and decision.
Decision subject to review; procedure. Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any
decision of the Board of Adjustment shall have the right to appeal said decision pursuant to the

Article VI. Floodway/Floodplain Management
§ 5-69. Findings of fact and purpose.
[Ord. No. 10241, § 1, 12-18-2014]
Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section 89.020, RSMo.,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the City Council
of the City of Kirkwood, Missouri, ordains as follows:
Findings of fact.
Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of
Kirkwood, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health

and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities;
and the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consists of
a series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur
on the particular streams subject to this article. It is in the general order of a flood which
could be expected to have a 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on
the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS and illustrative materials for St. Louis County,
dated February 4, 2015, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering
analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the
regulatory flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights
more than one foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted
that would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still
subject to inundation by the base flood.
Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare; to minimize those losses described in § 5-69B(1); to establish or maintain the
community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined
in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR
60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this article to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding
or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.
§ 5-70. General provisions.
[Ord. No. 10241, § 1, 12-18-2014]
Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the

29189C0316K, and 29189C0317K, dated February 4, 2015, as amended, and any future revisions
thereto. In all areas covered by this article, no development shall be permitted except through the
issuance of a floodplain development permit granted by the City Council or its duly designated
representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the City Council or the designated
representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare,
health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in § 5-72.
Floodplain Administrator. The Building Commissioner is hereby designated as the Floodplain
Administrator under this article.
Compliance. No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall
be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this article and other applicable regulations.
Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article imposes
greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to
be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not
be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This article does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This article shall not create
a liability on the part of the City of Kirkwood, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood
damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this article is adjudged unconstitutional
or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected
thereby.
§ 5-71. Administration.

any development or substantial improvement or cause the same to be done without first obtaining
a separate floodplain development permit for each structure or other development.
Designation of Floodplain Administrator. The Building Commissioner is hereby appointed to
administer and implement the provisions of this article.
Duties and responsibilities of Floodplain Administrator. Duties of the Building Commissioner shall
include, but not be limited to:

Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 5-70, A are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the
area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any
point.
The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
If § 5-72(D)(2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of § 5-72.
In unnumbered A zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources as set
forth in § 5-72(A)(2).
Recreational vehicles.
Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within all unnumbered and numbered A
zones and AE zones on the community's FIRM either:
Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use*; or
Meet the permitting, elevation, and the anchoring requirements for manufactured homes
of this article.
* A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
§ 5-73. Variance procedures.
[Ord. No. 10241, § 1, 12-18-2014]
Establishment of Appeal Board. The Board of Adjustment as established by the City of Kirkwood
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the floodplain management
requirements of this article.
Responsibility of Appeal Board.

Floodplain management variance criteria. In passing upon such applications for variances, the
Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this article, and the following criteria:
The danger to life and property due to flood damage;
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner;
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood
waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems; streets; and bridges.
Conditions for approving floodplain management variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items in Subsections E.2 through
6 below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or
local inventory of historic places upon determination, provided the proposed activity will not
preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause; a determination
that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and a
determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage, and such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as
required by this article.
Conditions for approving variances for accessory structures.
Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case by
case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following
conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in § 5-73(D) and (E) of this article.
In order to minimize flood damages during the one-hundred-year flood and the threat to public
health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory
structures that are constructed at grade and wet floodproofed.
Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in
flood-prone areas only.
For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building
components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes,
flooring, etc.) below highest adjacent grade must be built with flood-resistant materials in
accordance with § 5-72A.4.b of this article.
The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure in accordance with § 5-72A.4.a of this article. All of the
building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces,
including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above highest adjacent
grade or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure
that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with § 5-72A.4.d of
this article.
The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening
requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls subject to the onehundred-
year flood contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters in accordance with the NFIP regulations.
Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.
No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any federal agency shall be
paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below highest adjacent grade will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage, and such construction below highest adjacent grade increases risks to
life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions
as required by this article.
Wet floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community
and registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain
development permit for construction.

shall be in writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as the Commission may
require. Upon receipt of a complaint, a copy shall be furnished to the person who allegedly
committed or is about to commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice.
Within 30 days after receiving a complaint, it shall be investigated and the Commission shall

the Commission finds no cause.
The Commission, at any time it has reason to believe that any person has been engaged in
discriminatory practice prohibited by this Code, may issue a complaint.
A complaint under Subsection (a) shall be filed within 180 days after the alleged discriminatory
housing practice occurred. Complaints may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time.
A respondent may file an answer to the complaint against him and, with the leave of the
Commission, which shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may
amend his answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
If conciliation efforts fail, the Commission shall promptly set a date for hearing of the matters
alleged in the complaint and subsequently occurring related matters, but only after giving at least
five days prior written notice to the person or persons who allegedly committed or are about to
commit the alleged unfair housing practice.
The hearing shall be conducted in a fair and impartial manner according to rules adopted by the
Commission. The person aggrieved and the person or persons who allegedly committed or are
about to commit the alleged unfair housing practice may appear with legal counsel and shall have
the right to present proof and cross-examine witnesses in all matters relating to the complaint and
subsequent related occurrences.
After a hearing pursuant to this section, the Commission will report on the matter heard to the
Council, with copies of such report being forwarded to the City Attorney. Upon the receipt of the
report, the Council will review the report and will take such action as it deems appropriate by
entering an order to cease and desist or such other appropriate order, and shall cause such order
to be served on all parties, and shall certify the case to the City Attorney and the City Prosecutor
for appropriate action.

when he files a statement which is later found to be incorrect and it is determined that an additional
license tax is due. No penalties provided in this section shall be waived by the Director of Finance and
such penalties shall be paid coincident with the payment of the license tax.

A towing company may only assess reasonable storage charges for abandoned property towed
without the consent of the owner. Reasonable storage charges shall not exceed the charges for
vehicles which have been towed with the consent of the owner on a negotiated basis. Storage
charges may be assessed only for the time in which the towing company complies with the
procedural requirements of this division.
The Council may from time to time establish maximum reasonable towing, storage and other
charges which can be imposed by towing and storage companies operating within the City, and
which are consistent with this division and with Sections 304.155 to 304.158, RSMo. Any violation
of said established maximum charges shall be deemed a violation of this section of the Code and
shall be punishable pursuant to § 1-8 of the City of Kirkwood Code of Ordinances.
A towing company may impose a charge of not more than 1/2 of the regular towing charge for the
towing of abandoned property at the request of the owner of private real property or that owner's
agent pursuant to this division if the owner of the abandoned property or the owner's agent returns
to the abandoned property before it is removed from the private real property. The regular towing
charge may only be imposed after the abandoned property has been removed from the property
and is in transit.
Editor's Note: Added at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).

approved by the State Board of Education, which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.
Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school system which has a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds, which has the engine mounted entirely in front
of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels, and which is used for the
transportation of school children shall be equipped no later than August 1, 1998, with a crossing
control arm. The crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five feet six
inches from the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right
side of the front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (b) of this section.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading or
unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical signaling
devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to drivers of
other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district shall have the
authority pursuant to this section to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a school bus in
the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four or more lanes may
pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to stop and may
use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a stop;
provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided that the
emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers should
proceed with caution, and in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the school bus
with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at any location
upon a highway consisting of four or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided by a median or
barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two lanes of traffic; nor
shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the road or highway
proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least 500 feet in each direction to
drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder and a speed limit greater than
60 miles per hour and at least 300 feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other
highways, and on all highways, only for such time as is actually necessary to take on and
discharge passengers.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or
overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, or which is proceeding in the opposite
direction on a highway containing four or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading
zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or controlled-access highway at a point where
pedestrians are not permitted to cross the roadway.
The driver of any school bus driving upon the highways of this state, after loading or unloading
school children, shall remain stopped if the bus is followed by three or more vehicles, until such
vehicles have been permitted to pass the school bus, if the conditions prevailing make it safe to do
so.
If any vehicle is witnessed by a peace officer or the driver of a school bus to have violated the
provisions of this section and the identity of the operator is not otherwise apparent, it shall be a
rebuttable presumption that the person in whose name such vehicle is registered committed the
violation. In the event that charges are filed against multiple owners of a motor vehicle, only one of
the owners may be convicted and court costs may be assessed against only one of the owners. If
the vehicle which is involved in the violation is registered in the name of a rental or leasing
company and the vehicle is rented or leased to another person at the time of the violation, the
rental or leasing company may rebut the presumption by providing the peace officer or
prosecuting authority with a copy of the rental or lease agreement in effect at the time of the
violation. No prosecuting authority may bring any legal proceedings against a rental or leasing
company under this section unless prior written notice of the violation has been given to that rental
or leasing company by registered mail at the address appearing on the registration and the rental

§ 14-278. Traffic control signals; legend; observance.
[Ord. No. 7920, § 1, 10-19-1989]
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights or colored
lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall
be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall indicate and
apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
Green indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left
unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles
turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an
adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in this article,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
Steady yellow indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter
when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control
signal as provided in this article, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the
roadway.
Steady red indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, then before entering
the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown, except as
provided in Subsection (c)(2);[2]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the entrance to the
intersection in obedience to a red signal, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right
turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by

turn against a red signal at any intersection where safety conditions so require; said
prohibition shall be effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof;
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in § 14-279, pedestrians
facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.[3]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II).
Traffic control signals, signs or markings at other than intersections. In the event an official traffic
control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provision of this
section shall be applicable, except as to those provisions which, by their nature, can have no
application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating
where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be
made at the signal.

Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the
signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
Wait or don't walk. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such signal,
but any pedestrian who has partially completed his crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a
sidewalk or safety zone while the wait signal is showing.

before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or if
none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the
rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may
proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution.
This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. The conduct of drivers of vehicles
approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules as set forth in § 14-151.

Definition. "When lighted lamps are required" means at any time from a 1/2 hour after sunset
to 1/2 hour before sunrise and at any other time when there is not sufficient light to render
clearly discernible persons and vehicles on the highway at a distance of 500 feet ahead.
Lighted lamps shall also be required any time the weather conditions require usage of the
motor vehicle's windshield wipers to operate the vehicle in a careful and prudent manner as
defined in Section 304.012, RSMo. The provisions of this section shall be interpreted to
require lighted lamps during periods of fog even if usage of the windshield wipers is not
necessary to operate the vehicle in a careful and prudent manner.
Requirement; violations and penalties.
No person shall drive, move, park or be in custody of any vehicle or combination of
vehicles on any street or highway during the times when lighted lamps are required
unless such vehicle or combination of vehicles displays lighted lamps and illuminating
devices as hereinafter in this section required. No person shall use on any vehicle any
approved electric lamp or similar device unless the light source of such lamp or device
complies with the conditions of approval as to focus and rated candlepower.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 307.120, RSMo., or any other provision of law,
violation of this section shall be deemed an ordinance violation and any person who

so arranged that such selection can be made automatically, subject to the following limitations:
There shall be an uppermost distribution of light, or composite beam, so aimed and of such
intensity as to reveal persons and vehicles at a distance of at least 350 feet ahead for all
conditions of loading.
There shall be a lowermost distribution of light, or composite beam, so aimed and of sufficient
intensity to reveal persons and vehicles at a distance of at least 100 feet ahead; and on a
straight level road under any condition of loading none of the high-intensity portion of the
beam shall be directed to strike the eyes of an approaching driver. (RSMo. § 307.060)
Dimming of lights. Every person driving a motor vehicle equipped with multiple-beam road lighting
equipment, during the times when lighted lamps are required, shall use a distribution of light, or
composite beam, directed high enough and of sufficient intensity to reveal persons and vehicles at
a safe distance in advance of the vehicle, subject to the following requirements and limitations:
Whenever the driver of a vehicle approaches an oncoming vehicle within 500 feet or is within 300
feet to the rear of another vehicle traveling in the same direction, the driver shall use a distribution
of light, or composite beam, so aimed that the glaring rays are not projected into the eyes of the
other driver, and in no case shall the high-intensity portion which is projected to the left of the
prolongation of the extreme left side of the vehicle be aimed higher than the center of the lamp

§ 14-366. Operator's financial responsibility.
[Ord. No. 8549, § 1, 9-19-1996; Ord. No. 10492, 6-7-2018]
No owner of a motor vehicle registered in this state, or required to be registered in this state, shall
operate, register or maintain registration of a motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate
such vehicle, unless the owner maintains the financial responsibility which conforms to the
requirements of the laws of this state. No nonresident shall operate or permit another person to
operate in this City a motor vehicle registered to such nonresident unless the nonresident
maintains the financial responsibility which conforms to the requirements of the laws of the
nonresident's state of residence. Furthermore, no person shall operate a motor vehicle owned by
another with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained financial responsibility unless such
person has financial responsibility which covers the person's operation of the other's vehicle.
However, no owner or nonresident shall be in violation of this subsection if he/she fails to maintain
financial responsibility on a motor vehicle which is inoperable or being stored and not in operation.
For purposes of this section, the term "financial responsibility" shall mean the ability to respond in
damages for liability on account of accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said
financial responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, in the
amount of $25,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and,
subject to said limit for one person, in the amount of $50,000 because of bodily injury to or death
of two or more persons in any one accident and in the amount of $10,000 because of injury to or
destruction of property of others in any one accident.

rather than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall exhibit the insurance
identification card on the demand of any peace officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or
commercial vehicle inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident while
that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the officer's or inspector's duties.

On or in any of the waters in this state;
On the banks of any stream;
On any land or water owned, operated or leased by the state, any board, department, agency
or commission thereof, or any political subdivision thereof;
On any land or water owned, operated or leased by the federal government; or
On any private real property owned by another without his or her consent.
For purposes of this section, the last owner of record of a vehicle, vessel, or trailer found
abandoned and not shown to be transferred pursuant to Sections 301.196 and 301.197, RSMo.,
shall be deemed prima facie evidence of ownership of such vehicle, vessel, or trailer at the time it
was abandoned and the person who abandoned the vehicle, vessel, or trailer or caused or
procured its abandonment. The registered owner of the abandoned vehicle, vessel, or trailer shall
not be subject to the penalties provided by this section if the vehicle, vessel, or trailer was in the
care, custody, or control of another person at the time of the violation. In such instance, the owner
shall submit such evidence in an affidavit permitted by the court setting forth the name, address,
and other pertinent information of the person who leased, rented, or otherwise had care, custody,
or control of the vehicle, vessel, or trailer at the time of the alleged violation. The affidavit
submitted pursuant to this subsection shall be admissible in a court proceeding adjudicating the
alleged violation and shall raise a rebuttable presumption that the person identified in the affidavit
was in actual control of the vehicle, vessel, or trailer. In such case, the court has the authority to
terminate the prosecution of the summons issued to the owner and issue a summons to the
person identified in the affidavit as the operator. If the vehicle, vessel, or trailer is alleged to have
been stolen, the owner of the vehicle, vessel, or trailer shall submit proof that a police report was
filed in a timely manner indicating that the vehicle or vessel was stolen at the time of the alleged
violation.
The offense of abandoning a vehicle, vessel, or trailer is an ordinance violation.

storage, and administrative costs associated with the abandonment of the vehicle, vessel, or
trailer. Any reasonable towing, storage, and administrative costs in excess of the value of the
abandoned vehicle, vessel, or trailer that exist at the time the property is transferred pursuant to
Section 304.156, RSMo., shall remain the liability of the person convicted pursuant to this section
so long as the towing company, as defined in Chapter 304, RSMo., provided the title owner and
lienholders, as ascertained by the Department of Revenue records, a notice within the time frame
and in the form as described in Subsection 1 of Section 304.156, RSMo. (RSMo. § 577.080, 2008,

dealer, towing or storage facility so long as the business is operated in compliance with its business

which the owner of the abandoned property or property parked in a restricted or assigned
area may call to receive information regarding the location of such owner's property.
Unattended on owner-occupied residential property. The abandoned property is left
unattended on owner-occupied residential property with four residential units or less and

private real property and the owner, lessee or agent of the real property in lawful
possession of real property has notified the City Police Department, and 96 hours have
elapsed since that notification.
Pursuant to this section, any owner or lessee in lawful possession of real property that
requests a towing company to tow abandoned property without authorization from a City

the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of an offense, agrees with another person
or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such offense.
It is no defense to a prosecution for conspiring to commit an offense that a person, who knows
that a person with whom he or she conspires to commit an offense has conspired with another
person or persons to commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other person or
persons.

A.
If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he or she can be found guilty of only one
offense so long as such multiple offenses are the object of the same agreement.
No person may be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense unless
an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or
her or by a person with whom he or she conspired.
Exceptions.
No person shall be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense if,
after conspiring to commit the offense, he/she prevented the accomplishment of the
objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his/her
criminal purpose.
The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of renunciation of criminal purpose
under Subsection E(1).
For the purpose of time limitations on prosecutions:
A conspiracy to commit an offense is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when
the offense or offenses which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be
committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he or she conspired;
If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him/her only if
he/she advises those with whom he/she has conspired of his/her abandonment or he/she
informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his/her
participation in it.
A person shall not be charged, convicted or sentenced on the basis of the same course of conduct
of both the actual commission of an offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense.

Returns the property to the lessor at the end of the lease term, plus any agreed upon
extensions, but does not pay the lease charges agreed upon in the written instrument, with
the intent to wrongfully deprive the lessor of the agreed upon charges.
The provisions of this section shall apply to all forms of leasing and rental agreements, including,
but not limited to, contracts which provide the consumer options to buy the leased or rented
personal property, lease-purchase agreements and rent-to-own contracts. For the purpose of
determining if a violation of this section has occurred, leasing contracts which provide options to
buy the merchandise are owned by the owner of the property until such time as the owner
endorses the sale and transfer of ownership of the leased property to the lessee.
Evidence that a lessee used a false, fictitious, or not current name, address, or place of
employment in obtaining the property or that a lessee fails or refuses to return the property or pay
the lease charges to the lessor within seven days after written demand for the return has been
sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address the person set forth in the lease
agreement, or in the absence of the address, to the person's last known place of residence, shall
be evidence of intent to violate the provisions of this section, except that if a motor vehicle has not
been returned within 72 hours after the expiration of the lease or rental agreement, such failure to
return the motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of the intent of the offense of stealing
leased or rented property. Where the leased or rented property is a motor vehicle, if the motor
vehicle has not been returned within 72 hours after the expiration of the lease or rental agreement,
the lessor may notify the local law enforcement agency of the failure of the lessee to return such
motor vehicle, and the local law enforcement agency shall cause such motor vehicle to be put into
any appropriate state and local computer system listing stolen motor vehicles. Any law
enforcement officer which stops such a motor vehicle may seize the motor vehicle and notify the
lessor that he/she may recover such motor vehicle after it is photographed and its vehicle
identification number is recorded for evidentiary purposes. Where the leased or rented property is
not a motor vehicle, if such property has not been returned within the seven-day period prescribed
in this subsection, the owner of the property shall report the failure to return the property to the
local law enforcement agency, and such law enforcement agency may within five days notify the
person who leased or rented the property that such person is in violation of this section, and that
failure to immediately return the property may subject such person to arrest for the violation.
This section shall not apply if such personal property is a vehicle and such return is made more
difficult or expensive by a defect in such vehicle which renders such vehicle inoperable if the
lessee shall notify the lessor of the location of such vehicle and such defect before the expiration
of the lease or rental agreement or within 10 days after proper notice.
Any person who has leased or rented personal property of another who destroys such property so
as to avoid returning it to the owner commits the offense of property damage pursuant to
§ 569.100, RSMo., or § 17-104 of this Code in addition to being in violation of this section.
Venue shall lie in the county where the personal property was originally rented or leased.

Editor's Note: Ord. 6785, § 1, enacted 8-6-1981, amended the Code by adding § 23-84(b).
Inasmuch as the Code already contained a § 23-84(b), the provisions were redesignated as § 23-
84(f).
Special regulations with regard to customers in Classes GS-A, GS-B and P.
The City's rates applicable to industrial and commercial services are based on all such
customers maintaining a power factor of not less than 90% lagging. In the event a customer's
power factor is less than 85% during periods of normal operation, the City shall have the right
to require the customer to install, at his own expense, such corrective equipment as may be
required to increase the customer's power factor to not less than 85%.
All of the customer's lighting equipment, motor-driven equipment, apparatus, and appliances
shall have such characteristics or be equipped with corrective devices so as to enable the
City to maintain a satisfactory standard of service. In the case of high motor starting current,
violently fluctuating or intermittent loads, the City reserves and shall have the right to require
the customer to install, at his own expense, apparatus to correct the objectionable conditions.
When a separate or oversized substation or transformer must be installed specifically to
eliminate the effect of the objectionable load characteristic from the distribution system which
would otherwise have the capacity to supply a normal load of the same size, or where
separate transformers and/or service are installed at customer's request to supply apparatus
which is sensitive to voltage, the cost of such substation or transformer is considered as a
corrective device under Subsection (2) above.
When a customer fails to install the necessary facilities on its premises to correct the
objectionable conditions of its load, or to prevent such objectionable conditions from
interfering with the City's supply of satisfactory service to other customers, the City shall have
the right to deny service to such customer until the objectionable condition shall have been
corrected in a manner satisfactory to the City, provided that no service to any customer shall
be discontinued unless such customer has been given 10 days' notice of such termination
and the right to consult with an appropriate employee of the Electric Department during such
ten-day period.

during the applicable billing period, the customer-generator shall be billed for
the net billable kwh supplied by the Utility in accordance with the rates and charges
under the Utility's standard rate schedule applicable to the customer.
If the electricity generated by the customer-generator exceeds the electricity supplied by
the Utility, the customer-generator shall be credited for the net value of the electric
energy delivered to the Utility during the applicable billing period at the Utility's avoided
cost, with this credit appearing on the customer-generator's bill no later than the following
billing period.
Kirkwood Electric's Avoided Cost Energy cost, per kwh $0.175
Special conditions.
The customer-generator must have a signed standard interconnection
application/agreement with the Utility.

Rider PPA - purchase power adjustment clause:
Rider PPA
Purchase Power Adjustment Clause
Applicability
3/5/2020 City of Kirkwood, MO Ecode360

Rider PPA
Purchase Power Adjustment Clause
This Rider is applicable to kilowatt-hours (kwh) of energy supplies to customers served by
Kirkwood Electric Bill Codes E1, E2, E3, E4, including City-owned and customer-owned outdoor
lighting.
Costs passed through this Purchased Power Adjustment Clause (PPA) reflect differences
between actual purchase power costs, estimated purchased power costs and targeted reserve
fund levels.
For purposes of this PPA, the true-up year shall be from January 1 through the last day of
December of the current year. The accumulation periods and recovery periods are set forth in
the following table:
Accumulation Period (AP) Filing Date Recovery Period (RP)
February through May By August 1 October through September
June through September By December 1 February through January
October through January By April 1 June through May
Accumulation period (AP) means the historical calendar months during which the purchased
power costs are determined.
Recovery period (RP) means the billing months set forth in the above table during which the
difference between the actual purchase power costs, the estimated purchased power costs, and
the targeted reserve fund levels are applied to and recovered through the customer billings on a
per kwh basis.
The Electric Department will make a purchased power adjustment filing (FPPA) to the City
Council by each filing date. The new rates for which the filing is made will be applicable starting
with the recovery period that begins following the filing date. All FPPA filings shall be
accompanied by detailed work papers supporting the filing in an electronic format.
FPPA Determination
The difference between the actual power supply costs, the estimated purchased power costs,
and the targeted reserve fund levels for all kwh supplied to Kirkwood Electric customers during
the respective accumulation periods shall be reflected as an FPPA credit or debit, stated as a
separate line item on the customer's bill and will be calculated according to the following
formulas.
For the FPPA filing made by each filing date, the FPPA rate, applicable starting with the
recovery period following the applicable filing date, to recover purchased power costs as defined
below, during the recently-completed accumulation period, is calculated as:
FPPA =((CPP-ECPP) + (ARFL-TRFL))/S
The PPA rate, which will be multiplied by the voltage level adjustment factors set forth below,
applicable starting with the following recovery period, is calculated as:
FPPA = FPPA + FPPA + FPPA
Where:
FPPA = Purchased Power Adjustment rate applicable starting with the
recovery period following the applicable filing date
FPPA = FPPA recovery period rate component calculated to recover
under/over collection during the accumulated period that ended
prior to the applicable filing date
FPPA = FPPA recovery period rate component from prior FPPA
calculation, if any
FPPA = FPPA recovery period rate component from prior FPPA
calculation prior to FPPA , if any
CPP = Cost of purchased power reflected in the wholesale purchased

"NOTICE OF INTENDED DISCONTINUANCE OF ELECTRIC SERVICE"
"Your electric bills from the City of Kirkwood for the past three months up to and including
the bill of ______________, 20_____ have not been paid in full. Therefore, pursuant to § 23-
88 of the Ordinances of the City of Kirkwood, your electric service will be discontinued if the
balance is not paid in full or other arrangements are made with the City's credit and utility
billing supervisor within six calendar days from the date of this notice."
If the customer of electric service fails to pay the bill in full or make other arrangements with
the Director of Finance within the aforementioned six-day notice period provided in this
section, the City's Electric Department will forthwith discontinue the electric service to such
customer and the bill may be specially assessed against the real property.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the City will not discontinue electric
service to residential properties during the months of November through March.
If a customer is notified of a delinquent electric service account, that customer, prior to the
expiration of the six-day notice period provided in this section can request the City's
installment payment plan to allow the customer to make partial payments over a specific
period of time of the overdue amount. Along with these partial payments as determined by the
Director of Finance, the customer must pay in full each succeeding monthly electric service
bill.
The City's credit and utility billing supervisor may, in his/her discretion, consider account
history and/or general credit history of the customer in determining whether to allow an
installment plan and, if so, the parameters of that plan. The Director of Finance may also
order the installation of a current limiting device for the customer. No current limiting device,
however, shall be installed at any residential property with central electric heating during the
months of November through March.
At the time of the discontinuance of the electric service to a consumer as set forth in Subsection
(b), a final reading of the meter of such consumer shall be made, and that reading shall be
certified to the Director of Finance. The Director of Finance shall determine the full amount due to
the City for electric service consumed by the consumer up to the time of the discontinuance of the
service, and shall apply any deposit on hand against said amount. If the deposit on hand shall
exceed the total amount of the final bill for electric service, the balance thereof shall be transmitted
to the consumer. If the deposit on hand shall be insufficient to pay the full amount of the final
billing, the Director of Finance shall render a final bill for the balance due to the consumer and also
transmit the account to the City attorney for further action and collection. At the time of the
transmission to the consumer of either a refund from an excess deposit or a final billing for
additional amounts due over and above any deposit on hand, the Director of Finance shall set
forth all pertinent details as to the amount of electric current consumed, used to determine the final
billing.
The failure on the part of the consumer to receive the notice as set forth in Subsection (b) shall be
no reason or excuse or justification for the failure to pay the bill as required or to prevent the
discontinuance of electric service.
When any electric service of a consumer has been discontinued as provided in this section it shall
not be resumed for such consumer at the same or any other address until all unpaid bills shall
have been paid, and the actual cost of the discontinuance of the service, not exceeding $50 for
reconnections during normal working hours, or the actual cost after normal working hours, shall
also have been paid.

days from the date of this notice."
If a customer of water service fails to pay the bill in full or make other arrangements with the
Director of Finance within the aforementioned six-day notice period provided in this section,
the City's Water Department will forthwith discontinue water service to that customer and the
bill may be specially assessed against the real property.
At the time of the discontinuance and turn off of the water service to a consumer as set forth in

Discontinuance of service and placement of lien.
In the event a customer has an unpaid balance on a water service account for three months
before the next bill is sent out to that customer, the water service account is deemed
delinquent. Once a water service account is deemed delinquent, the Director of Finance shall
provide written notice to the most current billing address of the customer, containing the
following:
"NOTICE OF INTENDED DISCONTINUANCE OF WATER SERVICE
AND PLACEMENT OF LIEN UPON REAL PROPERTY"
"Your water service bill for the past three months up to and including the bill of
_____________, 20_____ has not been paid in full. Therefore, pursuant to § 23-145 of the
Ordinances of the City of Kirkwood, your water service will be discontinued if this bill is not
paid in full or other arrangements are made with the Director of Finance within six calendar
days from the date of this notice. In addition, a lien may be placed upon your real property in
the amount of the unpaid balance."
If a customer of water service fails to pay the bill in full or make other arrangements with the
Director of Finance within the aforementioned six-day notice period provided in this section,
the City's Water Department will forthwith discontinue water service to that customer and the

bill may be specially assessed against the real property and become a lien thereon placed on
the tax roll.
If a customer is notified of a delinquent water service account, that customer, prior to the
expiration of the six-day notice period provided in this section, can request the Director of
Finance to consider an installment payment plan to allow the customer to make partial
payments, over a specific period of time, of the overdue account. Along with these partial
payments as determined by the Director of Finance, the customer must pay in full each
succeeding quarterly water service bill.
The Director of Finance may, in his/her discretion, consider account history and/or general
credit history of the customer in determining whether to allow an installment (payment) plan
and, if so, the parameters of that plan.
At the time of the discontinuance and turn off of the water service to a consumer as set forth in
Subsection (b), a final reading of the meter of such consumer shall be made, and that reading
shall be certified by the Director of Finance. The Director of Finance shall determine the full
amount due to the City for water consumed by the consumer up to the time of the discontinuance
of the service, and shall apply any deposit on hand against the amount. If the deposit on hand
shall exceed the total amount of the final bill for water service, the balance thereof shall be
transmitted to the consumer. If the deposit on hand shall be insufficient to pay the full amount of
the total billing, the Director of Finance shall render a final bill for the balance due to the consumer
and also transfer the account to the City Attorney, designated collection firm for further action and
collection and/or the county to be added to the property as a lien. At the time of the transmission
to the consumer of either a refund from an excess deposit or a final billing for an additional amount
due over and above any deposit on hand, the Director of Finance shall set forth all pertinent
details as to the amount of water consumed used to determine the final billing.
The failure on the part of the consumer to receive the notice as set forth in Subsection (b) shall be
no reason, excuse or justification for the failure to pay the bill as required or to prevent the
discontinuance and turn off of water service as hereinbefore set forth.
When any water service of a consumer has been discontinued as provided in this section, it shall
not be resumed for such consumer at the same or any other address until all unpaid bills shall
have been paid and the actual cost of the discontinuance and turnoff of the service not exceeding
$30 for reconnections during normal working hours or the actual cost after normal working hours
shall have been paid.
§ 23-146. Adjustments.
[Ord. No. 8712, § 1, 4-2-1998]
The Director of Public Services shall be authorized to adjust water bills in the event of abnormally high
water bills caused by unexplainable or other reasons. Adjustments of this nature shall be made at the
discretion of the Director of Public Services based upon a written policy adopted by the Department.
Said policy shall be placed on file with the City Clerk.

Purpose. The purpose of this section is to require site plan review as outlined below for
buildings, structures, and uses to analyze the impacts on natural resources, traffic patterns,
adjacent parcels, and the character of future development. The regulations contained herein are
intended to provide and promote orderly developments within the City for the betterment of the
general welfare of the community based upon good planning practices, safe and convenient traffic
movement, both within a site and in relation to access streets, the recommendations of other
applicable City plans, including, but not limited to, the Kirkwood Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan; the
stability of land values and investments, compatibility with adjoining and neighboring parcels, the
maintenance and improvement of the general welfare and character of the developments within
the community, with proper attention to setting and the avoidance of unsightly appearances; and
other factors conducive to the proper development of the City.
Objectives. The City may, upon proper application, take the following actions on an application
for site plan review: approve, deny, or approve with modifications to zoning requirements and/or
additional conditions and restrictions as described herein. Modifications from existing zoning
requirements may be considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council in
relation to property line setback(s) [except for the setback line(s) directly adjacent to properties
zoned residentially], street frontage occupation, lot size, height, density, landscape requirements,
and parking requirements designed for conventional development. If the developer can
demonstrate that one or more of the numbered objectives listed below can be realized at a higher
level with modification of certain zoning requirements than could be achieved if all zoning
requirements were to be upheld, the City may grant a modification to one or more of the zoning
requirements listed above. Final determination of whether the proposed design warrants
modification from existing zoning requirements is at the sole discretion of the City Council.
[Ord. No. 10535, 12-6-2018]

natural features of a development site, inclusive of preservation, planting, maintenance,
restoration, protection and survival of desirable tree canopy areas within a development site.
Consideration of the impact on neighboring residential properties resulting from nonresidential
uses within the development, including but not limited to protecting the existing neighborhood
assets and quality of life.
Rational and cost-effective development in relation to public services and the installation and
maintenance of public and private infrastructure by reducing the distance utilities are
extended and installed, and/or by reducing the width and length of streets.
Design for efficient and effective traffic circulation, both within and adjacent to the
development site, and the encouragement of pedestrian and nonmotorized pathway utilizing
site features compliant with the land use plan.
Providing safe access to the development for all users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and
individuals with disabilities.

Administrative action. The Director of Public Services shall determine whether an application
for site plan review provides sufficient material for review against all requirements of the
Zoning Code.
At such time as the Director of Public Services determines the application to be complete, the
Director of Public Services shall refer all applications that require site plan approval by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council, pursuant to § A-220, to the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council for review.
Site plan approval.
For all site plans subject to site plan review, a fee shall be paid in accordance with the
Municipal Code of Ordinances, Chapter 5, Article VII, Fee Schedule.
When applicable, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall review and act upon a site
plan review application within 120 days of the date on which the application is received
and deemed complete by the Director of Public Services or within the time period
otherwise specified for another review process, if any. Said time period for review and
action may be extended upon mutual agreement between the City and the applicant. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall post notice on the property that is the subject of
the application, hear a presentation from the applicant, allow other interested parties to
make comments, and thereafter, provide the City Council with its recommendations
concerning the site plan within such time period. If the Planning and Zoning Commission
fails to take action within the time specified, the site plan review application shall be
considered as having received an affirmative recommendation. After a recommendation
from the Planning and Zoning Commission, a public hearing will be held by the City
Council as described below. The City Council may then either approve, deny, or modify
and then approve the application and site plan by resolution and, when appropriate, the
site plan review process shall be in conjunction with another application that requires final
approval by the City Council. The City Council may also choose to return the application
to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further study and report.
Public hearing required. The City Council shall conduct a public hearing concerning the
application after having given notice of the time, place, and purpose of such public hearing by
at least one notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Kirkwood at least
15 days prior to the date of the public hearing, and by sending a copy of said notice by first
class mail to all property owners shown by the county tax records within 300 feet of the
boundaries of the subject area.
Modifications, conditions and restrictions. In approving an application for site plan review, the
Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Council may grant modifications and/or impose
additional conditions and restrictions on said plan.
If the City Council imposes conditions or restrictions, it shall designate specific requirements
which must be met before an applicant may be granted final approval of a site plan. Failure to
comply with any of these conditions or restrictions shall constitute a violation of this code
punishable as set forth in § A-1120 of this code.
Site plan review and the Board of Adjustment. The completion of the site plan review process
as outlined herein shall be considered a necessary step in the exhausting of all available
alternatives that is required prior to applying to the City's Board of Adjustment for a variance.
However, if a modification requested during the site plan review process is based upon a
question of undue hardship or practical difficulty, the City Council may require the applicant to
apply to the Board of Adjustment prior to making a final decision.
Criteria for site plan review. In conducting a site plan review and approval, the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council shall consider the following:

Phased development. In the event an applicant desires to present a site plan identifying the
construction of a complex of buildings and site improvements to be developed over an extended
period of time, a detailed site plan shall be submitted for approval by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council in accordance with this section for each specific building project.
This shall include a proposed time schedule for each phase of the project. Such detailed site plans
may be submitted in advance of or in conjunction with an application for a building permit. Of
primary importance in this review will be a determination that the detailed site plan complies with
the site plan approval for the total development or project. This provision shall not be construed to
obligate an applicant to provide a site plan detailing phased development but is intended to be
discretionary with the applicant. In instances of phased development, the portions of the site not
under active construction shall be maintained according to all City codes and in no way shall the
active construction cause the remaining portions to become a property maintenance issue.
Period of validity. No approval of an application for site plan review shall be valid for a period
longer than 12 months from the date granted, unless within such a period a building permit is
obtained and substantial construction is commenced. The City Council may by resolution grant up
to two extensions not exceeding 12 months each upon written request submitted no later than 30
days prior to the date such site plan approval shall terminate, with a submittal, including the
original applicant, resubmission of the application and filing fee in accordance with the Municipal
Code of Ordinances, Chapter 5, Article VII, Fee Schedule, if the application as resubmitted is
substantially the same as the initially approved application. However, the City Council has the
power in such cases to attach new conditions to its reapproval or disapprove the reapplication.
Where the application for reapproval contained changes which the City Council concludes
materially alter the initial application, it shall refer the application to the Director of Public Services
who shall initiate a new site plan review procedure in accordance with the provisions herein.
Modification of approval of site plan. After an application for site plan review has been
approved, changes that are, in the judgment of the Director of Public Services, material to the
approved site plan, shall require a resubmission and payment of additional fees in accordance
with the Municipal Code of Ordinances, Chapter 5, Article VII, Fee Schedule.
Financial guarantees. As part of the site plan review process, a performance guarantee shall be
required in the form of a cash deposit or a letter of credit from a local lending institution furnished
by the developer to ensure restoration of the site, protection and installation of public
improvements, and compliance with the conditions of approval, including the requirements for
drives, walkways, utilities, parking, public improvements, landscaping, screening, and the like.
The performance guarantee shall be provided to the City before the issuance of the permit
authorizing the project or activity but no later than 12 months from the date of approval.
Before acceptance of the performance guarantee by the City, the developer shall pay to the
City of Kirkwood a fee in accordance with the Municipal Code of Ordinances, Chapter 5,
Article VII, Fee Schedule. Such fee is for administration and site inspections.
As work progresses, the Director of Public Services may authorize a proportional rebate of
the financial guarantee upon completion of significant phases or improvements.
The City shall require the monetary value of trees to be preserved to be included in the
performance guarantee. Should the designated trees be lost due to willful action or neglect of
the developer, the developer shall provide landscaping and trees in the site area equal to the
performance guarantee amount or forfeit the amount to the general revenue of the City of
Kirkwood.
Failure to satisfy the conditions of the site plan review procedure shall result in the letter of
credit being forfeited to the general revenue of the City of Kirkwood.

with its site and adjoining buildings. Building components such as windows and doors should
have proportions appropriate to the architecture of the structure.
Proportion. Elements of building massing should relate to the size and shape of those of
adjacent buildings.
Materials. Materials should be selected for suitability to the type of building and the design in
which they are used and for harmony with adjoining buildings. Materials should be of durable
quality.
Colors. Colors, including trim and accent colors, should be harmonious and visually
compatible with neighboring buildings.
Awnings, canopies and marquees. Awnings, canopies and marquees should fit the character
of the building and not interfere with the appearance of the surrounding buildings.
Preservation of period detail. Original details on existing buildings such as cornices, horizontal
bands and decorative elements should be preserved.
Screening. Unitarian facilities, including, but not limited to, trash dumpsters and rooftop and
mechanical units, should be visually screened with materials harmonious with the building.
Single-family architectural review. The Architectural Review Board shall review all single-family
residential building applications in all areas of Kirkwood in accordance with Chapter 2, Article VII,

The front yard setback for a lot located between two improved lots, where the front
yard setback of one of the improved lots exceeds the average front yard setback of

by calculating the average of all front yard setbacks on the same side of the block as
the subject lot. For blocks which are more than 1,000 feet in length, the front yard
setback average shall be determined using all lots (or portions thereof) within a
distance of 300 feet but not less than three lots in each direction of the subject lot.
These calculations shall exclude the lot with the enlarged setback from both the 300
feet distance and minimum number of lots parameters as depicted in Figure 400-3.

valid.
Height. No building other than a church or similar place of worship shall exceed 35 feet and
2 1/2 stories in height.
Infill residential finished first floor height and grade adjustment. The maximum finished first floor
height for new residential structures for an interior lot located between two improved lots shall be
determined by averaging the two existing finished first floor heights of the structures on either side
of the subject lot.
The maximum finished first floor height for new residential structures located between an
improved lot on one side and vacant lot on the other side or between an improved lot and a street
or between a vacant lot and a street shall be determined by averaging the existing finished first
floor heights of every improved lot within 200 feet, beginning from the property line of subject lot,
in the same block and on the same street frontage. For corner lots, the measurement shall be
taken along both frontages and the more restrictive of the two averages shall apply.
However, when the maximum finished first floor height for a new residential structure is calculated
to be less than 24 inches, the maximum finished first floor height for the new residential structure
may be set to 24 inches, but if the maximum finished first floor height for the new residential
structure would still result in any portion of the new foundation being below the minimum
requirements of the adopted Building Code,[1] a grade adjustment of up to 12 inches may be
added to the maximum finished first floor height.
Editor's Note: See § 5-2, Building Code.
Lot width and yard areas. No building or structure shall be erected or enlarged unless the
following lot width and yard requirements are provided and maintained in connection with such
building, structure, or enlargement, unless otherwise provided herein.
For structures which were legally constructed and contain front yard, rear yard or side yard
setbacks which are not in conformance with this code: the existing front, rear, and/or side yard
setbacks of the primary structure which are not in conformity shall be considered as the setbacks
for the subject property for the purpose of additions, alterations, and expansions, except that in no
case shall the minimum front, rear or side yard setback be less than five feet. However,
construction in front of the existing front yard building line shall be permitted if it satisfies § A-
430.7(2)d below. When nonconforming setbacks are considered as the required setbacks, the only
encroachments permitted are roof overhangs, sill, belt courses, cornices and other architectural
features not to exceed 30 inches into the yard.

is made by the Building Commissioner's Office for a period greater than 180 days, and every
180 days thereafter, a penalty of 10% of the performance guarantee balance shall be forfeited
to the City of Kirkwood. Any applicant desiring to extend the period in which construction shall
commence under a mixed-use development shall, no later than 30 days prior to the date such
mixed-use development shall terminate, submit a written request to the City Council setting
forth the reasons such development should be extended and filing fee in accordance with
Chapter 5 of the Kirkwood Municipal Code. The City Council may extend such application for
an additional one year(s) from the anticipated date of expiration at the sole discretion of the
City Council. No mixed-use development shall be deemed to terminate pending consideration
by the City Council of a timely filed application.
Financial guarantees. In reviewing the final site plan, the City Council shall require a cash
deposit, letter of credit, or other financial guarantee acceptable to the City, to be furnished by
the developer to insure compliance with such requirements as completion time lines, drives,
walks, utilities, sewers, parking, landscaping and the like. The financial guarantee shall be
deposited with the City within six months of final approval by the City Council and prior to the
issuance of any permits along with an administrative fee in accordance with the Municipal
Code of Ordinances, Chapter 5, Article VII, Fee Schedule. As work progresses, the Director
of Public Services may authorize a proportional release of the financial guarantee upon
completion of significant phases or improvements.
Amendments to approved final site plans. The owner or owners of any tract of land with an
approved final site plan for a mixed-use development (or existing mixed-use development)
shall file an application for amendment to said plan, and a fee shall be paid in accordance
with the Municipal Code of Ordinances, Chapter 5, Article VII, Fee Schedule.
If the proposed amendment substantially modifies the approved final site plan by intensity
of use, traffic impact, or construction or expansion of a structure or parking area by more
than 5,000 square feet, the plan shall be reviewed in accordance with the development
regulations described in this § A-510.5.
If the proposed amendment modifies the site plan of the approved plan, the application
shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council as a final
site plan.
Minor revisions to the final site plan may be approved by the Director of Public Services if
such revisions satisfy the intent of the approved site plan.
Height. No building other than a church or similar place of worship shall exceed in height that
height which for that particular building will create a maximum floor area ratio in excess of 2 1/2 or
40 feet, whichever is the lesser, except when the building is part of a mixed-use development, the
height shall not exceed 60 feet when approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission or City
Council as part of a site plan review. Architectural features may be permitted above the height
limitations provided that the space above the maximum height is not occupied, not used for
storage, and is approved by Planning and Zoning or the City Council as part of a site plan review.
More than one commercial or institutional structure may be erected upon a single lot, but the
yards and open spaces required around the boundaries of the lot or tract shall not be encroached
upon by any such structure, nor shall there be any change in the intensity of use requirements.
New structures shall be constructed or enlarged in accordance with the required yard areas.
For structures which were legally constructed and contain front yard, rear yard or side yard
setbacks which are not in conformance with this code: the existing front, rear and/or side yard
setbacks which are not in conformity shall be considered as the setbacks for the purpose of
additions, alterations, and expansions to the nonconforming structure(s), except no side or rear
yard setback shall be less than the amount required in § A-510.7(2) and (3) below when abutting
an "R" dwelling district.

§ A-540. B-5 Planned Commercial Development District.
[Ord. No. 9160, § 4, 4-18-2002; Ord. No. 9611, §§ 1-2, 8-3-2006; Ord. No. 10103, 11-15-2012; Ord.
No. 10136, § 1, 6-20-2013; Ord. No. 10197, § 2, 6-5-2014]
Purpose. The purpose of the B-5 Development District is to provide a means of achieving
greater flexibility in development of land for intensive single and mixed uses in a single or in
multiple structures at suitable nodal locations within the City in a manner not possible in
conventional zones, to encourage a more imaginative and innovative design of projects, to
promote a more desirable community environment, and to retain maximum control over both the
structure and future operation of the development.
It should be noted that these regulations are not intended to allow excessive densities, or the
development of incompatible land uses, either within the development, or as the development
relates to the general neighborhood. Adequate services must support such intensive development
or will be provided prior to occupancy. A B-5 development will be approved only if the project is of
exceptional design quality, if desirable amenities are an integral part of the development and if the
project can provide for adequate transition to adjacent neighborhood areas.
The standards contained in the following provisions must be strictly adhered to by the applicant.
The City may, upon proper application, approve a B-5 development for a site of at least 2.5
contiguous acres to facilitate the use of flexible techniques of land development and site design,
by providing relief from zone requirements designed for conventional developments.
Any use which in the judgment of the Planning and Zoning Commission is identical or very similar
to one or more of the listed uses and which conform with the intent and purpose of this section
may be added to the permitted uses.
A building or premises shall be used only for the following purposes and, except for motor vehicle
off-street parking and loading facilities, all activities relating to any such use shall be conducted
wholly within an enclosed building, unless as specifically permitted herein, or upon application
approved by the City Council for a temporary unenclosed use that may be permitted from time to
time after application is made to and approved by the City Council and after a finding by the City
Council that the general welfare is not adversely affected.
Permitted uses. A building or premises shall only be used for the following purposes:
Amusement or recreational facilities.
Animal hospitals when conducted wholly within an enclosed building.

No building permit shall be issued to construct any part or all of the development in the district
until such time as the Planning and Zoning Commission has approved the final site plan.
However, site grading to prepare the tract for development shall be permitted upon approval
of the development plan.
Within 12 months of the date of approval of the final site plan by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, construction shall commence, or the development approval and site plan shall
be void.
Any applicant desiring to extend the period in which construction shall commence under a
final site plan shall, no later than 30 days prior to the date such planned commercial
development shall terminate, submit a written request to the City Council setting forth the
reasons such development should be extended and filing fee in accordance with the
Municipal Code of Ordinances, Chapter 5, Article VII, Fee Schedule, of the Kirkwood

deposit, letter of credit, or other financial guarantee acceptable to the City, to be furnished by the
developer to insure compliance with such requirements as completion time lines, drives, walks,
utilities, sewers, parking, landscaping and the like. The financial guarantee shall be deposited with
the City within six months of final approval by the City Council and prior to the issuance of any
permits along with an administrative fee in accordance with the Municipal Code of Ordinances,
Chapter 5, Article VII, Fee Schedule. As work progresses, the Director of Public Services may
authorize a proportional release of the financial guarantee upon completion of significant phases
or improvements.

approved development plan (or existing use and development) shall file an application for
amendment to said plan and a fee shall be paid in accordance with the Municipal Code of
Ordinances, Chapter 5, Article VII, Fee Schedule.
If the proposed amendment substantially modifies the approved development plan by
intensity of use, traffic impact, or construction or expansion of a structure or parking area by
more than 5,000 square feet, the plan shall be reviewed in accordance with § A-540.18.
If the proposed amendment modifies the site plan of the approved plan, the application shall
be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council as a final site plan.
Minor revisions to the final site plan may be approved by the Director of Public Services if
such revisions satisfy the intent of the approved site plan.

Application procedure.
Applications for special use permits for new uses, construction, extensions or alterations, or
for extensions or alterations of existing uses and uses previously authorized shall be made to
the City Council on forms provided by the City, together with a complete site plan and
necessary descriptive material sufficient to clearly define the intensity and extent of the
intended use. The City Council shall forthwith refer the application to the Planning and Zoning
Commission to investigate and report as to the matters set forth in § A-900.2 hereof, and the
effect of such building, buildings, structures or uses upon traffic hazards or congestion, fire
hazards, the character of the neighborhood, the general welfare of the community, and the
public utility facilities, which report shall be accompanied by a recommendation. A fee in
accordance with Municipal Code of Ordinances, Chapter 5, Article VII, Fee Schedule, shall be
paid. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall file its report and recommendations with the
City Council within 120 days after the date of reference to said Commission. In default of filing
such report and recommendation within the time provided, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall be deemed to have found all factors of the application satisfactory and to
have recommended approval.
In the event that an applicant to whom a special use permit has been granted fails to
commence construction contemplated by such exception within one year after the date
such permit was granted, the special use permit shall terminate one year after the
granting of such special use permit unless the exception had been extended as provided
below.
Any applicant desiring to extend the period in which construction shall commence under
a special use permit shall, no later than 30 days prior to the date such special use permit

Except as provided in § A-900.3(1)b, in the event that an applicant to whom a special use
permit has been granted fails to proceed thereunder for a period of one year after the
effective date when said permit was granted, said applicant shall be deemed to have
abandoned the same and the special use permit shall terminate. In the event building permits
were taken out during the one-year period, but are then allowed to expire thereafter, or do
expire, the applicant shall be deemed to have abandoned the special use permit and it shall
thereupon terminate upon the expiration of the building permits. Unless expressly authorized
at the time of the granting of the special use permit, or upon subsequent application after
notice and hearing in the same manner as provided for the original application, all
construction and site development shall be completed within 18 months after the date of the
granting of the special use permit, or the special use permit shall be deemed to have been
abandoned and shall thereupon terminate.
At the effective date of this code, an existing lawful use which is set forth as a special use permit
in § A-900.1 of this section and which is located in a district in which such special use permit may
be permitted shall be deemed a conforming use hereunder and not a nonconforming use.
If the nature of the special use permit involves more than one of those listed in § A-900.1 hereof,
the applicant may apply for a special use permit which most closely relates to the primary use,
provided that the requirements of all related uses shall also be met.
When a use authorized by a special use permit is abandoned for 120 consecutive days, the
permit shall automatically terminate and the property shall thereafter be in conformity with the
regulations of the zoning district. The term "abandoned" shall mean the voluntary discontinuance
of the use.
§ A-910. Communication antennas and support structures.
[Ord. No. 8739, § 1, 6-18-1998; Ord. No. 10103, 11-15-2012]
General requirements.
Antenna support structures over 150 feet in height. Any antenna support structure which is
proposed to be in excess of 150 feet in height shall require a special use permit and shall
require a clear showing that such height is required to provide personal wireless services, or
reasonably required for public safety communications of a governmental entity sharing the
antenna support structure, and such showing is supported by the opinion of a
telecommunications consultant hired by the City at the expense of the applicant. The opinion
of the consultant shall include a statement that no available alternatives exist which exceed
the height limitation, or the reason why such alternatives are not viable.
Lighting. Antennas and antenna support structures shall not be lighted unless required by the
FAA or a state or federal agency with authority to regulate, in which case a description of the
required lighting scheme will be made part of the application to install, build, or modify the
antenna or antenna support structure.
Advertising. Unless a disguised support structure is in the form of an otherwise lawfully placed
pylon sign, the placement of signs on structures regulated by this section is prohibited.
Design.
Unless subject to the requirements of the FAA or any applicable state or federal agency,
towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish or be painted a neutral color consistent
with the natural or built environment of the site.
Antenna equipment shelters or cabinets shall have an exterior finish compatible with the
natural or built environment of the site, and may also be brick or other masonry material

as required by the Planning and Zoning Commission or by the City Council in the case of
a special use permit.
Antennas attached to a building or antenna support structure shall be painted a color
identical to, or compatible with, the surface to which they are mounted.
All towers shall be surrounded by a landscape strip of not less than 10 feet in width, and
planted with materials which will provide a visual barrier of a minimum height of six feet.
Evergreen trees should be at least six feet tall, and deciduous trees at least 2 1/2 inches
in caliper. Said landscape strip shall be exterior to any security fencing. In lieu of the
required landscape strip, a minimum six foot high decorative fence or wall may be
approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission in the case of a site plan review or by
the City Council in the case of a special use permit.
All towers shall be set back from any adjacent residentially zoned property a distance
equal to the height of the tower unless otherwise modified by a special use permit
approved by the City Council. In all cases, towers shall maintain setbacks as are required
by the zoning district regulations.
Ground anchors of all guyed towers shall be located on the same parcel as the tower and
meet the setbacks of the applicable zoning district.
Vehicle or outdoor storage on any antenna support structure site is prohibited.
On-site parking for periodic maintenance and service shall be provided at all antenna or
antenna support structure locations. Access to and parking for antenna or antenna
support structure locations shall be provided on a paved surface.
Shared use.
In order to maximize the use of an existing or proposed wireless tower, the tower owner
shall, prior to the issuance of any building permit or special use permit to alter or modify
any tower existing on the effective date of this code, provide to the City a written and
notarized statement agreeing to make said tower available for use by others subject to
reasonable technical limitations and reasonable financial terms. The willful and knowing
failure of a tower owner to agree to shared use or to negotiate in good faith with potential
users shall be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same tower owner to
install, build or modify antennas or antenna support structures within the City.
Any new tower at a height of 60 feet above ground level or higher shall be designed and
constructed to accommodate at least one additional user unless a larger number is
indicated by the City. In addition, the tower shall be designed and constructed to
reasonably accommodate use by the City. The willful and knowing failure of the owner of
a tower built for shared use to negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be cause
for the withholding of future permits to the same owner to install, build or modify antennas
or antenna support structures within the City.
These general requirements shall be observed unless otherwise waived or modified by
a site plan review approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission or a special use
permit approval by the City Council as applicable.
Permitted use. Upon receipt of the appropriate building permit, the following are allowed:
The attachment of additional antennas or the replacement of antennas to any tower or the
addition or replacement of antenna equipment shelters existing on the effective date of this
code or subsequently approved in accordance with these regulations, provided that additional
antenna equipment shelters or cabinets are located within the existing antenna support
structure site.

reviewed by Planning and Zoning under the site plan review procedures of this code:
The enlargement of the existing antenna support structure site.
The one-time replacement of any antenna support structure existing on the effective date of
this code or subsequently approved in accordance with these regulations so long as the
purpose of the replacement is to accommodate shared use of the site or to eliminate a safety
hazard. The new antenna support structure shall be of the same type as the original, except
that a guyed or self-supporting (lattice) tower may be replaced by a monopole or disguised
support structure. The height of the new antenna support structure may exceed that of the
original by not more than 20 feet.
The construction of a disguised support structure, provided that all related equipment shall be
placed underground or concealed within the structure when the structure is located in any
district other than a district authorizing industrial uses. Equipment may be placed in a cabinet

other nonresidential use.
The construction of a new antenna support structure if said antenna support structure
complies with all the provisions set out in this code, and is located within a potential antenna
site as identified by the Telecommunications Master Plan, which is made a part of this code
as if fully set out herein.
Special use permit required. All proposals to install, build, or modify an antenna support
structure not covered under §§ A-910.2 or A-910.3 or required by the zoning district regulations
shall require the applicant to obtain a special use permit, and, in so doing, the applicant shall
affirmatively show the reasons why the antenna cannot be located or constructed in such a
manner to satisfy those sections. The applicant shall be required to meet the requirements of a
special use permit.
Applications for special use permits shall be filed and processed in the manner and time
frame as established for all other special use permits in accordance with Article IX, § A-900,

A statement of the conditions which render unsuitable the potential antenna site area as
identified by the Telecommunication Master Plan and any existing tower, structures, and
buildings within the applicants required geographic area.
Findings required. In addition to any other determinations specified by the Zoning Code for
the consideration of special use permits, the Planning Commission shall make findings as to
the following:
The proposed antenna support structure is not and cannot be located within a potential
antenna site area as designated by the Telecommunications Master Plan.
There are other limiting conditions that render existing towers, structures or buildings
within the applicant's required geographic area unsuitable.
The design of the tower or structure, including the antennas, shelter, and ground layout
maximally reduces visual degradation and otherwise comply with the provisions and
intent of this code.
The proposal minimizes the number and size of the towers or structures that will be
required in the geographic area surrounding the proposed site.
The applicant attempted to take advantage of available shared use options provided by
this code or otherwise.
Tower removal. Any tower, or the upper portion of any tower, which is occupied by inactive
antennas for a period of 12 months shall be considered a public nuisance and the tower and
support structure, including footings, where appropriate, be removed at the owner's expense.
Removal of upper portions of a tower manufactured as a single object shall not be required.
§ A-920. Nonconforming uses and buildings.
[Ord. No. 8814, § 2, 5-6-1999; Ord. No. 9803; § 2, 10-16-2008; Ord. No. 7689, §§ 1, 2, 9-3-1987; Ord.
No. 7952, § 1, 3-1-1990; Ord. No. 10103, 11-15-2012]
Regulations. The following regulations shall govern the use, discontinuance, abandonment,
alteration, reconstruction, and creation of nonconforming uses and buildings.
The lawful use of a building existing at the time of the effective date of this code may be
continued, although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof. If no structural
alternations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a
nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such
use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use.
Whenever the use of a building becomes nonconforming through a change in the Zoning
Code or district boundaries, such use may be continued and if no structural alterations are
made, it may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted
classification.
Whenever a nonconforming use of a building, structure, or premises, or part thereof, has
been discontinued or abandoned for a period of 180 days, such use shall not be
reestablished, and the use of the building, structure, or premises shall thereafter be in
conformity with the regulations of the district. Any nonconforming use that has been
abandoned shall not thereafter be reestablished. The term "abandoned" shall mean the
voluntary discontinuance of a nonconforming use.

Where no enclosed building or structure is involved, discontinuance of a nonconforming use
for a period of 30 days shall constitute abandonment. Any nonconforming use that has been
abandoned shall not thereafter be reestablished. The term "abandoned" shall mean the
voluntary discontinuance of a use.
No existing building or premises devoted to a use not permitted by this code in the district in
which such building or premises is located, except when required to do so by law or order,
shall be expanded, enlarged, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered, unless such use
is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such building or premises is located or
unless a special use permit is obtained pursuant to the provisions provided below.
When any building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use which is permitted to
continue by the provisions of this code is damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, floods,
wind, or other acts of God, or by the public enemy, or by any other cause unrelated or
unattributable to the owner, it may be restored and such use may continue, provided such
restoration is in accordance with the building and fire codes and further provided that such
restoration is completed within 18 months after the date such damage was sustained, or
within such additional time thereafter as may be granted upon application to the Board of
Adjustment.
A legal nonconforming use or a building arranged or designed for or devoted to a legal
nonconforming use may not be expanded or extended or enlarged or altered unless the use is
changed to a conforming use or unless a special use permit is obtained pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Article IX, § A-900, Special use permits, requirements and procedure,
and shall be subject to the following minimum requirements:
No change in use is allowed which would make the property less conforming;
The expansion, extension, enlargement or alteration of the use or structure will have a
less deleterious effect on the neighboring properties than does the existing use or
structure;
The expansion, extension, enlargement or alteration of the use or structure shall not
create any additional burden on the neighboring properties;
The expansion, extension, enlargement or alteration of the use or structure shall not
substantially increase traffic hazards or congestion;
The expansion, extension, enlargement or alteration of the use or structure shall not
substantially increase fire hazards;
The expansion, extension, enlargement or alteration of the use or structure shall not
adversely affect the general welfare of the community;
The expansion, extension, enlargement or alteration of the use or structure shall not
overtax public utilities;
The expansion, extension, enlargement or alteration of the use or structure shall satisfy
all other site development regulations which are applicable;
The property shall comply with the applicable buffer yard and landscape requirements, if
any, contained in this code;
In order to assure compliance with any provisions required for approval of this provision
and to assure maintenance of buffers and landscaping, which mitigates the effect of the
nonconforming use, adequate provisions may be made in covenants running with the
land or other instruments which empower the City to enforce the covenants in the event
of failure of compliance and entitling the City to place a lien upon the property in the

provisions of a special use permit granted herein. Any approval of expansion, extension,
enlargement or alteration of the use or structure provided for herein does not alter the
nonconformancy of the use or any remaining nonconforming characteristics set forth
above. Further, any approval of an expansion, extension, enlargement or alteration of the
use or structure does not obligate the City to grant further approvals, and any additional
expansion, extension, enlargement or alteration of the use or structure shall require a
new application, which application may, in the discretion of the City, be considered from
the perspective of the aggregate impact of any proposed expansion, extension,
enlargement, or alteration and any previous expansion, extension, enlargement, or
alteration previously permitted under the provisions of this code.
The burden of establishing the legality of a nonconformity is the direct responsibility of the
user or owner of the property upon which the nonconformity uses, not the City.
Any nonconforming, single-family residential structure may be repaired, maintained, altered,
or expanded. However, no such repair, maintenance, alteration, or expansion shall create any
new noncompliance.

General provisions. The off-street parking and loading requirements hereinafter set forth in this
article supplement the district regulations for each of the districts, pursuant to this code.
Procedure. An application for a building permit for a new or enlarged building, structure or use
shall include therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale, and fully dimensioned showing any offstreet
parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with the requirements of this
code.
Extent of control. The off-street parking and loading requirements of this code shall apply as
follows:
All buildings and structures erected and all land uses initiated after the effective date of
this code shall provide accessory off-street parking or loading facilities as required herein
for the use thereof. New buildings that are constructed with a depth less than 24 feet and
provide the benefit of screening parking fields from street frontages and pedestrian

constructed within the Downtown Master Plan Study Area shall not be required to provide
off-street parking.
[Ord. No. 10547, 1-3-2019]
When a building or structure erected or enlarged shall undergo a decrease in number of
dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, number of employees, or other unit of
measurement specified hereinafter for required off-street parking or loading facilities,
and, further, when said decrease would result in a requirement for fewer total off-street
parking or loading spaces through application of the provisions of this code thereto, offstreet
parking and loading facilities may be reduced accordingly, provided that existing
off-street parking or loading facilities shall be so decreased only when the facilities
remaining would at least equal or exceed the off-street parking or loading requirements
resulting from application of the provisions of this code to the entire building or structure
as modified.
When a building or structure shall undergo any increase in number of dwelling units,
gross floor area, seating capacity, or other unit measurement specified hereinafter for
required off-street parking or loading facilities, and further, when said increase would
result in a requirement for additional total off-street parking or loading spaces through
application of the provisions of this code thereto, parking and loading facilities shall be
increased accordingly.
Existing off-street parking and loading spaces. Accessory off-street parking and loading
spaces in existence on the effective date of this code may not be reduced in number unless
already exceeding the requirements of this article for equivalent new construction; in which
event, said spaces shall not be reduced below the number required herein for such equivalent

parking facilities for each constituent use would be permitted, provided that the total number
of spaces so located together shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements for
each use and as provided in § A-1000.3.
[Ord. No. 10548, 1-3-2019]
Not more than 50% of the parking spaces required for (a) theaters, and places of amusement,
and up to 100% of the parking spaces required for a church may be provided by and used

be properly drawn and executed by the parties concerned, approved as to form and execution
by the City Attorney, and filed with the application for a building permit.
In addition to the shared parking opportunities mentioned above, developments that propose
shared parking between multiple uses are permitted to utilize the Shared Parking Table to
calculate a reduced parking requirement. The Shared Parking Table acknowledges that the
demand for parking for certain uses varies based on time of day and day of week. Said
reduction is meant to encourage shared efficiencies of complementary uses and to
discourage the overdevelopment of surface parking. Said Shared Parking Table can be
found below:

intended for the parking facilities is located in the same district as the principal permitted
use or in a less restricted district.
Schedule of minimum off-street parking requirements. The following table, Table 1000-1
Parking Requirements, sets forth the minimum off-street parking requirements for the districts in
accordance with the use of the premises. All parking provided shall be on paved areas behind the

Where the number of required bicycle racks results in a fraction of 0.5 or higher, the
number required shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.
In the case of mixed uses, the required number of bicycle racks shall equal the sum
of the requirements of the various uses computed separately.
Whenever a building or use constructed or established prior to January 3, 2019,
which requires one of the approvals listed in Subsection (1) above, is changed or
enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating
capacity or otherwise, bicycle parking shall be provided on the basis of the
enlargement or change.

§ A-1010. Loading zone regulations.
[Ord. No. 6147, § 2, 7-7-1977; Ord. No. 6772, § 1, 7-16-1981; Ord. No. 8855, § 1, 10-7-1999; Ord. No.
10103, 11-15-2012]
The following regulations shall govern the design of and the requirements for off-street loading
and unloading space in all districts:
Design.
Description. An off-street loading space shall be a hard surfaced area of land, open or
enclosed, other than a street or public way, used principally for the standing, loading or
unloading of motor trucks, tractors and trailers so as to avoid undue interference with the
public use of streets and alleys. Loading spaces may overlap or conflict with required
parking spaces when in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the required
loading space would not normally be used at the same time as the parking.
Location. No loading space shall be closer than 50 feet to any property in a residential
district unless completely enclosed by building walls, or a uniformly painted solid
noncombustible fence or wall, or any combination thereof not less than six feet in height.
No permitted or required loading space shall be located within 50 feet of the nearest point
of intersection of any two streets.
Measurement of berth. When determination of the number of required off-street loading
berths results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including 1/2
shall be disregarded, and fractions over 1/2 shall be interpreted as one loading space.
Surfacing. All off-street loading spaces shall be improved with a compacted rock base,
not less than eight inches thick, surfaced with not less than four inches of asphaltic
concrete or concrete not less than seven inches thick.
Every building or structure used for business, trade or industry shall provide space for the
loading and unloading of vehicles off the street or public alley. Such space shall have access
to a public alley or street. Off-street loading and unloading space shall be designed not to
obstruct nor interfere with the use of any street, alley or adjoining property. Off-street loading
and unloading spaces may not be located on public right-of-way nor within a front yard. The
minimum size and number of off-street loading and unloading spaces shall depend upon the
size of the building to which they are appurtenant, as follows:
Gross Floor Area of
Building
(square feet)
Size of Loading Space
(in feet x feet)
Minimum Number of Spaces
Required
0 to 4,000 None required None required
4,000 to 8,000 10 x 25 1

hereafter be in force, shall automatically be part of the evidence at each hearing before the Board
to the extent applicable, without being specifically introduced at a hearing.
Powers, duties and procedure. The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
To hear and decide appeals in which it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by the Building Commissioner or an administrative official in
the enforcement of the Zoning Enabling Act, Sections 89.010 through 89.140 (1992), RSMo.,
as amended, or the Zoning Code.
To hear and decide all matters referred to it or upon which it is required to pass under the
Zoning Code.
To grant area or non-use variances, which vary or modify the application of any of the
regulations or provisions of the Zoning Code, where there are practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardships in the carrying out of the strict letter of the Zoning Code so that the
spirit of the Zoning Code shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and
substantial justice done.
An area or non-use variance authorizes a deviation or departure from the literal
requirements of the Zoning Code regulations which relate to permitted uses within a
given zoning district. Examples of area or non-use variances include deviations from the
bulk area, height, density, setbacks and sideline restrictions in a zoning district.
In passing upon appeals, the Board of Adjustment is authorized to grant an area or nonuse
variance only upon a finding that:
There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the
strict application of the Zoning Code;
Granting the variance requested would observe the spirit of the Code, secure public
safety and welfare and do substantial justice; and
The deviation from strict application of the Zoning Code that would be authorized by
the area or non-use variance would not constitute a change in the district map,
impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, increase congestion
in public streets, increase the danger of fire, materially diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area, and would not in any other respect
impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the City of Kirkwood.
If an appeal for an area or non-use variance is granted, the Board shall grant the
minimum variance necessary to allow the applicant reasonable use of his or her land.
To grant use variances.
Use variances permit a use of property other than one enumerated as a permitted use in
the Zoning Code for the particular zoning district in which that property is located.
The Board of Adjustment is authorized to grant use variances upon application or appeal
in accordance with the Enabling Act, the Zoning Code, and the procedures set forth
herein only upon finding that:
The applicant will be deprived of all beneficial use of the property under any of the
permitted uses in that zoning district. All beneficial use is lost only where the
property is not suitable for any use permitted in the Zoning Code for that zoning
district;
The applicant has sufficiently demonstrated unnecessary hardship through actual
proof and not mere conclusory or lay opinion that the property in question cannot

yield a reasonable return if used only for a purpose or purposes permitted in the
zoning district in which that property is located;
The plight of the owner is due to exceptional or unique circumstances and not due to
general conditions in the neighborhood which may reflect the unreasonableness of
the Zoning Code itself;
The use to be authorized by the use variance would not alter the essential character
of the locality; and
The proposed use to be authorized by the use variance would not constitute a
change in the district map, impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent
property, increase congestion in public streets, increase the danger of fire, materially
diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area, and
would not in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and
welfare of the City.
To grant variances from parking and loading and unloading regulations of the Zoning Code, in
the manner prescribed above, where the character or use of the building or premises make
unnecessary the full provision of parking or loading or unloading facilities or when such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot or tract of land,
as contrasted with merely granting an advantage or convenience.
To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot of record
in single ownership.
To grant an extension of time for the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has
been damaged by fire, explosion, floods, wind or other acts of God, or the public enemy, or by
any other cause unrelated or unattributable to the owner as authorized under Article IX, § A-
920, Nonconforming uses and buildings, of the Zoning Code.
To interpret the provision of the Zoning Ordinance where the street layout actually on the
ground varies from the street layout as shown on the map fixing the several districts, which

An appeal to the Board stays all proceedings in furtherance of the order, requirement,
decision or determination of the Building Commissioner appealed from, unless the Building
Commissioner certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him,
that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent
peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application or
notice to the Building Commissioner from whom the appeal is taken and on good cause
shown.
The Board shall hear and decide appeals within a reasonable time period.
At the time that an appeal or application to the Board is filed, and a fee shall be paid in
accordance with Municipal Code of Ordinances, Chapter 5, Article VII, Fee Schedule.
The Board shall give at least 15 days' notice of the time and place of its hearing on each
appeal in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. The Board shall also give due notice
to interested parties, including the appellant and persons owning property located within 300
feet of the property which is the subject of the appeal. Any interested party may appear at the
Board's hearing on an appeal in person or by agent or by attorney.
The order, requirement, decision or determination of the Board may be made a part of any
building permit ordered to be issued by a decision of the Board.
Applications for building permits, authorized by a decision of the Board, must be made within
one year after the decision of the Board. If no application for a building permit is made within
the one-year period, the variance is automatically rescinded. Any variance granted by the
Board, which does not require an application for a building permit, is automatically rescinded
after one year from the date of the Board's decision if no use of the variance is made within
the one-year period. The Building Commissioner shall notify the Board of all variances which
are rescinded.
Procedure for appeals from the Board of Adjustment.[2]
Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the Board, any
neighborhood organization as defined in Section 32.105, RSMo., representing such person or
persons, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the City, may present to the circuit
court having jurisdiction in St. Louis County, a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such
decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality and asking for
relief therefrom. Such petition must be presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of
the decision in the office of the Board.
Upon the presentation of such petition, the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the
Board of Adjustment to review such decision of the Board and shall prescribe therein the time
within which a return thereto must be made and served upon the relator's attorney, which
shall not be less than 10 days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of the writ
shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court may, on
application, on notice to the Board and on due cause shown, grant a restraining order. The
Board of Adjustment shall not be required to return the original papers acted upon by it, but it
shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may
be called for by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be
pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be
verified. If, upon the hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the
proper disposition of the matter, it may take additional evidence or appoint a referee to take
such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court with his findings of fact and
conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which a
determination of the court shall be made. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
may modify the decision brought up for review.

inspection of the subdivision, the lost tree(s) shall be replaced by three times the number of
trees lost.
The City may require the value of trees to be preserved to be included in the subdivision's
performance guarantee. Should these designated saved trees be lost due to willful actions or
neglect of the developer, the developer shall provide landscaping and trees in the subdivision
equal to the performance guarantee amount or forfeit the amount to the general revenue of
the City of Kirkwood.
If the trees designated to be saved are lost due to the willful actions or neglect of the
developer, he shall be in violation of and be subject to the penalties under § 1-8 of the
Kirkwood Code of Ordinances. If any significant tree as identified in the tree study to be saved
dies, is destroyed, or removed and the developer failed to conform to any special provisions
of the subdivision approval ordinance regarding the protection of the trees, his actions shall
be considered prima facie evidence of neglect and willful.
Where it is determined that removal of significant trees has occurred within two years prior to
the filing of the preliminary plat, the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Council
may require plantings in excess of the above requirements up to 1 1/2 times the number of
trees that would otherwise be required.

concrete with minimum dimensions of four inches by four inches at the top and six inches by six
inches at the bottom with a length of three feet. They shall be marked with either a copper or steel
dowel embedded so that the top of the dowel shall be flush with the top surface at the center of
the monument. Monuments shall be set so that the bottom extends at least four inches below frost
line.
Markers shall consist of galvanized steel or wrought iron pipe, or steel bars at least 18 inches in
length and 3/4 of an inch in outside diameter.
Monuments and markers shall be so placed that the center point shall coincide with the point to be
marked and the top is level with the surface of the surrounding ground after final grading.
Monuments and markers shall be set after the completion of all grading operations and in such
manner as to preclude their destruction during subdivision construction activities.

§ E-120. Intent.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
These Personnel Rules and Regulations only outline the major employment policies of the City of

Classified, permanent, full-time employees who are not serving a probationary period of any kind are
subject to the Disciplinary Action provisions of Article IX and the Grievance, Complaint and Appeal

the legal right to discharge or terminate such employees at any time and for any reason, with or
without prior notice. Likewise employees have the legal right to terminate their employment at any time
and for any reason. The Personnel Rules and Regulations are not a contract and are not intended to
create any contractual obligations on the part of the City to employ any individual for any definite
duration.
As circumstances arise in which the City may determine that changes to these policies are necessary,
the City reserves the right to change these policies at any time and reserves the unilateral right to do
so at any time without prior notice to its employees. Accordingly, no statement in these rules and
regulations is intended as a contractual commitment or obligation of the City to any employee.
Likewise, no City employee has the right to enter into any employment agreement with any employee
contrary to the provisions of this Section of the Personnel Rules and Regulations without City Council
approval.
These policies and procedures shall not be inconsistent with but complementary to related State and
Federal laws and regulations. If any provision becomes invalid due to subsequent passage or
interpretations of related legislation or court rulings, the remaining provisions shall not be invalidated.
In addition, specific provisions of any employee benefit plan documents shall be controlling with
respect to any such benefits.

§ E-410. Establishment Of Plan.

[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
The Chief Administrative Officer shall be responsible for presenting to the City Council a uniform and
equitable pay plan which shall consist of minimum, market rate, midpoint and maximum rates of pay,
referenced herein as the Classification and Pay Plan. The salary rates recommended shall reflect an
equitable relationship, as determined by the Chief Administrative Officer, among the job classifications
and shall be made after review of prevailing rates for comparable work in other public and private
businesses, the current cost of living, responsibilities of the position, and the policy of the City Council.
§ E-420. Classification Of Positions — Purpose.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
The Classification and Pay Plan provides an inventory of all positions in the City's service which are
sufficiently alike in duties and responsibilities to be called by the same job title, to be accorded the
same pay scale, and to require substantially the same qualifications on the part of the incumbent.
No City employee shall be classified or paid at a salary rate which is not established and recognized in
the City's Classification and Pay Plan. All permanent classifications shall be established by the City
Council.
§ E-430. Reclassification.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
When significant changes are made to a particular position which changes the complexity or level of
responsibility, the Department Head may request, in writing, a pay grade evaluation of the position to
the Human Resources Manager. The request should include the job duty changes and other
circumstances that have precipitated the evaluation. The Human Resources Manager will meet with
the applicable Department Head, supervisor and incumbent(s) as deemed appropriate to discuss the
changes.
Utilizing a point factor system and market data, the Human Resources Manager and Assistant Chief
Administrative Officer will determine if a change in pay grade is warranted. If, after a new Classification
and Pay Plan Ordinance is adopted, it is determined the employee's current salary is below the
minimum rate of the new pay grade, the employee will be placed at the minimum rate of the new pay
grade. If the current salary is within the new salary range, it will be at the discretion of the Department
Head as to whether any further adjustment is recommended to the Chief Administrative Officer. In the
instance where an employee's job is reassigned to a higher salary grade, the employee's pay may be
adjusted at least five percent (5%) for each salary grade shift, not to exceed the greater of twenty
percent (20%) or the minimum of the new pay grade.
§ E-440. Development And Allocation Of New Positions.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
When in the opinion of the Department Head there arises a need to establish a new position
classification, the Department Head shall prepare a recommended job description and submit same to
the Assistant Chief Administrative Officer for review. The Assistant Chief Administrative Officer shall
study the duties and responsibilities of the new position and determine a recommended allocation to
the appropriate classification and so advise the Department Head. If there is any disagreement
between the Department Head and the Assistant Chief Administrative Officer, an appeal may be made
to the Chief Administrative Officer regarding a position assessment. The Chief Administrative Officer's
decision shall be administratively binding.
The Chief Administrative Officer shall make his or her recommendation for any new position
classification to the City Council.

[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
When a vacancy occurs, the Chief Administrative Officer shall review the allocation of the position
in cases where the need for changes in the duties and responsibilities of a position appears likely.
Each time a department or division is recognized initially, preliminary position descriptions for all
affected employees shall be submitted by the Department Head to the Chief Administrative Officer
for review and recommendation.
The Chief Administrative Officer may require any or all Department Heads to submit
recommended position descriptions on a periodic basis, or any time that there is reason to believe
there has been a change in the duties and responsibilities of one (1) or more positions.
Before a new classification is established by the City Council and before such a position is filled, a
formal job description shall be written by the Chief Administrative Officer or his or her delegate as
provided for in these rules and incorporated in the existing plan. The classification title shall be
added to the schematic list of titles. Likewise, an abolished classification shall be deleted from the
position classification plan by removing the class specification and eliminating the classification
title from the schematic list of titles.
The Chief Administrative Officer shall take the necessary steps to maintain the Classification and
Pay Plan in a current state on a continuous basis.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to conflict with or supersede any compensation policies
of the City adopted by Ordinance.
§ E-460. Official Copy Of The Classification And Pay Plan.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
The Chief Administrative Officer shall be responsible for maintaining an official copy of the
Classification and Pay Plan. The official copy shall include any regulations or guidelines for
administration, schematic list of job descriptions and any amendments thereto.
Article V. Classification And Pay Plan Administration
§ E-500. Administration Of Plan.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
New Employees. Generally all new employees shall be hired at the minimum rate unless their
qualifications are such that it is to the City's advantage to hire at an advanced rate. Hiring at an
initial rate above the market rate of the applicable pay grade shall be upon approval by the
Assistant Chief Administrative Officer and only upon appropriate documentation by the
Department Head that such action is to the benefit of the City.
Promotions And Transfers. When an employee is promoted to a position in a higher class, the
employee's salary shall be increased to at least the minimum rate for the higher classification.
Employees promoted or transferred will immediately begin a probationary period for the new
position. In the event that the employee does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period,
the employee shall, unless the probationary period is extended, revert to his or her previous
position at his or her prior rate of pay for the position, provided a position is available.
The Department Head will determine the promotional increase percentage according to the pay
adjustment guidelines. The employee's pay shall be adjusted at least five percent (5%) for each

salary grade shift not to exceed the greater of twenty percent (20%) or the minimum of the new
salary grade.
Demotions. An employee who requests and accepts an assignment in a lower pay classification
shall have his or her salary reduced by the percentage differential between the two (2) relevant
pay classifications.
In the case of a demotion resulting from poor performance, the employee's current salary will be
reduced by ten percent (10%) and then compared to the new salary grade maximum. If the
employee's adjusted salary is greater than the new salary grade maximum, his or her pay will be
reduced to the new salary grade maximum.
In the case of a demotion resulting from an organizational change or change in duties assignment,
reasonable attempts will be made to keep the individual at the current salary. In the case of a
voluntary demotion unrelated to job performance deficiencies, the employee's rate of pay in the
lower classification shall be reduced by the same percentage as such employee's pay was
increased upon acceptance of the promotion to the position the employee subsequently leaves
voluntarily.
Merit Increases. A merit increase is a payment granted to an employee as a result of overall
performance. The merit increase may be a lump-sum payment, an increase to salary base or a
combination of an increase to salary base and a singular lump-sum payment. Once an employee
reaches the maximum of the salary range, the merit increase will be in the form of a singular lumpsum
payment for future service but shall not increase the salary base. Merit increases shall be
based upon performance evaluations with the amount of merit increases, if any, fluctuating from
year to year. Performance evaluations will result in performance ratings which shall serve as the
basis for the amount of the merit increase. Merit increases may be granted once per year, unless
otherwise provided by ordinance. Employees on disciplinary probation or any type of performance
improvement plan will not receive their merit increase until such time as performance improves as
determined by the applicable Department Head or the period of disciplinary probation has expired.
Dates Of Performance Evaluations. Performance evaluations shall be conducted at least annually;
however, they may be conducted more frequently at the discretion of the Department Head. In no
case shall a merit increase be granted if a performance evaluation has not taken place within
ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of the merit pay increase.
Cost Of Living Adjustments. Each budget cycle, the Chief Administrative Officer shall evaluate the
salary schedules to ensure the market rates are accurate. When appropriate, the salary schedules
may be adjusted on January 1, in order to take into account the Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers in the Midwest (CPI-Midwest U). All employees who are paid at or below the
maximum of the salary range for their classification will receive such increase.
Pay Ordinance. The City Council may from time to time change the pay ordinance increasing the
minimum and maximum rates of pay. The Council may, by ordinance, establish special pay
provisions necessary for the effective administration of the Classification and Pay Plan and to
promote the concept of merit or performance pay.
Compensation Policies Ordinance. Nothing contained in these Rules and Regulations is intended
to or shall supersede the compensation policies of the City adopted by Ordinance.
§ E-510. Pay Policy.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
Purpose. The City's goal is to pay everyone properly under the law. To that end, the City seeks to
clearly communicate that policy and to make sure that all employees are aware of the City's
complaint procedure in the event that the City inadvertently makes an improper deduction from
any employee's pay.

Complaint Procedure. Any employee who believes that the City has made an improper deduction
from the employee's pay, as soon as it is discovered, at the latest, within thirty (30) days of
becoming aware of the improper deduction, should file a written complaint with the Director of
Finance identifying the improper deduction. The complaint should include a copy of the pay stub
from the relevant pay period, with an explanation of the reason(s) the deduction is believed to
have been improper.
Resolution. Upon the receipt of the written complaint, the Director of Finance will promptly review
and investigate the disputed deduction to determine whether the deduction was improper and, as
soon as practicable, the Director of Finance will provide a written decision outlining whether the
deduction was improper and the reasons therefore. If the Director of Finance, in response to
proper notification of the problem through the above-outlined complaint procedure, concludes that
the City has made an improper deduction, then the City will promptly reimburse the employee for
the improper deduction.

Objective. The probationary period shall be regarded as an integral part of the screening process
and shall be utilized for closely observing the employee's work, for securing the most effective
adjustment of a new, transferred, demoted or promoted employee to the position, and for replacing
any employee whose performance does not meet the required work standards.
Duration. Every person transferred, promoted, demoted, appointed or reappointed to a permanent
position with the City shall be subject to the following requirements:
All employees must complete at least twelve (12) continuous months of a probationary period.
The probationary or qualifying period shall begin immediately upon appointment to a
permanent position. The probationary or qualifying time period may be extended or reinstated
if deemed necessary by the Department Head. Any period of absence during the probationary
period may cause the probationary period to be extended.
Time spent in an "acting" capacity prior to receiving a permanent appointment to the same
classification and department shall be considered as time spent as a probationary or
qualifying employee in this position.
An employee who is promoted, transferred or demoted prior to completing a probationary

following the completion of twelve (12) months continuous service, except that sick leave
benefits may be used as earned during the probationary period.

At any time during any probationary period (whether due to initial employment, position change,
performance or disciplinary reasons), the Department Head may remove an employee for any lawful
reason. An employee removed during any probationary period cannot appeal such removal through
the grievance procedure.
Employees promoted into a position who do not successfully complete a qualifying period may be
demoted into their previous or similar classification, provided such position is vacant and is authorized
in the budget. If such a position is not available, the employee may be considered for any vacant
position for which the employee is qualified.

If the City reasonably determines that an employee is unable to perform all of the essential functions of
his or her position because of a disability, taking into consideration any reasonable accommodation,
the City may separate, transfer, or otherwise dismiss an employee. The separation of an employee due
to the inability to perform his or her essential job functions is not appealable to the Kirkwood Civil
Service Commission. The City reserves the right to require any employee to undergo a physical or
mental examination if the City determines that there is an issue with respect to the employee's ability to
perform the essential functions of his or her job or whether a reasonable accommodation is necessary
to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his or her position.

in an amount being withheld from the employee's pay check equal to the value of the property.
§ E-860. Lay Off — Reduction Of Work.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
A Department Head may lay off an employee when it is deemed necessary by reason of shortage of
work, funding, abolition of the position or change of duties or organizational structure, or other reasons
which are outside of the employee's control and which do not reflect discredit on the employee's
performance. The duties performed by an employee laid off may be re-assigned to other employees
currently working who hold positions in appropriate classifications. No regular employee shall be laid
off while another person is employed on a probationary or temporary basis in the same classification in
the department.
§ E-870. Order Of Lay-Off And Recall.

[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
Lay-off and recall of employees shall be made in inverse order of current performance ratings of
employees in the classification and department involved. In the event current performance ratings are

seniority. Employees laid off shall be placed on a priority recall list for a maximum of one hundred
eighty (180) calendar days. Employees separated because of lay-off shall be given at least two (2)
weeks' prior notice of such lay-off or pay in lieu thereof.

that the oral warning took place. Failure to sign the warning to acknowledge receipt shall be grounds
for additional disciplinary action. A record of this warning will be placed in the employee's personnel file
and the employee will receive a copy.
A written warning may be used for more serious infractions or in cases where the same rule has been
violated or the same performance expectation has not been met. The Supervisor should state, in
writing, the nature of the infraction leading to the disciplinary action. The warning may also include
what improvement is expected, the time limit for this improvement to occur and consequences if the
improvement goal is not met. The employee must read the written warning and sign it. Failure to sign
the warning to acknowledge receipt shall be grounds for additional disciplinary action. One (1) copy of

who are not serving any type of probationary period. All other employees are employed at will and
may be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without prior notice.
Except for probationary, part-time or temporary employees, a Department Head shall not
discharge any employee without first having suspended the employee, without pay. In such event,

Article X. Leaves Of Absence
§ E-1000. Holidays.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
All permanent, full-time employees shall be entitled to ten (10) holidays per year for which they shall
receive full pay at their standard rate. In order for an employee to receive pay for a holiday, that
employee must have been present at work on the work day immediately preceding and following the
holiday, or have been on an approved leave of absence with pay for the day or days absent. Paid
holiday leave shall count as eight (8) hours worked for overtime calculation purposes, unless the
employee is subject to a regular work day or shift of ten (10) hours or more, in which case the
employee shall receive credit for hours worked consistent with the employee's regularly scheduled
work shift for purposes of any overtime calculation.
Part-time employees who work at least twenty (20) hours per week and have been employed by the
City for at least six (6) months shall be entitled to ten (10) holidays per year for which they shall receive
partial compensation at their standard rate. The employee must have been present at work on the
work day immediately preceding and following the holiday, assuming these days are regularly
scheduled work days, or have been on an approved leave of absence with pay for the day or days
absent. Part-time employees who meet the above criterion and who are not otherwise employed by the
City on a full-time basis shall be compensated according to the average number of hours worked per
week divided by five (5) (for example, an employee working twenty (20) hours per week would receive
four (4) hours of pay for a holiday). Part-time employees shall be entitled to holiday pay which is
calculated by taking the average number of hours worked for the thirteen (13) pay periods immediately
preceding January 1 of the current calendar year. Provided, however, if the position has seasonal or
other variations that would significantly affect the ability of an employee to earn holiday pay as
contemplated herein, a Department Head may request permission from the Assistant Chief
Administrative Officer for a different period to be used in calculating holiday leave. For new hire
employees who work part-time, holiday pay (after six (6) months of employment) will be calculated by
taking the average number of hours worked for the thirteen (13) pay periods immediately preceding
each holiday until the employee has worked for thirteen (13) pay periods before January 1.
Authorized holidays shall include:
1. New Year's Day. 6. Labor Day.
2. Martin Luther King's Birthday. 7. Thanksgiving Day.
3. Presidents Day. 8. Day after Thanksgiving.
4. Memorial Day. 9. Christmas Eve Day.
5. Independence Day. 10. Christmas Day.
The City will attempt to accommodate the religious observances and practices of its employees. Requests
for time off for religious observances, except as provided on the City's holiday schedule, will be treated on
an individual basis, and accommodation will be afforded so long as such can be accomplished without
undue hardship to the City's operations.
Notwithstanding the above provisions regarding holidays for City employees, law enforcement personnel
who work on a rotating work schedule shall be allotted ten (10) days of "paid time off" in lieu of "holidays"
(referenced periodically as "PTO") each calendar year. Such law enforcement personnel shall not

participate in City holidays but shall be permitted to use ten (10) days of paid leave, in lieu of holidays,
during each calendar year. Such paid leave days shall be considered "hours worked" for purposes of any
overtime calculation. Such paid leave days shall be used in full day increments only. For recordkeeping
purposes only, any such PTO may be designated as "holiday leave." No such paid leave shall be carried
over from one (1) calendar year to the next. To the extent that any such paid leave has not been exhausted
by December 31 of each calendar year, law enforcement personnel shall be compensated for eight (8)
hours of pay for each unused paid leave day at his or her then current rate of pay or, in the event of law
enforcement personnel scheduled to work shift days of ten (10) or twelve (12) hours such compensation
shall be for either the ten (10) hours or twelve (12) hours shift applicable as of December 31 of each
calendar year. Payment for such unused paid leave days shall not count toward "hours worked" for
overtime purposes. The accrual of such paid leave by law enforcement personnel shall be at the rate of
five-sixths (5/6) of a paid leave day per calendar month. New hires within the Police Department subject to
this Policy shall accrue such paid leave at five-sixths (5/6) of a paid leave day per month, starting with the
first full month of employment with the City. If, during any calendar year, an employee of the Police
Department is assigned to a position which results in a change from or to a rotating work schedule (such as
from patrol officer to detective or vice versa), the City shall take appropriate measures to assure that such
employee receives a combination of ten (10) paid "days off in lieu of holidays" and City authorized holidays
during the calendar year. Such measures may include, but not necessarily be limited to: allowing the
employee to use vacation or earned compensatory time as a paid day on one (1) or more authorized City
holidays; requiring that time off during one (1) or more authorized City holidays be unpaid; or altering the
monthly accrual rate of "paid time off in lieu of holidays." In no event shall any Police Department employee
receive more or less than a total of ten (10) paid leave days, during the calendar year under such
circumstances.
In the event that any law enforcement employee utilizes such PTO during a calendar year in excess of that
which has accrued and thereafter dies, terminates, retires or is discharged, or otherwise separates
employment with the City of Kirkwood prior to the accrual of such paid leave, the City shall be entitled to
assess and recoup the value of such utilized paid leave in excess of the accrued paid leave. Any such
amount due shall be withheld from any final compensation due the employee and will be collected through
appropriate legal action, if necessary. If legal action is necessary to recoup such amount, the employee will
be responsible for the City's costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees. In the event that the law
enforcement employee dies, terminates, retires, is discharged or otherwise separates employment with the
City without utilizing accrued PTO in lieu of holiday pay, such employee shall be compensated for such paid
leave accrued up to the maximum allowed accrual to the date of separation, unless such employee is
discharged for misconduct connected with his or her work or fails to provide at least ten (10) business days'
notice of resignation. No leave time may be substituted for such notice. No "paid leave in lieu of holiday
pay" may be used during any disciplinary suspension.
§ E-1005. Vacation.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
Vacation leave shall accrue to all permanent, full-time employees based upon their years of continuous
service with the City and part-time employees who work at least twenty (20) hours per week and have
been employed by the City for at least six (6) months. Accrual of vacation shall commence on January
1 for that calendar year and shall be fully realized on December 31 of that calendar year, except during
the first calendar year in which accrual of vacation shall commence on the first day of the first month
following the date of employment.
During the first calendar year of service, all full-time employees shall accrue vacation leave through
such calendar year and may take vacation leave through such first calendar year, provided that the
employee has completed six (6) months of continuous employment. The employee may also accrue
the vacation leave and utilize such accrued vacation time during the following calendar year. In the
event an employee has not completed six (6) months of continuous, full-time employment during the
first calendar year, then such employee is entitled to take the vacation leave accrued during the
calendar year in which such employee has completed the six (6) months of continuous, full-time
employment. The rate of accrual of vacation leave for full-time employees shall be in accordance with
Section (a) as follows:
3/5/2020 City of Kirkwood, MO Ecode360

1-4 years 2 weeks 6 Shifts
5-9 years 3 weeks 8 Shifts
10-16 years 4 weeks 10 Shifts
17 and thereafter 5 weeks 12 Shifts
For purposes of this vacation policy, a "fire shift" means twenty-four (24) hours.
The amount of vacation for employees shall be identified on the basis of annual hours of vacation available
during any calendar year to coincide with each employee's regularly scheduled number of hours to be
worked during each work week or during each work cycle for the Police Department.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Chief Administrative Officer may set or modify the rate of
accrual of vacation leave for any employee due to recruiting or other unique circumstances, although such
discretion shall generally be reserved for a Department Head or management employee who is a direct
report to a Department Head, subject to the maximum annual accrual rate of five (5) weeks. The Chief
Administrative Officer shall also have discretion to award additional vacation leave to any employee as a
supplement to or in lieu of a merit increase.
Part-time employees who work at least twenty (20) hours per week and have been employed by the City for
at least six (6) months shall accrue one (1) week of vacation leave. A part-time employee eligible for
vacation pay shall be entitled to one (1) week of vacation pay which is calculated by taking the average
number of hours worked during the thirteen (13) pay periods immediately preceding January 1 of the
current calendar year and multiplying that number by the part-time employee's regular rate of pay.
Provided, however, if the position has seasonal or other variations that would significantly affect the ability
of an employee to earn vacation as contemplated herein, a Department Head may request permission from
the Assistant Chief Administrative Officer for a different period to be used in calculating vacation leave. For
example, an eligible part-time employee paid eight dollars ($8.00) per hour, who averages twenty (20)
hours per week, would be entitled to one (1) week off with vacation pay in the amount of one hundred sixty
dollars ($160.00). For new hire employees who work part-time, vacation pay (after six (6) months of
employment) will be calculated by taking the average number of hours worked during the first thirteen (13)
pay periods of employment for the calculation of such employee's initial vacation pay.
At the recommendation of a Department Head and with written approval from the Chief Administrative
Officer, a current part-time employee of the City who becomes a full-time employee may be provided
vacation at an accrual rate greater than set forth above upon commencement of full-time employment. In
making such recommendation, the Department Head shall consider the duration of prior part-time
continuous employment with the City (which must be a minimum of five (5) years). The "credited" service
from part-time employment toward vacation accrual as a full-time employee shall not exceed one-half (1/2)
of the period of continuous employment as a part-time employee.
Full-time employees who also work part-time and meet the above criterion will not receive additional
vacation leave.
All employees shall be entitled to utilize vacation leave which could accrue during the calendar year. In the
event that an employee utilized vacation leave during a calendar year in excess of that which has accrued
and thereafter dies, terminates, retires, is discharged, or otherwise separates employment with the City of
Kirkwood prior to the accrual of such vacation time, the City shall be entitled to assess and recoup the
value of such utilized vacation leave which is in excess of the accrued vacation leave. Any such amount
due shall be withheld from any final compensation due the employee and collected through appropriate
legal action, if necessary. If legal action is necessary to recoup such amount, the employee will be
responsible for the City's costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees. In the event that an employee dies,
terminates, retires, is discharged, or otherwise separates employment with the City without utilizing accrued
vacation leave, such employee shall be compensated for vacation leave accrued up to the maximum
allowed accrual to the date of separation, unless such employee is discharged for misconduct connected
with his or her work or fails to provide at least ten (10) business days' notice of resignation. No leave time
may be substituted for such notice.
Full-time and part-time employees may carry over into the following year accrued vacation provided that it
is not in excess of one-half (1/2) of the vacation earned during the current calendar year. The maximum

carry-over is one-half (1/2) of the current year's vacation accrual. Vacation carry-over is not cumulative. In
special situations, the carry-over limitation may be waived upon the review and written approval of the
Assistant Chief Administrative Officer.
Vacation leaves normally shall be granted at such time as is deemed by the Department Head to be in the
public interest and may be used in accordance with the rates set forth above, provided approval is given by
the Department Head. Department Heads shall schedule vacation leaves with particular regard to the
operating requirements, order of requests, and seniority of employees.
Vacation may not be used during any disciplinary suspension or during the first six (6) months of any
probationary period associated with initial employment with the City.
§ E-1010. Personal Sick Leave.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
Each full-time employee, with the exception of fire shift personnel, shall accrue one (1) day, consisting
of eight (8) hours or ten (10) or twelve (12) hours for any law enforcement personnel subject to a
scheduled shift day of ten (10) or twelve (12) hours, of personal sick leave for each full month of
continuous service rendered. Sick leave accrual may be increased beyond eight (8) hours per month
for any employment position for which regularly scheduled hours are significantly more than two
thousand eighty (2,080) during a full calendar year of employment. Fire shift personnel shall accrue
twelve (12.0) hours of personal sick leave for each full month of continuous service. Sick leave shall
not count as "hours worked" for purposes of any overtime calculation for City employees.
Holidays, vacation, personal sick leave, occupational illness, emergency leave, and funeral leave (all
as provided for in Article X herein) shall not be deemed to be an interruption to the full month of
continuous service as used herein.
Further, in no event shall any employee accrue more than one thousand forty (1,040) hours (except for
Fire Department personnel scheduled for twenty-four-hour shifts in which event the maximum sick
leave accrual shall be one thousand four hundred fifty-six (1,456) hours) of sick leave and at no time
shall sick leave be considered a benefit convertible to compensation during employment or at the time
of employment separation, except as described further below in this Personal Sick Leave Policy or in
any subsequent policy adopted by the City Council.
In addition, an employee may use up to a maximum of three (3) earned sick leave days (except that
fire shift personnel may use up to a maximum of two (2) earned sick leave days, defined as twentyfour-
hour shift days) per calendar year to care for an ill or injured immediate family member, which
shall include only the employee's spouse, child, mother, father or other relative permanently residing in
the employee's residence.
At any time, a physician's certificate may be required to verify the employee's sickness or injury or to
verify a family member's sickness or injury if personal sick leave is taken. Subsequent to an absence
of any duration due to sickness or injury, a physician's certificate may be required to verify the
employee's ability to return to work prior to assumption of duties by that employee. In addition, any
employee may be required to complete a Work Steps Program before returning to work.
It is understood that an employee utilizing sick leave benefits pursuant to this Section agrees that he or
she will not accept or perform any work for any other employer or engage in any self-employment work
activity during his or her leave of absence; if an employee does so, he or she acknowledges that in
such circumstances his or her conduct will be deemed to be a violation of the terms of the leave of
absence, and that his or her employment with the City will be considered to have been terminated
voluntarily on his or her part as of the first day of such a violation.
All City employees who have accrued the maximum sick leave amount of one thousand forty (1,040)
hours and have not utilized any sick leave during the calendar year will be provided an additional eight
(8) hours of vacation time the following January 1 as a Bonus Vacation Day. Any such Bonus Vacation
Day is earned annually and must be re-earned each calendar year. As a Sick Leave Buy Back Option,
employees who have accrued at least five hundred twenty (520) hours of total sick leave as of
December 31 and have not used any sick leave during the calendar year may sell back up to fortyeight
(48) hours of sick leave at fifty percent (50%) of their value. Employees who have accrued at

least five hundred twenty (520) hours of total sick leave during the calendar year and have used no
more than twelve (12) hours of sick leave during such calendar year may sell back up to thirty-two (32)
hours of sick leave at fifty percent (50%) of their value. Employees must request, in writing, to use any
such Sick Leave Buy Back Option by January 15. The City shall pay out the appropriate amount within
thirty (30) days of receiving such written request. For purposes of the Bonus Vacation Day and Sick
Leave Buy Back Option described in this Section, Employees shall be entitled to use up to eight (8)
hours per calendar year for preventive health care appointments, such as routinely scheduled annual
or periodic medical, dental or vision examinations, which shall not be considered for purposes of
eligibility for either a Bonus Vacation Day or the Sick Leave Buy Back Option. The City may require
that appropriate documentation be submitted for any use of sick leave for such routine annual or
periodic medical, dental or vision examination appointments.
The Sick Leave Buy Back Option and Bonus Vacation Day policies described herein shall not apply to
any employees represented by an organized labor union. Any sick leave buy back and/or bonus
vacation day policy for employees represented by any labor union, specifically including Fire
Department employees represented by Local 2665 of the International Association of Fire Fighters,
Police Department employees represented by the Eastern Missouri Coalition of Police, Fraternal Order
of Police, Lodge 15 and Electric Department employees represented by Local Union No. 2 of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, shall be governed exclusively by the terms of any
collective bargaining agreement or memorandum of understanding in effect between the City and the
union representing such employees of the City.
When an employee has advance notice of an impending physical disability, such as elective surgery or
pregnancy, the employee shall notify the Personnel Department so that it can be determined whether
an absence will qualify under the Family Medical Leave Act. Upon request, the employee will be
required to complete and submit an FMLA Certification Form for such intended absence. If the
employee is not eligible for FMLA leave, such employee shall, before commencing such leave, submit
a statement from the attending physician which shall include:
A description of the reason leave is needed.
The anticipated date that the leave should begin.
The date on which the employee will be able to return to work.
Whether the employee will or is likely to be under any physical restrictions as a result of the illness
or injury upon return to work.
Such employee shall obtain a physician's release prior to returning to work, and such release shall
indicate whether or not the employee is under any physical restriction and the nature of such
restriction.
Sick leave may not be used during any disciplinary suspension. Sick leave may be used as earned
during any probationary period.
An employee on approved vacation leave who becomes ill or injured during such vacation leave
cannot use sick leave in lieu of already approved vacation leave.
Nothing contained in this Sick Leave Policy is to be construed as guaranteeing employment status
throughout the availability or use of sick leave benefits or upon conclusion of any period of such leave.
An employee who is medically unavailable for work for any extended duration may be separated from
employment, consistent with applicable Federal and State laws, regardless of whether the employee
has exhausted all earned, unused sick leave. A separation for such reason is not appealable to the
Kirkwood Civil Service Commission. Earned, unused sick leave is not payable upon separation of
employment.
§ E-1015. Occupational Injury Or Illness.

workers compensation benefits. Such occupational injury pay shall continue until the happening of the
earliest of the following events:
The date such employee shall be determined to be permanently disabled pursuant to the City's
pension plans.
The date such employee is determined to be able to return to work by the City's appointed
physician.
The date of any resolution or settlement of any workers' compensation claim.
The elapse of fifteen (15) calendar weeks after the date of the occurrence of the disabling event.
In the event such employee remains unable to return to work after the fifteen (15) calendar weeks,
such employee may use any accrued personal sick leave or vacation time while still employed. Upon
the exhaustion of such paid leave time, such employee shall only receive worker's compensation
payments, if any. Nothing contained in this Occupational Injury or Illness Policy is to be construed as
guaranteeing employment status throughout the use of occupational injury or illness leave or upon
conclusion of any period of such leave.
The Return to Work Program can assist with minimizing the cost of injuries by allowing injured
employees to return to work as soon as possible. Every employee injured on the job and released to
perform light duty work shall be considered for this program. However, light duty will not apply to any
situation generally which would require the employee to perform duties that the employee is not
currently qualified to perform. Light duty, if provided, is temporary and may be discontinued by the City
at any time. Provided, however, no occupational injury or illness compensation shall be provided to any
employee who rejects a light duty assignment offered by the City to the employee.
In addition, any employee may be required to complete a Work Steps Program before returning to
work.
It is understood that any employee receiving workers' compensation benefits pursuant to this Section
agrees not to accept or perform any work for any other employer or engage in any self-employment
work activity during the leave of absence; if an employee does so, the employee acknowledges that in
such circumstances the employee's conduct will be deemed to be a violation of the terms of the leave
of absence, and that employment with the City will be considered to have been terminated voluntarily
on the employee's part as of the first day of such a violation.
Any leave of absence due to occupational injury or illness may also be designated as FMLA leave
when appropriate and the employee, if so designated, shall comply with the City's FMLA policy as
requested.
§ E-1020. Emergency Leave.

household fire, storm damage, flooding, etc. This provision does not allow use for situations such as
transportation problems, auto repairs, babysitting, or similar non-critical obligations of the employee.

for leave, submit a statement from his or her attending physician which shall include those items
described in the Personal Sick Leave Section, Article X, Section E-1010. Leaves under this Section will

For any leave taken in accordance with this Policy that would otherwise be unpaid, each employee
is required to use accrued paid vacation, accrued paid sick leave and accrued compensatory time
to the extent available in the following manner:
For any leave taken under this Policy as Servicemember Family Leave or any leave relating
to the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a family member with a
serious health condition, the employee is required to use all of his or her available accrued
paid sick leave first (maximum of three (3) paid days annually, except for fire shift personnel
who have a maximum of two (2) twenty-four-hour work shifts annually), then use all of his or
her accrued paid vacation and then use all of his or her accrued compensatory time while on
leave; and
For any leave taken under this Policy because of the employee's own serious health
condition, the employee is required to use all of his or her accrued paid sick leave first, then
use all of his or her accrued paid vacation leave, PTO with respect to law enforcement
personnel of the City who receive paid time off in lieu of holidays, and then use all of his or
her accrued compensatory time while on leave.
If the leave taken in accordance with this Policy is compensated at all, such as under the
temporary total disability provisions of workers' compensation law, then no use of accrued paid
vacation, accrued paid sick leave or accrued compensatory time will be required but such paid
leave may be used at the employee's option.
An eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin of a covered
servicemember shall be entitled to a total of twenty-six (26) work weeks of leave during a twelvemonth
period to care for the servicemember ("Servicemember Family Leave"). The leave
described in this paragraph shall only be available during a single twelve-month period. During
such a single twelve-month period, an eligible employee shall be entitled to a combined total of
twenty-six (26) work weeks of FMLA leave, regardless of the reason or reasons for taking FMLA
leave. A "covered servicemember" means a member of the Armed Forces, including a member of
the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is
otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious
injury or illness. The term "outpatient status," with respect to a covered servicemember, means the
status of a member of the Armed Forces assigned to:
A military medical treatment facility as an outpatient; or
A unit established for the purpose of providing command and control of members of the
Armed Forces receiving medical care as outpatients.
The term "serious injury or illness," in the case of a member of the Armed Forces, including a
member of the National Guard or Reserves, means an injury or illness incurred by the member in
line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render the member medically unfit to
perform the duties of the member's office, grade, rank, or rating. For purposes of this Policy, the
term "next of kin," used with respect to an individual, means the nearest blood relative of that
individual.
For any leave taken under this Policy, an eligible employee may also take paid vacation leave
which has not yet been earned but could accrue during the calendar year. The use of unearned
vacation shall follow the use of earned sick leave and earned vacation leave as required in
paragraph five (5) of this Policy. If an employee chooses to use unearned vacation leave during an
FMLA leave of absence, the request to use such leave must be made, in writing, and submitted to
the Human Resources Manager prior to the exhaustion of all paid sick leave and paid earned
vacation. In the event that an employee utilized vacation leave during a calendar year in excess of
that which has accrued and thereafter dies, terminates, retires, is discharged, or otherwise
separates employment with the City of Kirkwood prior to the accrual of such vacation time, the City
shall be entitled to assess and recoup the value of such utilized vacation leave which is in excess
of the accrued vacation leave. Any such amount due shall be withheld from any final

compensation due employee or through appropriate legal action if necessary. If legal action is
necessary to recoup such amount, the employee will be responsible for the City's costs and
expenses, including attorney's fees.
An employee on leave in accordance with this Policy during any of the holidays designated in
Article X, Section E-1000 of the Personnel Rules and Regulations for the City of Kirkwood, will
receive pay as set forth in Article X, Section E-1000.
Spouses who are both employed by the City of Kirkwood are permitted to take only a combined
total of twelve (12) weeks leave during a twelve-month period if the leave is taken: for the birth of a
child or to care for the child after birth; for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to
care for the child after placement; or to care for a parent with a serious health condition. Each
spouse is entitled to his or her own twelve (12) weeks of leave during a twelve-month period if the
leave is for his or her serious health condition or the serious health condition of the other spouse
or a child.
An employee's entitlement of leave to care for an adopted, foster care, or newborn child expires at
the end of the twelve-month period beginning on the date of the birth or placement.
Employees seeking to use leave under this Policy are required to provide thirty (30) days' advance
notice of the need to take leave if the need for the leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth
or placement of a child, or planned medical treatment for a serious health condition of the
employee or of a family member. If thirty (30) days' notice is not practicable under the
circumstances, such as because of the lack of knowledge of when leave will begin, a change in
circumstances, or a medical emergency, notice must be given as soon as practicable. The notice
under this Section must set forth the reason(s) for the requested leave, the anticipated duration of
the leave and the anticipated start of the leave.
When planning medical treatment, the employee must consult with his or her Department Head
and make a reasonable effort to schedule the leave so as not to disrupt unduly the Department's
operations, consistent with the health care provider's medical judgment.
When leave is taken because of the birth or placement of a child or adoption or foster care, an
employee may take leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only upon approval of the
employee's Department Head. When leave is taken to care for an employee's own serious health
condition or for a sick family member, leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave
schedule when medically necessary at the employee's request.
An employee that takes leave under this Policy for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health
condition, or because of the employee's own serious health condition, must submit a sufficient and
complete FMLA Certification Form, upon request. The Certification Form is due fifteen (15) days
after the City's written request directed to the employee.
While on leave, the employee may be asked to periodically report on his or her status or the status
of the family member and when the employee intends to return to work.
It is understood that any employee taking Family and Medical Leave pursuant to this Section
agrees that he or she will not accept or perform any work for any other employer or engage in any
self-employment work activity during his or her leave of absence; if an employee does so, he or
she acknowledges that in such circumstances his or her conduct will be deemed to be a violation
of the terms of the leave of absence, and that his or her employment with the City will be
considered to have been terminated voluntarily on his or her part as of the first day of such a

For the duration of any leave taken under this Policy, the City of Kirkwood will maintain the
employee's health care coverage on the same basis as coverage would have been provided if the
employee had not taken leave. If an employee fails to return to work for the City for at least thirty
(30) days upon conclusion of leave taken under this Policy, the employee shall owe the City the
cost of health insurance premiums provided by the City during such absence, except as otherwise
limited by law.
When an employee takes leave, which would otherwise qualify as leave under this Policy except
that the employee has not specifically requested Family and Medical Leave, including any leave
due to occupational injury or illness, the time spent on such a leave may be designated as Family
and Medical Leave and may be counted towards an employee's total number of weeks to which
the employee is entitled as Family and Medical leave.
Extended leaves of absence without pay that are not governed by this Policy, (i.e., those for a
reason other than those provided herein, or if of the type otherwise covered but which extends
beyond the number of weeks allowed hereunder), will be governed by Article X, Section E-1030
(leave of absence without pay) of the Personnel Rules and Regulations for the City of Kirkwood.
Any interpretation of this Policy and of the benefits and obligations under the Family and Medical
Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA") shall be governed by appropriate Federal law and regulations issued
under the FMLA.
§ E-1070. Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
The Genetic Information and Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits employers and other
entities covered by GINA Title II from requesting or requiring genetic information of an individual or
family member of the individual, except as specifically allowed by this law. To comply with this law, the
City asks that employees not provide any genetic information when responding to a request for
medical information. "Genetic information" as defined by GINA, includes an individual's family medical
history, the results of genetic services sought or received by an individual (employee) or an individual's
family member, and genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual (employee) or an individual's
family member or an embryo lawfully held by an individual (employee) or family member receiving
assistive reproductive services.

undergraduate tuition reimbursement or four thousand dollars ($4,000.00) for graduate class
attendance tuition.
The course of study must be job related and in the field of employment.
All courses must be approved in advance by the appropriate Department Head and the Chief
Administrative Officer.
If letter grades are used by the educational institution, then a grade of "C" or better must be
attained in order to qualify for reimbursement by the City. If a pass/fail or
satisfactory/unsatisfactory system is used, "pass" or "satisfactory" will qualify for reimbursement.
The City will pay the employee up to three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) or four thousand dollars
($4,000.00) as applicable, for the cost of tuition reimbursement and required fees during any
single fiscal year; however, the employee will be responsible for any cost not covered by the
tuition or required fees, such as books and parking.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, tuition reimbursement is also available for academic
courses which are not job related when such courses are taken at local community colleges
approved by the Chief Administrative Officer or his or her designee.
Any City employee who has received any payment for tuition reimbursement shall be obligated to
repay such amount on a pro rata schedule, pursuant to a separate signed Tuition Reimbursement
Agreement if such employee voluntarily leaves the employment of the City for any reason
whatsoever or such employee is terminated for misconduct with the employee's work at any time
prior to completing twenty-four (24) months of employment service from employee's receipt of any
tuition reimbursement payment pursuant to this Policy.
As a transition for the increased amount of tuition reimbursement available pursuant to this revised
Tuition Reimbursement Program Policy in 2018, the maximum amount of tuition reimbursement for
the period of January 1, 2018 through March 31, 2019 shall be two thousand seven hundred fifty
dollars ($2,750.00) for undergraduate class attendance and reimbursement and three thousand
five hundred dollars ($3,500.00) for graduate class attendance and reimbursement. Effective April
1, 2019, the annual maximum amounts of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) and four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00) shall be in effect for the fiscal year of April 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020
and each fiscal year thereafter.
For avoidance of doubt, the maximum amount of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) for
undergraduate class tuition reimbursement and four thousand dollars ($4,000.00) for graduate
class tuition reimbursement shall not be cumulative. No employee shall be entitled to tuition
reimbursement in excess of four thousand dollars ($4,000.00) during any City fiscal year
regardless of whether the employee attends both undergraduate and graduate classes during any
fiscal year.
§ E-1120. Uniforms And Clothing Allowances.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]

public, will be provided with such clothing allocations as deemed appropriate by the Department Head.
If allocations are provided, the employee shall be required to wear the uniform clothing and to return
the full allocation of garments upon separation from City service. The City shall replace uniform
clothing damaged through natural wear on the job, but not due to negligence by the employee. The
employee shall wear uniform clothing only in route to and from work and while on duty.
The City Council may establish clothing allowances where deemed appropriate in lieu of providing
uniforms. In such instances, the employee shall be fully responsible for all maintenance and
replacement of uniforms or clothing.

and vote in any City election. Political affiliation, participation, or contribution shall not be considered in

No employee shall place, or allow to remain, upon a City vehicle used by the employee in the course
of employment any political picture, sticker, badge, or button. No person currently serving on any City
Board or Commission may become a full-time or part-time employee of the City while so serving on
any City Board or Commission and no full-time or part-time employee of the City shall be appointed to
any City Board or Commission while employed with the City. This provision does not apply to any
person classified by the City as a temporary employee.
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to restrict an employee's freedom to express an opinion or
exercise the right to vote.
No employee of the City shall use City equipment, personnel, facilities, or resources to promote or help
promote any civic, social, business, or political candidate, or any non-City of Kirkwood purpose without
the express written consent of the Chief Administrative Officer.
No employee shall accept or be influenced in his or her duties by an offer of any payment, gift or favor
from any source, other than their regular compensation from the City. It is particularly important that
employees refrain from accepting gifts where it might be construed as evidence of favoritism or unfair
advantage relative to any supplier or vendor. These limitations are not intended to prohibit the
acceptance of a) small gifts of no significant value, such as pens, pencils, note pads and other items
which can be used in the performance of work duties, and b) non-alcoholic consumable items such as
food, of no significant value, that can be shared equally on the City premises by all employees.
Alcoholic beverages or gifts of significant value sent to the City or City employees shall remain

Article XIII. Grievances, Complaints, And Appeals
§ E-1300. Grievances And Complaints.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
All classified employees shall have the right, except as specified herein, to utilize the grievance and
complaint procedures of this Article. The grievance and complaint procedures of this Article will be
available only to classified, permanent, full-time employees who are not serving a probationary period,
whether imposed due to a new position or for disciplinary or performance reasons.
The City follows an "open door" policy. Employees are encouraged by the City to raise any workrelated
concerns with their immediate Supervisors or with any member of management.
In addition, it is the policy of the City that all employees be treated in a nondiscriminatory fashion.
Accordingly, the City requires that all Supervisors discipline similarly situated employees in the same
fashion. At the same time, inasmuch as no two (2) conduct violations are identical in every detail, no
exact pattern of corrective discipline is required and the City may deviate from its imposition of
discipline whenever it determines that such action is warranted under the circumstances.
§ E-1310. Procedures For Handling Grievances And Complaints.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
STEP A. A grievance or complaint must be taken to the immediate Supervisor within seven (7)
calendar days following knowledge of the occurrence. Where possible, the grievance
should be settled at this level. If informal discussions do not resolve the issue, the
matter shall be reduced to writing by the employee and be submitted to the immediate
Supervisor within three (3) working days. The immediate Supervisor shall have five (5)
working days to respond in writing. In departments such as Police, Fire and others
where a more involved hierarchy chain of command system is utilized, the Department
Head shall, through written, published departmental rules and regulations, establish
which immediate supervisory level shall successively respond to a grievance.
STEP B. In the event that Step A does not resolve the situation, the employee may forward the
3/5/2020 City of Kirkwood, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/KI3621?guid=30203846,30203847,30203848,30701866,30203849,30702117,30203850,30203851,30703026,302038… 753/853
grievance or complaint, in writing, to the Department Head within three (3) working days
following receipt of the Supervisor's response. The written documentation must include
specific circumstances and state the remedial action requested. Such appeal must be
signed personally by the employee, with the original delivered to the Department Head.
Any other form of appeal, such as a facsimile transmission, e-mail communication or an
appeal unsigned by the employee, will not be considered by the Department Head. The
Department Head or his or her designee shall investigate and document the matter and
render a decision within ten (10) working days of receipt of the request, unless it is
impracticable to do so in such a timeframe.
STEP C. In the event that Step B does not resolve the problem and the grievance involves a
suspension, demotion or termination, the employee may forward all written
documentation and appeal to the Chief Administrative Officer within three (3) working
days of receipt of the Department Head's decision. The Chief Administrative Officer will
consider only an appeal involving a suspension, demotion or termination of
employment, which results in economic loss to the employee. Such appeal must be
signed personally by the employee, with the original delivered to the Chief
Administrative Officer. Any other form of appeal, such as a facsimile transmission, email
communication or an appeal unsigned by the employee, will not be considered by the
Chief Administrative Officer. The Chief Administrative Officer will provide a decision to
the employee within ten (10) working days of receipt of the request, unless it is
impracticable to do within such a timeframe. For grievances that are not eligible to be
appealed to the Civil Service Commission, the Chief Administrative Officer may delegate
to the Assistant Chief Administrative Officer the responsibility for reviewing and
responding to the appeal.
STEP D. If the grievance involves suspension for more than five (5) working days, dismissal
(unless an appeal to the Civil Service Commission is expressly prohibited under these
Rules and Regulations) or disciplinary demotion, the employee may request a hearing
before the Civil Service Commission. A written request for a formal hearing shall be filed
with the City's liaison to the Civil Service Commission (Assistant Chief Administrative
Officer) within seven (7) calendar days from the date of receipt of the decision of the
Chief Administrative Officer. The Civil Service Commission shall convene as soon as
reasonably practicable after receipt of the request for appeal. If requested by either
party, the Civil Service Commission shall conduct a closed hearing in accordance with
procedures and rules established by the Civil Service Commission. Each party shall
have the right to be heard in person and call witnesses. All parties, including the Civil
Service Commission, may engage counsel. Technical rules of evidence shall not apply.
After hearing and consideration of the evidence, the Commission shall render its
decision in writing. The Commission's decision shall be final and binding.
Grievances which are not continued timely by the employee within the aforementioned procedure shall
be considered as satisfied and not subject to further consideration.
Article XIV. Employment Of Relatives
§ E-1400. Employment Of Relatives.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
The City discourages the employment of relatives with the City. The City will not hire on a full-time,
part-time, or temporary basis a member of the immediate family of a City Council member, the Chief
Administrative Officer, a Department Head or a Division Head. In addition, no person who is a member
of the immediate family of an employee may be hired, transferred or promoted to work in the same
work unit of the City. A work unit is defined as a work grouping where the possibility of one (1) relative
directly supervising another may occur. "Immediate family" for the purpose of this Section is defined as

Article XV. No Smoking Policy
§ E-1500. No Smoking Policy.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
To maintain a safe and comfortable working environment and to ensure compliance with applicable
laws, smoking or use of any other tobacco products within City offices, facilities and vehicles is strictly
prohibited. This Policy applies to e-cigarettes and any other smoking device or product.
Article XVI. Equal Employment Opportunity, Anti-
Harassment, And Nondiscrimination Policy
§ E-1600. Equal Employment Opportunity, Anti-Harassment, And
Nondiscrimination Policy.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
It is the policy and practice of the City of Kirkwood ("City") to provide and promote equal employment
opportunities for all applicants and employees. It is the responsibility of all employees to ensure that
the concepts of equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination are understood, abided by, and
carried out by everyone.
It is the policy of the City to hire, train, promote, compensate, and administer all employment practices
without regard to age, race, color, genetic information, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, religion,
sex, disability unrelated to the ability to perform the job or sexual orientation or gender identity to the
extent protected by State or Federal law. In short, discrimination or harassment on any of the grounds
stated above is strictly forbidden and will not be tolerated. The City will take appropriate measures in
response to any such incidents which are known by or reported to management or the Personnel
Department.
The City believes that every employee has the right to work in an environment free of sexual or other
prohibited harassment. Such conduct does not advance the purposes of the City; it is also morally
wrong, and may subject the City to legal exposure. Consequently, any employee who engages in this
prohibited conduct will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
Conduct Constituting Prohibited Sexual Harassment
Under guidelines published by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, "unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature"
constitute unlawful harassment in the following instances:
a. When submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of
employment; or
b. When submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for any
employment decision (e.g., promotion, wage increase, termination) affecting such individual;
or
c. When such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's
work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
For example, and without compiling an exhaustive list, the following are illustrative of conduct that the
City condemns and prohibits under this Policy:
3/5/2020 City of Kirkwood, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/KI3621?guid=30203846,30203847,30203848,30701866,30203849,30702117,30203850,30203851,30703026,302038… 755/853
(a) Conditioning a benefit such as a certain salary or promotion on the granting of sexual favors
or the establishment or continuance of a personal relationship, or to imply to an employee that
an award of such a benefit is conditioned upon the granting of sexual favors or the
establishment or continuance of a personal relationship.
(b) Stating or implying that another employee's performance is attributable in whole or in part to
the sex of that employee.
(c) Stating or implying that a fellow employee's promotion in the City hierarchy has resulted from
the granting of a sexual favor or relationship.
Sexual harassment may involve such matters as crude sexual jokes or sexual names; sexually
suggestive, profane language; offensive sexual flirtations and innuendos; a display of obscene or
pornographic material; sexual advances; grabbing or touching another individual; or other, similar
demeaning and insulting behavior based on sex. Employees of the City should be aware that the
issue of whether conduct constitutes sexual harassment or discriminatory conduct may depend on
how that conduct is viewed by the employee who is subjected to the conduct. Any employee who
initiates or persists in this prohibited conduct assumes the risk of violating this Policy in the event that
the person who is the object of the conduct views it as offensive; accordingly, such an employee may
be subject to discipline even if the conduct might not have been intended as offensive.
Prohibited Discriminatory Joking or Epithets Based on Age, Race, Color, Genetic Information,
Pregnancy, National Origin, Ancestry, Religion, Sex, Disability, Sexual Orientation or Gender
Identity
As examples, and without compiling an exhaustive list, the following are illustrative of conduct the
City condemns and prohibits under this Policy:
(a) It is prohibited for any employee to bring any item to the work premises for purposes of a joke
or epithet based on age, race, color, genetic information, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry,
religion, sex, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity.
(b) It is also prohibited for any employee to use City property, bulletin boards, e-mail or voice mail
systems, or documents for purposes of a joke or epithet based on age, race, color, genetic
information, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, religion, sex, disability, sexual orientation or
gender identity.
(c) It is also prohibited for any employee to deface City property or the personal property of
anyone else for purposes of a joke or epithet based on age, race, color, genetic information,
pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, religion, sex, disability, sexual orientation or gender
identity.
(d) It is also prohibited for any employee to utter or use any slur, joke or epithet at work or when
referring to or about any other person, be they an employee or a non-employee, based on
age, race, color, genetic information, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, religion, sex,
disability, sexual orientation or gender identity.
Procedure Upon Occurrence of Prohibited Conduct
Any employee who believes they have been subjected or exposed to any harassment or other
conduct prohibited by this Policy has the right to have such activity terminated immediately.
Complaints must be made either to the employee's immediate Supervisor, Department Head, or to
the City's Chief Administrative Officer, Assistant Chief Administrative Officer or Human Resources
Manager. Complaints shall be treated in a confidential manner to the extent reasonable. Retaliation of
any form against anyone who complains pursuant to this Policy is strictly prohibited. An investigation
shall be made immediately concerning any complaint. If the investigation leads to a determination
that the charges are true or there has been any improper conduct, corrective action will be taken
immediately. Such action may include termination of employment for anyone violating this Policy. Any
complaint against the Chief Administrative Officer or City Clerk should be made to the Human
Resources Manager or Assistant Chief Administrative Officer, who shall do a prompt and thorough
investigation. A report of such investigation shall be forwarded to the Mayor and City Council for their
review and determination of appropriate action to be taken against the Chief Administrative Officer or
City Clerk.

Article XVII. Policy Regarding Reasonable
Accommodations For Qualified Individuals With A Disability
§ E-1700. Policy Regarding Reasonable Accommodations For
Qualified Individuals With A Disability.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
The City stands committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Americans With Disabilities Act and all
other applicable State and Federal Statutes governing the workplace. It is the policy of the City to hire,
train, promote, compensate, and administer all employment practices without regard to a disability
unrelated to the ability to perform a job with or without reasonable accommodation. Discrimination
against job applicants or employees because they are disabled is prohibited and will not be tolerated.
GUIDELINES
When dealing with situations involving job applicants or employees with a disability, the City will
endeavor to follow these guidelines:
1. It is against the policy of the City to discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities
who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of a job.
2. The City is committed to ensuring that qualified individuals with a disability are not
discriminated against in applying for employment and once such individuals have been
employed in the workplace. It is the policy of the City, where possible and readily achievable, to
make existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with
disabilities. However, there may be instances where the City is not aware that an employee has
a disability which might impact on an aspect of his or her employment or whether an existing
facility is accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. It is incumbent upon any job
applicant or employee to alert the City or his or her Supervisor as to the existence of a disability
which the job applicant or employee believes needs to be accommodated so that he or she will
enjoy and be afforded equal employment opportunity in the workplace.
3. An individual may be considered disabled if he or she has a physical or mental impairment and
the impairment substantially limits one (1) or more of the individual's major activities in life, has
a record or history of such an impairment, or is perceived as having such an impairment. The
City is committed to making reasonable accommodations in job duties, the work environment,
and the application process to enable a qualified person with a disability to enjoy equal
employment opportunities, so long as such accommodations do not constitute an undue
hardship.
4. At the same time, the City also has an obligation to provide a safe work environment for all
employees and customers. Reasonable precautions will be taken to ensure that an employee's
disability, or any attempted reasonable accommodations thereto, do not present a direct threat
to the health and/or safety of the individual employee with a disability or to others.
PROCEDURAL CHANNELS
The employee should advise his or her Supervisor of the existence of a disability which the employee
believes needs to be accommodated so that he or she will have equal employment opportunities in
the workplace. The City will attempt to work with the employee to determine if the employee's
disability can be reasonably accommodated. Employees also should advise their Department Head,
the Chief Administrative Officer or Assistant Chief Administrative Officer of any facilities which they
believe need to be made accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities. In addition, the
employee may contact his or her Supervisor, Department Head, Chief Administrative Officer or
Assistant Chief Administrative Officer if he or she believes that he or she has been discriminated
against by reason of a disability. Any complaint of disability discrimination shall be investigated and
treated in a confidential manner to the extent reasonable. If the investigation leads to a determination
that the charges are true, corrective action will be taken immediately.

§ E-1800. Statement Of Policy And Objective.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
It is the policy of the City of Kirkwood to vigorously support an all-encompassing safety and property
protection program. The City of Kirkwood maintains that its residents and employees are its most
important asset. Therefore, their safety is our greatest concern and responsibility. In all assignments,
the health and safety of all shall have the utmost consideration. Department heads and supervisory
personnel at all levels of the municipal work force are directed to make safety a matter of continuing
concern, equal in importance with all other operational considerations. Effective loss prevention is an
integral part of management procedures designed to fully utilize municipal capital and personnel.
The Safety Procedures Manual is a supplement and extension of the City Safety Policy. It is a working
document that provides the means of implementing the goal of a safe workplace and is to be used in
conjunction with applicable codes and regulations.
Every employee is charged with the responsibility of supporting and cooperating with the City's Safety
Manager and safety and property protection procedures. All employees are expected, as a condition of
employment, to adopt the concept that the safe way to perform a task is the most efficient and the only
acceptable way to perform it. Safety adherence and performance will be considered as an important
measure of supervisory and employee performance evaluation.
§ E-1810. Responsibilities.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]

success.
Safety Manager
The Safety Manager's responsibility is that of providing and following a well balanced safety and
property protection program to guide the City in its safety and property protection efforts. He or she
will serve as the Assistant Chief Administrative Officer's consultant, analyst, organizer and

Supervisory Personnel
Each Supervisor has the responsibility for the safe actions of his or her employees and the safe
performance of machines and equipment within his or her operating area. The full potential of a
safety and property protection program can only be realized when Supervisors accept and carry out
their responsibilities on a day-to-day basis in all phases of the program.
Supervisors are responsible for making certain that there is an immediate investigation into any
Preventable Accident, defined below, and to take immediate corrective and disciplinary action as
appropriate in the event of a Preventable Accident. Each Supervisor must report all information
regarding a Preventable Accident to the Safety Manager and coordinate with the Safety Manager and
Human Resources Manager of the City to review and determine appropriate disciplinary action for
any Preventable Accident or any other violation of a safety policy, rule or regulation by an employee.
Any Supervisor who fails to promptly report and provide complete information relating to any
Preventable Accident or safety violation or who fails to issue discipline to an employee who violates
any safety policy, rule or regulation shall be disciplined by the Department Head. Ensuring a safe
workplace within the City is the responsibility of all Department Heads, Supervisors and employees,
all of whom shall be held accountable to fulfill their obligations to provide the safest working
environment feasible within the City.
Employees and Safety Violation Discipline
Every employee is required, as a condition of employment, to develop and exercise safe work
practices in the course of his or her work to prevent injuries to themselves, fellow workers, and
damage to property and to report any incidents or injuries to their supervisor immediately.
All employees that operate City vehicles or equipment shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary
action in the event of a Preventable Accident. A Preventable Accident is defined as any accident
involving a City vehicle or equipment, whether being used for City or personal use, that results in
property damage and/or personal injury, and in which the driver or other City employee using the
vehicle or City equipment failed to exercise every reasonable precaution to prevent the accident.
A Preventable Accident determination will be generated by the Police Department and contained in
the Missouri uniform crash report (section 7d) conducted by the accident investigation and reviewing
officers.
The Department Head and/or Department Supervisor shall determine the discipline to be issued
following any Preventable Accident, which may range from a written warning to employment
termination. The factors to be considered in issuing discipline shall include: extent of injury to another
person; extent of property damage; level of negligence or willful disregard of proper safety
procedures on the part of the employee; refusal to follow established traffic laws, safety rules or
regulations; failure to pass a drug/alcohol screening; prior incidents of one (1) or more Preventable
Accident and any prior disciplinary action in the personnel file of the employee.
Any violation of a safety policy, rule or regulation shall also be subject to disciplinary action even if
there is no Preventable Accident. Generally, a written warning should be issued to any employee for
the first violation of any safety policy, rule or regulation which does not result in a Preventable
Accident or any damage to property or person. Any safety violation thereafter shall result in more
severe disciplinary action, including the possibility of employment termination.
§ E-1820. Environmental Control.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
Supervisors shall determine the designation and use of appropriate personal protective equipment
through consideration of environmental factors, the task, and the individual employee. In order that
safety devices or safeguards be acceptable as to proper type, design, strength and quality, they shall
be at least equivalent to those complying with The American National Standards Institute (ANSI),
Bureau of Standards, or other recognized authorities, where applicable. Detailed specifications for the
design, purpose, and purchase of all protective equipment shall be the responsibility of the authorized
department in conjunction with the Safety Manager.

https://ecode360.com/print/KI3621?guid=30203846,30203847,30203848,30701866,30203849,30702117,30203850,30203851,30703026,302038… 759/853
The employee shall be responsible for the proper use of specialized equipment provided by the City for
his or her safety. In addition, any employee-owned personal protective equipment must also comply
with the standards and be maintained in a safe, sanitary condition at all times and available for
inspection by the Supervisor.
When the use of personal protective equipment has been specified for hazardous work, its use shall be
mandatory. Seat belts must be in use at all times. Supervisors shall be held accountable for training
their employees in the proper use and wearing of the equipment when required, and the appropriate
documentation of all training.
Proper Dress
Each employee shall wear clothing suitable for the job he or she is performing at all times. Suitable
clothing means clothing that will minimize the possibility of damage from moving machinery, hot or
injurious substances, or other harmful agents. Proper dress standards shall be governed by the
discretion of the Department Head or Supervisor.
§ E-1830. Fleet Safety.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
Driver Training
All drivers shall receive training on good driving practices, proper care and adherence to maintenance
schedules, good maintenance records, and prompt repair — all of which will aid in the safety of both
driver and pedestrians. Each Department Head, in conjunction with the Safety Manager, shall
determine the exact nature of the training, which may include the use of safety meetings, seminars,
and defensive driving courses, with refresher courses as needed.

Article XX. Policy Against Substance Abuse
§ E-2000. Policy Against Substance Abuse.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
A. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL EMPLOYEES AND APPLICANTS
Purpose.
It is the policy of the City of Kirkwood, Missouri to maintain a safe, healthy, and productive work
environment for all employees and the City's residents. To that end, the City will act to eliminate any
use, possession, concealment, sale, or distribution of illegal or unauthorized drugs and alcoholic
beverages which increases the potential for accidents, absenteeism, substandard performance, poor
employee morale, or tends to undermine public confidence in the City's workforce. Generally, any
substance which may affect the employee's senses, motor functions, or alter the individual's
perception while working falls within this Policy. This prohibition applies during working hours and
non-working hours if the off-duty use impacts job performance.
This Policy provides guidelines for the detection and deterrence of alcohol and drug abuse. It also
outlines the responsibilities of management and employees. All employees covered by this Policy
should be aware that violations of the policy may result in discipline, up to and including termination.
Applicants in violation of this Policy will not be hired.
In recognition of the serious duty entrusted to employees of the City and with the knowledge that
drugs and alcohol do hinder a person's ability to perform duties safely and effectively, the following
policy against drugs and alcohol is hereby adopted by the City of Kirkwood.
Policy
The use, possession, concealment, sale, or distribution of unauthorized drug or alcohol is absolutely
prohibited. It is City policy that employees shall not: report to work with any detectable amount of an
unauthorized drug or alcohol or be under the influence of alcohol or drugs; have the odor of alcohol or
drugs on their breath during a regularly scheduled shift; possess drugs or alcohol on their person or
property under their control, while on duty or on compensated standby time; sell or provide drugs or
alcohol to any other employees or to any person while such employee is on duty; test positive for
unauthorized drugs or alcohol; or work impaired as a result of the use of alcohol or drugs.
The use of any unauthorized drug by an employee where a State or other Country considers such
drug use lawful (such as a State in which marijuana use is considered lawful) does not excuse any
violation of this Policy.
The use of medically prescribed medications and drugs which are lawful under both Federal and
Missouri law is not per se a violation of this Policy. However, failure by the employee to notify his or
her Supervisor, before beginning work, when taking medication or drugs which may interfere with the
safe and effective performance of duties or operation of City equipment may result in discipline, up to
and including termination. In the event there is a question regarding an employee's ability to safely
and effectively perform assigned duties while using such medication or drugs, clearance from a
qualified physician will be required.
The City has established a voluntary Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to assist those employees
3/5/2020 City of Kirkwood, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/KI3621?guid=30203846,30203847,30203848,30701866,30203849,30702117,30203850,30203851,30703026,302038… 762/853
who voluntarily seek help for alcohol or drug problems. Telephone numbers for the EAP are listed on
posters in the workplace, on periodic payroll stuffers, and in the employee newsletter. Medical
insurance coverage for drug and alcohol treatment is also included in the medical plan offered by the
City. Employees wishing to obtain more information on any of these benefits should contact the
Personnel Department, the City's health insurance carrier, or the Employee Assistance Program.
The City reserves the right to search, without employee consent, all areas and property in which the
City maintains joint control with the employee or full control. All City vehicles are subject to search by
appropriate management personnel. Warrants will be obtained should it become necessary to search
areas beyond the City's immediate control.
Violations of this Policy will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Refusal
to submit immediately to an alcohol and/or drug analysis when requested by management pursuant
to provisions of this substance abuse policy will result in termination.
Employees reasonably believed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs shall be prevented from
engaging in further work. The employee shall be instructed to wait for a reasonable time until an
authorized City representative can transport the employee from the work site.
Application
A. Personnel.
1. All employees and applicants who are selected for positions with the City of Kirkwood.
B. Substances
1. Alcohol;
2. Illegal or unauthorized drugs or any other substances which may impair an employee's
ability to effectively perform the functions of the job or as otherwise described elsewhere
in this substance abuse policy.
Employee Responsibilities.
An employee must:
A. Not report to work or be subject to duty while having any detectable prohibited drug or alcohol
in his or her system or report to work or be subject to duty while his or her ability to perform
any job duties is or has been impaired due to alcohol or drug use, on or off duty;
B. Not possess or use, or have the odor of alcohol or drugs on his or her breath during work
hours, on breaks, during meal periods, while on City property in an official capacity, or while
operating any City vehicle;
C. Not directly or through a third party sell or provide drugs or alcohol to any person or to any
other employee while either employee or both employees are on duty or "on call";
D. Consent to and submit immediately to reasonable requests for alcohol and/or drug analysis
when requested by a Department Head or his or her designee;
E. Notify his or her Supervisor, before beginning work, when taking any medications or drugs,
prescription or non-prescription, which may interfere with the safe and effective performance
of job duties or operation of City equipment; and
F. Provide within twenty-four (24) hours of request a current valid prescription for any drug or
medication identified when a drug screen/analysis is positive. The prescription must be in the
employee's name.

ordinance conviction or suspended imposition of sentence for a violation occurring in the
workplace no later than five (5) calendar days after such conviction or suspended imposition

Management Responsibilities and Guidelines
A. Managers and Supervisors are responsible for consistent enforcement of this Policy. Any
Supervisor who knowingly permits a violation of this Policy by employees under his or her
3/5/2020 City of Kirkwood, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/KI3621?guid=30203846,30203847,30203848,30701866,30203849,30702117,30203850,30203851,30703026,302038… 763/853
direct supervision shall be subject to disciplinary action.
B. Managers and Supervisors may request that an employee submit to a drug and/or alcohol
analysis when a Manager or Supervisor has a reasonable suspicion that an employee is
intoxicated or under the influence of drugs or alcohol or is otherwise in violation of any
provision of this Policy. "Reasonable suspicion" is a belief based on objective and articulable
facts sufficient to lead a reasonably prudent Supervisor to suspect that an employee is under
the influence of drugs or alcohol so that the employee's ability to perform the functions of the
job is impaired or so that the employee's ability to perform his or her job safely is reduced or
that the employee is otherwise in violation of any provision of this Policy. For example, any of
the following, alone or in combination, may constitute reasonable suspicion:
1. Slurred speech;
2. Alcohol on breath;
3. Inability to walk a straight line;
4. An accident involving City property;
5. An accident that results in the injury of a person;
6. Physical altercation;
7. Verbal altercation;
8. Behavior which is so unusual that it warrants summoning a Supervisor or anyone else
with authority;
9. Use or possession of alcohol or drugs;
10. Information on use or possession of alcohol or drugs provided either by a reliable and
credible source or independently corroborated;
11. Arrest or conviction for a substance abuse offense or being the subject of a criminal
investigation into illegal drug possession, use, or trafficking;
12. Evidence that the employee has previously tampered with a previous drug test.
This list is not intended to be all inclusive of conduct which constitutes reasonable suspicion.
C. Drug/alcohol tests shall be required for employees whenever there is a pattern of on-duty
accidents, an accident resulting in property damage or any on the job injury.
D. Any Supervisor who has reasonable suspicion that an employee is impaired on the job by
alcohol or other substance or is otherwise in violation of any term of this Policy will, with the
approval of the Department Head, immediately arrange for a substance screening through the
Personnel Department. If a screening is required after normal business hours, the Supervisor
will make direct contact with the facility that has been designated to perform screenings for the
City. The following procedures shall be followed:
1. The Supervisor should document, in writing, the facts constituting reasonable suspicion
that the employee in question is impaired on the job by alcohol or other substance or is
otherwise in violation of any term of this Policy.
2. Any Supervisor requesting an employee to submit to a drug and/or alcohol analysis
shall be responsible for the employee's transport to the City's designated facility where
a drug and/or alcohol analysis will be performed.
3. Any Supervisor encountering an employee who refuses to submit to a drug and/or
alcohol analysis upon request shall remind the employee of the requirements and
consequences of this Policy. Such continued refusal will constitute grounds for
termination.
4. Supervisors shall not physically search employees.
5. Supervisors shall notify the Police Department when they have reasonable suspicion to
believe that an employee may have illegal drugs in his or her possession or in an area
not jointly or fully controlled by the City.
6. Supervisors shall not confiscate, without consent, prescription drugs or medications
from an employee.

E. Results of Drug and/or Alcohol Analysis
1. Upon a negative result, the employee shall return to work.
2. If the test result is positive, the employee will then be given the opportunity, at the
employee's expense, to have an additional test performed on the retained specimen. If
the additional test shows a negative result, it will be assumed that the individual is not in
violation of this Policy, and the employee shall return to work. If negative, the City will
reimburse the employee for the expense of the additional screen.
3. If all tests indicate a positive result, the employee's Department Head shall have the
authority to determine appropriate discipline including termination, subject to the review
or approval by the City's Chief Administrative Officer or his or her authorized
administrative officer. A single offense may result in immediate termination of
employment.
Pre-Employment Substance Screening and Procedure
A. Prospective employees will be screened for a range of chemical substances. Any employment
offer is conditional on a negative substance screening. Refusal to consent to and participate in
such testing will automatically disqualify the applicant from further hiring considerations.
B. The drug screen may test for any substance which could impair an employee's ability to
effectively and safely perform the functions of his or her job. The type(s) of screening and the
levels of substances which constitute a positive screen will be determined administratively
after consultation with the City's medical services provider(s).
C. An applicant whose initial substance screen shows a positive result will be given the
opportunity, at the applicant's expense, to have an additional screen performed on the
retained specimen. If the additional screen of the same sample shows a negative result, the
individual will not be disqualified from City employment on account of the previous substance
screen. If the additional screen of the same sample confirms the positive test result, the
applicant will be disqualified from consideration for City employment for twelve (12) months.
Severability
The provisions of this Policy are severable and, if any of its provisions shall be held unconstitutional
or otherwise invalid by any competent jurisdiction, the decision of such court shall not affect any of
the remaining provisions.
B. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN SAFETY SENSITIVE EMPLOYEES
All City employees who hold a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) are also subject to the rules of the
Federal Highway Administration (FHA) adopted pursuant to the Omnibus Transportation Employee

No driver shall refuse to submit to any required drug or alcohol test required by post-accident,
random, reasonable suspicion or follow-up testing requirements as defined below.
No driver shall report for duty or remain on duty when using any controlled substances except
those a physician has advised that the driver may use which will not adversely affect the
driver's performance.
Drug/Alcohol Tests Required by This Policy
The City is required to administer the following types of tests for persons operating commercial motor
vehicles:
Pre-employment testing for drugs.[1] Offers of employment are made contingent on
successfully passing drug screening tests.
Post-accident testing. Drivers will be given drug and alcohol tests within two (2) hours of an
accident involving property damage or bodily injury or an accident when the driver is cited for a
moving traffic violation. In cases of post-accident testing, the employee will be transported to a
medical facility or the City will request and conduct a breath test at the worksite.
Random testing. Drivers must participate in random drug and alcohol test pools. The random
test rate of the alcohol testing pool shall be at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the drivers
annually and for the drug testing pool at least fifty percent (50%) of the drivers annually. The
tests will be spread throughout the calendar year. Random selection means that an individual
commercial driver may be selected for alcohol and/or drug testing several times in one (1)
calendar year, or not at all.
Reasonable suspicion testing. Drivers are subject to drug and/or alcohol testing at any time
during, immediately prior to, or immediately after the driver's assigned working hours, when
based upon reasonable suspicion as defined in this Policy. In cases of reasonable suspicion
testing, the employee will be transported to a medical facility or the City will request and
conduct a breath test at the worksite.
Return to duty and follow-up testing. Before a worker who has violated the prohibited
conduct of this Policy may return to work, he or she must take and pass drug and/or alcohol
tests. Follow-up tests are to be given at least six (6) times within the first year after the
employee returns to duty following completion of a rehabilitation program.
Testing Procedures
Drug and alcohol testing procedures shall conform to those required by Federal regulations
governing the drug and alcohol testing mandated by the Department of Transportation. All drug
tests shall be done by a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) certified laboratory.
Specimen Collection. The Personnel Department will instruct job applicants to report to the
testing site. Current employees will be instructed by the Department Head where and when to
report for drug and/or alcohol testing. In cases of post-accident or reasonable suspicion testing,
the employee will be transported to a medical facility or the City will request and conduct a
breath test at the worksite.
The procedure for collecting urine specimens will be designed to ensure the integrity and
identity of the urine specimen that is produced. The procedure will also allow for individual
privacy, provided, however, the City and employees shall abide by all current DOT Rules or
Regulations, which provide additional safeguards against efforts of employees to cheat on
substance abuse testing, including a required collection of urine under direct observation for
certain return-to-duty and follow-up tests. Breath alcohol testing will follow Federal procedures
to ensure accuracy, reliability and confidentiality.
If testing under this Policy is ever required of an employee who is in need of medical attention,
necessary medical attention will not be delayed in order to collect the test specimen. However,
such an employee shall promptly, upon request from the City, provide the necessary
authorization for obtaining hospital reports and records and any other information at the time
the need for medical attention and/or testing arose.
Nature of Tests. Drug testing. Drug testing will be performed on urine samples. The initial test

https://ecode360.com/print/KI3621?guid=30203846,30203847,30203848,30701866,30203849,30702117,30203850,30203851,30703026,302038… 766/853
will be done by the Enzyme Immunochemical Assay Method (EMIT) or a similarly approved
testing method. All specimens identified as a positive test on the initial test will be confirmed
using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques. A specimen will be
treated as negative if the result of the initial test or the confirmatory test is negative. All urine
samples will be split samples so that if the original specimen test is positive the employee may
request the retained sample be tested. This request must be received by the MRO, in writing,
within seventy-two (72) hours of employee's notice of a positive result. The split sample will be
tested at the employee's expense. If the second test is negative, the test will be deemed to be
negative and the cost of the test for the split sample will be paid for by the City or reimbursed to
the employee if already paid by the employee. Job applicants do not have the right to split
samples.
Alcohol Testing. Alcohol testing will be done by using Evidential Breath Testing Devices (EBT)
approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Two (2) breath tests are
required to determine if a person has a prohibited alcohol concentration. Breath Alcohol testing
requires the individual to provide a breath sample. Should the initial breath sample have a
result of two hundredths percent (0.02%) blood alcohol content or greater, a confirmation test
will be conducted within twenty (20) minutes using an EBT that prints out the results, date, and
time, a sequential number, and the name and serial number of the EBT to ensure reliability of
the results. A positive test will be reported to the City of Kirkwood only if the initial and
confirmatory tests measure a blood alcohol concentration at or above two hundredths percent
(0.02%) by weight.
Refusal to Test. All employees covered by this Policy are required to submit to the alcohol or
drug tests as provided herein. If an employee refuses to be tested or alters or attempts to alter
the test sample, such actions shall be treated as a positive test in addition to being a violation
of this Policy. Such a refusal is grounds for immediate termination.
Test Results
Drug Tests. The Medical Review Officer (MRO) will review positive drug test results with the
employee before they are reported to the City to determine if there is a legitimate medical
explanation to account for the laboratory results. The Medical Review Officer will report to the
City whether an employee's drug test was positive or negative. If positive, the substance(s) for
which the test was positive will be identified. The Medical Review Officer may advise the City of
a positive test result without having communicated with the tested employee about the test
results if the employee expressly declines the opportunity to discuss the results of the test, or if
the employee cannot be reached after reasonable effort by the Medical Review Officer.
Following a positive test result, the employee will be removed from his or her safety sensitive
function until, at a minimum, the employee undergoes evaluation and, when necessary,
rehabilitation; after a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) determines that the employee has
successfully complied with any required rehabilitation; and after the employee takes a returnto-
duty test with a verified negative test result.
If the Medical Review Officer determines there is a legitimate medical explanation for the
positive test result, the Medical Review Officer will report the test result to the City as negative.
Alcohol Tests. If an alcohol breath test results in a reading of two hundredths percent (0.02%)
to thirty-nine thousandths percent (0.039%) blood alcohol content, the individual shall not
return to duty but shall be taken off-duty and not returned to work for at least twenty-four (24)
hours. If an alcohol breath test results in a reading of four hundredths percent (0.04%) blood
alcohol content or greater, in addition to the above, the employee must meet with a Substance
Abuse Professional (SAP). The SAP will determine what assistance, if any, the employee
needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol use and when the employee may return to
work. Provided, however, nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way limit the right of
the City to take disciplinary action as it deems appropriate for any positive alcohol (or drug)
test, including immediate termination of employment.
Confidentiality. The results of any positive test shall be kept confidential from the general City
work force and public. The results may be known to the employee, test facility, the Medical
Review Officer and Substance Abuse Professional and those Department Heads necessary.

Department Heads (or Supervisors) have the following specific duties.
Department Heads must produce drivers for post accident drug and alcohol testing within two
(2) hours of the accident or explain, in writing, why the driver was not produced. The driver may
be given necessary medical treatment and if such treatment prevents normal drug or alcohol
testing, the Supervisor shall immediately inform the City's Human Resources Manager.
Whenever drug or alcohol tests are required under this Policy, Department Heads must
produce the driver for those tests, and when current impairment is reasonably suspected, the
Department Head shall not allow the employee to drive.

writing, why the test or tests were not performed.
Review of Test Results. The City will employ a Medical Review Officer (MRO) to review the drug
test results. The MRO shall be a licensed physician with knowledge of drug abuse disorders.
Return to Work; Drug Test. In order to recommend return to work after a positive drug test, the
MRO shall ensure the employee has subsequently tested drug free, been evaluated by a
rehabilitation program counselor, and ensure the employee is in compliance with rehabilitation
conditions.
The MRO shall determine whether and when a return to duty recommendation shall be made
for an employee who has failed a drug test or refused to be tested and shall determine the
schedule for return to work drug testing.
Only the Medical Review Officer may review and interpret each positive drug test and, after
conferring with the employee, report the results to the City.
Substance Abuse Professional. The City will also employ a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP).
The SAP shall be a licensed physician (M.D. or D.O.) or a licensed psychologist, social worker,
employee assistance professional or an addiction counselor (certified by MHADACCC) with
knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-related disorders.
Return to Work; Alcohol Test. In order to recommend return to work after an alcohol test which
indicates a blood alcohol content greater than four hundredths percent (0.04%), the SAP must first
evaluate the employee to determine whether the employee has an alcohol problem.
If it is determined by the SAP that an employee has an alcohol problem which requires assistance,
the employee shall be subject to counseling, treatment and follow-up alcohol testing as directed by
the SAP. Follow-up testing shall only occur just before, during or just after the employee operates a

Article XXI. Travel Policy
§ E-2100. Travel Policy.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
3/5/2020 City of Kirkwood, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/KI3621?guid=30203846,30203847,30203848,30701866,30203849,30702117,30203850,30203851,30703026,302038… 770/853
PURPOSE
To establish a uniform policy for reimbursing City employees for travel and related expenses incurred
while conducting City business.
TERMS
"Expenses" shall refer only to expenses actually and necessarily incurred in the performance of the
official business of the City.
"Employee" shall include all persons employed by the City and all elected and appointed officials of
the City.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The Assistant Chief Administrative Officer shall be responsible for promulgating any further rules and
regulations regarding the Travel Policy. Further, the Assistant Chief Administrative Officer shall
provide all departments with uniform travel and expense forms.
Any employee incurring any expense as defined herein and seeking reimbursement of same shall
submit to the Director of Finance a voucher of such expenses which has been certified as being true
and accurate. The Director of Finance shall then review such expense vouchers and shall reimburse
the employee only for those expenses which have been properly incurred.
Each Department Head is also responsible for ensuring that expenses incurred for travel and other
activities by employees under his or her supervision are essential to their functions and expenses are
reasonable and justified. In order to maintain cost control, the Department Head shall:
1. Approve in advance each proposed trip or activity.
2. Obtain the approval of the Chief Administrative Officer for all out-of-town travel and training.
3. Review and approve all expenses reported for reimbursement in accordance with the specific
provisions outlined below.
4. Review and evaluate these expenses as a guide for future authorization.
The City reserves the right to perform an in-depth audit of any expenses submitted by an employee
for reimbursement. The Finance Department has the responsibility for performing such audits from
time to time. Any findings of misrepresentation will be forwarded to the Department Head for
appropriate action. It is the responsibility of the Director of Finance or his or her designee to:
1. Ensure full compliance by all departments with the procedures set forth in this Policy.
2. Have all expense reports reviewed for mathematical accuracy, required receipts, and
authorized approval.
3. Review reported expenses for reasonableness and to make inquiries as deemed appropriate.
4. Return all expense reports that are not in compliance with this Policy or that require additional
substantiation to the responsible Department Head for appropriate action/response.
Employees are required to submit expense reports within ten (10) days of the completion of any
business trip or activity.
TRANSPORTATION
Selection of the mode of transportation should be based on the distance, costs, time involved, and
the purpose of the trip. Whenever the airfare (coach or economy) would be less than the mileage
reimbursement for use of a personal vehicle, air transportation must be used. Air transportation
expenses must be supported by documentation which reflects the destination, dates of travel, and
cost.
On occasion, the employee may wish to drive a vehicle to his or her destination. The City has City
owned vehicles that may be used, or an employee may take advantage of an agreement the City has
with a rental car company. If the employee wishes to use his or her personal vehicle in lieu of air
transportation, City vehicle or rental vehicle, the employee will only receive the "cash equivalent" for
use of his or her personal vehicle; the "cash equivalent" will be based on the lowest cost of either the
lowest airfare in effect thirty (30) days prior to the employee's departure date, or the cost of the rental
vehicle for the number of days the employee is involved on City business. Generally, a rental vehicle
will be cheaper than mileage reimbursement for any trip involving more than seventy (70) miles of
travel per day. If the employee elects to use his or her personal vehicle or a rental vehicle when air

transportation is more cost effective, driving time will be the responsibility of the employee (i.e.,
vacation time).
The use of buses, limousines, or taxis should be governed by the local ground transportation
available between the airport and the hotel/motel and the most economical cost and/or availability;
receipts should be obtained for these charges. Tips for taxi drivers, baggage handlers, etc., should be
reported separately.
LODGING
It is expected that all employees will endeavor to return to their permanent residence as soon as
possible after the conclusion of the conference, business meeting, or other purposes of the trip. On
one-day trips or at the conclusion of an extended trip, lodging will be reimbursed only in connection
with travel which would preclude the employee from arriving home before 10:00 P.M.
The City expects its employees to stay in a hotel/motel which is reasonably close and convenient to
the place where the conference, business meeting, or seminar is held and that such accommodations
will be modestly priced for the local market. To the extent possible, lodging costs should be paid
directly to the vendor by using a City procurement card. Lodging costs will be based at the "one
person, one bed" rate. Receipts for lodging costs must be submitted to substantiate the cost.
MEALS
The cost of all meals while away on City business will be reimbursed. In most situations, the
maximum daily cost should not exceed sixty-five dollars ($65.00). It is expected that employees will
exercise good judgment when dining and such meals should generally meet the same standards as if
the employee were bearing the cost. All meal costs must be supported by receipts.
On all travel beyond the local area (i.e., greater than a fifty-mile radius from Kirkwood) reimbursement
will be made on meals on the following basis:
1. When travel commences before 7:00 A.M., breakfast will be reimbursed.
2. When travel extends over the period 12:00 Noon to 1:30 P.M., lunch will be reimbursed.
3. When travel extends after 6:00 P.M., dinner will be reimbursed.
No reimbursement will be made for meals which are provided in conjunction with air transportation or
which are included in the conference/meeting cost.
The cost of snacks, beverages, etc., are not eligible for reimbursement.
As deemed appropriate by the Department Head, meal costs for local training may be eligible for
reimbursement. The appropriateness and reasonableness of the expense will be reviewed by the
Director of Finance.
REGISTRATION COSTS
Conference registration costs will be paid directly to the sponsoring institution; the request for
payment submitted to the Finance Department should include a copy of the completed registration
form.
TRAVEL ADVANCES
Travel advances should be limited to those items which cannot be pre-paid, such as meal costs and
transportation costs, and for projected expenses which would pose a financial burden on the
employee. Requests for travel advances must be submitted to the Finance Department at least two
(2) weeks prior to the employee's departure date. The Director of Finance may then advance
payment of projected expenses if the projected expenses to be incurred by particular employees
would pose a financial burden on such employees. If such advance is authorized, then the voucher
for the expenses actually and necessarily incurred and the balance of the advance remaining after
the expenditures shall be submitted to the Director of Finance within ten (10) days after such
expenses are actually incurred.
COMMUNICATION CHARGES
All telephone, internet and postage costs incurred during the travel which are necessary for City
purposes are reimbursable. The employee should use the most economical means of
communication.
PERSONAL ITEMS

No reimbursement will be made for miscellaneous reading material, shoe shines, or items relating to
personal hygiene. The cost of handling any clothes or equipment carried by an employee for personal
enjoyment or activities are not reimbursable. Repairs to personal briefcases and luggage will not be
reimbursed unless damaged when being used on City business and when the employee is not repaid
by the carrier responsible for the damage. A copy of the damage claim and a copy of the refusal to
reimburse for such claim must be submitted.

mileage reimbursement in an amount set by the Finance Director. Use of a personal vehicle for trips
out of the Metropolitan St. Louis area or overnight will be governed by the City's Travel Policy.
It is the employee's responsibility to pay for gas, insurance and maintenance of his or her personal
vehicle. It is further the employee's responsibility to disclose to his or her insurer the uses to which he
or she chooses to put his or her vehicle which may affect his or her coverage. Except as may be

https://ecode360.com/print/KI3621?guid=30203846,30203847,30203848,30701866,30203849,30702117,30203850,30203851,30703026,302038… 774/853
§ E-2600. Wireless Telecommunications Policy.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
The City may provide wireless telecommunications equipment to employees who as part of their
employment have a regular and continuing business need for its use. Such wireless
telecommunications equipment may include cellular telephones, pagers and PDA's. Employees may
be assigned wireless telecommunication equipment by a Department Head when their duties are
determined to require frequent mobility but be readily accessible and/or when their duties require them
to be available for emergency responses or consultation after normal business hours. Assignment of
wireless telecommunication equipment to an employee may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion
of the CAO or Department Head.
Wireless telecommunication equipment should be obtained through the Purchasing Department. Only
the Purchasing Department has the authority to enter into contracts for service. Department Heads
should work with the Purchasing Director to determine the type of equipment that best suits the need,
identify the appropriate service vendor, and take advantage of the most cost effective service contract
and features. Typically, wireless telecommunication providers are offering contracts that permit calls
under certain circumstances to be made at no additional charge. Employees should remain aware of
the terms of their contract so as to take advantage of no cost calling opportunities rather than calling
with land line charges. Contracts may also place a maximum on the number of minutes that can be
used without incurring additional costs. The service level should be set based solely on business
needs and the employee must reimburse the City for any personal use that results in additional
charges.
Personal use of City assigned wireless telecommunication equipment is permitted. During normal
business hours personal use should be subject to the same limitations as that of a land line. Such
calls, emails or texts should be infrequent and brief and made on the employee's own time, such as
during breaks or lunch. Any other personal use during business hours may not interfere with being
productive or performing expected job duties. Personal use outside of normal business hours is
permitted so long as the employee reimburses the City for any additional charges incurred.
Employee communication via City-issued wireless telecommunication equipment at all times cannot be
considered private. No employee shall have any expectation of privacy in the use of the equipment and
no employee shall use the equipment for any type of communication that is offensive, illegal,
inappropriate, or in violation of any City or departmental policy.
Employees may be financially responsible for assigned wireless telecommunication equipment if the
equipment is lost or damaged as a result of the employee's negligence or not returned within a
specified period of time.
Wireless telecommunications equipment use should not occur while driving a City vehicle unless it is
an emergency. This does not apply to employees whose job responsibilities include being in contact
with dispatch. Where possible, employees should send or receive communications when the vehicle is
not in motion. Telecommunications equipment features such as pre-programming numbers, speed dial
functions, and voice mail should be set up. Under no circumstances shall any employee while driving a
City vehicle review any text message or create or send any text message when a vehicle is in motion.
Departments may restrict employee owned wireless telecommunications equipment during the work
day and ban them from job sites. Departments may develop additional wireless telecommunications
equipment policies and procedures for City assigned equipment to meet specific departmental needs.
Employees whose job responsibilities may require them to be contacted after hours in emergency
situations should supply the City with contact information, including the numbers of any wireless
telecommunications devices they might regularly carry. Such information should not be considered to
make the employee "on call" or result in additional compensation outside of what may be required
under State or Federal law.
Article XXVII. Computer/Internet/E-Mail/Text Policy
3/5/2020 City of Kirkwood, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/KI3621?guid=30203846,30203847,30203848,30701866,30203849,30702117,30203850,30203851,30703026,302038… 775/853
§ E-2700. Computer/Internet/E-Mail/Text Policy.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
APPLICABILITY
The computer system, network, Internet and E-mail access is the backbone of City operations and as
such is an expensive infrastructure that needs to be monitored and protected. This Policy applies to all
employees and any other individuals who are provided access to the City's computer system. Third
parties should only be provided access to the computer system as necessary for their business
purpose with the City and only if they abide by all applicable rules.
COMPUTERS
The hardware and software that make up the City's computer system and all data on the system is the
property of the City of Kirkwood. All data, including electronic messages within the system, is the
property of the City and may be public records for the purpose of retention or accessible via Missouri's
Sunshine Law and Public Records Law. The City purchases, owns, and administers the necessary
software and licenses and employees may not rent, copy or loan the software, or its documentation.
Computers may not be relocated to another office without the permission of the MIS Department.
Employees may not bring in any personal computer or other device including MP3 players to connect
to the system without the permission of the MIS Department.
Even the most innocuous games, screen savers, and popular software have the capability of
unknowingly introducing spyware, viruses, and backdoor access to our system. As a result, no
software, applications, or modifications may be downloaded or made to City-owned equipment. The
MIS Department may approve screen savers upon request. No instant messaging software may be
downloaded and streaming audio (using the computer to listen to the radio) is prohibited unless
authorized by the CAO as it reduces available bandwidth.
Employees should have no expectation of privacy in their use of any City-owned equipment or
computer system. The City may at any time monitor, retrieve or recreate any files, calendars or
computer communications of any employee. Employees should expect that their activities on computer
devices or telephone devices can be reviewed at any time.
Employees who leave employment with the City have no property rights to contents of their E-mail
messages or computer files. Supervisors or managers may access an employee's computer system
and E-mail at any time.
E-MAIL/TEXTS
The E-mail system is provided by the City for the purpose of internal and external business related
communication. The system and all electronic messages within the system are the property of the City
of Kirkwood. Texts sent through City provided cell phones are also the property of the City of Kirkwood
and employees should have no expectation of privacy regarding such messages.
E-MAIL/TEXT ETIQUETTE
Employees should be aware that while E-mail and texting is a quick and convenient method of
communication, once sent the E-mail/text can be viewed potentially by the public so sending or
forwarding of E-mail/text messages should be carefully considered for appropriateness and good
judgment. Humor is often contextual and augmented by body language and so E-mail/texts may not be
the most appropriate method of transmission. Electronic discussion of topics internally that begin to
become controversial or involve significant differences of opinion should be discontinued in favor of
face-to-face discussion.
With over two hundred (200) internal users of the E-mail system employees receive frequent E-mails.
The system offers the availability of addressing all users with a group address entitled all-users. No
employee is permitted to use the all-users email address without prior approval by the Department
Head. Such approval shall be granted only when strictly necessary to conduct City business.
PROHIBITED USES OF E-MAIL/TEXTS
3/5/2020 City of Kirkwood, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/KI3621?guid=30203846,30203847,30203848,30701866,30203849,30702117,30203850,30203851,30703026,302038… 776/853
The following E-mail/text uses including sending or forwarding communications are expressly
prohibited:
• Communications that are disruptive, offensive, abusive, threatening or exceed the bounds of
generally accepted standards of good taste and ethics.
• Communications of sexually explicit images or messages.
• Communications that contain anything that might be reasonably construed as harassment or
disparagement of others based on race, national origin, color, pregnancy, ethnicity, sex, sexual
orientation, age, ancestry, disability or religious beliefs (except as may be specifically required
as part of police reporting procedures including the statements of other parties).
• Solicitation for commercial ventures, religious or political causes.
• Any other use that may harm or compromise the integrity of the City or be otherwise
inappropriate to the City's organizational philosophy.
• Intercepting, eavesdropping, recording, or altering another person's E-mail/text message
without authority.
• Attempting to send E-mail/texts anonymously or adopting the identity of another person on
any E-mail/text message, or using another person's login, other than with permission.
• Sending, downloading, or using information or software in violation of copyright law.
• Engaging in personal commercial activities including offering services or merchandise for sale.
• Engaging in any E-mail/text activity that would create liability for the City of Kirkwood.
RETENTION
Depending on the content of an E-mail message, it may be considered a formal record and should be
retained pursuant to a departmental, City, or Missouri record retention schedule. Accordingly, E-mail
messages should be written with care with the understanding they may be public records. Employees
should be aware that when they have deleted a message from their workstation mailbox it may not
have been deleted from the server. The message may be residing in the recipient's mailbox or
forwarded to other recipients. Unless there is a reason for archiving or retaining an E-mail, employees
should delete sent and received messages regularly as accumulation of files will degrade system
performance and response times. Employees and departments are responsible for retaining and
archiving their own documents, E-mails and other records and should not rely on system back-ups as
an appropriate retention method. Since space is limited and costly, employees should not be retaining
personal E-mails, documents, spreadsheets, or photos on the system.
INTERNET
Access to the Internet is provided for work related information gathering and communication.
PROHIBITED INTERNET USAGE
Accessing sites that are pornographic or sites that promulgate violence or terrorism (also commonly
known as "hate" sites), or sites that allow gambling are inappropriate and expressly prohibited using
City-owned equipment (except in the course of law enforcement purposes).
PERSONAL USE
The City recognizes that occasional personal use of computer equipment, cell phones, E-mail and
Internet is desirable to employees and overly tight restrictions are detrimental to morale and
unproductive to enforce. Such use should generally be limited to lunch and outside of (before or after)
work time and only if the equipment is not needed for City business. Employees should consider the
personal use of City E-mail privileges in the same manner as use of a City telephone or personal cell
phone. Limited personal use is expected to occur but should not interfere with being productive or
performing expected job duties. Prohibited uses of E-mail and Internet browsing are violations
regardless of whether they occur during work time, non-work time or during occasional personal use
and are subject to discipline up to and including termination. All uses of City equipment, whether
business or occasional personal use, are subject to monitoring. Excessive personal use will be
subject to discipline. Employees should address questions on what constitutes excessive personal
use to their department heads.
IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY
3/5/2020 City of Kirkwood, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/KI3621?guid=30203846,30203847,30203848,30701866,30203849,30702117,30203850,30203851,30703026,302038… 777/853
It is the responsibility of each individual employee to understand and comply with this Policy. To
ensure the safety and uncompromised integrity of the system employees have the responsibility for
reporting inappropriate use or activities to their supervisor. Department Heads are responsible for
ensuring compliance with the policy within their departments.
Upon hire the Personnel Department will be responsible for distributing this Policy as part of the
Employee Rules and Regulations and obtaining the appropriate acknowledgment of receipt. The MIS
Department will provide training on how to access the system. Training on specific applications is
regularly available and Department Heads and employees should arrange opportunities for taking
advantage of those sessions. Employees with E-mail access should at minimum take the introductory
course for GroupWise and be competent in its basic use, archiving, and use of the scheduling and
calendar function.
Article XXVIII. Conflict Of Interest
§ E-2800. Conflict Of Interest.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
All employees of the City must avoid any conflicts of interest in performing their duties and abide by the
conflict of interest restrictions set forth in the City's Charter and Code of Ordinances. Copies of any
such restrictions may be obtained by contacting the Assistant Chief Administrative Officer.
Article XXIX. Unauthorized Alien Policy
§ E-2900. Unauthorized Alien Policy.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
The City will not knowingly employ, hire for employment, or continue to employ an unauthorized alien
to perform work within the State of Missouri. "Unauthorized alien" means an alien who does not have
the legal right or authorization under Federal law to work in the United States, as defined in 8 U.S.C.
Section 1324a(h)(3).
Article XXX. City Property
§ E-3000. City Property.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]

inspection. This includes, but is not limited to, City vehicles, offices, work stations, desks and lockers.
No employee shall have any expectation of privacy with respect to such property and the City reserves
the right at any time to search or inspect any such property. No expectation of privacy exists regarding

Overview. With the rise of new media and next generation communication tools, the manner in
which employees of the City can communicate, both internally and externally, continues to evolve.
While this creates new opportunities for communication and collaboration, it also creates new
responsibilities for our employees. This Social Media Policy applies to all employees who use the
following (which is not intended to be an exhaustive list):
• Social networking websites, examples of which include MySpace, Facebook, LinkedIn,
Twitter and YouTube;
• Blogs;
• Instant messaging sites;
• Wikis, such as Wikipedia and any other site where text can be posted;
• Web bulletin boards or chat rooms.
All of these activities are referred to as "Social Media Postings" in this Policy.
Scope Of Policy. This Social Media Policy covers an employee's personal use of Social Media
Postings and the sanctioned use of Social Media Postings for City business purposes.
Personal Use Of Social Media.
This Policy Section applies when an employee is using personal/home computers or other
personal devices. The City takes no position on employees' decision to participate in the use
of Social Media Postings. In general, employees who participate in Social Media are free to
publish their own personal information. Any use of City computers or other City issued
devices for personal Social Media Postings should generally be limited to lunch and outside
(before or after) work time and only if the equipment is not needed for City business. Limited
personal use is expected to occur but should not interfere with being productive or performing
expected job duties.
Responsible Social Media Postings. Ultimately, an employee is responsible for what is posted
online. Before creating online content, an employee should consider the risks and rewards
that are involved, including how Social Media Postings may affect others who perform
services for or are employed with the City. Harassment, intimidation or demeaning comments
against such persons on social networking sites may result in discipline up to and including
dismissal. Thus, the City encourages an employee to always be fair and courteous to coworkers,
citizens, suppliers, vendors or other people who work on behalf of the City. Also, an
employee should keep in mind that he or she is more likely to resolve work-related complaints
by speaking directly with co-workers or by addressing the issue or problem with the
Department Head than by posting complaints to a social media outlet. Nevertheless, if an
employee decides to post complaints or criticism, he or she should avoid using statements,
photographs, video or audio that reasonably could be viewed as malicious, obscene,
threatening or intimidating, that disparages guests, co-workers, citizens, suppliers or vendors,
that might constitute harassment or bullying or might violate any applicable law. Examples of
such conduct include offensive posts meant to intentionally harm someone's reputation or
posts that could contribute to a hostile work environment on the basis of race, sex, disability,
age, national origin, ethnicity, pregnancy, religion or any other status protected by law or City
policy.
Identification. If an employee chooses to identify himself or herself as a City employee on any
Social Media network or site, either in words or in image, he or she must state in clear terms
within any specific social media posting that the views expressed are the employee's alone
and that they do not reflect the views of the City. No personal use of social media shall
include any pictures or photographs of the employee wearing any City uniform or operating
any City equipment. Employees are prohibited from acting as a spokesperson for the City or
posting comments as a representative of the City.

Honesty And Accuracy. An employee should ensure that he or she is always honest and
accurate when posting information or news. If an employee makes a mistake, it should be
corrected quickly. An employee should be open about any previous posts that have been
altered. It is important to remember that the Internet archives almost everything; therefore,
even deleted postings can be searched. Never post any information or rumors that are known
to be false about the City, co-workers, vendors or others working on behalf of the City. In
short, the City expects its employees, when commenting on matters related to the City's
business, services or programs, to exercise good judgment and common sense, consistent
with the City's values of honesty, integrity and ethical behavior. Each employee should be
mindful that any Social Media Posting may remain public for a long time if not indefinitely.
Right To Access. The City reserves the right to monitor Social Media Postings of employees.
Any information that employees post on any social media may be accessed by the City at any
time, without prior notice. The City prohibits taking negative employment action against any
employee for reporting a possible deviation from this Policy or for cooperating in an
investigation. Any employee who retaliates against a co-worker for reporting a possible
deviation from this Policy or for cooperating in an investigation will be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
Prohibited Activity. Employees may not disclose confidential information of any department,
specifically including confidential information relating to ongoing investigations, or disclose
confidential information of third parties who have provided information to any department,
including Federal, State or local security/safety information, or disclose private personnel
information or Protected Health Information as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA").
Use Of Social Media For City Business Purposes.
Social Media Uses. Social Media provides a new and potentially valuable means of assisting
City departments and their personnel in community outreach for problem solving,
investigations, crime prevention, recruiting, training, safety education and providing public
awareness of the activities of City personnel in serving and protecting the interests of the
City's residents and community.
Specific uses for City sanctioned Social Media include but are not limited to:
Time sensitive notifications related to road closures, special events and weather
emergencies.
Investigative tool for law enforcement when seeking evidence or information about
missing persons, wanted persons, crimes perpetrated online such as cyber bullying or
cyber stalking, unsolved crimes through solicitation of tips and posting of photos or
videos of a crime by a participant or observer.
Alerting the public to the effective law enforcement services of the police department and
the effective rescue and fire protection services provided by the City's Fire Department.
Obtaining information as a recruitment mechanism for persons seeking employment or
volunteer positions with the City.
Rules Applicable To City Sanctioned Use Of Social Media.
All Social Media Postings are subject to all existing City policies, including, for example,
the City's Equal Employment Opportunity, Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment
Policy, Workplace Violence Policy, Computer/Internet/E-mail/Text Policy and Wireless
Telecommunications Usage Policy.
Social Media Postings containing obscene or sexually explicit language, images or acts
and statements or other forms of speech that ridicule, malign, disparage or otherwise

views or positions of any department, without express authorization to do so.
No information shall be disclosed which is likely to identify the specific location or
identification of any person subject to an emergency call for law enforcement assistance.
No employee shall disseminate or transmit in any fashion photographs or images of
individuals receiving emergency medical assistance. The City is the owner of any
photographs or electronic images taken by the Fire Department or law enforcement
personnel within the scope of employment. Any such photographs or electronic images
must be turned into the proper department authority.
The use of social media does not alter or change the emergency or life safety report
protocols currently in place. Social Media should not be used in place of the Emergency
Operations Center (9-1-1).
The establishment and use of any City-sanctioned Social Media sites are subject to
approval by the Chief Administrative Officer and applicable Department Head. All City
Social Media sites shall be administered by authorized administrators of the respective
department.
City Social Media sites should explicitly state they are maintained by the City and that
they follow the City's Social Media Policy, with links to such Policy on the official City web
site.
Wherever possible, City Social Media sites should link back to the official City and
departmental websites for forms, documents, online services and other information
necessary to conduct business with the City.
The authorized administrators will monitor content on City Social Media sites to ensure
adherence to both the City's Social Media Policy and the interests and goals of the City.
The City reserves the right to restrict or remove any content that is deemed in violation of
this Social Media Policy or any applicable law. Comments on topics or issues not
considered to be within the relevant concerns of the City may be removed.
The City will approach the use of Social Medial tools as consistently as possible among
different departments.

Article XXXII. Fraud And Whistle-Blower Policy
§ E-3200. Scope Of Policy.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
All employees of the City must observe high standards of business and personal ethics performing
their duties and responsibilities and fraud in any form will not be tolerated. This Policy is designed to
enable all employees of the City to raise any complaint of unethical, fraudulent or unlawful conduct in
an appropriate manner and to protect any employee of the City raising such a good faith complaint
from any retaliatory action.

Regulations, such as under the City's Equal Employment Opportunity, Anti-Harassment and Non-
Discrimination Policy, Workplace Violence Policy or Policy Regarding Reasonable Accommodations
for Qualified Individuals with a Disability.
§ E-3210. Employee Protection.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
This Policy is designed to offer protection to any employee who discloses a complaint, provided the
disclosure is made in good faith. It is a violation of this Policy for any supervisor, manager, department
head or other employee of the City to retaliate against any City employee who makes a complaint
pursuant to this Policy. Prohibited retaliation against any employee "whistle-blower" under this Policy
includes disciplining, demoting or suspending the employee or threatening to do so, terminating or
threatening to terminate the employee or in any other manner intimidating the employee as a form of
retaliation for any complaint made pursuant to this Policy. Any City employee engaging in retaliatory
conduct will be subject to disciplinary action by the City, which may include termination of employment.
§ E-3220. Confidentiality.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
The City will treat all good faith complaints under this Policy in a confidential and sensitive manner to
the extent feasible consistent with the City's obligation to fully investigate any complaint filed or made
under this Policy. A report of a complaint will only be disclosed to those persons who have a need to
know and in order to properly conduct an investigation of the complaint. Any report or complaint shall
be kept in a file that is separate from the personnel file of the employee making the complaint and the
person or persons to whom it relates, although any disciplinary action that may be issued due to a
complaint under this Policy shall be part of the personnel file of the disciplined employee.
§ E-3230. Procedure For Making A Complaint And Investigation.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
Any complaint by a City employee pursuant to this Policy must be made, in writing, to the Assistant
Chief Administrative Officer, the Chief Administrative Officer or the Audit Committee of the City, with all
factual details supporting any such complaint. The complaint should be made immediately upon
discovery of any facts showing unethical, fraudulent or unlawful conduct as described in this Policy.
Any employee may also submit a complaint anonymously under this Policy. The City's Chief
Administrative Officer, Assistant Chief Administrative Officer and/or the City's Audit Committee shall be
responsible for investigating any such complaint. The City's Chief Administrative Officer shall
determine who shall investigate any such complaint depending upon the nature of the complaint,
unless the complaint is against the City's Chief Administrative Officer, in which event the City's Audit
Committee shall investigate any such complaint. Any such complaint shall be investigated in
consultation with legal counsel or other expert resources deemed necessary to conduct a full and

complete investigation of the allegations of such complaint, and making decisions for appropriate
corrective action, as applicable, to be implemented. The investigative action by the Chief
Administrative Officer, Assistant Chief Administrative Officer or Audit Committee may include referral
fully or in part to a law enforcement agency or City law enforcement personnel for appropriate
investigation of any suspected criminal activity. Unless the employee has submitted or made a
complaint anonymously under this Policy, the complainant will be informed of the final outcome of the
City's investigation as deemed appropriate under the circumstances.
§ E-3240. Effect Of Unsubstantiated Allegations.
[Ord. No. 10516, 9-20-2018]
If an employee makes an allegation in good faith under this Policy, which is not substantiated or
confirmed by a subsequent investigation, no action will be taken against the individual making the
complaint. However, if an employee makes a complaint maliciously without any reasonable factual
foundation against another employee of the City, the employee making such complaint may be subject
to discipline by the City as deemed appropriate.

hereof.

COMPENSATION —
The total of all remuneration paid by the City to an employee during the period he or she is a

lump sum payment of workers' compensation. "Compensation" shall include salary, bonuses,
wages overtime payments, or other regular remuneration, educational incentive pay, all

employment of an employee or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of
severance from employment of the employee shall be treated as compensation to the extent

such amounts are compensation for services rendered that would have been paid absent a
severance from employment, payments of accrued vacation or other leave the employee
would have been able to use if employment had continued, or payments of unfunded
nonqualified compensation that would have been paid at the same time if the employee had
continued in employment.

under the plan for any plan year shall not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for increases in the
cost-of-living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the code. The cost-of-living
adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any determination period beginning in such
calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual
compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short
determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If compensation for any prior
determination period is taken into account in determining a participant's allocations for the
current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the
applicable annual compensation limit in effect for the prior period. Effective January 1, 2009,
compensation shall not include differential wage payments.

shall be derived from such revenue sources as the City Council shall determine, from income and
capital appreciation derived therefrom and from any property given or donated to it from any
source. The Board may accept, on behalf of the fund, gifts, grants, devises or bequests of

The Board shall establish and maintain or shall cause to be established and maintained a
current account in the name of each participant, former participant and beneficiary. Each
participant's pro rata share of the City contributions shall be credited to his or her current
account. Such records are primarily for accounting purposes and do not require a segregation
of fund assets to each such account.
The Board shall establish and maintain or shall cause to be established and maintained a
retirement plan account in the name of each participant in the plan. The retirement plan
account shall consist of the following:
The actuarial equivalent of the participant's earned benefit (as defined in the applicable
prior plan) under the applicable prior plan, unless the participant elected to have an
annuity purchased with the actuarial equivalent of his or her earned benefit under the
prior plan; plus
The participant's mandatory contributions to the applicable prior plan and earnings

a vested deferred benefit under the applicable prior plan and whose benefit has not
commenced under the applicable prior plan, which such retirement plan account shall
consist only of an annuity purchased with the actuarial equivalent of his or her earned
benefit under such prior plan. For purposes of this § F-106, "actuarial equivalent" means

Each participant shall be 100% vested at all times in the amount credited to and any
annuity held in his or her retirement plan account.
Allocation to current account. As of the day the City shall make a contribution, the Board shall
credit the amount of such contribution made on behalf of each participant pursuant to § F-105(a),
to the current account of each such participant.
Limitation on annual additions.
If a participant does not participate in and has never participated in another qualified plan
[within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the code], a welfare benefit fund [as defined in
Section 419(e) of the code], an individual medical account [as defined in Section 415(1)(2) of
the code], or a simplified employee pension [as defined in Section 408(k) of the code]
maintained by the employer, the annual additions, as defined in § F-106(d)(4), which may be
credited to the participant's current account for any limitation year will not exceed the lesser of
the maximum permissible amount or any other limitation contained in the plan. If the
contributions that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the participant's current
account would cause the annual additions for the limitation year to exceed the maximum
permissible amount, the amount contributed or allocated will be reduced so that the annual
additions for the limitation year will equal the maximum permissible amount.
This section applies if, in addition to the plan, the participant is covered under another
qualified defined contribution plan, a welfare benefit fund, an individual medical account, or a
simplified employee pension maintained by the employer. The annual additions which may be
credited to a participant's current account under the plan for any limitation year will not
exceed the maximum permissible amount reduced by the annual additions credited to a
participant's accounts under the other qualified defined contribution plans, welfare benefit
funds, individual medical accounts, or simplified employee pensions for the same limitation
year. If the annual additions with respect to the participant under other qualified defined
contribution plans, welfare benefit funds, individual medical accounts, and simplified
employee pensions maintained by the employer are less than the maximum permissible
amount and the contributions that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the
participant's current account under this plan would cause the annual additions for the
limitation year to exceed this limitation, the amount contributed or allocated will be reduced so
that the annual additions under all such plans and funds for the limitation year will equal the
maximum permissible amount. If the annual additions with respect to the participant under
such other qualified defined contribution plans, welfare benefit funds, individual medical
accounts, and simplified employee pensions in the aggregate are equal to or greater than the
maximum permissible amount, no amount will be contributed or allocated to the participant's
current account under this plan for the limitation year.
Excess annual additions shall be corrected in accordance with the principles set forth in the
Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System.

on a uniform and consistent basis with respect to all similarly situated employees
and no compensation is included in more than one limitation year.
Compensation for a limitation year shall also include compensation paid by the later
of 2 1/2 months after a participant's severance from employment with the employer
maintaining the plan or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the
participant's severance from employment with the employer maintaining the plan, if
the payment is regular compensation for services during the participant's regular
working hours, or compensation for services outside the participant's regular working

after severance from employment, even if they are paid by the later of 2 1/2 months
after the date of severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that
includes the date of severance from employment, except compensation paid to a
participant who is permanently and totally disabled, as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of
the code, provided salary continuation applies to all participants who are

was not a highly compensated employee, as defined in Section 414(q) of the code,
immediately before becoming disabled.
Back pay, within the meaning of Section 1.415(c)-2(q)(8) of Treasury Regulations,
shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates
to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise

LIMITATION YEAR
The plan year. All qualified plans maintained by the employer must use the same
limitation year. If the limitation year is amended to a different twelve-consecutive-month
period, the new limitation year must begin on a date within the limitation year in which the
amendment is made.
MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE AMOUNT
Except for catch-up contributions described in Code Section 414(v), the annual
addition that may be contributed or allocated to a participant's current account under
the plan for any limitation year shall not exceed the lesser of:
Forty thousand dollars, as adjusted for increases in the cost-of-living under
Section 415(d) of the code, or

The compensation limit referred to herein shall not apply to any contribution for
medical benefits after separation from service [within the meaning of Section 401(h)
or Section 419A(f)(2) of the code] which is otherwise treated as an annual addition.
If a short limitation year is created because of an amendment changing the limitation
year to a different twelve-consecutive-month period, the maximum permissible
amount will not exceed the defined contribution dollar limitation multiplied by the
following fraction:
Number of months in the short limitation year

maximum permissible amount shall be determined and shall be prorated for the
resulting short limitation year.
Adjustment to accounts. With respect to each investment fund established under § F-111(d), on a
daily basis the then net credit balance in the current accounts of each participant, former
participant and beneficiary, shall be adjusted upward or downward, as the case may be, in the
same proportion that the total amount of the then net credit balance in each such current accounts
invested in the investment fund bears to the total amount of the then net credit balances in the
current accounts of all participants, former participants and beneficiaries invested in the
investment fund, so that the total of the then net credit balances in the current accounts of all
participants, former participants and beneficiaries invested in the investment fund, as so adjusted,
will equal the value of the investment fund as of such date less, however, the City contribution for
such plan year and the amount of any suspense account established in accordance with § F-
106(d). In determining credit balances in current accounts of participants, former participants and
beneficiaries, the determination shall be made prior to the allocations of the City contribution
provided for in § F-106(c).

such value to the City Council and participants, in writing, on a quarterly basis. In making such,
determination, the Board of Trustees shall value the assets of the fund, other than the amount of any
suspense account established in accordance with § F-106(d), at their current fair market value as of
such valuation date, with all accrued income, and shall deduct all accrued expenses and other
amounts properly chargeable to the fund. Such valuation shall include any contribution made by the

retirement shall be distributable to such participant until his or her actual retirement. A participant's
right to the amount credited to his or her account shall be 100% vested and nonforfeitable upon
attaining his or her retirement date.
Retirement. Upon retirement at his or her retirement date, a participant shall be entitled to receive
and there shall be distributed to him or her as provided in § F-108(f), a benefit in an amount equal

any, shall have been made.
Permanent disability.
Amount. Upon the termination of a participant's active employment with the City because of
permanent disability or upon the Board's determination that a participant, during his or her

she remained a participant, incurred permanent disability [herein in this § F-108(c) referred to
as "the date of permanent disability"], such participant shall be entitled to receive a benefit in
an amount equal to the total of the vested portion of the net credit balance in his or her
account as of the date of his or her termination of employment, which balance shall be
computed after all adjustments and allocations, if any are required as of such date, if any,
shall have been made.
Date of termination of employment. For purposes of this § F-108(c) only, "date of his or her
termination of employment" means the earlier of the date a participant who is permanently
disabled attains age 65, the date a participant ceases to be entitled to benefits under the
City's long-term disability program, the date of the participant's death, or the date of the
written election of the participant to receive all or a portion of his or her benefit. A disabled

Contributions during disability. In the case of a participant who is receiving benefits under the
City's long-term disability program, the City shall continue to make contributions to the plan,
as required by § F-105(a), on behalf of such participant based on the compensation the
participant would have received for the plan year if the participant was paid at the rate of
compensation on the date of permanent disability, which contributions shall continue until the
earlier of the date the permanently disabled participant attains age 65, the date the participant
ceases to be entitled to benefits under the City's long-term disability program, the date of the

years of vesting service.
Form of benefit. The participant's benefit under this § F-108(c) shall be payable in the form

provisions of § F-104), and upon the Board being furnished with evidence satisfactory to it of such
participant's death, the participant's designated beneficiary shall be entitled to receive, and there
shall be distributed to him or her, as provided in § F-108(f) and (g), a benefit in an amount equal to
the total of the net credit balance in his or her account, as of the date of his or her death, which
balance shall be computed after all adjustments and allocations required as of such date, if any,
shall have been made.
Upon the death of a former participant prior to receipt of some or all of his or her benefits
hereunder, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such undistributed benefits shall be paid
to the beneficiary of such deceased former participant as provided in § F-108(f) and (g).
Termination for other reasons. A participant, whose active employment terminates prior to
retirement (for reasons other than death or permanent disability) and who shall not be in the
employment of the City as of the last day of the plan year in which such termination occurs, shall
be entitled to receive and there shall be distributed to him or her, as provided in § F-108(f), a
benefit in an amount equal to the sum of the net credit balance in his or her retirement plan
account, the net credit balance in his or her mandatory contributions account, if any, transferred to
this plan from the City's Police Officers' and Firefighters' Pension Plan, the net credit balance in
his or her rollover account, and the net credit balance in his or her current account as of the date
of his or her termination of employment; less, however, in either case, the applicable percentage
of the net credit balance of his or her current account set forth in the following schedule based
upon the number of his or her years of vesting service with the City as of the date of his or her
termination of active employment with the City:
Number of Years of Vesting Service Percentage of Amounts Not Vested
Less than 5 100
5 or more 0
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participant shall be 100% vested when he or she attains 60
years of age. The net credit balance in the current account of a participant referred to in this § F-
108(e) shall be determined after all adjustments and allocations required as of the date of the
determination of the net credit balance in his or her current account shall have been made.
The amount, if any, of the net credit balance in his or her current account to which a terminated
participant referred to in this § F-108(e) is not entitled in accordance with the above schedule
shall be forfeited at the time his or her benefit commences. For purposes of this § F-108(e), a
participant who is 0% vested in his or her benefit is deemed to have received a distribution of his
or her vested benefit and the nonvested portion of his or her benefit is forfeited. The City
contribution for such plan year shall be reduced by the amount of such forfeiture and said
amount shall be treated as part of the City contribution for such plan year in which such forfeiture
occurs. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, in the event such participant again becomes an
employee of the City, but before he or she has five consecutive breaks in service, the amount he
or she forfeited shall be restored and credited to his or her current account. Such restoration

shall first be derived from forfeitures of other participants occurring in the plan year in which such
restoration is made and to the extent such amount is not derived from said forfeitures, it shall be
restored from City contributions. The term "break in service" means a continuous period of 12
consecutive months during which the employee is not employed by the City, commencing on the
date the employee terminates under this § F-108(e). In the case of an employee who is absent
from work pursuant to a leave of absence which City is required to extend to the participant
under the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993,[1] the twelve-consecutivemonth
period begins on the first anniversary of the first date of such absence. Absence on
account of military service shall be treated as employment with the City for purposes of
determining whether a break in service occurs.
Editor's Note: See 29 U.S.C.§ 2601.
Forms of benefit. Subject to the provisions of § F-108(k), (m) and (n) and paragraph 2 of this § F-
108(f), as promptly as practicable after the date as of which a participant becomes entitled to a
distribution from the fund in accordance with § F-108(b), (c) and (o) and in all events no later than
60 days after the close of the plan year during which the participant becomes entitled to such
distribution, the Board shall distribute or instruct the custodian to distribute the benefit to which
such participant is entitled in one of the following methods of payment, as selected by the
participant, subject to the provisions of (b) of each of § F-108(b), (c), (e) and (o):
One lump sum; or
An annuity in the form selected by the participant, which annuity shall be purchased by the
Board. The payments under such annuity will be for the life of such participant or beneficiary
or over the lives of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary (or over a period not
extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the life expectancy of such
participant and a designated beneficiary).
A series of substantially equal installments over a period which does not extend beyond the
life expectancy of such participant or beneficiary or the joint life expectancy of such participant
and a designated beneficiary.
Anything to the contrary herein contained notwithstanding, a participant entitled to a
distribution from the fund may elect to defer payment of his or her entire benefit and elect to
receive a portion of his or her benefit as a distribution from any of the separate investment
funds [established pursuant to § F-111(d)] in which he or she has invested the net credit
balance in his or her accounts or portions thereof as of his or her date of termination or
retirement. For purposes of this paragraph, each participant shall designate, in writing, at the
time he or she becomes entitled to a distribution hereunder or at any time thereafter, from
which separate investment fund or funds he or she wishes the net credit balance in his or
her accounts or portions thereof to be distributed to him or her and the form of payment of
such distribution as otherwise permitted under the plan. Under such election, the entire
amount of the separate investment fund or funds of the participant shall be distributed to him
or her. The participant may not defer commencement of his or her benefit under this
paragraph beyond his or her required beginning date as defined in § F-108.5(g).
Time of payment of death benefit. The amount distributable pursuant to § F-108(d) shall be paid or
commence to be paid as soon as practicable after the date of the participant's or former
participant's death and will be payable to his or her beneficiary in accordance with § F-108.5(g).
Benefits paid after fund valuation. Anything to the contrary herein contained notwithstanding, no
benefit shall be payable hereunder until the Board of Trustees determines the value of the fund as
of the appropriate date, if such value needs to be determined in order to determine the benefit to
which the participant is entitled.
Designation of beneficiary. Each participant and former participant shall have the right, from time
to time, to designate or change the designation of a primary and a contingent beneficiary, or either

thereof, to receive on his or her death the benefit provided herein, or, as the case may be, any
undistributed balance of any benefit distributable to him or her pursuant to the provisions hereof. A
beneficiary designation by a participant must be in writing in a form or forms as the Board may
require, and be an original document signed by the participant.
Upon the death of a beneficiary entitled to the distribution of an amount pursuant to the provisions
of this § F-108 prior to receipt of all amounts distributable to such beneficiary hereunder, an
amount equal to the unpaid balance shall be paid to the estate of such deceased beneficiary in a
single lump sum.
Solvency of fund. When any amount becomes payable under the provisions of this § F-108, the
same shall be paid to the extent that there are assets in the fund available for the payment
thereof, after deduction of accrued expenses and other amounts properly chargeable to the fund.
In the event the assets of the fund available for payment, after the aforesaid deductions, are not
sufficient to pay all such amounts required to be paid on a payment date, then the assets of the
fund shall be used to pay such amounts on the basis of direct proportion to the extent such assets
are available for payment.
Address for benefit payments. All benefits and installments thereof are distributable from the
address hereinafter provided for in § F-112(c) as the address to which notices shall be mailed to
the City, or such other address as the Board may designate.
Latest date for commencement of benefits. The benefit to which a participant is entitled shall begin
to be distributed to him or her not later than his or her required beginning date as defined in § F-
108.5(g).
Lump sum distribution. If a participant's, former participant's or beneficiary's total benefit due under
the plan is equal to or less than $5,000, such benefit will be paid in one lump sum only. In the
event of a distribution greater than $1,000 in accordance with the provisions of this section, if the
participant, former participant or beneficiary does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to
an eligible retirement plan specified by the participant, former participant or beneficiary in a direct
rollover in accordance with § F-112(p), or to receive the distribution directly in accordance with this
section, then the benefit will be paid in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated
by the Board. For purposes of determining a participant's total benefit under the plan, the
participant's account balances attributable to rollover amounts to the plan shall be disregarded.
Lost participant. In the event the Board is unable to locate a former participant or beneficiary who
is entitled to a benefit from the plan, the benefit to which such former participant or beneficiary is
entitled shall be forfeited as of the last day of the plan year in which the Board determines the
former participant or beneficiary cannot be located, and such benefit shall be treated as part of the
City contribution for such plan year in which such forfeiture occurs. If the former participant or
beneficiary whose benefit was forfeited is subsequently located or claims such benefit, such
benefit shall be restored and paid to the former participant or beneficiary in accordance with § F-
108(f). Such restoration shall first be derived from forfeitures to be treated as part of the City
contribution in accordance with § F-108(e) and, to the extent such amount is not derived from said
forfeitures, it shall be restored from a separate City contribution for such purpose. This § F-108(n)
shall only apply if a former participant or beneficiary cannot be located.
In-service distributions. A participant who has attained age 62 and is 100% vested in the net credit
balance of his or her current account may elect in accordance with procedures established by the
Board to commence distribution under the plan while remaining in the employment of the City (an
"in-service distribution"). Such participant shall be entitled to elect as an in-service distribution, in a
form determined under § F-108(f), a benefit in an amount equal to the total of the net credit
balance in his or her account, determined as of the date his or her election to receive an in-service
distribution is received by the Board, which balance shall be computed after all adjustments and
allocations required as of such date, if any, shall have been made.
A participant who makes an election pursuant to this § F-108(o) will continue to be eligible for
allocation of additional City contributions under the plan and will be entitled, upon his or her

If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then
distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of
the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 70 1/2, if later.
If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then
distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died.
If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the
participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the
calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.
If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the
surviving spouse dies after the participant but before distributions to the surviving spouse
begin, this § F-108.5(c) other than § F-108.5(c)(i) will apply as if the surviving spouse were
the participant.
For purposes of § F-108.5(c), (e) and (f), unless § F-108.5(c)(iv) applies, distributions are
considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If § F-108.5(c)(iv) applies,
distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the
surviving spouse under § F-108.5(c)(i). If distributions under an annuity purchased from an
insurance company irrevocably commence to the participant before the participant's
required beginning date or to the participant's surviving spouse before the date distributions
are required to begin to the surviving spouse under § F-108.5(c)(i), the date distributions are
considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an
insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the
first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with § F-108.5(d), (e)
and (f). If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an
insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the
requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the code and the Treasury Regulations.
Required minimum distributions during participant's lifetime. During the participant's lifetime, the
minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year is the lesser of:
The quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the distribution period
in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations,
using the participant's age as of the participant's birthday in the distribution calendar year; or
If the participant's sole designated beneficiary for the distribution calendar year is the
participant's spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the
number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury
Regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and
spouse's birthdays in the distribution calendar year.
Required minimum distributions will be determined under this § F-108.5(d) beginning with
the first distribution calendar year and up to and including the distribution calendar year that
includes the participant's date of death.
Required minimum distributions upon participant's death on or after date distributions begin.
Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies on or after the date
distributions begin and there is a designated beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be
distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the participant's death is the
quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the longer of the remaining

life expectancy of the participant or the remaining life expectancy of the participant's
designated beneficiary, determined as follows:
The participant's remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the participant
in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, the
remaining life expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated for each distribution
calendar year after the year of the participant's death using the surviving spouse's age as
of the spouse's birthday in that year. For distribution calendar years after the year of the
surviving spouse's death, the remaining life expectancy of the surviving spouse is
calculated using the age of the surviving spouse as of the spouse's birthday in the
calendar year of the spouse's death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year.
If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary,
the designated beneficiary's remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the
beneficiary in the year following the year of the participant's death, reduced by one for
each subsequent year.
No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and
there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the
participant's death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar
year after the year of the participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the
participant's account balance by the participant's remaining life expectancy calculated using
the age of the participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
Required minimum distribution upon participant's death before date distributions begin.
Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date
distributions begin and there is a designated beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be
distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the participant's death is the
quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the remaining life
expectancy of the participant's designated beneficiary, determined as provided in § F-
108.5(e).
No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there
is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the
participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by
December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.
Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse are required to begin. If the
participant dies before the date distributions begin, the participant's surviving spouse is the
participant's sole designated beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions
are required to begin to the surviving spouse under § F-108.5(c)(i) , this § F-108.5(f)(iii) will
apply as if the surviving spouse were the participant.

No amendment to the plan required as a condition of qualification of the plan under the

amendments provided in Subsection (a)(2) above.

Termination of plan; dates. To the extent permitted by federal and/or state law, the plan shall
terminate on whichever of the following dates shall first occur:
The date specified for the termination of the plan in a notice of termination as provided for in
§ F-110(b) above;
Upon the happening of any event, the enactment of any law, the issuance of any rule,
regulation, direction, command, demand or order of any court, administrative, regulative or
other agency, or of any group or organization, or of any individual on behalf of the same,
which in any way or manner or to any extent whatsoever, impairs or prevents the free
exercise of the uncontrolled discretion of the City Council in connection with terminating the
plan hereby created, in any of which such events, the plan shall thereupon, ipso facto, be
terminated;
The date on which the City shall be adjudicated bankrupt, or the date on which the City shall
make a general assignment to or for the benefit of creditors, or the date on which the
dissolution of the City shall occur.
Distribution of benefits to former participants or their beneficiaries. Upon complete discontinuance
of the City's contributions hereunder or the termination of the plan, the amount of undistributed
installments of the benefits to which each former participant, or the beneficiary of a former
participant, as the case may be, is entitled on the date of such discontinuance or termination of the
plan shall be distributed to such former participant or such beneficiary, as the case may be, in one
lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable after such discontinuance or termination of the plan.
Pending such distribution, no installments or benefit shall be distributed to any such former
participant or beneficiary. In the event a former participant shall die prior to distribution to him or
her of the lump sum amount herein provided for after such discontinuance or termination of the
plan, the said amount shall be distributed to the beneficiary of such former participant.
Distribution of benefits to participants.
Upon complete discontinuance of the City's contributions or the termination of the plan, the
rights of each participant to the benefits accrued to the date of such discontinuance or
termination are nonforfeitable. After payment of all expenses of the plan and after making the
distributions provided for in § F-110(d) above, each then participant shall be entitled to
receive, and there shall be distributed to him or her as hereinafter provided in this § F-110(e),
an amount equal to the proportion of the remaining assets of the fund that the total amount
credited to the accounts of such participant, as the case may be, bears to the total amount
credited to such accounts of all participants as of the date of such discontinuance or
termination.
Upon the partial termination of the plan, the rights of each participant with respect to whom
the plan is partially terminated to the benefits accrued to the date of such partial termination
shall be nonforfeitable. The Board of Trustees, at the direction of the City Council, shall
thereupon proceed, as promptly as shall then be reasonable under the circumstances, to
distribute to the participants with respect to whom the plan is partially terminated the net credit
balance in the account of each such participant as of the date the plan is partially terminated,
which distribution may be made in any manner or method of payment permitted by § F-108(f)
hereof.
Upon the termination of the plan, assets remaining in Trust II shall be used to purchase paidup
disability and life insurance benefits for employees who are participants at the time of such
termination. To the extent funds remain in Trust II immediately following such purchase, these
assets shall be used to purchase paid-up disability and life insurance benefits and/or benefits
under § F-117(c) for any other employees. Any remaining funds in Trust II shall be distributed
in accordance with applicable state law.

Board to complete distribution of assets. The Board in office at the time of any termination of the
plan shall continue to act with its full powers hereunder until the completion of the distribution of
the assets of the fund. A majority of the members of the Board then in office shall have the power
to fill any vacancy occurring in the Board after such termination by resignation, death or otherwise.
In the event that the City, within a reasonable time after such termination, shall not have given the
Board of Trustees the directions provided for in § F-110(d) and (e) above, whichever may be
applicable, the assets then remaining in the fund shall be distributed in such manner as may be
directed by a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Conditions for merger consolidation of plan and fund. The plan and fund shall not be merged or
consolidated with, nor shall any assets or liabilities be transferred to, any other plan unless the
benefits payable to each participant, if the plan were terminated immediately after such action,
would be equal to or greater than the benefits to which such participant would have been entitled if
this plan had been terminated immediately before such action.
§ F-111. Fund.
[Code § 18 1/2-12]
Fund part of plan; assets of Trusts I and II. The City of Kirkwood Employees' Retirement Fund
shall consist of all assets of the prior plans which have been transferred to the fund and such
contributions with respect to the plan as shall from time to time be made by the City to the Board,
and all income and profits thereon and accruals thereto, which assets, payments and accruals are
herein referred to as the "fund." The fund shall be deemed to form part of the plan and any and all
rights or benefits which may accrue to any person under this plan shall be subject to all the terms
and provisions of the fund as hereafter provided or as may be amended from time to time. The
fund shall be divided into two sections which shall be denominated Trust I and Trust II. The assets
of Trust I shall consist of accounts of participants, the retirement plan accounts established in this
plan for certain participants in the prior plans, and all contributions made by the City pursuant to
§ F-105(a), and all income and profits thereon and accruals thereto. The assets of Trust II shall
consist of the assets of the prior plans not allocated to Trust I, plus all contributions made by the
City to Trust II, and all income and profits thereon and accruals thereto, all of which are hereby
dedicated for the purpose of providing the benefits described in §§ F-114, F-115, F-116 and F-117.
Power and authority of board relative to fund. Except as otherwise herein specifically provided or
under the law of the State of Missouri, the Board shall, in general, have the power and authority to
do and perform, in the same manner and to the same extent as an individual might or could do
with his or her own property, any and all acts and things in relation to the fund which in its
judgment are necessary or appropriate for the management, investment and distribution of the
fund and shall have all those powers to which it is authorized, from time to time, under the laws of
the State of Missouri.
Duties of custodian. The Board may appoint a custodian to hold any cash, securities and other
assets of the fund, subject to the control and direction of the Board, and to apply the income and
principal thereof in accordance with the directions of the Board for the purpose of paying, in
accordance with the plan, retirement and other benefits to participants in the plan and their
beneficiaries entitled thereto, and the administrative expenses of the plan, as hereinafter provided.
Any custodian shall have custody of the fund to the extent of the cash securities and assets of the
fund transferred to it and collect all interest due and other income thereon. As prescribed by said
Board, any custodian shall keep separate books and complete accounts of the fund, and its books
and accounts shall always be subject to public inspection. Such person shall be bonded, as
required by the Board. Upon its resignation or removal by the Board, the custodian shall deliver to
its successor all unexpended cash, securities, books, records and other assets which may have
come into its possession as custodian of the fund. Any custodian shall make disbursements from
the fund to such person or persons, at such times and in such amounts as the Board shall direct in
writing. Any custodian shall be fully protected in making such disbursements from the fund from

time to time upon such written directions of the Board and shall be charged with no responsibility
whatever respecting the application of such disbursements.
Separate investment funds.
The Board may from time to time establish separate investment funds within the fund;
provided, however, at no time shall there be less than four such funds in existence.
If separate investment funds are established, the following shall apply:
Each participant, former participant and beneficiary may, in accordance with procedures
established by the Plan Administrator, designate into which of the investment funds he or
she wishes the net credit balance in his or her account, or portions thereof, to be invested as
of said date. Should any participant, former participant or beneficiary fail to make a
designation, he or she shall be deemed to have designated that the net credit balance in his
or her account be invested entirely in the separate investment fund designated by the Board
for such purpose. Each participant, former participant or beneficiary may, in accordance with
procedures established by the Plan Administrator, change his or her investment option as to
future contributions and/or his or her existing account balance.
If separate investment funds are established, the Board shall cause a segregation of assets
into separate investment funds within the fund in such proportion as indicated in designations
received from participants, former participants and beneficiaries, and in accordance with the
terms hereof. The segregated separate investment funds shall be denominated and shall be
managed in accordance with the provisions hereof. After the establishment of the separate
investment funds, the net credit balance in all accounts shall be invested in such investment
funds. The Board shall determine the portion of each contribution to be invested in each
investment fund and the Board shall cause transfers to be made from one investment fund to
others based upon the designations of participants, former participants and beneficiaries as
provided herein.
Investment manager.
In the event the Board, in its discretion, appoints one or more investment managers to
manage (including the power to acquire or dispose of) all, or one or more portions, of the
fund, all or, as the case may be, any portion of the fund under the management of an
investment manager shall be hereafter referred to as "directed fund."
A custodian shall have no responsibility with respect to the terms and conditions of
appointment, authority and retention of an investment manager. Upon appointment of an
investment manager, the Board shall give notice to the custodian, if any, certifying the name
and address of the investment manager; that said investment manager is an "investment
manager" as such term is defined in Section 3(38) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974,[1] as now or hereafter amended from time to time, and has
acknowledged in writing that he or she is a fiduciary with respect to the plan; and the assets
of the fund to be allocated to the directed fund over which such investment manager shall
have responsibility. Upon the termination of the appointment of an investment manager
(whether by expiration of the term of his or her appointment, removal or resignation or
otherwise), the Board shall give notice to any custodian of such termination. Unless a
custodian shall receive notice that another investment manager has been appointed to
replace the investment manager whose appointment was terminated, the directed fund over
which the investment manager whose appointment was terminated had responsibility shall
cease being a directed fund. A custodian shall not be liable for any losses to the fund from
assets acquired, held or transferred by an investment manager.
Editor's Note: See 29 U.S.C. § 1001.
Each investment manager shall have exclusive authority to manage (including the power to
acquire or dispose of) assets of the directed fund which is his or her responsibility except that

the Board or a custodian may invest and reinvest cash of a directed fund for the short term.
For this purpose, the Board or a custodian may, in its sole discretion, invest such cash in
savings accounts and certificates of deposit with any financial institution and purchase, hold
and sell United States Treasury bills, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances and similar
investments, including individual interest or participations therein and in commingled or
collective funds composed of such investments.
Each investment manager shall furnish the Board or any custodian from time to time with the
names and signatures of those persons authorized to direct the Board or custodian on its
behalf. The Board and any custodian may request that all directions of an investment
manager be in writing and, if the Board or custodian shall so request, the Board or custodian
shall assume no liability hereunder for failure to act pursuant to directions from the investment
manager unless and until the Board or custodian shall receive directions in writing.
The Board or a custodian shall settle purchases and sales of assets of a directed fund upon
the direction of the investment manager responsible for such directed fund. An investment
manager may issue orders for the purchases or sales of securities directly to a broker or
dealer. Written notification of the execution of each such order shall be given promptly to the
Board or custodian by the investment manager and the execution of each such order shall be
confirmed by the broker to the investment manager and to the Board or custodian. Such
notification shall be authority to the Board or custodian to receive securities purchased
against payment therefor and to deliver securities sold against receipt of the proceeds
therefrom, as the case may be.
The Board or a custodian shall have no responsibility for supervision of an investment
manager. The Board or custodian shall be under no duty or obligation to review or to question
any direction of an investment manager or to review the securities or other property held in
any directed fund with respect to prudence, proper diversification of trust funds, or compliance
with any limitation on an investment manager's authority whatsoever.
Neither the Board nor a custodian shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any investment
manager unless the Board or custodian knowingly participates in or knowingly undertakes to
conceal an act or omission of such investment manager knowing such act or omission
constitutes a breach of fiduciary responsibility of the investment manager. The performance
by the Board or custodian of trades, custody, reporting, recording and bookkeeping with
respect to a directed fund shall not be deemed to give rise to any participation or knowledge
on the part of the Board or custodian. If the Board or custodian has other knowledge of a
breach committed by the investment manager, it shall notify the Board and City Council which
shall assume responsibility to remedy such breach.
Charges upon fund. The expenses incurred by the plan administrator, Board or a custodian in the
performance of its duties hereunder, including, but not limited to, reasonable fees for legal,
accounting or actuarial services rendered to the Board or custodian and expenses incident
thereto, the compensation of investment managers, and all other proper charges, including all real
and personal property taxes, income taxes, transfer taxes and other taxes of any and all kinds
whatsoever that may be levied or assessed under existing or future laws of any jurisdiction upon
or in respect of the fund hereby created, or any money, property or securities forming a part
thereof, not paid by the City, shall be paid by the Board or custodian out of the fund and the same
shall constitute a charge upon the fund.
Indemnification, defense, etc. of Board members. Except as otherwise provided below, the City
shall indemnify, defend and otherwise hold harmless the members of the Board, and the Plan
Administrator, to the extent allowed by law, for any loss, claim, liability, penalty, surcharge or
related expense arising out of or in connection with any act or omission of the City or other
fiduciary with respect to the fund and plan, including without limitation any direction to the Board
members by any other fiduciary with respect to the plan which the Board is required to follow
under the terms of the plan. A Board member shall not be entitled to indemnity, however, in any
case in which the Board member is guilty of willful or criminal misconduct; provided, however, that

such member shall not be deemed to be guilty of willful or criminal misconduct for which, with
respect to any matter, it has no responsibility, duty or obligation under § F-111(e). A custodian
shall not be entitled to any indemnification for any loss or damage it incurs which is attributable to
the actions of its employees and agents. The Plan Administrator shall not be indemnified for
criminal misconduct. The City shall have no obligation to indemnify under this § F-111(g) to the
extent such loss, claim, liability, penalty, surcharge or related expense is covered by insurance
and/or an indemnity provision of a third party.
This provision shall not be construed to relieve any Board member or a custodian from the
performance of any duty he or she may have under the plan and to the participants and their
beneficiaries entitled to benefits hereunder.
§ F-112. Miscellaneous provisions of plan.
[Code § 18 1/2-13]
Participation in plan not a contract. Neither the adoption and continuance of the plan, nor any
modification of it, nor the creation of any fund or account, nor the payment of any benefits shall be
construed as giving to any participant, former participant, or other person a legal or equitable right
against the City or any officer or employee thereof or the Board, except as herein provided. Under
no circumstances shall participation in the plan and fund by an employee constitute a contract of
continuing employment or in any manner obligate the City to continue or discontinue the services
of an employee.
Benefits provided from fund. All benefits distributable under the plan shall be distributed or
provided for solely from the fund and the City assumes no liability or responsibility therefor. The
obligation of the City is limited solely to making contributions as provided in the plan.
Requirements of due notice. Any notice, request, direction or approval required or permitted to be
given hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given or made only:
If to a person, upon personal delivery thereof to such person or upon the mailing of the same
by United States first-class mail, postage fully prepaid, and duly addressed to such person at
the last address of such person appearing upon the records of the City.
If to the City, upon personal delivery thereof to the City Administrator of the City, or upon
mailing the same by United States first-class mail, postage fully prepaid, and duly addressed
to the City at its principal place of business (or such other address as the City Council may
hereafter designate by notice to the Board).
If to the custodian, upon personal delivery thereof to the custodian, or upon mailing a copy of
the same by United States first-class mail, postage fully prepaid, and duty addressed to the
custodian of the address of the City (or such other address as the City Council may hereafter
designate by notice to the Board).
If to the Board, upon personal delivery thereof to the Chairman of the Board, or upon mailing
the same by United States first-class mail, postage fully prepaid, and duly addressed to such
person at the address shown on the records of the City (or at such other address as the City
may from time to time designate in accordance with the terms hereof).
Identification of distributee. If at any time any doubt exists as to the identity of any person entitled
to distribution hereunder of any benefit or installment thereof, or as to the amount or time of any
such distribution, upon certification of such fact to the Board, the Board shall be entitled to, or to
direct any custodian, to hold such sum in a savings account or other savings instrument until
further orders of the Board or until final order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or to pay such
sum into a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with any lawful procedure in such case
made and provided.

Legal action by Board or City Council. The Board or the City Council may, at any time, and from
time to time, take such legal action as it may deem advisable to have determined judicially any
matter arising hereunder, including any matter as to which the Board is empowered to act
hereunder and as to which the Board fails, refuses or does not desire to act.
City Council and Board reliance. The City Council and the Board may (but shall not be required to)
rely upon any certificate, statement or other representation made to it or them by an employee, a
participant, former participant or beneficiary in respect of any fact required to be determined under
any of the provisions of the plan, and shall not be liable on account of the payment or distribution
of any moneys or the doing of any act or any failure to act in reliance upon any such certificate,
statement or other representation made by such employee, participant, former participant or
beneficiary. Any such certificate, statement or other representation made by such employee,
participant, former participant or beneficiary shall be conclusively binding upon such party, his or
her personal representative and heirs (but not upon the City or the Board) and any such
employee, participant, former participant or beneficiary, his or her personal representative and
heirs (but not the City or the Board) shall thereafter be estopped from disputing the truth and
correctness of any such certificate, statement or other representation.
Nonalienation of benefits; qualified domestic relations order; judgement against participant.
Nonalienation of benefits. Except for § F-112(g)2 and 3 below, no benefit which shall be
payable under this plan to any person shall be subject in any manner to anticipation,
alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge, and any attempt to
anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge the same shall be void
and no such benefit shall in any manner be liable for, or subject to, attachment or legal
process for or against such person, and the same shall not be recognized by the Board
except to such extent as may be required by law.
Qualified domestic relations order. The provisions of § F-112(g)(1) shall not apply to the
creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a
participant pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined in Section 414(p) of the
code, to the extent such Section 414(p) of the code is applicable to governmental plans. In
the event that a domestic relations order which is determined to be a qualified domestic
relations order is received by the plan, benefits shall be paid to the alternate payee as soon
as practicable after the determination that such domestic relations order is a qualified
domestic relations order.
Judgement against participant. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary, the
Plan Administrator may offset against the amount in a participant's account under the plan
any amount which the participant is ordered or required to pay as a result of a judgement or
settlement described in Code Section 401(a)(13)(C) of the code provided that the
requirements set forth in Sections 401(a)(13)(C) and 401(a)(13)(D) of the code are satisfied.
Fund for exclusive benefit of participants. It shall be impossible by operation of the plan or of the
fund, by termination of either, by power or revocation or amendment, by the happening of any
contingency, by collateral arrangement or by any other means, for any part of the corpus or
income of any fund maintained pursuant to this plan or any funds contributed thereto, to be used
for, or diverted to, purposes other than the exclusive benefit of participants, former participants, or
their respective beneficiaries.
Performance of parties. All parties to, or claiming any interest under, this plan agree to perform
any and all acts and to execute any and all documents and papers which are necessary or
desirable for carrying out this plan and fund.
Validity of plan. This plan has been executed in the State of Missouri and all questions pertaining
to its validity, construction and administration shall be determined in accordance with the laws of
that state, to the extent such laws are not inconsistent with applicable federal law. Any dispute

and/or the United States Federal District Court in St. Louis, Missouri.
Invalid provisions. In case any provisions of this plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason,
said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts, but this plan shall be construed and
enforced as if the illegal or invalid provisions had never been inserted.
Discharge of liability and receipt. The payment and acceptance of any money or property in
settlement of any participation under this plan shall constitute a complete acquittance and
discharge of all liability of the City, Board and a custodian with respect to such participation. On
final payment or distribution to any participant, former participant, or his or her legal representative
or beneficiary in accordance with the provisions hereof the Board shall be entitled to demand a
receipt or acquittance in full satisfaction of all claim against the fund, the City, the Board and any
custodian.
Incapacity of distributee. In the event any person entitled to receive any distribution hereunder of a
benefit or an installment thereof, who in the opinion of the Board shall be legally incapable of
giving a valid receipt and discharge for distribution of such benefit and another person or
institution is then maintaining or has custody of such person and no guardian or representative of
the estate of such person shall have been duly appointed, then such benefit or installment thereof,
at the option of the Board, may be distributed to such person or institution. Distribution to such
other person or institution shall be in complete discharge of liability under the plan for the
distribution of such benefit or installment thereof and there shall be no responsibility whatsoever
on the City, the Board or anyone else to see to the application of such benefit or installment
thereof so distributed.
Return of City contributions. Contributions made to the plan by the City shall be returned to the
City only under the following circumstances:
All contributions made to the plan are conditioned upon legality of the contributions in full
under the law of the State of Missouri or any statute of similar import. If all or any portion of
the contributions is not legal, the amount so determined to be illegal shall be returned to the
City, if the City so directs the Board, within one year of the determination of the illegality of the
contribution.
A contribution made by mistake of fact shall be returned to the City within one year after the
payment of the contribution if the City so directs the Board.
Rollovers to the plan.
Any employee may file a written request on such form or forms required by the Board to
transfer to the plan all or any portion of a rollover amount received by him or her; provided,
however, that either all or any portion of the rollover amount is transferred to the plan on or
before 60 days after the day on which the employee receives such rollover amount, or all or
any portion of the rollover amount is transferred directly to Trust I by the trustee or custodian
of the plan from which the rollover amount is distributed. Such written request shall set forth
the amount of the rollover amount, the nature of the property contained in the rollover amount,
and a statement satisfactory to the Board that such amount constitutes a rollover amount. The
Board, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether or not an employee shall be permitted to
transfer a rollover amount to the plan.
Rollover amounts transferred to the plan shall be credited to a rollover account established
and maintained for each employee who elects to transfer to the plan any funds received
pursuant to the rollover provisions of the code and as specified in this § F-112. Each
employee's rollover account shall be increased or decreased based upon the value of the
rollover account.

In the event of retirement, death, permanent disability or other termination of employment of
the employee, the amount credited to the employee's rollover account shall be added to the
benefit to which he or she is entitled under the plan and shall be distributed to him or her in
accordance with the provisions of § F-108(f).
"Rollover amount" as used in this § F-112 means an eligible rollover distribution within the
meaning of Section 402(c), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3) or 457(d) of the code; provided, however, that
no part of such rollover amount shall be attributable to a trust forming part of a plan under
which the person was an employee within the meaning of Section 401(c)(1) of the code at the
time contributions were made to his or her benefit under the plan, and provided further, that
such rollover amount shall not include amounts considered to be contributed by the person
[determined by applying Section 72(t) of the code], which contributions shall be reduced by
any amounts theretofore distributed to him or her which were not includable in his or her
gross income.
Direct rollovers from the plan.
Effective for distributions on or after January 1, 1993, notwithstanding any provision of the
plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this § F-112(p), a
distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator, to
have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan
specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
credit of the distributee from an eligible retirement plan, except that an eligible rollover
distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of
the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more; any
distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the code; and
any hardship distribution. A portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover
distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are
not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual
retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the code, or effective
January 1, 2007, such amount may be transferred in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a
qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the code or an annuity contract described in
Section 403(b) of the code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred,
including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross
income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.
An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of
the code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the code, a Roth IRA
described in Section 408A(b) of the code (effective for distributions after December 31, 2007),
an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the code, or a qualified plan described in
Section 401(a) of the code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. An
eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the
code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by a state,
political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political
subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into
such plan from this plan.
A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former
employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former
spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in
Section 414(p) of the code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former
spouse. Effective for distributions on or after November 1, 2008, a distributee also includes an
employee's beneficiary who is not the employee's surviving spouse; provided that in the case

If an individual is deceased at such time as an allocated amount is to be distributed, such
distribution shall be made to the individual's beneficiary, upon verification of such individual's
death, and the identity and address of his or her beneficiary. A distribution shall only be made
to a beneficiary of an individual if such individual is an active participant and living at the time
the City Council approves the allocation under this § F-117(c).

shall treated a current participant who is an active participant under § F-117(c)(2)(i) and an
allocation of such distribution shall be made under this § F-117(c) with respect to such person
if:
He or she was formerly a participant in this plan;

The Board shall establish and maintain or shall cause to be established and maintained a
retirement plan account in the name of each participant in the plan. The retirement plan
account shall consist of the following:
The actuarial equivalent of the participant's earned benefit (as defined in the applicable
prior plan) under the applicable prior plan, unless the participant elected to have an
annuity purchased with the actuarial equivalent of his or her earned benefit under the
prior plan, in which such case nothing shall be credited to the participant's retirement
account with respect to his or her earned benefit; plus
The participant's mandatory contributions to the applicable prior plan with interest on the
participant's mandatory contributions to the plan from July 1, 1973, through December
31, 1985, at the rate of 2% per annum, compounded annually.
For purposes of this § F-207, "actuarial equivalent" means a benefit or benefits which
are of equal value at the date of determination to the benefits for which they are being
substituted. Equivalence of value is determined by an actuary selected by the Board
and is based on the following actuarial assumptions:
Mortality: The 1984 PBGC Unisex Pension Mortality Table.
Interest rate: 8.2% per annum.
Each participant shall be 100% vested at all times in the amount credited to and held in
his or her retirement plan account. Each retirement plan account is established primarily
for accounting purposes and does not require segregation of fund assets for each such
account.
Allocation to current and mandatory accounts. As of the day the City shall make a contribution, the
Board shall credit the amount of such contribution made on behalf of each participant pursuant to
§§ F-205(a) and F-206(a), to the current and mandatory contributions accounts of each such
participant.
Limitations on annual additions.
If a participant does not participate in and has never participated in another qualified plan
[within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the code], a welfare benefit fund [as defined in
Section 419(e) of the code], an individual medical account [as defined in Section 415(1)(2) of
the code], or a simplified employee pension [as defined in Section 408(k) of the code]
maintained by the employer, the annual additions, as defined in § F-207(d)(4), which may be
credited to the participant's current and mandatory contributions accounts for any limitation
year will not exceed the lesser of the maximum permissible amount or any other limitation
contained in the plan. If the contributions that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to
the participant's current and mandatory contributions accounts would cause the annual
additions for the limitation year to exceed the maximum permissible amount, the amount
contributed or allocated will be reduced so that the annual additions for the limitation year will
equal the maximum permissible amount.
This section applies if, in addition to the plan, the participant is covered under another
qualified defined contribution plan, a welfare benefit fund, an individual medical account, or a
simplified employee pension maintained by the employer. The annual additions which may be
credited to a participant's current and mandatory contributions accounts under the plan for
any limitation year will not exceed the maximum permissible amount reduced by the annual
additions credited to a participant's accounts under the other qualified defined contribution
plans, welfare benefit funds, individual medical accounts, or simplified employee pensions for
the same limitation year. If the annual additions with respect to the participant under other
qualified defined contribution plans, welfare benefit funds, individual medical accounts, and
simplified employee pensions maintained by the employer are less than the maximum
permissible amount and the contributions that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to
the participant's current and mandatory contributions accounts under this plan would cause

the annual additions for the limitation year to exceed this limitation, the amount contributed or
allocated will be reduced so that the annual additions under all such plans and funds for the
limitation year will equal the maximum permissible amount. If the annual additions with
respect to the participant under such other qualified defined contribution plans, welfare benefit
funds, individual medical accounts, and simplified employee pensions in the aggregate are
equal to or greater than the maximum permissible amount, no amount will be contributed or
allocated to the participant's current and mandatory contributions accounts under this plan for
the limitation year.
Excess annual additions shall be corrected in accordance with the principles set forth in the
Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System.

substantial risk of forfeiture;
Amounts realized from the sale, exchange or other disposition of stock acquired

Other items of remuneration that are similar to any of the items listed in
Subsection(a)(i) through (iv) above.
Except as provided herein, compensation for a limitation year is the compensation
actually paid or made available during such limitation year. Compensation for a
limitation year shall include amounts earned but not paid during the limitation year
solely because of the timing of pay periods and pay dates, provided the amounts are
paid during the first few weeks of the next limitation year, the amounts are included
on a uniform and consistent basis with respect to all similarly situated employees
and no compensation is included in more than one limitation year.
Compensation for a limitation year shall also include compensation paid by the later
of 2 1/2 months after an participant's severance from employment with the employer
maintaining the plan or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the
participant's severance from employment with the employer maintaining the plan, if
the payment is regular compensation for services during the participant's regular
working hours, or compensation for services outside the participant's regular working
hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar
payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have
been paid to the participant while the participant continued in employment with the
employer, or the payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other
leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued;
or the payment is received by the participant pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded
deferred compensation plan and would have been paid at the same time if
employment had continued, but only to the extent includible in gross income.
Any payments not described above shall not be considered compensation if paid
after severance from employment, even if they are paid by the later of 2 1/2 months
after the date of severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that
includes the date of severance from employment, except compensation paid to a
participant who is permanently and totally disabled, as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of
the code, provided salary continuation applies to all participants who are

was not a highly compensated employee, as defined in Section 414(q) of the code,
immediately before becoming disabled.
Back pay, within the meaning of Section 1.415(c)-2(q)(8) of Treasury Regulations,

to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise
be included under this definition.
Compensation paid or made available during a limitation year shall include amounts
that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Sections
125(a), 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b) of the code.

"Compensation" shall also include deemed Section 125 compensation. Deemed
Section 125 compensation is an amount that is excludable under Section 106 of the
code that is not available to a participant in cash in lieu of group health coverage
under and described in an arrangement solely because the participant is unable to
certify that he or she has other health coverage. Amounts are deemed Section 125
compensation only if the employer does not request or otherwise collect information
regarding the participant's other health coverage as part of the enrollment process
for the health plan.
"Compensation" shall not include amounts paid as compensation to a nonresident
alien, as defined in Section 7701(b)(1)(B) of the code, who is not a participant in the
plan to the extent the compensation is excludable from gross income and is not
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United
States.
EMPLOYER
For purposes of this § F-207(d), employer shall mean the City, and all members of a
controlled group of corporations [as defined in Section 414(b) of the code as modified by
Section 415(h)], all commonly controlled trades or businesses [as defined in Section
414(c) as modified by Section 415(h)] or affiliated service groups [as defined in Section
414(m)] of which the adopting City is a part, and any other entity required to be
aggregated with the City pursuant to regulations under Section 414(o).
LIMITATION YEAR
The plan year. All qualified plans maintained by the employer must use the same
limitation year. If the limitation year is amended to a different twelve-consecutive-month
period, the new limitation year must begin on a date within the limitation year in which the
amendment is made.
MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE AMOUNT
Except for catch-up contributions described in Code Section 414(v), the annual
addition that may be contributed or allocated to a participant's current account under
the plan for any limitation year shall not exceed the lesser of:
Forty thousand dollars, as adjusted for increases in the cost-of-living under
Section 415(d) of the code, or
One hundred percent of the participant's compensation for the limitation year.
The compensation limit referred to herein shall not apply to any contribution for
medical benefits after separation from service [within the meaning of Section 401(h)
or Section 419A(f)(2) of the code] which is otherwise treated as an annual addition.
If a short limitation year is created because of an amendment changing the limitation
year to a different twelve-consecutive-month period, the maximum permissible
amount will not exceed the defined contribution dollar limitation multiplied by the
following fraction:
Number of months in the short limitation year
12
If the plan is terminated as of a date other than the last day of the limitation year, the
plan is deemed to have been amended to change its limitation year and the
maximum permissible amount shall be determined and shall be prorated for the
resulting short limitation year.

Adjustments to accounts. With respect to each investment fund established under § F-212(d), the
then net credit balance in the current account, mandatory contribution account, retirement plan
account and rollover account [within the meaning of Code § F-213(o)] of each participant, former
participant and beneficiary, shall be adjusted upward or downward on a daily basis, as the case
may be, in the same proportion that the total amount of the then net credit balance in each such
account invested in the investment fund bears to the total amount of the then net credit balances
in such accounts of all participants, former participants and beneficiaries invested in the
investment fund, so that the total of the then net credit balances in such accounts of all
participants, former participants and beneficiaries invested in the investment fund will equal the
value of the investment fund as of such date.
§ F-208. Valuation of the fund.
[Code § 18 1/2-28]
Valuation. The value of the fund shall be determined on a daily basis. The Board of Trustees shall
report such value to the City Council and participants, in writing, on a quarterly basis. In making
such determination, the Board of Trustees shall value the assets of the fund at their current fair
market value as of such valuation date, with all accrued income, and shall deduct all accrued
expenses and other amounts properly chargeable to the fund. Such valuation shall include any
contributions made by the City and participants as of such valuation date, as well as any losses
sustained in the administration of the fund since the preceding valuation date. The Board's
determination of the value of the fund shall be final and conclusive for all purposes of this plan and
shall be binding upon the City, participants, former participants, their respective beneficiaries and
all other persons interested in or concerned with the fund.
§ F-209. Benefits.
[Code § 18 1/2-29]
Retirement date. If a participant continues his or her employment beyond his or her normal
retirement date, he or she shall continue to be treated in all respects as a participant until his or
her late retirement date, except that no benefit on account of his or her retirement shall be
distributable to such participant until his or her actual retirement. A participant's right to the
amounts credited to his or her accounts shall be 100% vested and nonforfeitable upon attaining
his or her retirement date.
Retirement. Upon retirement at his or her retirement date, a participant shall be entitled to receive
and there shall be distributed to him or her, as provided in § F-209(f), a benefit in an amount equal
to the total of the net credit balance in his or her accounts as of the date of his or her retirement,
which balance shall be computed after all adjustments and allocations, if any, required as of such
date have been made.
Permanent disability.
Amount. Upon the termination of a participant's active employment with the City because of
permanent disability or upon the Board's determination that a participant, during his or her
authorized leave of absence (in accordance with the provisions of § F-204) and while he or
she remained a participant, incurred permanent disability [referred in this § F-209(c) to as "the
date of permanent disability"], such participant shall be entitled to receive a benefit in an
amount equal to the total of the vested portion of the net credit balance in his or her accounts
as of the date of his or her termination of employment which balance shall be computed after
all adjustments and allocations required as of such date, if any, have been made.
Date of termination of employment. For purposes of this § F-209(c) only, "date of his or her
termination of employment" means the earlier of the date a participant who is permanently

disabled attains age 65, the date a participant ceases to be entitled to benefits under the
City's long-term disability program, the date of the participant's death, or the date of the
written election of the participant to receive all or a portion of his benefits. A disabled
participant who terminates employment and who is not entitled to receive benefits under the
City's long-term disability program shall receive his vested benefit, if any, in accordance with
§ F-209(e).
Contributions during disability. In the case of a participant who is receiving benefits under the
City's long-term disability program, the City shall continue to make contributions to the plan,
as required by § F-205(a)(i), on behalf of such participant based on the compensation the
participant would have received for the plan year if the participant was paid at the rate of the
participant's compensation on the date of permanent disability, which contributions shall
continue until the earlier of the date the permanently disabled participant attains age 65, the
date the participant ceases to be entitled to benefits under the City's long-term disability
program, the date of the participant's death or the date of the written election of the participant
to receive all or a portion of his or her benefit. The contribution, if any, required by § F-205(a)
(ii) and § F-206 of the plan shall not be made by the City and the participant during the entire
period of his or her permanent disability.
Vesting service. No additional years of vesting service will be earned by a permanently
disabled participant until such time as he or she returns to active employment with the City
except that a permanently disabled participant will be 100% vested in his or her accounts
upon the earlier of the attainment of age 60 or the date of his or her death, regardless of his
or her years of vesting service.
Form of benefit. The participant's benefit under this § F-209(c) shall be payable in the form
provided in § F-209(f); provided, however, that a participant may elect, in writing, to have all or
a portion of his or her benefit paid while still permanently disabled. If a participant so elects,
no further contributions shall be made by the City pursuant to § F-209(c)(3) for any period
after the date of such written election and such participant shall cease to be a participant in
the plan as of such date.
Death. Upon the death of a participant while in active employment with the City or upon the death
of a participant during his or her period of authorized leave of absence (in accordance with the
provisions of § F-204), and upon the Board being furnished with evidence satisfactory to it of such
participant's death, the participant's designated beneficiary is entitled to receive and there shall be
distributed to him or her, as provided in § F-209(f) and (g), a benefit in an amount equal to the total
of the net credit balance in his or her accounts, as of the date of his or her death, which balance
shall be computed after all adjustments and allocations, if any, required as of such date, shall have
been made.
Upon the death of a former participant prior to the receipt of some or all of his or her benefits
hereunder, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such undistributed benefit shall be paid to
the beneficiaries of such deceased former participant as provided in § F-209(f) and (g).
Termination for other reasons. A participant, whose active employment terminates prior to
retirement (for reasons other than death or permanent disability), shall be entitled to receive and
there shall be distributed to him or her, as provided in § F-209(f), a benefit in an amount equal to
the sum of the net credit balance in his or her retirement plan account, the net credit balance in his
or her mandatory contributions account, the net credit balance in his or her rollover account, and
the net credit balance in his or her current account as of the date of his or her termination of
employment; less, however, in either case, the applicable percentage of the net credit balance of
his or her current account set forth in the following schedule based upon the number of his or her
years of vesting service with the City as of the date of his or her termination of active employment

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participant shall be 100% vested when he or she attains 60
years of age. The net credit balance in the current account of a participant referred to in this § F-
209(e) shall be determined after all adjustments and allocations required as of the date of the
determination of the net credit balance in his or her current account shall have been made.
The amount, if any, of the net credit balance in his or her current account to which a terminated
participant referred to in this § F-209(e) is not entitled in accordance with the above schedule
shall be forfeited at the time payment of his or her benefits commences. For purposes of this § F-
209(e), a participant who is 0% vested in his or her benefit is deemed to have received a
distribution of his or her vested benefit and the non nonvested vested portion of his or her benefit
is forfeited. The City contribution for such plan year shall be reduced by the amount of such
forfeiture and said amount shall be treated as part of the City contribution for such plan year in
which such forfeiture occurs. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, in the event such
participant again becomes an employee of the City but before he or she has five consecutive
breaks in service, the amount he or she forfeited shall be restored and credited to his or her
current account. Such restoration shall first be derived from forfeitures of other participants
occurring in the plan year in which such restoration is made and, to the extent such amount is
not derived from said forfeitures, it shall be restored from a separate City Contribution. The term
"break in service" means a continuous period of 12 consecutive months during which the
employee is not employed by the City commencing on the date the participant terminates under
this § F-209(e). In the case of an employee who is absent from work pursuant to a leave or
absence which City is required to extend to the participant under the provisions of the Family and
Medical Leave Act of 1993,[1] the twelve-consecutive-month period begins on the first
anniversary of the first date of such absence. Absence on account of military service shall be
treated as employment with the City for purposes of determining whether a break in service
occurs.
Editor's Note: See 29 U.S.C.§ 2601.
Forms of benefit. Subject to the provisions of §§ F-209(k), (n) and (o), F-209(f)b, and § F-209.1, as
promptly as practicable after the date as of which a participant or beneficiary becomes entitled to a
distribution from the fund in accordance with § F-209(b), (c), (d) or (e) and in all events no later
than 60 days after the close of the plan year during which the participant or beneficiary becomes
entitled to such distribution, the Board shall distribute or instruct the custodian to distribute the
benefit to which such participant or beneficiary is entitled in one of the following methods of
payment, as selected by the participant, subject to the provisions of each of § F-209(b), (c), (d)
and (e):
One lump sum; or
An annuity in the form selected by the participant, which annuity shall be purchased by the
Board. The payments under such annuity will be for the life of such participant or beneficiary
or over the lives of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary (or over a period not
extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the life expectancy of such
participant and his or her designated beneficiary).
A series of substantially equal installments over a period which does not extend beyond the
life expectancy of such participant or beneficiary or the joint life expectancy of such participant
and a designated beneficiary.
Anything to the contrary herein contained notwithstanding, a participant entitled to a
distribution from the fund may elect to defer payment of his or her entire benefit and elect to
receive a portion of his or her benefit as a distribution from any of the separate investment

funds [established pursuant to § F-212(d)] in which he or she has invested the net credit
balance in his or her accounts or portions thereof as of his or her date of termination or
retirement. For purposes of this paragraph, each participant shall designate, in writing, at the
time he or she becomes entitled to a distribution hereunder or at any time thereafter, from
which separate investment fund or funds he or she wishes the net credit balance in his or
her accounts or portions thereof to be distributed to him or her and the form of payment of
such distribution as otherwise permitted under the plan. Under such election, the entire
amount of the separate investment fund or funds of the participant shall be distributed to him
or her. The participant may not defer commencement of payment of his or her benefit under
this paragraph beyond his or her required beginning date as defined in § F-209.1(g)(5).
Time of payment of death benefit. The amount distributable pursuant to § F-209(d) shall be paid or
commence to be paid as soon as practicable after the date of the participant's death and will be
payable to his or her beneficiary.
Benefits paid after final valuation. Anything to the contrary herein contained notwithstanding, no
benefit shall be payable hereunder until the Board of Trustees determines the value of the fund as
of the appropriate date, if such value needs to be determined in order to determine the benefit to
which the participant is entitled.
Death of former participant. Upon the death of a former participant prior to receipt of any of his or
her benefits hereunder, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such undistributed benefits
shall be paid to the beneficiary of such deceased former participant within 60 days after receipt by
the Board of evidence satisfactory to it concerning such death.
Designation of beneficiary. Each participant and former participant shall have the right, from time
to time, to designate or change the designation of a primary and a contingent beneficiary, or either
thereof, to receive on his or her death the benefit provided herein, or, as the case may be, any
undistributed balance of any benefit distributable to him or her pursuant to the provisions hereof. A
beneficiary designation by a participant must be in writing in a form or forms as the Board may
require and be an original document signed by the participant. Any such participant or former
participant may make such designation only in writing and by filling out and furnishing to the Board
such form or forms as the Board may require. If there is no designated beneficiary upon the death
of a participant or former participant, then, and in any of said events, the amount which would
have been paid to a designated living beneficiary shall be paid as provided in § F-201(b).
Upon the death of a beneficiary entitled to the distribution of an amount pursuant to the provisions
of this § F-209 prior to receipt of all amounts distributable to such beneficiary hereunder, an
amount equal to the unpaid balance shall be paid to the estate of such deceased beneficiary in a
single sum.
Solvency of fund. When any amount becomes payable under the provisions of this § F-209, the
same shall be paid to the extent that there are assets in the fund available for the payment
thereof, after deduction of accrued expenses and other amounts properly chargeable to the fund.
In the event the assets of the fund available for payment, after the aforesaid deductions, are not
sufficient to pay all such amounts required to be paid on a payment date, then the assets of the
fund shall be used to pay such amounts on the basis of direct proportion to the extent such assets
are available for payment.
Address for benefit payments. All benefits and installments thereof are distributable from the
address hereinafter provided for in § F-213(c) as the address to which notices shall be mailed to
the City, or such other address as the Board may designate.
Latest date for commencement payments. The benefit to which a participant is entitled shall begin
to be distributed to him or her not later than his or her required beginning date as defined in § F-

Lump sum distribution. If a participant's, former participant's or beneficiary's total benefit due under
the plan is equal to or less than $5,000, such benefit will be paid in one lump sum only. In the
event of a distribution greater than $1,000 in accordance with the provisions of this section, if the
participant, former participant or beneficiary does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to
an eligible retirement plan specified by the participant, former participant or beneficiary in a direct
rollover in accordance with § F-213(p), or to receive the distribution directly in accordance with this
section, then the benefit will be paid in a direct rollover to an individual retirement account
designated by the Board. For purposes of determining a participant's total benefit under the plan,
the participant's account balance attributable to rollover amount, within the meaning of § F-213(o)
(5) shall be disregarded.
Lost participation. In the event the Board is unable to locate a former participant or beneficiary
who is entitled to a benefit from the plan, the benefit to which such former participant or
beneficiary is entitled shall be forfeited as of the last day of the plan year in which the Board
determines the former participant or beneficiary cannot be located, and such benefits shall be
treated as part of the City contribution for such plan year. If the former participant or beneficiary
whose benefit was forfeited is subsequently located or claims such benefit, such benefit shall be
restored and paid to the former participant or beneficiary in accordance with § F-209(f). Such
restoration shall first be derived from forfeitures to be treated as part of the City contribution in
accordance with § F-209(e) and, to the extent such amount is not derived from said forfeitures, it
shall be restored from a separate City contribution for such purpose. This § F-209(o) shall only
apply if a former participant or beneficiary cannot be located. In the event of the death of a
participant, former participant or beneficiary, the provisions of § F-209(j) shall control.
§ F-209.1. Minimum distribution requirements.
[Code § 18 1/2-29.1]
General rule. The following provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining
required minimum distributions under Section 401(a)(9) of the code. The requirements of this
section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. All distributions required
under this section will be determined and made in accordance with the Treasury Regulations
under Section 401(a)(9) of the code.
Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be
distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date.
Commencement of benefits upon death of participant before distributions begin. If the participant
dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed no later than as
follows:
If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then
distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of
the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 70 1/2, if later.
If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then
distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died.
If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the
participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the
calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.
If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the
surviving spouse dies after the participant but before distributions to the surviving spouse

begin, this § F-209.1(c), other than § F-209.1(c)(1), will apply as if the surviving spouse were
the participant.
For purposes of § F-209.1(c), (e) and (f), unless § F-209.1(c)(4), applies, distributions are
considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If § F-209.1(c)(4) applies,
distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the
surviving spouse under § F-209.1(c)(1). If distributions under an annuity purchased from an
insurance company irrevocably commence to the participant before the participant's
required beginning date [or to the participant's surviving spouse before the date distributions
are required to begin to the surviving spouse under § F-209.1(c)(1)], the date distributions
are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an
insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the
first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with § F-209.1(d), (e)
and (f). If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an
insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the
requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the code and the Treasury Regulations.
Required minimum distributions during participant's lifetime. During the participant's lifetime, the
minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year is the lesser of:
The quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the distribution period
in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations,
using the participant's age as of the participant's birthday in the distribution calendar year; or
If the participant's sole designated beneficiary for the distribution calendar year is the
participant's spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the
number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury
Regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and
spouse's birthdays in the distribution calendar year.
Required minimum distributions will be determined under this § F-209.1(d) beginning with
the first distribution calendar year and up to and including the distribution calendar year that
includes the participant's date of death.
Required minimum distributions upon participant's death on or after date distributions begin.
Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies on or after the date
distributions begin and there is a designated beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be
distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the participant's death is the
quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the longer of the remaining
life expectancy of the participant or the remaining life expectancy of the participant's
designated beneficiary, determined as follows:
The participant's remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the participant
in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, the
remaining life expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated for each distribution
calendar year after the year of the participant's death using the surviving spouse's age as
of the spouse's birthday in that year. For distribution calendar years after the year of the
surviving spouse's death, the remaining life expectancy of the surviving spouse is
calculated using the age of the surviving spouse as of the spouse's birthday in the
calendar year of the spouse's death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year.
If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary,
the designated beneficiary's remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the

beneficiary in the year following the year of the participant's death, reduced by one for
each subsequent year.
No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and
there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the
participant's death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar
year after the year of the participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the
participant's account balance by the participant's remaining life expectancy calculated using
the age of the participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
Required minimum distribution upon participant's death before date distributions begin.
Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date
distributions begin and there is a designated beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be
distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the participant's death is the
quotient obtained by dividing the participant's account balance by the remaining life
expectancy of the participant's designated beneficiary, determined as provided in § F-209.1(e)
hereof.
No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there
is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the
participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by
December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.
Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse are required to begin. If the
participant dies before the date distributions begin, the participant's surviving spouse is the
participant's sole designated beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions
are required to begin to the surviving spouse under § F-209.1(c)(1), this § F-209.1(f)(3) will
apply as if the surviving spouse were the participant.

Amendments by City.
The City, by action of the City Council, shall have the right at any time, and from time to time,

except that no such amendment may be made without first having submitted such
amendment to the Board for its review, which review shall be completed within 60 days of
receipt by the Board of such amendment. Any such amendment shall be set out in an
ordinance approved by the City Council and shall be deemed to have been amended in the
manner and to the extent set forth in said ordinance and all participants and persons claiming
any interest under the plan shall be bound thereby.
No amendment to the plan:

consent; or
Shall decrease the accrued benefit of a participant.
No amendment to the plan required as a condition of qualification of the plan under Section
401(a) of the code or the exemption of the fund under Section 501(a) of the code or any
statute of similar import, shall be deemed contrary to the limitations upon amendments
provided in Subsection (a)(2) above.
Discontinuance of City contributions. To the extent permitted by federal and/or state law, the City
shall have the right at any time to discontinue its contributions hereunder or to terminate the plan
by delivering to the Board of Trustees written notice of such discontinuance or termination

installments of the benefits to which each former participant, or the beneficiary of a former
participant, as the case may be, is entitled on the date of such discontinuance or termination of the
plan shall be distributed to such former participant or such beneficiary, as the case may be, in one
lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable after such discontinuance or termination of the plan.
Pending such distribution, no installments or benefit shall be distributed to any such former
participant or beneficiary. In the event a former participant shall die prior to distribution to him or
her of the lump sum amount herein provided for after such discontinuance or termination of the
plan, the amount shall be distributed to the beneficiary of such former participant.
Distribution of benefits to participants or their beneficiaries.
Upon complete discontinuance of the City's contributions or the termination of the plan, the
rights of each participant to the benefits accrued to the date of such discontinuance or
termination are nonforfeitable. After payment of all expenses of the plan and after making the
distributions provided for in § F-211(d) above, each participant shall be entitled to receive, and
there shall be distributed to him or her as hereinafter provided in this § F-211(e), the total
amount credited to the accounts of such participant as of the date of such distribution.
Upon the partial termination of the plan, the rights of each participant with respect to whom
the plan is partially terminated to the benefits accrued to the date of such partial termination
shall be nonforfeitable. The Board of Trustees, at the direction of the City Council, shall
thereupon proceed, as promptly as shall then be reasonable under the circumstances, to
distribute to the participants with respect to whom the plan is partially terminated the net credit
balance in the accounts of each such participant as of the date the plan is partially terminated,
which distribution may be made in any manner or method of payment permitted by § F-209(f)
hereof.
Upon the termination of the plan, assets remaining Trust II shall be used to purchase paid up
disability and life insurance benefits and/or benefits under §§ F-215 and F-216 for employees
who are participants at the time of such termination. To the extent funds remain in Trust II
immediately following such purchase, these assets shall be used to purchase paid up
disability and life insurance benefits and/or benefits under §§ F-215 and F-216 for any other
employees. Any remaining funds in Trust II shall be distributed in accordance with § F-217(c).
Any remaining funds in Trust II which cannot be distributed under § F-217(c) shall be
distributed in accordance with applicable state law.
Board to complete distribution of assets. The Board in office at the time of any termination of the
plan shall continue to act with its full powers hereunder until the completion of the distribution of
the assets of the fund. A majority of the members of the Board then in office shall have the power
to fill any vacancy occurring in the Board after such termination by resignation, death, or
otherwise. In the event that the City, within a reasonable time after such termination, shall not
have given the Board of Trustees the directions provided for in § F-211(d) and (e) above,
whichever may be applicable, the assets then remaining in the fund shall be distributed in such
manner as may be directed by a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Conditions for merger and consolidation of plan and fund. The plan and fund shall not be merged
or consolidated with, nor shall any assets or liabilities be transferred to, any other plan unless the
benefits payable to each participant, if the plan were terminated immediately after such action,
would be equal to or greater than the benefits to which such participant would have been entitled if
this plan had been terminated immediately before such action.
§ F-212. Fund.

and accruals thereto, which assets, payments and accruals are herein referred to as the "fund."
The fund shall be deemed to form part of the plan and any and all rights or benefits which may
accrue to any person under this plan shall be subject to all the terms and provisions of the fund as
hereafter provided or as may be amended from time to time. The fund shall be divided into two
sections which shall be denominated Trust I and Trust II. The assets of Trust I shall consist of
accounts of participants, the retirement plan accounts established in this plan for certain
participants in the prior plans, as well as all contributions made by the City and participant
pursuant to §§ F-205, and F-206, and all income and profits thereon and accruals thereto. The
assets of Trust II shall consist of the assets of the prior plans not allocated to Trust I, plus all
contributions made by the City to Trust II, and all income and profits thereon and accruals thereto,
all of which are hereby dedicated for the purpose of providing the benefits described in §§ F-214,
F-215, F-216 and F-217.
Power and authority of board relative to fund. Except as otherwise herein specifically provided or
under the law of the State of Missouri, the Board of Trustees shall in general have the power and
authority to do and perform, in the same manner and to the same extent as an individual might or
could do with his or her own property, any and all acts and things in relation to the fund which in its
judgment are necessary or appropriate for the management, investment and distribution of the
fund and shall have all those powers to which it is authorized, from time to time, under the laws of
the State of Missouri.
Duties of custodian. The Board may appoint a custodian to hold cash, securities and other assets
of the fund, subject to the control and direction of the Board, and to apply the income and principal
thereof in accordance with the directions of the Board for the purpose of paying, in accordance
with the plan, retirement and other benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries
entitled thereto, and the administrative expenses of the plan, as hereinafter provided. Any
custodian shall have custody of the fund to the extent of the cash, securities and assets of the
fund transferred to it and collect all interest due and other income thereon. As prescribed by said
Board, any custodian shall keep separate books and complete accounts of the fund, and its books
and accounts shall always be subject to public inspection. Such person shall be bonded, as
required by the Board. Upon its resignation or removal by the Board, the custodian shall deliver to
its successor all unexpended cash, securities, books, records and other assets which may have
come into its possession as custodian of the fund. Any custodian shall make disbursements from
the fund to such persons or persons, at such times and in such amounts as the Board shall direct
in writing. A custodian shall be fully protected in making such disbursements from the fund from
time to time upon such written directions of the Board and shall be charged with no responsibility
whatever respecting the application of such disbursements.
Separate investment funds.
The Board may, from time to time, establish separate investment funds within the fund;
provided, however, at no time shall there be less than four such funds in existence.
If separate investment funds are established, the following shall apply:
Each participant, former participant and beneficiary may, in accordance with procedures
established by the Plan Administrator, designate into which of the investment funds he or
she wishes the net credit balance in his or her account or portions thereof to be invested as
of said date. Should any participant, former participant or beneficiary fail to make a
designation, he or she shall be deemed to have designated that the net credit balance in his
or her account be invested entirely in the separate investment fund designated by the Board
for such purpose. Each participant, former participant or beneficiary may, in accordance with
procedures established by the Board, change his or her investment option as to future
contributions and/or his or her existing account balance.
If separate investment funds are established, the Board shall cause a segregation of assets

received from participants, former participants and beneficiaries and in accordance with the
terms hereof. The segregated separate investment funds shall be denominated and shall be
managed in accordance with the provisions hereof. After the establishment of the separate
investment funds, the net credit balance in all accounts shall be invested in such investment
funds. The Board shall determine the portion of each contribution to be invested in each
investment fund and the Board shall cause transfers to be made from one investment fund to
others based upon the designations of participants, former participants and beneficiaries as
provided herein.
Investment manager.
In the event the Board, in its discretion, appoints one or more investment managers to
manage (including the power to acquire or dispose of) all, or one or more portions, of the
fund, all or, as the case may be, any portion of the fund under the management of an
investment manager shall be hereafter referred to as "directed fund."
A custodian shall not have responsibility with respect to terms and conditions of appointment,
authority and retention of an investment manager. Upon appointment of an investment
manager, the Board shall give notice to the custodian, if any, certifying the name and address
of the investment manager; that said investment manager is an "investment manager" as
such term is defined in Section 3(38) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974,[1] as now or hereafter amended from time to time, and has acknowledged in writing that
he or she is a fiduciary with respect to the plan; and the assets of the fund to be allocated to
the directed fund over which such investment manager shall have responsibility. Upon the
termination of the appointment of an investment manager (whether by expiration of the term
of his or her appointment, removal or resignation or otherwise), the Board shall give notice to
any custodian of such termination. Unless a custodian shall receive notice that another
investment manager has been appointed to replace the investment manager whose
appointment was terminated, the directed fund over which the investment manager whose
appointment was terminated had responsibility shall cease being a directed fund. A custodian
shall not be liable for any losses to the fund from assets acquired, held or transferred by an
investment manager.
Editor's Note: See 29 U.S.C. § 1001.
Each investment manager shall have exclusive authority to manage, including the power to
acquire or dispose of assets of the directed fund which is his or her responsibility except that
the Board or a custodian may invest and reinvest cash of a directed fund for the short term.
For this purpose, the Board or a custodian may, in its sole discretion, invest such cash in
savings accounts and certificates of deposit with any financial institution and purchase, hold
and sell United States Treasury bills, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances and similar
investments, including individual interest or participations therein and in commingled or
collective funds composed of such investments.
Each investment manager shall furnish the Board and any custodian from time to time with
the names and signatures of those persons authorized to direct the Board and custodian on
its behalf. The Board and any custodian may request that all direction of an investment
manager be in writing and, if the Board or custodian shall so request, the Board or custodian
shall assume no liability hereunder for failure to act pursuant to directions from the investment
manager unless and until the Board or custodian shall receive directions in writing.
The Board or a custodian shall settle purchases and sales of assets of a directed fund upon
the direction of the investment manager responsible for such directed fund. An investment
manager may issue orders for the purchases or sales of securities directly to a broker or
dealer. Written notification of the execution of each such order shall be given promptly to the
Board or custodian by the investment manager and the execution of each such order shall be
confirmed by the broker to the investment manager and to the Board or custodian. Such
notification shall be authority to the Board or custodian to receive securities purchased

against payment therefore and to deliver securities sold against receipt of the proceeds there
from, as the case may be.
The Board or a custodian shall have no responsibility for supervision of an investment
manager. The Board or custodian shall be under no duty or obligation to review or to question
any direction of an investment manager or to review the securities or other property held in
any directed fund with respect to prudence, proper diversification of trust funds, or compliance
with any limitation on an investment manager's authority whatsoever.
Neither the Board or custodian shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any investment
manager unless the Board or custodian knowingly participates in or knowingly undertakes to
conceal an act or omission of such investment manager knowing such act or omission
constitutes a breach of fiduciary responsibility of the investment manager. The performance
by the Board or custodian of trades, custody, reporting, recording and bookkeeping with
respect to a directed fund shall not be deemed to give rise to any participation or knowledge
on the part of the Board or custodian. If the Board or custodian has other knowledge of a
breach committed by the investment manager, it shall notify the Board and City Council which
shall assume responsibility to remedy such breach.
Charges upon fund. The expenses incurred by the Board or a custodian in the performance of its
duties hereunder, including, but not limited to, reasonable fees for legal, accounting or actuarial
services rendered to the Board or custodian and expenses incident thereto, the compensation of
investment managers, and all other proper charges, including all real and personal property taxes,
income taxes, transfer taxes and other taxes of any and all kinds whatsoever that may be levied or
assessed under existing or future laws of any jurisdiction upon or in respect of the fund hereby
created, or any money, property or securities forming a part thereof, not paid by the City, shall be
paid by the Board or custodian out of the fund and the same shall constitute a charge upon the
fund.
Subject to rules established by the Board, fees and expenses for investment services incurred in
connection with the participant's direction of the investment of assets attributable to his or her
account shall be charged directly to his or her account.
Indemnification, defense, etc., of board members. Except as otherwise provided below, the City
shall indemnify, defend and otherwise hold harmless the members of the Board and the Plan
Administrator, to the extent allowed by law, for any loss, claim, liability, penalty, surcharge or
related expense arising out of or in connection with party act or omission of the City or other
fiduciary with respect to the fund and Plan, including without limitation any direction to the Board
members by any other fiduciary with respect to the plan which the Board is required to follow
under the terms of the plan. A Board member shall not be entitled to indemnity, however, in any
case in which the Board member is guilty of willful or criminal misconduct; provided, however, that
such member shall not be deemed to be guilty of willful or criminal misconduct for which, with
respect to any matter, it has no responsibility, duty or obligation under § F-212(e). A custodian
shall not be entitled to any indemnification for any loss or damage it incurs which is attributable to
actions of its employees and agents. The Plan Administrator shall not be indemnified for criminal
misconduct. The City shall have no obligation to indemnify under this § F-212 to the extent such
loss, claim, liability, penalty, surcharge or related expenses is covered by insurance and/or an
indemnity provision of a third party.
This provision shall not be construed to relieve any Board member or a custodian from the
performance of any duty he or she may have under the plan and to the participants and their
beneficiaries entitled to benefits hereunder.

Participation in plan not a contract. Neither the adoption and continuance of the plan, nor any
modification of it, nor the creation of any fund or account, nor the payment of any benefits shall be
construed as giving to any participant, former participant, or other person a legal or equitable right
against the City or any officer or employee thereof, or the Board of Trustees, except as herein
provided. Under no circumstances shall participation in the plan and fund by an employee
constitute a contract of continuing employment or in any manner obligate the City to continue or
discontinue the services of an employee.
Benefits provided from fund. All benefits distributable under the plan shall be distributed or
provided for solely from the fund and the City assumes no liability or responsibility therefor. The

address as the City may from time to time designate in accordance with the terms hereof).
Identification of distributee. If at any time any doubt exists as to the identity of any person entitled
to distribution hereunder of any benefit or installment thereof, or as to the amount or time of any
such distribution, upon certification of such fact to the Board, the Board shall be entitled to, or shall
be entitled to direct any custodian, to hold such sum in a savings account or other savings
instrument until further orders of the Board or until final order of a court of competent jurisdiction,
or to pay such sum into a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with any lawful procedure
in such case made and provided.
Legal action by the Board or City Council. The Board or the City Council may, at any time, and
from time to time, take such legal action as it may deem advisable to have determined judicially
any matter arising hereunder, including any matter as to which the Board is empowered to act
hereunder and as to which the Board fails, refuses or does not desire to act.

any of the provisions of the plan, and shall not be liable on account of the payment or distribution
of any moneys or the doing of any act or any failure to act in reliance upon any such certificate,
statement or other representation made by such employee, participant, former participant or
beneficiary. Any such certificate, statement or other representation made by such employee,
participant, former participant or beneficiary shall be conclusively binding upon such party, his or
her personal representative and heirs (but not upon the City or the Board) and any such

under this plan to any person shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale,
transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge, and any attempt to anticipate,

code even if Section 414(p) of the code is not applicable to governmental plans. In the event
that a domestic relations order which is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order
is received by the plan, benefits shall be paid to the alternate payee as soon as practicable
after the determination that such domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations
order.
Judgment against participant. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the Board may
offset against the amount in a participant's account any amount which the participant is
ordered or required to pay as a result of a judgment or settlement described in Section 401(a)
(13)(C) of the code, provided that the requirements set forth in Sections 401(a)(13)(C) and
401(a)(13)(D) of the code are satisfied.
Fund for exclusive benefit of participants. It shall be impossible by operation of the plan or of the
fund, by termination of either, by power or revocation or amendment, by the happening of any
contingency, by collateral arrangement or by any other means, for any part of the corpus or
income of any fund maintained pursuant to this plan or any funds contributed thereto, to be used
for, or diverted to, purposes other than the exclusive benefit of participants, former participants, or
their respective beneficiaries.

enforced as if the illegal or invalid provisions had never been inserted.

settlement of any participation under this plan shall constitute a complete acquittance and
discharge of all liability of the City, Board of Trustees and a custodian with respect to such
participation. On final payment or distribution to any participant, former participant or his or her
legal representative or beneficiary in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Board shall be

City, the Board of Trustees and any custodian.

Incapacity of distributee. In the event any person entitled to receive any distribution hereunder of a
benefit or any installment thereof, who in the opinion of the Board shall be legally incapable of
giving a valid receipt and discharge for distribution of such benefit and another person or
institution is then maintaining or has custody of such person and no guardian or representative of
the estate of such person shall have been duly appointed, then such benefit or installment thereof,
at the option of the Board, may be distributed to such person or institution. Distribution to such
other person or institution shall be in complete discharge of liability under the plan for the
distribution of such benefit or installment thereof and there shall be no responsibility whatsoever
on the City, the Board of Trustees or anyone else to see to the application of such benefit or
installment thereof so distributed.
Return of City contributions. Contributions made to the plan by the City shall be returned to the

affected participants within one year after the payment of the Contribution if the City so directs
the Board.
Rollovers to the plan.
Any employee may file a written request on such form or forms required by the Board to
transfer to the plan all or any portion of a rollover amount received by him or her; provided,
however, that either all or any portion of the rollover amount is transferred to the plan on or
before 60 days after the day on which the employee receives such rollover amount, or all or
any portion of the rollover amount is transferred directly to Trust I by the trustee or custodian
of the plan from which the rollover amount is distributed such written request shall set forth
the amount of the rollover amount, the nature of the property contained in the rollover amount,
and a statement satisfactory to the Board that such amount constitutes a rollover amount. The
Board, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether or not an employee shall be permitted to
transfer a rollover amount to the plan.
Rollover amounts transferred to the plan shall be credited to a rollover account established
and maintained for each employee who elects to transfer to the plan any funds received
pursuant to the rollover provisions of the code and as specified in this § F-213. Each
employee's rollover account shall be increased or decreased based upon the value of the
rollover account.
The net credit balance in an employee's rollover account shall be 100% vested at all times.
In the event of retirement, death, permanent disability or other termination of employment of
the employee, the amount credited to the employee's rollover account shall be added to the
benefit to which he or she is entitled under the plan and shall be distributed to him or her in
accordance with the provisions of § F-209(f).
"Rollover amount" as used in this § F-213 means an eligible rollover distribution within the
meaning of Sections 402(c), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3) or 457(d) of the code; provided, however,

which the person was an employee within the meaning of Section 401(c)(1) of the code at the
time contributions were made to his or her benefit under the plan, and provided further, that
such rollover amount shall not include amounts considered to be contributed by the person
[determined by applying Section 72(t) of the code], which contributions shall be reduced by

any amounts theretofore distributed to him or her which were not includable in his or her
gross income.
Direct rollovers from the plan.
Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a
distributee's election under this § F-213(p), distributee may elect, at the time and in the
manner prescribed by the Board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid
directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
credit of the distributee, except than an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any
distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently
than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint
life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a
specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required
under Section 401(a)(9) of the code; and any hardship distributions described in Section
401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) of the code. A portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover
distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are
not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual
retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the code, or effective
January 1, 2007, such amount may be transferred in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a
qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the code or an annuity contract described in
Section 403(b) of the code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred,
including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross
income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.
An individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the code, an individual
retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the code, a Roth IRA described in Section
408A(b) of the code (effective for distributions after December 31, 2007), an annuity plan
described in Section 403(a) of the code, or a qualified plan described in Section 401(a) of the
code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. An eligible retirement plan
shall also mean an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the code and an eligible
plan under Section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a
state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which
agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan.
A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former
employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former
spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in
Section 414(p) of the code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former
spouse. A distributee also includes an employee's beneficiary who is not the employee's
surviving spouse; provided that in the case of such a distributee, an eligible retirement plan
includes only those arrangements described in Section 402(c)(11)(A) or 408A of the code.
A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the
distributee.
Service as a civilian employee. A participant in the City's Employees' Pension Plan, who either
terminates employment with the City and returns to the active employment of the City in the
capacity as an employee or remains an active employee of the City but whose status as an active
employee changes to an employee, shall become a participant in the plan upon becoming an
employee and shall receive credit under the plan for all years of vesting credit he or she earned
under the City's Employees' Pension Plan. In the event such a participant remains an employee
for one full year following his or her becoming an employee, his or her accounts under the
Employees' Pension Plan shall be transferred to this plan, the assets funding such accounts shall
be directly transferred to the fund from the fund under the City's Employees' Pension Plan, and
such accounts shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this plan.

and Fund.
Election for payment of qualified health insurance premiums.
A participant or former participant, who is an eligible retired public safety officer, may annually
elect for a plan year to have the Plan Administrator deduct an amount from a plan distribution
which such participant or former participant would otherwise receive under the plan and
include in taxable income as qualified health care premiums. The Plan Administrator shall
cause to be directly paid to the provider of the accident or health plan or qualified long-term
care insurance contract, on behalf of such participant or former participant, his or her spouse
and dependents (as defined in Section 152 of the code), the amounts such participant or
former participant elected to have deducted from plan distributions under this subsection.
Such amount shall not exceed the lesser of $3,000, or the amount the participant or former
participant elected to have paid under this subsection. The $3,000 limit shall be further
reduced by the amount of qualified health insurance premiums paid on behalf of such
participant or former participant, his or her spouse and dependents (as defined in Section 152
of the code) from other retirement plans qualified under Section 401(a) of the code. The
participant or former participant shall provide the Plan Administrator with information
regarding such payments by other retirement plans so that payments pursuant to this section
may be properly limited. No qualified health care premiums shall be paid on behalf of a
participant or former participant, his or her spouse or dependents (within the meaning of
Section 152 of the code) after the participant's or former participant's death.
A participant or former participant shall make the election under this § F-213(s) by providing a
written notice to the Plan Administrator of such election no later than 30 days prior to the
effective date of the election. A separate election must be made for each calendar year. The
Board of Trustees may require the participant or former participant to provide any information
it deems necessary to administer the election.
For purposes of this § F-213(s), the following terms have the meanings as indicated.

Premiums for coverage of the participant or former participant who is an eligible retired
public safety officer, his or her spouse and dependents (as defined in Section 152 of the
code) by an accident or health plan or qualified long-term care insurance contract [as
defined in Section 7702B(b) of the code].

and (iii) of this subsection (c)(2) are hereafter referred to in this § F-217(c) jointly as
"individuals" and singly as "individual"].
Allocation of the approved dollar amount shall be made in accordance with the following
formula:
A + B
C + D
x E = pro rata share of allocation
For purposes of the formula, A equals the value of the individual's account as of April 1,
1987; B equals the value of all contributions made to the individual's account on and after
April 1, 1987; C equals the value of all individuals' accounts as of April 1, 1987; D equals the
value of all contributions made to the individuals' accounts on and after April 1, 1987; and E
equals the specific dollar amount approved by the City Council to be distributed.
Each individual's pro rata share of the distribution shall be credited to his or her current
account and shall be held in such current account until such individual becomes entitled to a
distribution of his or her vested interest in the plan. Where no current account is maintained
for an individual, the Board of Trustees shall forward, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to such individual's last known address notice of his or her entitlement to an
additional benefit from the plan. The Board of Trustees shall distribute to such individual his or
her pro rata share of the allocation in one lump sum upon verification of such individual's
identity and address.
If an individual is deceased at such time as an allocated amount is to be distributed, such
distribution shall be made to the individual's beneficiary, upon verification of such individual's
death, and the identity and address of his or her beneficiary. A distribution shall only be made
to the beneficiary of an individual if such individual is living at the time the City Council
approves the allocation under § F-217(c).
In the event the City Council approves the distribution of funds under this § F-217(c), a person
shall be treated as a current participant who is an active participant under § F-217(c)(2)(i) and
an allocation of such distribution shall be made under this § F-217(c) with respect to such
person if:
He or she was formerly a participant in this plan;
He or she is a participant, within the meaning of § F-101(r), in the City of Kirkwood
Employees' Pension Plan at the time the City Council approves the amount to be
allocated under this § F-217(c);
He or she became a participant in the City of Kirkwood Employees' Pension Plan under
§ F-112(r) when he or she ceased being an employee under this plan; and
Only the contributions made on behalf of such person under §§ F-205 and F-206 shall
be considered for purposes of determining the person's pro rata share of a distribution
under § F-217(c)(3). The pro rata share of such person's allocable share of a
distribution under this § F-217(c) shall be allocated to his current account under the City
of Kirkwood Employees' Pension Plan described in § F-101(a)(1).
No distribution authorized herein may be used for any purpose other than the provision of
benefits for individuals.
Rollover amounts under § F-213(o) shall not be treated as contributions for purposes of § F-
217(c)(3).
All allocations of participants approved pursuant to this § F-217(c) shall be allocated to
