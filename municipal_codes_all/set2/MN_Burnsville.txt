officer was utilized. The initial filing fee will be credited toward these costs. No additional costs

occurring within the scope of employment or official duties. The obligation to indemnify is subject

does not include the requirements to indemnify in cases of malfeasance in office or wilful or
wanton neglect of duty.

omission and the decision is appealed, the city shall continue to defend the case.
3. In the event that a city officer or employee is found liable, the city council may elect to appeal
the decision. The alternatives to the council shall have no bearing on subsection (D) of this

* Numerical values represent length of license suspension in days.
1. The city manager or designee may in their discretion impose a civil fine of $500.00 in lieu of
a suspension on the first violation.
(C) Multiple Violations: At a licensee's first violation, the city manager or designee must act upon all of
the violations that have been alleged in the notice sent to the licensee. The city manager or
designee in that case must consider the administrative penalty for each violation under the first
violation column in subsection (B) of this section. The occurrence of multiple violations is grounds
for deviation from the administrative penalties at the city manager's discretion.
(D) Subsequent Violations: Violations occurring after the notice of hearing has been mailed, but prior
to the hearing, must be treated as a separate violation and dealt with as a second violation, unless
the city manager and licensee agree in writing to add the violation to the first violation. The same
procedure applies to a second, third or fourth violation.
(E) Subsequent Violations: Upon a second, third or fourth violation by the same licensee, the city
manager or designee must impose the administrative penalty for the violation or violations giving

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 103/771
rise to the subsequent violation without regard to the particular violation or violations that were the
subject of the first or prior violation. However, the city manager or designee may consider the
amount of time elapsed between violations as a basis for deviating from the administrative penalty
imposed by this section.
(F) Computation Of Violations: After the first violation, a subsequent violation by the same licensee will
be determined as follows:
1. If the first violation was within eighteen (18) months of the current violation, the current violation
will be treated as a second violation.
2. If a licensee has two (2) previous violations, and the current violation occurred within thirty (30)
months of the first violation, the current violation will be treated as a third violation.
3. If a licensee has three (3) previous violations, and the current violation occurred within forty
eight (48) months of the first violation, the current violation will be treated as a fourth violation.
4. Any violation not covered by subsection (F)1, (F)2 or (F)3 of this section will be treated as a first
violation.
(G) Other Penalties: Nothing in this section shall restrict or limit the authority of the city manager or
designee to suspend up to sixty (60) days, deny the renewal of, revoke the license, or impose a
civil fine not to exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), to impose conditions or take any other
action in accordance with law; provided, that the license holder has been afforded an opportunity

PAWNBROKERS, SECONDHAND GOODS AND
PRECIOUS METAL DEALERS
3-24-1: PURPOSE; ADOPTION BY REFERENCE:
The city council finds that pawnbrokers, secondhand goods dealers, precious metal dealers and other
resellers of certain items potentially provide an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their
concealment because such businesses have the ability to receive and transfer stolen property easily
and quickly.
The purpose of this chapter is therefore to prevent these businesses from being used as facilities for
the commission of crimes and to assure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection
standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city.
The provisions of state law applicable to and regulating pawnbrokers and precious metal dealers,
including Minnesota statutes chapters 325F and 325J, are hereby adopted and incorporated herein
and made a part of this code as completely as if set out in full. (Ord. 1204, 6-8-2010)

Chapter 25
SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
3-25-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
(A) Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the
health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, to guard against the inception
and transmission of disease, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations. The provisions
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 159/771
of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not
the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.
(B) Findings: Studies conducted by the American Planning Association, the Minnesota attorney
general's office and the governments of St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Ramsey, Minnesota; St. Croix
County, Wisconsin; Denver and Adams County, Colorado; Chicago, Illinois; Phoenix, Arizona; Los
Angeles, California; Rochester, Olmsted County, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Seattle,
Washington; and the Texas City Attorneys' Association have investigated the impacts that sexually
oriented businesses have in their communities. These studies have concluded that sexually
oriented businesses have negative secondary impacts on surrounding neighborhoods. Those
impacts included increased crime rates, lower property values, increased transiency, neighborhood
blight and potential health risks. Based on these studies and findings, the city council concludes:
1. Minnesota statutes section 462.357, allows the city to adopt regulations to promote the public
health, safety, morals, and general welfare.
2. The public health, safety, morals and general welfare will be promoted by the city adopting
regulations governing sexually oriented businesses.
3. Sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary impacts of the type found in the studies
referenced in this chapter.
4. The adverse impacts caused by sexually oriented businesses tend to diminish if sexually
oriented businesses are governed by location requirements, licensing requirements and health
requirements.
5. It is not the intent to prohibit sexually oriented businesses from having a reasonable opportunity
to locate in the city.
6. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of
reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented business. A
licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented
business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and
employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances
that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
7. The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a certain crime leads to
the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this
chapter.
8. The city council further finds that experience from other cities demonstrates that sexually
oriented businesses employing personnel with no specialized training, are susceptible to
operation in a manner contravening, subverting or endangering the health, safety and welfare of
members of the community by being the sites of acts of prostitution, illicit sex, and occasions of
violent crimes, thus requiring close inspection, licensing, and regulation.
(C) Certain Statutes Not Applicable: Minnesota statutes section 617.242 shall not apply. (Ord. 1386, 5-
3-2016)

RENTAL LICENSING
3-28-1: PURPOSE:
The City Council has concluded that the regulation of the rental practices of single-family and multitenant
residential dwelling units through licensing will thereby promote the health, safety and welfare
of the residents of the City, particularly those residents who live in rental properties and
neighborhoods surrounding them.
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect the public health, safety and welfare of citizens of the City by
adopting a rental dwelling licensing, inspection and maintenance program that corrects substandard
conditions, maintains a standard for existing, newly constructed and/or converted rental dwellings, and
ensures neighborhood stability in the City. The operation of rental properties is a business enterprise
that includes certain responsibilities.
Rental dwelling owners and managers are responsible to take necessary reasonable actions to
ensure that the citizens who occupy such rental dwelling units, as well as neighboring properties, may
pursue the quiet enjoyment of the normal activities of life in surroundings that are safe, secure, and
sanitary, free from noise, nuisances and annoyances, and free from unreasonable fears about safety
of persons and property. (Ord. 1353, 9-8-2015)
3-28-2: INTERPRETATION:
This chapter is to be construed liberally in conjunction with the provisions of this Code to give effect to
the policy, purpose, and objectives of this chapter, but is not to be construed to modify, amend or
otherwise alter the provisions of this Code relating to health, safety, building or land use regulation. It
is not the intention of the City to intrude upon the fair accepted contractual relationship between tenant
and landlord. The City does not intend to intervene as an advocate of either party, or to act as an
arbiter. It is determined that certain conditions within existing buildings, lawful at the time of
construction of the building, and not creating a hazardous condition, may not comply with the
minimum requirements of this chapter. Such conditions are referred to as "built in deficiencies", and
the Code official, in administering this chapter, may consider built in deficiencies as being beyond
reasonable correction and accept them as an alternate method of meeting the intent of this chapter.

owner's control. Such factors may include climatic conditions or the unavailability of contractors,
supplies or materials needed to make the corrections. A provisional rental license shall be conditioned

applicant's/owner's expense and shall be paid prior to issuing the license for that property. (Ord.
1415, 5-16-2017)

18. Violations of the Minnesota State Fire Code, section 901.8 concerning the removal, tampering
with or otherwise disturbing any fire hydrant, fire detection or fire alarm systems or other fire
appliance. This includes the deliberate disabling or rendering as inoperative of any fire smoke
detection or alarms, sprinklers, egress lighting or exit signage as required.
(B) Process Following Disorderly Use: It shall be the responsibility of the license holder to take
appropriate action following disorderly use by tenants or their guests using or occupying the
premises:
1. First Strike: Upon the occurrence of an alleged disorderly use, the Police or Fire Department
shall inform the City Manager or designee of the suspected disorderly use. The City Manager or
designee shall then send to the tenant, and license holder, as appropriate, a written notice of the
violation by mail. The license holder shall be responsible to take action as appropriate to
terminate the disorderly use.
2. Second Strike: If another instance of disorderly use takes place in the same unit or by the same
tenant or guest within twelve (12) months of an incident for which a notice in subsection (B)1 of
this section was given, the Police or Fire Department shall inform the City Manager or designee
of the alleged violation. The City Manager or designee shall then send to the tenant, and license
holder, as appropriate, a written notice of the violation by mail. The license holder shall be
responsible to take action as appropriate to terminate the disorderly use.
3. Third Strike: If a third or more instance of disorderly use takes place in the same unit or by the
same tenant or guest within twelve (12) months of an incident for which a notice in subsection
(B)1 or (B)2 of this section or this subsection was given, the City shall notify the license holder
by mail of the violation and shall also require the license holder to immediately undertake the
process necessary to remove the tenant from the property. If the license holder fails to comply
with the requirements of this section within fourteen (14) days, this constitutes a property owner
violation under subsection 3-28-10(B)5 of this chapter. (Ord. 1415, 5-16-2017)
(C) Postponement Of Penalty: An action to revoke or not renew a license based upon violations of this
section may be postponed or discontinued at any time if it appears that the license holder has
taken appropriate measures which will prevent further instances of disorderly use. No adverse
license action shall be imposed where the instance of disorderly use of licensed premises occurred
during the pendency of eviction proceedings (unlawful detainer) or within thirty (30) days of notice
given by the license holder to a tenant to vacate the premises, where the disorderly use was
related to conduct by the tenant or by other occupants or guests of the tenant's unit. Eviction
proceedings shall not be a bar to adverse license action, however, unless the license holder
diligently pursues them.
(D) Standard Of Review: A determination that the licensed premises have been used in a disorderly
manner as described in this section shall be made upon substantial evidence to support such a
determination.

excuse the owner/licensee from compliance with all terms of this section, this Code, and State
laws for as long as any units in the facility are occupied. Failure to comply with all terms of this
chapter during the term of revocation, suspension or nonrenewal is a misdemeanor and grounds
for extension of the term of such revocation or suspension or continuation of nonrenewal, or for a
decision not to reinstate the license, notwithstanding any limitations on the period of suspension,
revocation or nonrenewal specified in the City Council's written decision.
(D) New Licenses Prohibited: A person who has a rental license revoked may not receive a rental
license for another property within the City for a period of one (1) year from the date of revocation.

(A) The City of Burnsville is committed to maintaining the quality of life and has a compelling interest
in protecting the character of its residential neighborhoods.
(B) Rental of private homes for temporary occupancy is a commercial activity that if unregulated can

tenants have little interest in the welfare of the local community, do not engage in activities that
strengthen residential neighborhoods, and do not integrate into residential neighborhoods.
(C) The unregulated rental of private homes for temporary occupancy can disturb residential
neighborhoods by creating excessive noise, accumulation of refuse, trespassing, disorderly
conduct, vandalism, high occupant turnover, excessive traffic, and excessive numbers of parked
motor vehicles.
(D) Regulating rental of private homes for temporary occupancy is necessary to protect the essential
character of residential neighborhoods and the health, safety, and welfare of the community.

OFFICIAL MAPS
4-9-1: PURPOSE:
Land that is needed for future street purposes and as sites for other necessary public facilities and
services is frequently diverted to nonpublic uses which could have been located on other lands without
hardship or inconvenience to the owners. When this happens, public uses of land may be denied or
may be obtained only at prohibitive cost or at the expense of dislocating the owners and occupants of
the land. Identification on an official map of land needed for future public uses permits both the public
and private property owners to adjust their building plans equitably and conveniently before
investments are made which will make such adjustments difficult to accomplish. It is the purpose of
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 225/771
this chapter to provide a uniform procedure for the proper use of official maps as authorized by the
Minnesota municipal planning act, Minnesota statutes, section 462.351 to 462.36. (Ord. 961, 2-7-
2005)
4-9-2: OFFICIAL MAP DEFINED:
"Official map" as used in this chapter means a map adopted in accordance with this chapter showing
existing streets, proposed future streets, and the area needed for widening of existing streets of the
city. An official map may also show the location of existing and future land and facilities within the city.
An official map may cover the entire city or any portion of the city. (Ord. 961, 2-7-2005)
4-9-3: INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS:
Proceedings for adoption, amendment, or repeal of an official map or any part thereof may be initiated
by: a) the city's planning department; b) a recommendation of the planning commission; or c) action
by the city council. (Ord. 961, 2-7-2005)
4-9-4: REFERENCE TO PLANNING COMMISSION:
Every proposed official map or change in a map shall be referred to the planning commission for
advice and recommendation thereon, and such recommendation shall be submitted to the city council
within forty five (45) days after reference to the planning commission, along with the report of the
commission on the effect of the proposal on the comprehensive plan of the city. If no recommendation
is received by the council from the planning commission within forty five (45) days after reference of
the proposal to the commission by the council, the council may take such action as it may deem
proper upon the proposal without further action by the planning commission. (Ord. 961, 2-7-2005)
4-9-5: NOTICE AND HEARING:
(A) Notice: Upon receiving the recommendation of the planning commission or after forty five (45)
days from the submission of the proposal to the planning commission without a recommendation
from the commission, the council may call a public hearing on the proposal. A notice of the time,
place, and purpose of the hearing and a description of property to be included in the mapped
streets and public grounds shall be published in the official newspaper at least ten (10) days prior
to the date of the hearing. At least ten (10) days prior to the hearing, the clerk shall also mail a
copy of the notice to each owner of land situated within or abutting any street or other public
ground shown on the official map. For purposes of this notice, the owners shall be determined by
the records of the county auditor and the notice shall be addressed to the last known address as
shown by the auditor's records. Failure to serve any such notice shall not invalidate the
proceedings.
(B) Hearing: At the time and place specified in the notice, the council shall hear evidence and
arguments concerning the proposal. The hearing may be continued from time to time without
further notice. The council may direct the planning commission to conduct a hearing and following
the hearing to report its recommendation to the council. (Ord. 961, 2-7-2005)

4-9-6: PREPARATION AND FILING OF MAPS:
The official map or maps shall be prepared in sufficient detail to permit the establishment of future
acquisition lines on the ground. In unplatted areas, a minimum of a centerline survey shall be made
prior to the preparation of the final draft of the official map. The accuracy of the future acquisition lines
shown on the official map shall be attested to by a licensed land surveyor. After enactment of any
ordinance adopting an official map or amending or repealing a previous official map ordinance, a
certified copy of the official map or section to which the ordinance relates, together with an attached
copy of the ordinance, shall be filed with the county recorder. (Ord. 961, 2-7-2005)
4-9-7: EFFECT:
After an official map has been adopted and filed, the issuance of building permits by the city shall be
subject to the provisions of this chapter. The city shall deny every application for a permit to construct
a new building or structure or expand an existing building or structure within any area designated on
the official map for street or other public purposes, or within required setback from mapped streets.
Whenever any street or highway is widened or improved or any new street is opened, or any interest
in lands for other public purposes is acquired by the city, the city is not required in such proceedings to
pay for any building or structure placed without a permit or in violation of conditions of a permit within
the limits of the mapped street or outside of any building line that may have been established upon the
existing street or within any area thus identified for public purposes. The adoption of an official map
does not give the city any right, title, or interest in areas identified for public purposes thereon, but the
adoption of the map does authorize the city to acquire such interest without paying compensation for
buildings or structures erected in such areas without a permit or in violation of the conditions of a
permit. (Ord. 961, 2-7-2005)
4-9-8: APPEALS:
Whenever a building permit is denied pursuant to this chapter, the board of appeals and adjustments
shall, upon appeal filed with it by the owner of the land, grant a permit for building in an area
designated on the official map for a street or other public purpose in any case in which the board finds,
upon the evidence and the arguments presented to it: a) that the entire property of the appellant of
which the area designated for public purposes forms a part cannot yield a reasonable return to the
owner unless such a permit is granted, or b) that balancing the interest of the city in preserving the
integrity of the official map and of the comprehensive city plan and the interest of the property owner
in the use of his property and in the benefits of ownership, the grant of such permit is required by
considerations of justice and equity. The board of appeals and adjustments shall hold a public hearing
upon the appeal after notice of the hearing has been published in the official newspaper once at least
ten (10) days before the hearing. If the board authorizes the issuance of a permit, it shall specify the
exact location, ground area, height, and other details as to the extent and character of the building for
which the permit is granted. If the board authorizes issuance of a permit, the council or other board or
commission having jurisdiction shall have six (6) months from the date of the decision of the board to
institute proceedings to acquire such land or interest therein, and if no such proceedings are started
within that time, the city shall issue the permit if the application otherwise conforms to local
ordinances. (Ord. 961, 2-7-2005)

official as soon as practicable after the bite occurs. This report shall include the name and address
of the owner of the animal if known, the description of the animal, and the name, address and age
if known of any person injured.
(B) Any animal which may have exposed a person to rabies by bite or other manner may be
immediately seized whether on or off the owner's premises and quarantined for a period of at least
ten (10) days. Such impounding may be by the owner except as otherwise provided. The owner
shall notify the animal control official and shall furnish written certification that the animal is being
impounded.
In the case of an animal with no known owner, the animal shall be quarantined in the city pound.
Where no current rabies vaccination of the animal can be proven or upon written demand by the

pound. In either case, the owner shall be responsible for the impoundment costs and shall make
arrangements in advance for the payment of these costs.

the animal shall be euthanized and examined for rabies to determine if it was diseased.
(D) The city may have an autopsy performed on any dead animal which had been impounded or on an
animal dying while impounded to determine if it was diseased and the cause of death.
(E) Upon expiration of the required ten (10) days, if the animal does not have rabies, it may be
released and the animal control official notified just prior to the release. If the animal is impounded
in the city pound, such animal may be reclaimed as hereinafter provided.
(F) Any animal that has been bitten by a rabid animal or believed to have been exposed to rabies shall
be confined and maintained in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the state
board of animal health. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the animal to notify the animal
control official of such bites and exposure to rabies. If the owner fails to provide as set forth above

the animal. (Ord. 1153, 3-17-2009)
6-2-14: EXCEPTIONS TO IMPOUNDMENT:

rabies, it shall be kept as specified in section 6-2-13 of this chapter. For the purpose of this chapter,
"regular business day" means a day during which the establishment having custody of an animal is

6-2-16: RECLAIMING OR DISPOSING OF IMPOUNDED ANIMALS:
(A) Reclaiming Impounded Animals: Before reclaiming a dog, cat, ferret, or other animal, the owner
shall pay an impounding fee as determined by council resolution, plus the cost to the city of
keeping the animal in the pound. If at the end of the impounding period the animal is not reclaimed
by the owner, such animal shall be deemed to have been abandoned and may be sold to any

licensed institution, the animal may be sold to any person. If the purchaser of the animal keeps or

animal is given to the purchaser. If any animal is not reclaimed, released to an institution, or sold,
then it may be destroyed in a humane manner.

license, such license shall also be obtained and an unlicensed penalty fee, as established by the
council annually, shall be paid before the animal is released. No dog, cat or ferret shall be released
until sufficient proof of vaccination has been shown. If no proof of vaccination can be shown the
dog, cat or ferret may be released, but the animal control official shall issue a notice requiring the
owner to produce proof of vaccination within ten (10) days of release. If proof of vaccination is not
produced within ten (10) days, the city may issue a citation.

delay the response time of public safety agencies which may result in a life threatening situation for
the caller. In addition, many callers are unaware that when they dial 911 on a multiline system their
location and telephone number are not automatically displayed. Disclosure of a multiline telephone
system's capabilities regarding location identification is necessary to ensure that callers can obtain
emergency assistance. (Ord. 837, 12-17-2001)

sewer system except upon making an application therefor on a form provided by the city and receiving
a permit issued by the city for such purposes. The application shall include the legal description of the
property to be served, the uses for which the connection is requested and the size of the service line
to be used.
No connection shall be made with respect to any sanitary sewer, water system or storm sewer system
serving the property of any person or occupants of the land, parcel or premises affected that have not
paid or provided for the payment of the full and proportionate share of the said utilities. At the time of

purposes:
(A) For service to property to which service lines have not been previously run from the street laterals
to the property line, the owner, occupant or user shall pay into the treasury an amount not less
than the cost of making the necessary connections, taps and installation of pipe and
appurtenances to provide service to the property and the necessary street repairs.
(B) For service to property to which service lines have been run to the property line but which have not
been paid for, the owner, occupant or user shall pay in cash or agree to pay charges in the form of
special assessments to be levied against the property to be spread over a number of years
coincident with the maturity requirements of any special improvement bonds sold for the purpose
of financing the construction of sanitary sewer, municipal water, or storm sewer system serving the
property. Said cash payment or assessment charge shall be in the principal amount of not less
than the payments made by or charges placed against comparable properties for like services for
such sanitary sewer, water or storm sewer system in an amount as may be established by the
council. In the instance of services run to the property lines as provided under subsection (A) of
this section, the payment to the clerk of any amount required under this subsection shall be
reduced by the amount paid to the city under subsection (A) of this section. Payment to the
treasury in the form of a special assessment charge shall be in the form of equal annual
installments together with interest on the unpaid balance. (Ord. 25, 6-4-1963)

connection application. Fees for the connection of commercial and industrial properties shall be
based upon area and usage population equivalent factors.
There shall be a connection fee for water or sewer connections to multiple housing for each living
unit in the multiple housing project.
Before proceeding with the construction, enlargement, alteration, or repair, of any water or sewer

or building, the owner or his agent shall first obtain a permit for such purpose from the city through
its plumbing inspector.

use or operation of said system. Whenever a service has been discontinued for nonpayment of
charges or bills or for disregard of any other purpose it shall not be resumed except upon payment
of the charges or bills accrued together with interest thereon, or compliance with the rules and
regulations previously violated and payment to the city of a restoration fee to turn on the water

sent out, the bill shall be considered delinquent and the service may be discontinued as provided
in subsections (B) and (D) of this section and the council may cause the charges noted in such
billing to become a lien against the property served by certifying to the county auditor the amount
of said delinquent bill in accordance with the statutes of the state. Such action is discretionary and
may be in lieu of or in addition to any other action to collect delinquent accounts. (Ord. 605, 2-5-
1996)

case the supply will not be cut off until after a hearing is held. If the customer requests a hearing
before the date specified, a hearing shall be held on the matter by the city manager at least one
week after the date on which the request is made. If, as a result of the hearing, the city manager
finds that the amount claimed to be owing is actually due and unpaid or the rules and regulations
affecting utility service have been violated and that there is no legal reason why the water supply of
the customer may not be shut off, the city may shut off the supply. (Ord. 605, 2-5-1996)
7-2-6: BILLING REGULATIONS:
The council shall have the authority to prescribe by resolution the rates to be charged for water and

7-2-22: INDUSTRIAL WASTE, USER CHARGE:
(A) Recitals: The metropolitan waste control commission, a metropolitan commission organized and
existing under the laws of the state (the "commission"), in order to receive and retain grants in
compliance with the federal water pollution control act amendments of 1972 and regulations
thereunder (the "act"), has determined to impose an industrial user sewer strength charge upon
users of the metropolitan disposal system1 to recover operation and maintenance costs of
treatment works attributable to the strength charge being in addition to the charge based upon the
volume of discharge. ln order for the city to pay such costs based upon strength of industrial
discharge and allocated to it each year by the commission, it is hereby found, determined and
declared to be necessary to establish sewer strength charges and a formula for the computation
thereof for all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city.
Furthermore, Minnesota statutes section 444.075, subdivision 3, empowers the city to make such
sewer charge a charge against the owner, lessee, occupant or all of them and certify unpaid
charges to the county auditor as a tax lien against the property served.
(B) Establishment Of Strength Charges: For the purpose of paying the costs allocated to the city each
year by the commission that are based upon the strength of discharge of all industrial users
receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, there is hereby approved, adopted
and established, in addition to the sewer charge based upon the volume of discharge, a sewer
charge upon each person, company or corporation receiving waste treatment services within or
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 303/771
served by the city, based upon strength of industrial waste discharged into the sewer system of the
city (the "strength charge").
(C) Establishment Of Strength Charge Formula: For the purpose of computation of the strength
charge established by subsection (B) of this section, there is hereby established, approved and
adopted in compliance with the act the same strength charge formula designated in resolution 76-
172 adopted by the governing body of the commission on June 15, 1976, such formula being
based upon pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of the sewage produced through an
evaluation of pollution qualities and quantities in excess of an annual average base and the
proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of waste treatment services provided by the
commission.
(D) Strength Charge Payment: It is hereby approved, adopted and established that the strength
charge established by subsection (B) of this section shall be paid by each industrial user receiving
waste treatment services and subject thereto before the twentieth day next succeeding the date of
billing thereof to such user by or on behalf of the city, and such payment thereof shall be deemed
to be delinquent if not so paid to the billing entity before such date. Furthermore, it is hereby
established, approved and adopted that if such payment is not paid before such date an industrial
user shall pay interest compounded monthly at the rate of two-thirds of one percent (2/3%) per
month on the unpaid balance due.
(E) Establishment Of Tax Lien: As provided by Minnesota statutes section 444.075, subdivision 3, it is
hereby approved, adopted and established that if payment of the strength charge established by
subsection (B) of this section is not paid before the sixtieth day next succeeding the date of billing
thereof to the industrial user by or on behalf of the city, said delinquent sewer strength charge, plus
accrued interest established pursuant to subsection (D) of this section, shall be deemed to be a
charge against the owner, lessee and occupant of the property served, and the city or its agent
shall certify such unpaid delinquent balance to the county auditor with taxes against the property
served for connection as other taxes are collected; provided, however, that such certification shall
not preclude the city or its agent from recovery of such delinquent sewer strength charge and
interest thereon under any other available remedy. (Ord. 162, 6-20-1977)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 314/771
(A) Amount. Subject to State statute, the fee prescribed by this Chapter shall be set by City Council
resolution. The fee shall be due from an operator of a mixed Municipal waste disposal facility within
the City for each cubic yard of solid waste accepted for disposal. If the waste is weighed, six
hundred (600) pounds of waste shall be deemed to be the equivalent of a cubic yard. All vehicles
transporting solid waste shall register at the entrance of the facility.
(B) Basis for Calculation. An operator of a facility that weighs waste accepted for disposal may allow
haulers to elect the method to be used for calculation of the fee on the hauler's vehicles. This
election shall be made in accordance with rules promulgated by the Minnesota Commissioner of
Revenue in conjunction with the "Metropolitan Solid Waste Landfill Fee", Minnesota Statutes,
section 473.843.
(C) Passenger Cars and Pickup Trucks Exception. The fee charged for waste transported by
passenger cars and pickup trucks shall be computed in accordance with the rules promulgated by
the Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue and shall be prorated in accordance with the ratio
between the State's fee and the City's fee.
(D) "Rolloffs" Exception. The operator of a mixed Municipal solid waste disposal facility may calculate
the fee for rolloffs on a "load-by-load" basis. Each invoice shall reflect the basis for the calculation
of the fee.
7-6-6: EXEMPTIONS:
(A) Energy and Resource Recovery Facilities. Waste residue from energy and resource recovery
facilities at which solid waste is processed for the purposes of extracting, reducing, converting to
energy, or otherwise separating and preparing solid waste for reuse shall be exempt from one-half
(1/2) the amount of the fee imposed if there is at least an eighty five percent (85%) volume
reduction in the solid waste processed. To qualify for the partial exemption granted by this
subdivision, the verification procedures of section 73, subdivision 1, paragraph (c), of Minnesota
Laws 1984, chapter 644, must be followed and submitted to the Department of Revenue in
accordance with their rules.
(B) Temporary Exemption for Metal Casting Facilities. For the period January 1, 1985, through
December 31, 1987, nonhazardous solid waste from metal casting facilities shall not be subject to
the fee imposed by this Section, provided such waste is brought to the disposal facility separately.
The operator must return to the City a statement of exemption with its monthly return for all wastes
exempted pursuant to this subsection. Such statement of exemption shall be in the form provided
by the Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue.
(C) Cover Material and Lining. When solid waste that is accepted at a mixed Municipal solid waste
facility is not disposed of in the body of the facility, but is used in the operation of the facility as
cover or lining material, the solid waste may be exempt from the amount of the fee charged. The
generator of waste qualifying for this exemption must first obtain written approval from the City as
to the suitability of material for cover material or lining. No request for approval will be considered
unless the generator has also obtained approval from the Minnesota PollutionControl Agency.

for the SSTS within three (3) years if the SSTS is older than five (5) years or within five (5)
years if the SSTS is less than five (5) years old prior to the intended date of sale or transfer of
the real property, unless evidence is found identifying an imminent threat to public health and
safety. If this requirement cannot be met, a compliance inspection must be conducted in
accordance with subsection (C) of this section.
b. The compliance inspection must have been performed by a licensed inspection business
following the procedures described in subsection (C) of this section.
c. The seller/transferor of the real property must provide the disclosure required by Minnesota

complying SSTS. The security shall be placed in an escrow with a licensed real estate closer,
licensed attorney, or federal or state chartered financial institution. The amount escrowed shall
be equal to one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of a written estimate to connect to an
available city sewer or if city sewer is not available, to install a complying SSTS provided by a
licensed and certified installer, or the amount escrowed shall be equal to one hundred ten
percent (110%) of the written contract price for the installation of a complying SSTS provided
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 342/771
by a licensed and certified installer. After a complying SSTS has been installed and a
certificate of compliance issued, the seller/transferor or the buyer/transferee shall provide the
escrow agent a copy of the certificate of compliance.

4. The responsibility for filing the completed compliance portion of the certificate of compliance
under subsection (D)1 of this section or for upgrading a system found to be noncompliant shall
be determined by the seller/transferor and the buyer/transferee. The seller/transferor and the
buyer/transferee shall provide the city with a signed statement indicating responsibility for
completing the compliance portion of the certificate of compliance and for upgrading a system
found to be noncompliant.
5. The issuance of permits, certificates of compliance or notices of noncompliance as requested or
issued shall not be construed to represent a guarantee or warranty of the system's operation or
effectiveness. Such certificates signify that the system in question is or has been designed and
installed in compliance or noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter.
(E) Conflict Of Interest: A licensed inspection business that inspects an existing SSTS is allowed to
subsequently design and install a new SSTS for that property provided the inspection business is
also licensed to design and install. A licensed inspection business working on behalf of the city

occurrence of the emergency the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees
associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into
compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the city will attempt to
contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever reasonable action it deems necessary to
respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities
occasioned the emergency.
(B) Nonemergency Situations: Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained
the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit,
and as a penalty pay double the normal fee for said permit and, if a new registrant, double the
registration fee. Deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way
and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 1282, 10-16-2012)

1. The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
2. An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the
perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens;
3. Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right-of-way permit;
4. The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a permit extension is obtained or
unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the permittee's control; or
5. The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition indicated on
an order issued pursuant to section 8-14-17 of this chapter;
6. Failure of the permittee to pay any required costs, fees, or charges billed by the City.
(B) Written Notice Of Breach: If the City determines that the permittee has committed a substantial
breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the
permit the City shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The
demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the City, at its discretion, to place additional or
revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach. (Ord. 1282, 10-16-2012)
(C) Response To Notice Of Breach: Within seventy two (72) hours, or a longer time set in the notice by
the Director, the permittee shall provide the City with a plan acceptable to the Director, that will
cure the breach. Permittee's failure to so contact the City, or permittee's failure to timely submit an
acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause
for revocation of the permit. (Ord. 1434, 9-5-2017)
(D) Reimbursement Of City Costs: If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and
reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

will not be allowed to obstruct or excavate within the City's right-of-way until the breach situation is
corrected to the satisfaction of the Director and the permit is reissued. (Ord. 1282, 10-16-2012)
8-14-21: MAPPING DATA:
(A) Information Required: Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping information required by
the City to develop a right-of-way mapping system in accordance with Minnesota Rules 7819.4000
and 7819.4100.
(B) Application Required: The City requires a permit from excavation in or obstruction of its public
right-of-way. A person wishing to undertake a project within the public right-of-way shall submit a
right-of-way permit application, which will require the filing of mapping information pursuant to
subsection (C) of this section.
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 384/771
(C) Mapping Information: The City requires as part of its permit the filing of all of the following
information for the placement of utilities:
1. Location and elevation of applicant's mains, cables, conduits, switches, and related equipment
and facilities, with the location based on the following methods:
a. The preferred method is: X, Y, Z coordinates referenced to NAD-83 (1986 adjustment) or
DAD-83 (HARD adjustment) horizontal datum and NGVD-88 vertical datum. The information is
to be supplied in an electronic file to be an ASCII common delimited file including: latitudes (dd
mm ss.sss), longitude (dd mm ss.sss), and elevation in feet (xxx.xx), description, and a linking
code. The alignment position will be reported at a minimum interval of two hundred feet (200') or
as required by change in direction to define the horizontal alignment. Random elevation "as
built" depth locations will be reported at a minimum of ten (10) per mile. The horizontal accuracy
should be within 0.5 foot based on a ninety five percent (95%) confidence level. A signed
horizontal and vertical accuracy statement that the survey work was done by or under the
supervision of a licensed land surveyor or engineer registered in the State of Minnesota.
b. Offsets from property lines, distances from centerline of the public right-of-way, and curb lines
as determined by the City.
c. Any other system agreed upon by the right-of-way user and the City.
(1) The type and size of the utility facility;
(2) A description of aboveground appurtenances;
(3) Any abandoned facilities, if applicable, in conformance with Minnesota statutes 216D.04,
subdivision 3.
(D) Changes And Corrections: The applicant must provide that the applicant agrees to submit "as
built" data, reflecting any change and variations from the information provided under subdivision 2,
items A to D.
(E) Additional Construction Information: In addition, the right-of-way user shall submit to city at the
time the project is completed a completion certificate.
(F) Manner Of Conveying Permit Data: A right-of-way user is not required to provide or convey
mapping information or data in a format or manner that is different from what is currently utilized
and maintained by that user. A permit application fee may include the cost to convert the data
furnished by the right-of-way user to a format currently in use by the city. These data conversion
costs, unlike other costs that make up permit fees, may be included in the permit fee after the
permit application process.
(G) Data On Existing Facilities: At the request of the city, a right-of-way user shall provide existing
data on its existing facilities within the public right-of-way in the form maintained by the user at the
time the request was made, if available. (Ord. 1282, 10-16-2012)
8-14-22: UNDERGROUNDING:
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 385/771
(A) Purpose: The purpose of this section is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the
public and is intended to foster: 1) safe travel over the right-of-way, 2) nontravel related safety
around homes and buildings where overhead feeds are connected and 3) orderly development in
the city. Location and relocation, installation and reinstallation of facilities in the right-of-way must
be made in accordance with this section. This section is intended to be enforced consistently with
state and federal law regulating right-of-way users, specifically including, but not limited to,
Minnesota statutes, sections 161.45, 237.162, 237.163, 301B.01, 222.37, 238.084 and 216B.36
and the telecommunications act of 1996, title 47, USC section 253.
(B) Undergrounding Of Facilities: Facilities newly installed, constructed or otherwise placed in the
public right-of-way or in other public property held in common for public use must be located and
maintained underground pursuant to the terms and conditions of this section and in accordance
with applicable construction standards, subject to the exceptions below. Aboveground installation,
construction, modifications, or replacement of meters, gauges, transformers, street lighting, pad
mount switches, capacitor banks, reclosers and service connection pedestals shall be allowed.
The requirements of this section shall apply equally outside of the corporate limits of the city
coincident with city jurisdiction of platting, section regulation or comprehensive planning as may
now or in the future be allowed by law.
(C) Exceptions To Undergrounding: The following exceptions to the strict application of this section
shall be allowed upon the conditions stated:
1. Transmission Lines: Aboveground installation, construction, or relocation of facilities commonly
referred to as "high voltage transmission lines" shall be allowed unless the council requires
undergrounding of the facilities after providing the right-of-way user notice and an opportunity to
be heard on the issue of undergrounding.
2. Technical And Economic Feasibility: Aboveground installation, construction, or placement of
facilities shall be allowed in residential, commercial and industrial areas where the council,
following consideration and recommendation by the planning commission, finds that:
a. Underground placement would place an undue financial burden upon the landowner,
ratepayers, or right-of-way user or would deprive the landowner of the preservation and
enjoyment of substantial property rights; or
b. Underground placement is impractical or not technically feasible due to topographical, subsoil
or other existing conditions which adversely affect underground facilities placement.
c. Failure to promote the purposes of undergrounding. The right-of-way user clearly and
convincingly demonstrates that none of the purposes under subsection (A) of this section
would be advanced by underground placement of facilities on the project in question.
3. Temporary Service: Aboveground installation, construction or placement of temporary service
lines shall only be allowed:
a. During new construction of any project for a period not to exceed twenty four (24) months;
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 386/771
b. During an emergency in order to safeguard lives or property within the city;
c. For a period of not more than seven (7) months when soil conditions make excavation
impractical.
(D) Undergrounding Of Permanent Replacement, Relocated Or Reconstruction Facilities: If the city
council determines that one or more of the purposes set forth in subsection (A) of this section
would be promoted, the city may require a permanent replacement, relocation or reconstruction of
a facility of more than six hundred feet (600') or a city block to be located, and maintained
underground, with due regard for seasonal working conditions. For purposes of this section,
"reconstruction" means any substantial repair of or any improvement to existing facilities.
Undergrounding may be required whether a replacement, relocation or reconstruction is initiated
by the right-of-way user owning or operating the facilities, or by the city in connection with: 1) the
interference with a present or future use by the city or other local government unit of the right-ofway
or other public ground for a project, 2) the public health or safety, or 3) the safety and
convenience of travel over the right-of-way.
(E) Retirement Of Overhead Facilities: The city council may determine whether it is in the public
interest that all facilities within the city, or facilities within certain districts designated by the city, be
permanently placed and maintained underground by a date certain or target date, independently of
undergrounding required pursuant to subsections (B) (new facilities) and (D) (replacement
facilities) of this section. The decision to underground must be preceded by a public hearing, after
published notice and written notice to the utilities affected (2 weeks published, 30 days written). At
the hearing the council must consider subsections (G)1 through (G)4 of this section and make
findings. Undergrounding may not take place until city council has, after hearing and notice,
adopted a plan containing subsections (H)1 through (H)6 of this section.
(F) Public Hearings: A hearing must be open to the public and may be continued from time to time. At
each hearing any person interested must be given an opportunity to be heard. The subject of the
public hearings shall be the issue of whether facilities in the right-of-way in the city, or located
within a certain district, shall all be located underground by a date certain. Hearings are not
necessary for the undergrounding required under subsections (B) and (D) of this section.
(G) Public Hearing Issues: The issues to be addressed at the public hearings include, but are not
limited to:
1. The costs and benefits to the public of requiring the undergrounding of all facilities in the right-ofway.
2. The feasibility and cost of undergrounding all facilities by a date certain as determined by the
city and the affected utilities.
3. The fee requirements, procedure and rate design for recovery or intended incremental costs for
undergrounding by the utilities from ratepayers within the city.
4. Alternative financing options available if the city deems it in the public interest to require
undergrounding by a date certain and deems it appropriate to participate in the cost otherwise
borne by the ratepayers.
Upon completion of the hearing or hearings, the city council must make written findings on
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 387/771
whether it is in the public interest to establish a plan under which all facilities will be
underground, either citywide or within districts designated by the city.
(H) Undergrounding Plan: If the council finds that it is in the public interest to underground all or
designated corridors in the public right-of-way or in non-right-of-way public ground, the council
must establish a plan for such undergrounding. The plan for undergrounding must include at least
the following elements:
1. Timetable for the undergrounding.
2. Designation of districts for the undergrounding unless the undergrounding plan is citywide.
3. Exceptions to the undergrounding requirement and procedure for establishing such exceptions.
4. Procedures for the undergrounding process, including, but not limited to, coordination with city
projects and provisions to ensure compliance with nondiscrimination requirements under the law.
5. A financing plan for funding of the incremental costs if the city determines that it will finance
some of the undergrounding costs, and a determination and verification of the claimed additional
costs to underground incurred by the utility.
6. Penalties or other remedies for failure to comply with the undergrounding.
(I) Facilities Location: In addition to complying with the requirements of Minnesota statutes sections
216D.01 through 216D.09 ("one call excavation notice system"), before the start date of any rightof-
way excavation, each registrant who has facilities located in the area to be excavated shall mark
the horizontal placement of all said facilities. To the extent its records contain such information,
each registrant shall provide information regarding the approximate vertical location of its facilities
to excavators upon request. Nothing in this subsection is meant to limit the rights, duties, and
obligations of facility owners or excavators as set forth in Minnesota statutes sections 216D.01
through 216D.09. Any right-of-way user whose facility is less than twenty inches (20") below a
concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor in an effort
to establish and mark the exact horizontal and vertical location of its facility and the best procedure
for excavation.
1. All facilities shall be placed in appropriate portions of right-of-way so as to cause minimum
conflict with other underground facilities.
(J) Developer Responsibility: All owners, platters, or developers are responsible for complying with the
requirement of this section, and prior to final approval of any plat or development plan, shall submit
to the director written instruments from the appropriate right-of-way users showing that all
necessary arrangements with said users for installation of such facilities have been made. (Ord.
1282, 10-16-2012)
8-14-23: LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES:
(A) Placement Of Facilities: Placement, location, and relocation of bus benches, transit shelters and
all other facilities must comply with the act, with other applicable law, and with Minnesota rules
7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise
available to cities.
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 388/771
(B) Corridors: The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any particular segment
thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities that are or, pursuant to current technology,
the city expects will be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits
issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper
corridor for the facilities at issue. A typical crossing section of the location for utilities may be on file
at the director's office. This section is not intended to establish "high density corridors".
Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the corridors
established by the city may remain at that location until the city requires facilities relocation to the
corridor pursuant to relocation authority granted under Minnesota rules part 7819.3100 or other
applicable law.
(C) Limitation Of Space: To protect the public health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to protect
the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement
of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive
to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall
be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular
utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities,
the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements
and development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.
(D) Relocation Of Facilities: A registrant must promptly and at its own expense, with due regard for
seasonal working conditions, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the right-of-way
whenever the director for good cause requests such removal and relocation, and shall restore the
right-of-way consistent with PUC standards, local regulations and MnDOT standards
specifications.
The director may make such request to prevent interference by the company's equipment or
facilities with: 1) a present or future city use or the right-of-way, 2) a public improvement
undertaken by the city, 3) an economic development project in which the city has an interest or
investment, 4) when the public health, safety and welfare requires it, or 5) when necessary to
prevent interference with the safety and convenience or ordinary travel over the right-of-way.
1. Relocation Notification Procedure: The director shall notify the utility owner at least three (3)
months in advance of the need to relocate existing facilities so the owner can plan the relocation.
The director shall provide a second notification to the owner one month before the owner needs
to begin the relocation. The utility owner shall begin relocation of the facilities within one week of
the second notification. To the extent technically feasible, all utilities shall be relocated within one
month or in a time frame determined by the director. The director may allow a different schedule
if it does not interfere with the city's project. The utility owner shall diligently work to relocate the
facilities within the above schedule.
2. Delay To City Project: The director shall notify the utility owner if the owner's progress will not
meet the relocation schedule. The city may charge the utility owner for all costs incurred and
requested by a contractor working for the city who is delayed because the relocation is not
completed in the scheduled time frame and for all costs incurred by the city due to the delay.
(Ord. 1282, 10-16-2012)
8-14-24: PREEXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION:

In addition to complying with the requirements of Minnesota statutes 216D.01 through 216D.09 ("one
call excavation notice system") before the start date of any right-of-way excavation, each registrant
who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the horizontal
placement of all said facilities, to the extent technically feasible. To the extent its records contain such
information, each registrant shall provide information regarding the approximate vertical location of
their facilities to excavators upon request. Nothing in this section is meant to limit the rights, duties and
obligations of the facility owners or excavators as set forth in Minnesota statutes sections 216D.01
through 216D.09.
Any registrant whose facilities may be less than twenty inches (20") below a concrete or asphalt
surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor in an effort to establish and mark
the exact horizontal and vertical location of its facility and the best procedure for excavation. (Ord.
1282, 10-16-2012)
8-14-25: DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES:
(A) When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a
registrant's facilities to protect it, the city shall notify the local representative as early as is
reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be
paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing.
(B) Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which
it or its facilities damages. When the permittee does damage to city facilities in the right-of-way,
such as, but not limited to, culverts, road surfaces, curbs and gutters, or tile lines, it shall correct
the damage immediately to city specifications. If it does not, the city may make such repairs as
necessary and charge all of the expenses of the repairs to the permittee. The permittee shall pay
for said repairs within thirty (30) days of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of
repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during the city's response to an
emergency occasioned by that registrant's facilities. (Ord. 1282, 10-16-2012)
8-14-26: Right-of-way VACATION:
(A) Reservation Of Right: If the city vacates a right-of-way, which contains the facilities of a registrant,
the registrant's rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by Minnesota rules 7819.3200.
(Ord. 1282, 10-16-2012)
8-14-27: INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY:
(A) Limitation Of Liability: By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a
registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance with the provisions of
Minnesota rule 7819.1250 for any liability for: 1) injuries to persons, damage to property or loss of
service claims by parties other than the registrant or the city, or 2) claims or penalties of any sort
resulting from the installation, presence, maintenance or operation of equipment or facilities by
registrants or permittees or activities of registrants or permittees.
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 390/771
(B) Indemnification: To the fullest extent permitted by law, a registrant or permittee shall indemnify,

repair or operation of its equipment and facilities or out of any activity undertaken in or near a
public right-of-way, whether or not any act or omission complaint of is authorized, allowed or
prohibited by a public right-of-way permit. The foregoing does not indemnify the city from its own
negligence except from claims arising out of or alleging the city's negligence with term, condition or
purpose of a permit. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity
otherwise available to the registrant, permittee or the city, and registrant or permittee, in defending
any action on behalf of the city, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity
that the city could assert in its own behalf. In defending the city, any registrant or permittee shall
obtain the consent of the city council before settlement shall be enforced.
(C) Permits Subject To: All permits are granted subject to the ownership rights the city may have in the
property involved and to the extent that state, federal, local laws, rules and regulations allow and
said permit shall be subject to all such laws and rules. (Ord. 1282, 10-16-2012)
8-14-28: ABANDONED FACILITIES:
(A) Discontinued Operations: A registrant who has decided to discontinue all or a portion of its
operations in the city must provide information satisfactory to the director that the registrant's
obligations for its facilities in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by
another registrant.
(B) Removal: Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-way shall remove them from
the right-of-way pursuant to Minnesota rules part 7818.3300, unless this requirement is waived by

TRAFFIC SIGNAL PREEMPTION SYSTEM
9-5-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose for using the Traffic Signal Preemption System (TSPS) in Burnsville is to allow
emergency vehicles to perform emergency services in a safer and more timely manner by temporarily
controlling motorized vehicle traffic flow at signalized intersections. The City Council deems it
advisable to formulate policies and procedures for the use of the TSPS which are to be followed by
drivers of all emergency vehicles equipped with TSPS emitters so that both pedestrians and drivers of
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 399/771
motorized vehicles have adequate warning that emergency vehicles are changing normal trafficcontrol
timing at signalized intersections.
9-5-2: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this Chapter, the following terms shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them:
EMERGENCY VEHICLE: A vehicle equipped and identified according to law and operated by the
Burnsville Police and/or Fire Departments or any other vehicle so designated by State statute.
FIRE CHIEF: The Fire Chief of the City of Burnsville or his/her designee.
TRAFFIC SIGNAL PREEMPTION SYSTEM (TSPS): A traffic-control system designed for use by
emergency vehicles to improve traffic movement by temporarily controlling signalized intersections.
The TSPS is comprised of four (4) separate components: an emitter, a detector, an indicator, and a
phase selector. The emitter (a high intensity light source) is attached to the emergency vehicle and
functions like a strobe light, pulsating at a frequency in excess of ten (10) "beats" per second. As an
emergency vehicle approaches the intersection, this pulsating light is received by a detector that is
located at or near the traffic signal. The detector relays the coded message to the phase selector,
located in the traffic light control box, which then either holds the existing green light in favor of the
approaching emergency vehicle or accelerates the normal cycle of a signal change toprovide green by
the time the vehicle reaches the intersection. The indicator is a light source located near the detector
which is directed toward the oncoming emergency vehicle to indicate to the driver whether or not the
traffic light has been preempted in their favor.
9-5-3: CONDITIONS FOR USING THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL PREEMPTION SYSTEM
(TSPS):
(A) Fire Department: City-owned Fire Department vehicles shall use the TSPS while on emergency
responses only. Unless otherwise provided for herein, all other use by the Department is
prohibited. Conditions for the use of TSPS hereby become a part of the Fire Department standard
operating procedures.
(B) Police Department: City-owned Police Department vehicles shall use the TSPS while on
emergency responses only. Unless otherwise provided for herein, all other use by the Department
is prohibited. Conditions for the use of TSPS hereby become a part of the Police Department
standard operating procedures.
(C) City or County Maintenance Personnel: Dakota County or City maintenance personnel, or their
contractors under written agreement, may activate the TSPS only when testing or repairing the
system. Sirens and flashing red lights need not be used except when the test vehicle must exceed
the posted speed limits. In such instances, said test must be pre-approved and coordinated
through the Fire Chief.
(D) Emergency Vehicles Not Owned or Operated by the City: The use of TSPS within the City by non-
City emergency vehicles is allowed if said emergency vehicle is one which is recognized by the
City in which it is based. The participating organization or unit of government shall follow all
procedures prescribed by the City in utilizing the TSPS.
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 400/771

application shall be accompanied by a fee as established by city council ordinance. (Ord. 1196, 4-
6-2010)
10-5-4: VARIANCES:
(A) Purpose: The city council may grant a variance from the strict application of this title and impose
conditions and safeguards on the variance so granted only in instances where their strict
enforcement would cause practical difficulties in complying with the official control because of
circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, and may grant a variance
only when it is demonstrated that such actions will be in harmony with the general purposes and
intent of this title and when the variances are consistent with the comprehensive plan. "Practical
difficulties" as used in connection with the granting of a variance means that the property owner
proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not permitted by an official control, the plight
of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not created by the landowner, and
the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. Economic
considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties. Practical difficulties also includes, but is
not limited to, direct sunlight for solar energy systems. Variances shall be granted for earth
sheltered construction as defined in section 216C.06, subdivision 14, when in harmony with the
official controls. A variance shall not be granted to allow a use that is not allowed in the zoning
district involved.

related to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance.
(B) Application: An application for a variance shall be filed with the city planner and shall state the
unique circumstances claimed as a basis for the variance. The application shall contain at least the
following information:
1. The signature of each owner of affected property or his agent.
2. The legal description of the property and the common address.
3. A description of the variance requested and a statement demonstrating that the variance would
conform to the requirements necessary for approval.
4. The present use.
5. Any maps, drawings and plans that the city planner considers to be of value in considering the
application.
(C) Referral To Planning Commission: The application shall be referred to the planning commission for
study concerning the effect of the proposed variance upon the comprehensive plan, and upon the
character and development of the surrounding neighborhood. The planning commission shall
make a recommendation to the city council to grant or deny the variance, and may recommend
imposing conditions in the granting of the variance. The conditions may include considerations
such as location, character and other features of the proposed building.
(D) Approval; Denial: Variances require the approval of a majority vote of the city council. Variances
may be denied by motion of the city council and such motion shall constitute a determination that
the findings required for approval do not exist. No application for a variance which has been denied
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 424/771
in whole or in part shall be resubmitted within six (6) months of the date of the order of denial,
except upon grounds of new evidence or upon proof of change of conditions. The city council may
impose conditions upon the granting of a variance. The conditions may include considerations
such as location, aesthetics and other features of the proposed buildings. A condition must be
directly related to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance.
(E) Decision Period: All applications shall be reviewed consistent with Minnesota statutes section
15.99.

violation of this title and shall constitute sufficient cause for the termination of the variance by the

10-5-5: CONDITIONAL USES:
(A) Purpose: "Conditional use" means a land or development as defined by ordinance that would not
be appropriate generally but may be allowed with appropriate restrictions as provided by official
controls upon a finding that: 1) certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist, and 2)
the use or development conforms to the comprehensive land use plan of the city and 3) is
compatible with the existing neighborhood. (Ord. 1236, 6-21-2011)
(B) Application, Public Hearing, Notice And Procedure: The application, public hearing, public notice
and procedure requirements for conditional use permits shall be the same as those for
amendments as provided in section 10-5-6 of this chapter, except that the permit shall be issued
on the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire council. Although specific submittals required to
complete an application for a conditional use permit may vary with the specific use and the district
in which it is located, all applications for such permits must include at minimum a site plan that
clearly illustrates the following: proposed land use, building mapping and functions, circulation and
parking areas, planting areas and treatment, sign locations and type, basic lighting concerns, the
relationship of the proposed project to neighboring uses, environmental impacts and demand for
municipal services. (Ord. 1196, 4-6-2010)
(C) Standards: The planning commission shall recommend a conditional use permit and the council
shall issue such conditional use permits only if it finds that such use at the proposed location:
1. Will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, comfort, convenience or general
welfare of the neighborhood or the city.
2. Will be harmonious with the general and applicable specific objectives of the city's
comprehensive plan and this title.
3. Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so to be compatible in appearance with
the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and will not change the essential
character of that area.

4. Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring uses.
5. Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services, including streets, police and
fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer systems and schools; or
will be served adequately by such facilities and services provided by the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use.
6. Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for public facilities and services
and will not be detrimental to the economic welfare of the community.
7. Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and conditions of operation that
will be detrimental to any persons, property or the general welfare because of excessive
production of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors.
8. Will have vehicular approaches to the property which do not create traffic congestion or interfere
with traffic on surrounding public thoroughfares.
9. Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural, scenic or historic feature of major
importance.
10. Will not depreciate surrounding property values. (Ord. 499, 8-16-1993)
(D) Conditions: In reviewing applications for conditional use permits, the planning commission and the
council may attach whatever reasonable conditions they deem necessary to mitigate anticipated
adverse impacts associated with these uses, to protect the value of other property within the
district, and to achieve the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan. Such conditions may
include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. Controlling the number, area, bulk, height and location of such uses.
2. Regulating ingress and egress to the property and the proposed structures thereon with
particular reference to vehicle and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control,
and access in case of fire or other catastrophe.
3. Regulating off street parking and loading areas where required.
4. Utilities with reference to location availability and compatibility.
5. Berming, fencing, screening, landscaping or other facilities to protect nearby property.
6. Compatibility of appearance.
7. Regulating hours and dates of operation.
In determining such conditions, special consideration shall be given to protecting immediately
adjacent properties from objectionable views, noise, traffic and other negative characteristics
associated with such uses. (Ord. 1316, 4-8-2014)
(E) Denial For Noncompliance: If the Planning Commission recommends denial of a conditional use
permit or the Council orders such denial, it shall include in its recommendation or determination
findings as to the ways in which the proposed use does not comply with the standards required by
this title.
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 426/771

person.
(G) Periodic Review: A periodic review of the use may be attached as a condition of approval of a
conditional use permit.

violation of this title, shall be a misdemeanor and shall also constitute sufficient cause for the
termination of the conditional use permit by the City Council following a public hearing.

additional period as it deems appropriate. If the conditional use is discontinued for six (6) months,
the conditional use permit shall become void. This provision shall apply to conditional use permits
issued prior to the effective date of this title, but the six (6) month period shall not be deemed to
commence until the effective date of this title. (Ord. 499, 8-16-1993)

the public hearing process outlined in section 10-5-6 of this title. (Ord. 1467, 9-18-2018)
10-5-5A: INTERIM USES:
(A) Purpose: The purpose and intent of allowing interim uses is: 1) to allow a use for a limited period
of time that reasonably utilizes the property where it is not reasonable to utilize it in the manner
provided in the comprehensive guide; and 2) to allow a use that is presently acceptable but that,
with anticipated development, will not be acceptable in the future.
(B) Application, Public Hearing, Notice And Procedure: The application, public hearing, public notice

deemed appropriate for permission of the use, including a condition that the owner will provide
an appropriate financial surety to cover the cost of removing the interim use and any interim
structures upon the expiration of the interim use permit. (Ord. 1196, 4-6-2010)
(D) Termination: An interim use permit shall terminate upon the occurrence of any of the following
events; whichever first occurs:
1. The date stated in the permit; or
2. A violation of conditions under which the permit was issued; or
3. A change in the City's zoning regulations which renders the use nonconforming. (Ord. 499, 8-
16-1993)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
10-7-1: PURPOSE:
(A) Primary Purpose: Excessive uniformity, dissimilarity, inappropriateness or poor quality of design in
the exterior appearance of structures and the lack of proper attention to site development and
landscaping in the City hinder the harmonious development of the City, impair the desirability of
residences, investment or occupation in the City, limit the opportunity to attain the optimum use
and value of land and improvements, adversely affect the stability and value of property, produce
degeneration of conditions affecting the peace, health and welfare of the City, and destroy a proper
relationship between the taxable value of property and the cost of Municipal services. A primary
purpose of this title is to eliminate such problems.
(B) Maintenance Of Certain Standards: The maintenance of certain standards is essential to ensure
compatible relationships between land uses within a community. All uses allowed, as either
permitted or conditional uses within the City's various zoning districts, shall conform to the
following general provisions and performance standards. (Ord. 244, 11-15-1982)
(C) Substitution Clause: The owner of any image which is otherwise allowed by this Code may
substitute noncommercial speech in lieu of any other commercial speech or noncommercial
speech. This substitution of copy may be made without any additional approval or permitting. The
purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over
noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial speech over any other
noncommercial speech. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary.
(Ord. 1265, 5-22-2012)

replacement, restoration, maintenance, or improvement, but not including expansion, unless:
1. The nonconformity or occupancy is discontinued for a period of more than one year; or
2. Any nonconforming use is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater than fifty
percent (50%) of its estimated market value, as indicated in the records of the county assessor
at the time of damage, and no building permit has been applied for within one hundred eighty
(180) days of when the property is damaged. In this case, the city council may impose
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

occupancy.
(C) Nothing in this title shall prevent a property owner from putting a structure in safe condition after
the structure has been declared unsafe by the building inspector.

started within six (6) months of the effective date of this title or amendment thereof and continues
to completion within one year.
(E) A lawful nonconforming use of a structure or land may be changed to a more restrictive
nonconforming use. Once a structure or parcel of land has been placed in a more restrictive
nonconforming use, it shall not return to a less restrictive nonconforming use.
(F) Alterations may be made to a building containing lawful nonconforming residential units when they
will improve the livability thereof, provided they will not increase the number of dwelling units. (Ord.
1226, 1-18-2011)
(G) Improvements may be made to existing lawful nonconforming structures, provided that such
improvements shall not enlarge the structure by fifty percent (50%) or more and provided the new
improvements meet all other performance standards of the building code, fire code and this title.
(Ord. 1353, 9-8-2015)
(H) For structures located outside of a FEMA floodplain, building up above the existing footprint of a
structure does not constitute an increase in the nonconformity.
(I) Any expansion of the footprint of a nonconforming structure shall be in conformance with this title.
(J) Parcels with legal nonconforming green space may make improvements and footprint alterations
as long as the green space is not further decreased.
(K) A nonconforming use of a structure or land shall not be moved to any other part of the parcel upon
which it was conducted or located at the time of adoption or amendment to this title unless the
movement will reduce the nonconformity.

FOOD SERVICE . Go to new ordinance.
10-7-26: GENERAL PARKING AND ACCESS REQUIREMENTS:
(A) Purpose: Regulation of off street parking is to alleviate congestion of the public streets and to
promote the safety and general welfare of the public by establishing minimum requirements for off
street parking and the loading and unloading of vehicles and/or containers in accordance with the
use of various parcels of land and structures. (Ord. 1196, 4-6-2010)
(B) Compliance:
1. Permits Prior To Effective Date: Structures or uses for which a building permit has been issued
prior to August 19, 2008 (the effective date of this section), shall be exempt from the parking
requirements in this section if the structure is completed within six (6) months after the effective
date of this section.
2. Compliance Required: All new development, full redevelopment, and all redevelopment that
results in disturbance of one-half (1/2) acre or more or the addition of five thousand (5,000)
square feet of impervious surface shall comply with the requirements of this section.
3. Change In Use: A change in use or occupancy shall require adequate parking for the new use. If
the new use calls for less parking, the extra parking stalls may be removed by the owner. If the
new use calls for additional parking, it shall be provided.
(C) Application Of Off Street Parking Regulations: The regulations and requirements set forth in this
section shall apply to off street parking facilities in all zoning districts.
(D) Site Plan Drawing: All applications for a building or occupancy permit shall be accompanied by a

building occupancy on which the parking has been calculated. (Ord. 1132, 8-19-2008)
(E) General Provisions:
1. Calculating Parking Space:
a. Fractions: When the calculation of the number of required off street parking spaces results in
a fraction, each fraction of one-half (1/2) or more shall constitute another space.
b. Individual Activities Within Use: When computing total number of parking spaces required for
a use, individual activities within the use will be calculated separately and added together to
arrive at the total required parking spaces for each specific use proposed.

3. Alternative Parking CUP: The city recognizes reuse of sites and that the strict interpretation of
the parking standards of this section may not be appropriate for each specific use or lot.
Therefore, the city council may approve alternative parking standards through the conditional
use permit process provided the applicant can demonstrate, based upon documented parking
studies and site specific analysis, that a need exists to provide more or fewer parking stalls than
the maximum or minimum parking standards or to deviate from pervious paving/paver system
standards. Factors to be considered in such determination include (without limitation) national
parking standards, parking standards for similar businesses or land uses, size of building, type
of use, number of employees, expected volume and turnover of customer traffic and expected
frequency and number of delivery or service vehicles and appropriate soils and/or site conditions
to support pervious paving/paver systems. (Ord. 1132, 8-19-2008)
(F) Design Standards:

two (2) doors shall be separated a minimum of twenty feet (20') apart.
19. ADUs shall be constructed on a permanent foundation with no wheels.
20. The primary residence and ADU shall be constructed and maintained in compliance with the
property maintenance regulations set forth in this Code.
21. The primary residence and ADU shall be served by one shared Municipal water, sanitary
sewer, gas and electric utility service. Except in the R-1A Zoning District, if not served by sewer
and water the primary residence and ADU shall meet the private well and septic requirements
according to section 10-13-5 of this title.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 494/771
(A) Wetlands Overlay District: Wetlands and public waters wetlands help maintain water quality, serve
to reduce flooding and erosion, act as sources of food and habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife,
and are an integral part of the community's natural landscape. Wetlands provide the aesthetic
benefits of open space and can be used to provide a natural separation of land uses. It is the intent
of this overlay district to establish a policy of sound stewardship through coordination of
regulations, which conserve, protect, enhance, and result in the no net loss of these
environmentally sensitive resources. In addition, it is the intent of the city to promote the restoration
of degraded wetlands. This overlay district is adopted in part to implement the wetland
conservation act of 1991 (Minnesota laws 1991, chapter 354, as amended), and the accompanying
rules of the Minnesota board of water and soil resources (Minnesota rules chapter 8420, as
amended). (Ord. 732, 9-21-1998)
(B) Soil Erosion Overlay District: There are areas within the city which, due to certain slopes or
unstable soils, create ecological problems including siltation and pollution of water bodies and
streams due to excessive erosion and runoff and present threats to the public safety in the form of
landslide and mudslide dangers. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is:
To promote the public safety by minimizing the hazards of certain slopes and unstable soils and
promote public health by reducing the siltation and pollution of water bodies and streams, and
promote the general welfare by preserving significant features of the natural character of slopes
and conditioning development in a manner that minimizes the above enumerated threats to the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. (Ord. 1265, 5-22-2012)
(C) Restrictive Soils Overlay District: Areas within the city are characterized by certain soil types,
slopes and water levels which, without proper corrective action, are unsuitable for development.
Inappropriate development in those areas increases soil erosion and sedimentation, the
introduction of toxic materials into groundwater, encourages pollution, destroys ecological and
natural resources, and requires expenditures of public funds to correct deficiencies thereby acting
to the detriment of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Burnsville. Therefore, the
purpose of this chapter is:
To provide for the regulation of development on restrictive soils in such a way as to minimize the
risk of environmental damage and to protect private homeowners and governmental units from
incurring high maintenance and capital costs resulting from the necessity to correct deficiencies
encountered as a result of development on poorly suited soils.
(D) Woodland Overlay District: The preservation of trees and woodlands within the city is critical to the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, as well as those of the metropolitan area.
Existing and potential development within the city and the metropolitan area has the effect of
reducing and in some cases eliminating wooded areas, which, if preserved and maintained, serve
important ecological, recreational and aesthetic functions to the benefit of present and future
residents of the city. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is:
To preserve woodlands and trees on individual sites, protect the safety of the residents by
preventing wind and water erosion, slope instability and rapid runoff, promote the health of the
residents by absorption of air pollutants, contaminants and noise; increasing rainfall infiltration to
the water table, provide a diversified environment for many kinds of animals and plants necessary
for wildlife maintenance and important to the aesthetic values and recreational requirements of the
area and promote energy conservation by shading buildings in the summer and breaking winds in
the winter.

(E) Shoreland Overlay District:
1. Statutory Authorization: This shoreland ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authorization and
policies contained in Minnesota statutes, chapter 103F, Minnesota regulations, parts 6120.2500 -
6120.3900, and the planning and zoning enabling legislation in Minnesota statutes, chapter 462.
2. Policy: The uncontrolled use of shorelands of Burnsville, Minnesota, affects the public health,
safety and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution of public waters, but also by
impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the public health, safety and
welfare to provide for the wise subdivision, use and development of shorelands of public waters.
The legislature of Minnesota has delegated responsibility to local governments of the state to
regulate the subdivision, use and development of the shorelands of public waters and thus
preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve the economic and natural
environmental values of shorelands, and provide for the wise use of waters and related land
resources. This responsibility is hereby recognized by Burnsville, hereinafter referred to as "the
city".
3. Jurisdiction: The shoreland overlay district provisions of this chapter shall apply to the
shorelands of the public water bodies as classified in subsection 10-8-10(B) of this chapter.
Pursuant to Minnesota regulations, parts 6120.2500 through 6120.3900, no lake, pond, or
flowage less than ten (10) acres in size in municipalities needs to be regulated in a local
government's shoreland regulations. A body of water created by a private user where there was
no previous shoreland may, at the discretion of the city, be exempt from this chapter.
4. Compliance: The use of any shoreland of public waters; the size and shape of lots; the use,
size, type and location of structures on lots; the installation and maintenance of water supply and
waste treatment systems; the grading and filling of any shoreland area; the cutting of shoreland
vegetation; and the subdivision of land shall be in full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. (Ord. 732, 9-21-1998)
(F) Stormwater Overlay District: The management of stormwater runoff from land is critical to the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. Quality and quantity of runoff directly affects
the ecological and physical environments including soil erosion, flooding, water pollution and
aquatic life. Therefore, the purposes of this chapter are:
To accommodate anticipated development while controlling the quality and quantity of stormwater
runoff and properly managing and protecting surface groundwater resources and thereby
implement the water resources management plan and set forth stormwater management
performance standards which apply to all land disturbance activities.
Specific purposes are to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions; prevent and
control the adverse effects of stormwater, prevent and control soil erosion, prevent and control
water pollution, protect spawning grounds, fish and aquatic life; control exceedance of the safe
capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies; prevent undue channel erosion;
control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter; prevent conditions that
endanger downstream property; and control building sites, placement of structures, areas of
impervious surface and promote sound economic growth. (Ord. 865, 12-2-2002)
(G) Drinking Water Protection Overlay District: The purpose and intent of this overlay district is to:
1. Acknowledge that certain areas within the city are highly susceptible to drinking water
contamination, based on location of wells, surface water supply, and geomorphology;
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 496/771
2. Provide for land uses that are compatible with the protection of the drinking water supply, while
providing performance standards for uses that may put the aquifer at risk;
3. Provide performance standards for land uses that have the potential to be detrimental to the
drinking water supply. (Ord. 1344, 6-2-2015)

(F) Wetland Alteration: An applicant for a permit to alter a wetland shall adhere to the following
principles in descending order of priority:
1. Filling must be consistent with the city's wetland protection and management plan and the water
resources management plan;
2. Minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its
implementation;
3. Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland activity and its
implementation;
4. Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations
during the life of the activity; and
5. Filling in wetland areas must be mitigated in accordance with the requirements of this chapter
and the city's wetland protection and management plan.
A permit shall not be issued unless the proposed development complies within the mitigation
provisions of subsection (K) of this section, as well as the standards, intent, and purpose of this
section.
(G) Permit Required: Drainage, grading, filling, removal of healthy native vegetation, or otherwise
altering or destroying a wetland and any land within the minimum permanent buffer zone as shown
in subsection (E) of this section of a delineated wetland boundary requires a permit. Activity in a
wetland requiring a permit includes, but is not limited to:
1. Construction of new streets and utilities.
2. Creation of ponds or dams and alterations of the natural drainageways of watercourses. This
shall only be allowed as part of a mitigation project, or to restore or improve the function and
value of the wetland.
3. Installation of boardwalks.
4. Discharge of stormwater runoff in a manner that impacts the wetland.
(H) Filling: When a permit is issued allowing filling in a wetland, the following standards shall be
followed:
1. Filling must be consistent with the water resources management plan.
2. Filling shall not cause the total natural nutrient stripping capacity of the wetland to be diminished
to an extent that is detrimental to any area river, lake, or stream.
3. Only fill free of chemical pollutants and organic wastes may be used.
4. Filling in wetlands will not be permitted during waterfowl breeding season or fish spawning
season, unless it is demonstrated to the city's satisfaction that the wetland is not used for
waterfowl breeding or fish spawning.

measures.
7. Dredging in any wetland is prohibited during waterfowl breeding season or fish spawning
season, unless it is demonstrated to the city's satisfaction that the wetland is not used for
waterfowl breeding or fish spawning.
8. Dredging in wetlands must be mitigated in accordance with the requirements of this title if the
activity results in a loss of functional wetland. Dredging to create water quality improvement
basins may be allowed by the city where reasonable alternatives are not available or where the
wetland is of low quality and designated for this purpose by the city's wetland protection and
management plan and the water resources management plan.
(J) Stormwater Runoff: When a permit is issued allowing stormwater runoff to discharge directly into a
wetland, the following standard shall be followed:
Stormwater runoff from a development may be directed to the wetland if permitted by the city's
wetland protection and management plan and the water resources management plan. Sheet flow
and other overland drainage of runoff shall be encouraged.
(K) Mitigation:
1. Mitigation Intent: Where wetland alteration is approved and mitigation is required, mitigation
must result in an improvement to the wetland function and value. Mitigation plans must address
water quality, improvement, and maintenance of preexisting hydrological balance and wildlife
habitat. The wetland function and value will include improvement of water quality, maintaining
hydrological balance, and provision of wildlife habitat. Mitigation will be performed at ratios
required by state law to achieve replacement of the wetland function and value.
2. Mitigation Standards: Mitigation of wetlands for function and value should be restored, created,
and enhanced to have the following characteristics:
a. Relatively stable water levels subject to natural fluctuations.
b. Pretreatment of inflow waters to improve quality.
c. High level of upland/lowland intermingling.
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 501/771
d. A ratio of open water to aquatic vegetation between one to one (1:1) and one to two (1:2).
e. High degree of intermingling of open water and aquatic vegetation.
f. High level of plant species diversity.
g. Restoration of native plant species in upland and lowland areas.
h. Undisturbed upland/lowland edge (i.e., buffer).
i. Meandered wetland edge.
j. Irregular bottom contours - mix of shallow and deep water.
k. Shallow side and bottom slopes - preferable ten to one (10:1) to thirty to one (30:1) around
and within wetland; steeper slopes may be used to provide open water and greater vegetation
variability.
3. Mitigation Techniques:
a. Mitigation shall be performed at a ratio required by state law.
b. Mitigation shall result in no net loss to the wetland function and value. The wetland function
and value will include improvement of water quality, maintaining hydrological balance, and
provision of wildlife habitat.
c. Mitigation shall provide a buffer strip as set forth in this chapter. The buffer strip acreage may
be included in the total acreage for mitigation purposes to the extent allowed pursuant to
Minnesota rules 8420.0540.
d. Mitigation shall maintain or enhance the wetland hydrological balance through the following:
(1) Restoration of drained or partially drained wetlands.
(2) Restoration of degraded wetlands.
(3) Creation of new wetlands.
e. If stormwater is channeled into a wetland, mitigation shall provide for pretreatment of
water prior to it entering the wetland to improve water quality.
f. The buffer strip landscape shall provide for wildlife cover and utilize a diversity of native
flora (i.e., trees, shrubs, grasses, herbaceous plants) to encourage wildlife diversity, provide
visual variety, and provide nesting and food for wildlife.
g. Wetland mitigation should be undertaken on site. If this is not feasible as demonstrated to
the city, mitigation should occur in accordance with the requirements of the wetland
conservation act.
4. Construction Management And Long Term Wetland Maintenance:
a. The permit holder shall follow the urban best management practices to minimize direct
impacts due to erosion and construction practices and to safeguard wildlife habitat.

b. The permit holder shall conduct a monitoring program in accordance with the requirements of
the wetland conservation act. A letter of credit in the amount of the estimated construction costs
of the mitigation plan from the permit holder shall be held to ensure compliance. The letter of
credit shall be in the form approved by the city and shall be from an FDIC insured local bank.
The letter of credit may be reduced to twenty five percent (25%) if the city approves the
mitigation construction and the permit holder provides the city with as built plans showing
compliance with the approved mitigation plans. At the end of the monitoring period, the city will
release the last twenty five percent (25%) of the letter of credit if the permit holder demonstrates
compliance with the designed wetland as built plans.
Where feasible, the city shall require the permit holder to satisfy long term management
requirements.
(L) Application And Issuance Of Permit:
1. The applicant for a permit shall furnish the information required by the city including, but not
limited to, a site plan, topographic data, hydrological data, and an assessment of the functions
and value of the impacted wetland (MnRAM assessment) for the review of a wetland alteration
permit application. The director of parks and natural resources shall use discretion regarding the
level and complexity of information required to review the request. A wetland alteration permit

council following requirements and time schedules of Minnesota rules 8420.0230. The applicant
shall have the burden of proving that the proposed use or activity complies with the purpose,
intent, and other provisions of this chapter. The city council may establish reasonable conditions
which are specifically set forth in the permit to ensure compliance with requirements contained in
this title. Such conditions may, among other matters, limit the size, kind, or character of the
proposed work; require the construction of other structures; require replacement of vegetation
and wetland function and value; establish required monitoring procedures and maintenance
activity; state the work over time; require the alteration of the site design to ensure buffering; and
require the provision of a performance security.
2. The director of parks and natural resources or designee shall serve on the technical evaluation
panel. Decisions under this section must not be made until after receiving the determination of
the technical evaluation panel regarding wetland public values, location, size, and/or type if the
city council, the landowner, or a member of the technical evaluation panel asks for such
determinations. This requirement does not apply to wetlands for which such data is included in
an approved comprehensive wetland protection and management plan per Minnesota rules
8420.0650. The city council may seek and consider recommendations, if any, made by the
technical evaluation panel in making replacement plan decisions.
3. Decisions made under this section concerning implementation of the wetland conservation act
may be appealed to the board of water and soil resources under Minnesota rules 8420.0250.

10-8-8: CONTROLLING EROSION AND SEDIMENT FROM LAND DISTURBING
ACTIVITIES:
(A) Purpose: The purpose of this section is to control or eliminate stormwater pollution along with soil
erosion and sedimentation within the city. It establishes standards and specifications for
conservation practices and planning activities designed to minimize stormwater pollution, soil
erosion and sedimentation.
(B) Compliance: Any person, firm, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, state agency, or
political subdivision proposing a land disturbance activity that involves ninety (90) or more cubic
yards of earthwork shall comply with the requirements of this section. The city engineer may
require that any land disturbing activity that does not meet the above requirements but has the
potential for generating stormwater pollution due to erosion and sediment control issues be
required to comply with portions of this section.
The following general criteria are minimum city requirements for controlling erosion and
sedimentation from "land disturbing activities". These general criteria do not replace the
requirement for individually developed erosion and sediment control plans; however, they do
establish minimum standards of soil conservation practice which apply to all land disturbing
projects.
Nothing in the general criteria shall limit the right of the city to impose additional or more stringent
standards for controlling erosion and sedimentation during the plan approval and construction

correction and the amount of financial security.
(H) Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: It is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this section shall prevail. (Ord. 1162, 5-19-2009)
10-8-9: WOODLAND PROTECTION STANDARDS:
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 508/771
No development shall be allowed or development permit issued within the city of Burnsville until the
council finds that the development will comply with the following:
(A) Woodland Preservation: To the extent possible, woodlands shall be preserved by locating
structures in existing clearings and by the use of other innovation design techniques.
(B) Undeveloped Land: No coniferous trees six feet (6') or taller or deciduous trees four inches (4") or
greater in diameter as measured at four and one-half feet (41/2') above the ground shall be
removed from undeveloped property without a tree removal permit, or as part of a city approved
development of the property. A woodland evaluation worksheet is required on all new development
projects. Any trees removed prior to development, through a tree removal permit, shall be included
in future woodland removal calculations. For purposes of calculating woodland values, trees in
existence as of November 15, 1982 (date of original woodland ordinance), shall be included. While
development shall retain the maximum amount of woodland possible, it is recognized that a certain
amount of woodland removal is an inevitable consequence of the urban development process.
The threshold of clearing for each zoning district, beyond which reforestation shall be required, is
as follows: (Ord. 1265, 5-22-2012)
Zoning District Woodland Removal Threshold1
CD, P 20 percent
CRD 30 percent
R-1, R-1A 40 percent
R-2, R-3A, R-3B, R-3D 50 percent
B-1, B-2 50 percent
B-3, B-4, MIX 60 percent
I-1, I-2, I-3, GIM, GIH 60 percent
Note:
1. Applies only to deciduous trees 4 inches or greater in diameter at 4.5 feet above the
ground and coniferous trees 6 feet or taller.
(Ord. 1265, 5-22-2012; amd. Ord. 1277, 9-18-2012)
(C) Developed Land: Property owners may remove trees (unless restricted by a CUP or PUD or other
development agreement) under the following circumstances:
1. In all zoning districts, any deciduous trees less than four inches (4") in diameter, at four and onehalf
feet (41/2') above the ground, and any dying or dead trees. No permit is required.
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 509/771
2. On residential lots under two (2) acres, any tree. No permit is required.
3. On residential lots of two (2) or more acres, and all other zoning districts, up to the tree removal
threshold identified in subsection (B) of this section. Removal of trees requires a tree removal
permit and reforestation for trees removed beyond the identified thresholds. (Ord. 1247, 9-20-
2011)
(D) Preservation Of Trees: Trees, which are committed to preservation through permit or agreement,
shall be surveyed by the developer or landowner. A replacement value for each tree will be
determined by the city using the city's shade tree evaluation method. Letter of credit for the value
of trees which are to be preserved beyond the removal threshold under this chapter shall be at the
rate of one and one-half (11/2) times the determined valuation.
The city's standard letter of credit form shall be used. The letter(s) of credit will be released when
the following conditions are met:
1. Eighteen (18) months have passed from the end of construction (determined by the issuance of
a certificate of occupancy) in the area for which the letter(s) of credit were collected.
2. An inspection by city staff has verified that the trees which were to be preserved are in good
condition.
Exceptions to the above will be considered if unique circumstances exist. Exceptions must be
reviewed and approved by both the city forester and planning staff.
(E) Additional Tree Removal: The city may permit additional tree removal by requiring reforestation in
adjacent areas such as yard setbacks, outlots, or park lands. A tree removal permit to exceed the
identified removal threshold will only be issued after review by the city forester and planning staff to
ensure that the best available layout has been used to preserve significant trees and woodland
areas. Reforestation shall occur in an amount equal to 1.5 times the value of the trees removed
beyond the tree removal threshold. The value of the trees removed shall be determined by the
shade tree evaluation method. Reforestation plans shall not include the use of any of the tree
species which are currently on the city's list of "species which do not meet reforestation
requirements". No more than twenty five percent (25%) of the reforestation plan shall consist of
any one species, including shrubs provided on any related landscape plan.
(F) Detrimental Activity Prohibited: Grading, contouring, paving, compaction of soils, or any excavation
or trenching shall not occur within the drip line of tree preservation areas. Such activity has a
detrimental effect on the aeration and permeability of the soils and causes permanent damage to
the primary root zone of trees.
(G) Measures: Measures shall be taken to protect and preserve the woodlands as described in the
city's "Practical Guide To Preventing Construction Damage To Trees".
(H) Damaged Trees: Notwithstanding the above, the removal of dead or dying trees seriously
damaged by storm, other acts of nature, or disease is not prohibited. Trees removed due to acts of
nature do not require reforestation.
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 510/771
(I) Construction Sites: No movement and placement of equipment or materials storage shall be
permitted outside the building activity area or in the tree preservation area. All buildings and
driveways shall be located to avoid tree damage consistent with minimum building setback
requirements of the zoning ordinance. The tree preservation area shall be temporarily fenced (with
highly visible 4 foot high fencing) by the developer during all construction so that all trees in the
tree preservation area shall be preserved. The city manager or designee shall have the authority to
stop construction on the site until adequate barriers have been constructed. If a barrier is
constructed on the site and is not adequately maintained in a manner which protects the tree
preservation area, the city manager or designee shall have the authority to stop construction until
the barrier is repaired.
(J) Permits: Permits authorizing removal of trees may be issued by the city manager or designee in
circumstances when the issuance of such a permit is found to be consistent with the purpose of
this section.
In all cases of permit application, the city manager or designee shall use reasonable interpretations
of the circumstances in determining whether or not the permit should be issued. (Ord. 1226, 1-18-
2011)
(K) Tree Contractor License Required: Tree contractors shall obtain a license as required by title 3,
chapter 29 of this code.
(L) Appeals: The property owner may appeal to the planning commission and city council any decision
made by the city manager or other city official under the provisions of this section within thirty (30)
days of the decision being rendered. (Ord. 1316, 4-8-2014)
10-8-10: SHORELAND OVERLAY DISTRICT:
(A) Administration:
1. Permits Required:
a. A permit is required for the construction of buildings or building additions (and including such
related activities as construction of decks and signs), the installation and/or alteration of
sewage treatment systems, and those grading and filling activities not exempted by
subsection (C)3 of this section. Application for a permit shall be made to the city manager, or
his or her designee, on the forms provided. The application shall include the necessary
information so that the city manager, or his or her designee, can determine the site's suitability
for the intended use and that a compliant sewage treatment system will be provided.
b. A permit authorizing an addition to an existing structure shall stipulate that an identified
nonconforming sewage treatment system, as defined by subsection (C)8 of this section, shall
be either brought into compliance or eliminated according to the provisions of title 7, chapter
11 of this code.
2. Certificate Of Zoning Compliance: The city manager, or his or her designee, shall issue a
certificate of zoning compliance for each activity requiring a permit as specified in subsection
(A)1 of this section. This certificate shall specify that the use of land conforms to the
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 511/771
requirements of this chapter. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized by permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and shall be punishable as
provided in subsection 10-8-4(D) of this chapter.
3. Variances:
a. Variances may only be granted in accordance with Minnesota statutes 462 and section 10-5-4
of this title as applicable. A variance may not circumvent the general purposes and intent of
this chapter. No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is prohibited in the
zoning district in which the subject property is located. Conditions may be imposed in the
granting of a variance to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent properties and the public
interest. In considering a variance request, the city council must also consider whether the
property owner has reasonable use of the land without the variance, whether the property is
used seasonally or year round, whether the variance is being requested solely on the basis of
economic considerations, and the characteristics of development on adjacent properties. (Ord.
621, 5-20-1996)
b. In order to preserve water quality, the city will require a natural vegetated buffer strip on
riparian lots as a mitigation measure with any variances granted. This includes variances to
the OHWL setback, other setbacks and yard requirements, impervious surface, etc. The buffer
strip must run parallel to and extend landward from the OHWL, with an average width of no
less than twenty feet (20'). The buffer strip must be planted with native vegetation as approved
by the city, and must not be mowed, cut or fertilized. A pervious twenty foot (20') wide, or
twenty percent (20%) of the lot width at the shoreline (whichever is less) walkway or path may
be established across the width of the buffer strip to allow access to a beach, dock or other
amenity. If a beach is established landward of the OHWL, the buffer strip can be moved
further landward to accommodate it.
c. The city council shall hear and decide requests for variances in accordance with the rules that
it has adopted for the conduct of business. When a variance is approved after the department
of natural resources has formally recommended denial in the hearing record, the notification of
the approved variance required in subsection (A)4b of this section shall also include the city
council's summary of the public record/testimony and the findings of facts and conclusions
which supported the issuance of the variance.
d. For existing developments, the application for a variance must clearly demonstrate whether a
conforming sewage treatment system is present for the intended use of the property. The
variance, if issued, must require that a nonconforming sewage treatment system be either
brought into compliance or eliminated according to the provisions of chapter 11 of this title.
(Ord. 884, 6-2-2003)
4. Notifications To The Department Of Natural Resources:
a. Copies of all notices of any public hearings and reviews to consider variances, amendments,
or conditional and interim uses under local shoreland management controls must be sent to
the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked at least
ten (10) days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to consider proposed subdivisions/plats
must include copies of the subdivision/plat.

b. A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats, and final decisions granting
variances or conditional and interim uses under local shoreland management controls must be
sent to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked
within ten (10) days of final action.
(B) Shoreland Classification System And Land Use Districts:
1. Shoreland Classification System: The public waters of the city have been classified in this
subsection consistent with the criteria found in Minnesota regulations part 6120.3300, and the
protected waters inventory map for Dakota County, Minnesota.
a. The shoreland area for the water bodies listed in subsections (B)1b and (B)1c of this section

c. Special Provisions:
(1) Only land above the ordinary high water level of public waters can be used to meet lot area
standards. The lot width is the horizontal distance between the side lot lines, measured on a
straight line that is as perpendicular to the side lot lines as possible, and that is parallel with
the front lot line, as defined in section 10-4-2 of this title. The width standard must be met at
both the ordinary high water level and at the building line. For lots with irregular front lot
lines and/or shorelines, the width shall be measured on a straight line that is as
perpendicular to the side lot lines as possible, and that is no closer to the front lot line and/or
the shoreline than any portion of the building line and/or the ordinary high water level,
respectively. The sewer lot area dimensions in subsection (C)1a of this section can only be
used if publicly owned sewer system service is available to the property.
(2) Subdivisions of duplexes, triplexes, and quads on natural environment (NE) lakes must
also meet the following standards:
(a) Each building must be set back at least two hundred feet (200') from the ordinary high
water level;
(b) Each building must have public sanitary sewer and water service;

shore or bluff impact zones; and
(b) The movement of more than ninety (90) cubic yards of material outside of steep slopes
and shore and bluff impact zones.
(4) The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to during the issuance of
construction permits, grading and filling permits, conditional and interim use permits,
variances and subdivision approvals:
(a) Grading or filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 wetland must be evaluated to determine
how extensively the proposed activity would affect the following functional qualities of the
wetland. This evaluation must also include a determination of whether the wetland
alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews, or approvals by other local, State, or
Federal agencies such as a watershed district, the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources, or the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The applicant shall be so
advised:
i. Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;

conditional, or interim uses and do not adversely affect adjacent or nearby properties; and
(k) Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of the shoreline and
placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished slope does not exceed three feet
(3') horizontal to one foot (1') vertical, the landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet
(10') of the ordinary high water level, and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high
water level does not exceed three feet (3').
(5) Connections To Public Waters: Excavations where the intended purpose is connection to a
public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors, must be controlled by local
shoreland controls. Permission for excavations may be given only after the Commissioner
has approved the proposed connection to public waters.
4. Placement And Design Of Roads, Driveways, And Parking Areas:
a. Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take advantage of natural
vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view from public waters.
Documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that all roads and parking areas are
designed and constructed to minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the
field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district, or other applicable
technical material.
b. Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and must not be placed
within bluff and shore impact zones, when other reasonable and feasible placement
alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may be placed within these areas, and must be
designed to minimize adverse impacts.
c. Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and access related parking
areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided the vegetative screening and
erosion control conditions of this subsection are met. For private facilities, the grading and

must be shielded or directed to prevent illumination out across public waters; and
iii. Other outside lighting may be located within the shore impact zone or over public
waters if it is used primarily to illuminate potential safety hazards and is shielded or
otherwise directed to prevent direct illumination out across public waters. All outside
lighting must comply with section 10-7-36 of this title. This does not preclude use of
navigational lights.
(2) Uses without water oriented needs must be located on lots or parcels without public water
frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with public water frontage, must either be set back
double the normal ordinary high water level setback or be substantially screened from view
from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
b. Extractive Use Standards:

(4) The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed or screened.
10. Nonconforming Sewage Treatment Systems:
a. A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of subsection (C)8 of this section
shall be considered to be nonconforming and must be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a
permit or variance of any type is required for any improvement on, or use of, the property. For
the purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered
nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system's improper setback from
the ordinary high water level.
b. The city council has by formal resolution notified the commissioner of its program to identify
nonconforming sewage treatment systems. The city of Burnsville will require upgrading or
replacement of any nonconforming system identified by this program within a reasonable

6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 528/771
requirements of subsection (C)8 of this section and the requirements of chapter 11 of this title
shall be considered to be nonconforming. Systems using cesspools, leaching pits, seepage
pits, or other deep disposal methods, or systems with less soil treatment area separation
above groundwater than required by the Minnesota pollution control agency's chapter 7080 for
design of on site sewage treatment systems, shall also be considered nonconforming. (Ord.
1196, 4-6-2010)
(E) Subdivision/Platting Provisions:
1. Land Suitability: Each lot created through subdivision must be suitable in its natural state for the
proposed use with minimal alteration. Suitability analysis by the city shall consider susceptibility
to flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for
development, severe erosion potential, steep topography, inadequate water supply or sewage
treatment capabilities, near shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for water based recreation,
important fish and wildlife habitat, presence of significant historic sites, or any other feature of
the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of future residents of the
proposed subdivision or of the community.
2. Consistency With Other Controls: Subdivisions must conform to all official controls of the city. A
subdivision will not be approved where a later variance from one or more standards in official
controls would be needed to use the lots for their intended purpose. In areas not served by
publicly owned sewer and water systems, a subdivision will not be approved unless domestic
water supply is available and a sewage treatment system consistent with subsections (C)1 and
(C)8 of this section can be provided for every lot. Each lot shall meet the minimum lot size and
dimensional requirements of subsection (C)1 of this section, including at least a minimum
contiguous lawn area, that is free of limiting factors sufficient for the construction of two (2)
standard soil treatment systems. Lots that would require use of holding tanks must not be
approved.

Chapter 10
FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
10-10-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE:
(A) Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the state of Minnesota has, in Minnesota statutes
chapter 103F and 462.357 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore the city council of the city of Burnsville,
Minnesota, does ordain as follows.
(B) Findings Of Fact:
1. Flood Hazard Areas: The flood hazard areas of the city of Burnsville are subject to periodic
inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
2. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards: This chapter is based upon a reasonable method of
analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Minnesota
department of natural resources.
3. National Flood Insurance Program Compliance: This chapter is adopted to comply with the rules
and regulations of the national flood insurance program codified as 44 code of federal
regulations parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the national
flood insurance program.
(C) Statement Of Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in subsection (B)1 of this section by
provisions contained herein. (Ord. 1250, 10-18-2011)
This section has been affected by a recently passed ordinance, 1491 - MISC ZONING
AMENDMENTS. Go to new ordinance.
10-10-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
(A) Land To Which Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the
city of Burnsville shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments thereto as being located
within the boundaries of the floodway, flood fringe, and general floodplain districts.
(B) Official Zoning Map: The official zoning map, together with all materials attached thereto is hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The attached material shall include
the flood insurance study, Dakota County, Minnesota, and incorporated areas, volumes 1, 2, 3, and
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

flood insurance rate map panels therein numbered 27037C0060E, 27037C0065E, 27037C0070E,
27037C0080E, 27037C0090E, 27037C0177E, 27037C0179E, 27037C0181E, 27037C0182E,
27037C0183E, 27037C0184E, 27037C0201E, and 27037C0203E, all dated December 2, 2011,
and prepared by the federal emergency management agency. The official zoning map shall be
kept on file in the community development department.
(C) Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an
elevation no lower than one foot (1') above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increase in
flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a
floodway.
(D) Interpretation:
1. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum
requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
2. The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official
zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the
district as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the
decision of the city planner, the city council shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions
will be based on elevation on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that
existed on the site at the time the city adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the date of the
first national flood insurance program map (March 29, 1974) showing the area within the 100-
year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of
the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the board of
adjustment and to submit technical evidence.
(E) Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or
impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
(F) Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodplain

customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure.
BASEMENT: Any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade
(below ground level) on all four (4) sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground
level. This definition of basement is for interpreting and administering only the provisions of this
chapter dealing with floodplain regulations and is distinct from the definition that applies to the
other chapters of this title.
CONDITIONAL USE: A specific type of structure or land use listed in the official control that may
be allowed but only after an in depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or
restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that:
1. Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.
2. The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive plan and is compatible with
the existing neighborhood.
EQUAL DEGREE OF ENCROACHMENT: A method of determining the location of floodway
boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a
proportionate share of flood flows.
FLOOD: A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or
lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
FLOOD FREQUENCY: The frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or
discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
FLOOD FRINGE: That portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is
synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the flood insurance study, Dakota County,
Minnesota, and incorporated areas.
FLOODPLAIN: The beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake, or watercourse which
have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
FLOODPROOFING: A combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to
properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood
damages.
FLOODWAY: The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those portions
of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to carry or store the regional flood
discharge.
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An
unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or
storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when
attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include the term

square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be selfpropelled
or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a
permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use. For the purposes of this chapter, the term recreational vehicle shall be
synonymous with the term travel trailer/travel vehicle. This definition is for interpreting and
administering only the provisions of this chapter and is distinct from the definition, standards and
requirements of section 7-1-8, "Outside Storage Within Residential Neighborhoods", of this
code.
REGIONAL FLOOD: A flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred
generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an

period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after
damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless
of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include:
1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.

where the intent is to protect individual structures, landfills, quarries, essential service structures,
public utilities and related structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural
crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the 10-year frequency flood event.
(D) Standards For Floodway Conditional And Interim Uses:
1. All Uses: No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit,
obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as conditional or
interim uses that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause
an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
2. Conditional And Interim Uses: All floodway conditional uses and interim uses shall be subject to
the procedures and standards contained in subsection 10-10-10(H) of this chapter.
3. Fill:
a. Fill, dredge spoil, excavation sites, salt storage, Minnesota pollution control agency authorized
landfills or other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain shall be protected
against erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
b. Dredge spoil sites, sand and gravel operations, salt storage and Minnesota pollution control
agency authorized landfills shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a long term site
development plan which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element in the plan is
submitted.
c. As an alternative, and consistent with subsection (D)3b of this section, dredge spoil disposal,
salt storage, Minnesota pollution control agency authorized landfills and sand and gravel
operations may allow temporary, on site storage of fill or other materials which would have
caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood, but only after the city
council has received and approved an appropriate plan which assures the removal of
materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The city may require
the applicant to provide a financial security or cash escrow in order to ensure compliance with
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 546/771
the plan. The conditional or interim use permit allowing such use must be title registered with
the property in the office of the county recorder.
4. Accessory Structures:
a. Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
b. Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as
to offer the minimum amount of obstruction to the flow of floodwaters:
(1) Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the
direction of flood flow; and
(2) So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines
as those of adjoining structures.
c. Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance
with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in the state building code. As an alternative,
an accessory structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification in
the state building code provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment and
does not exceed five hundred (500) square feet in size at its largest projection. If the
accessory structure is a detached garage, it must be used solely for parking of vehicles and
limited storage. All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional
standards:
(1) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls;
(2) Any mechanical and utility equipment in the structure must be elevated to or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed; and
(3) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two (2)
"automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must
be openings on at least two (2) sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be
no higher than one foot (1') above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for
automatic openings.
5. Storage Of Material And Equipment:
a. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or
potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
b. Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area
within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the
city council. The city may require the applicant to provide a financial security or cash escrow in
order to ensure compliance with the plan.

6. Structural Works For Flood Control: Structural works for flood control that will change the
course, current, or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the
provisions of Minnesota statutes, chapter 103G. Communitywide structural works for flood
control intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the
floodway.
7. Levees, Dikes, Or Floodwalls Constructed In Floodway: A levee, dike, or floodwall constructed
in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical
analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream. (Ord. 1250,
10-18-2011)
10-10-5: FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF):
(A) Permitted Uses: The following uses shall be permitted uses within the flood fringe district to the
extent that they are allowed in the base zoning district. All permitted uses shall comply with
subsections (B), "Standards For Flood Fringe Permitted Uses", and (E), "Standards For Flood
Fringe Uses", of this section.
Any use permitted in subsection 10-10-4(A) of this chapter.
Any use permitted in the base zoning district.
(B) Standards For Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
1. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor,
including the basement floor, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The
finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot (1') below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least fifteen feet (15') beyond
the outside limits of the structure erected thereon. Lowest floor elevations shall also be subject
to the Burnsville water resources management plan.
2. As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment
and that do not exceed five hundred (500) square feet at its largest projection may be internally
floodproofed in accordance with subsection 10-10-4(D)4c of this chapter.
3. The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of one thousand (1,000) cubic
yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a conditional use, unless said fill is
specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection (B)1 of this section.
4. The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
5. The provisions of subsection (E) of this section shall apply.

fringe district by conditional or interim use permit if allowed as such in the base zoning district.
1. Any use permitted in the base zoning district as either a conditional or interim use.
2. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with subsection (B)1 or
(B)2 of this section or any land use that does not comply with the standards in subsection (B)3 or
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 548/771
(B)4 of this section. An application for a conditional use permit shall be subject to the standards
and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in subsections (D) and (E) of this section and
subsection 10-10-10(H) of this chapter.
(D) Standards For Flood Fringe Conditional And Interim Uses:
1. Alternative Elevation Methods: Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above
grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an
enclosed area shall be considered above grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if
the enclosed area:
a. Is above grade on at least one side of the structure;
b. Is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and
c. Is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. The above noted alternative
elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards:
(1) Design And Certification: The structure's design and as built condition must be certified by
a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general
design standards of the state building code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating,
ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at
or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent floodwater from
entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
(2) Specific Standards For Above Grade, Enclosed Areas: Above grade, fully enclosed areas
such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the
design plans must stipulate:
(a) The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a
floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two (2) openings on at least two (2)
sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered
professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The
automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters without any
form of human intervention; and
(b) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with
the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the state building code and shall be used solely for
building access, parking of vehicles, or storage.
2. Basements: Basements, as defined by subsection 10-10-2(H) of this chapter shall be subject to
the following:
a. Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection
elevation.
b. Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation
provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with subsection (D)3 of this
section.
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 549/771
c. Basement and all other low floor elevations shall also meet the requirements of the Burnsville
water resources management plan.
3. Areas Of Nonresidential Structures: All areas of nonresidential structures including basements
to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance
with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the state building code. Structurally dry
floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the state building code
and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the
FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.
4. Erosion/Sedimentation Control Plan: When at any one time more than one thousand (1,000)
cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on site
storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal, or
construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted.
The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a
minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a
registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city. The plan may
incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate
flood warning time exists.
5. Storage Of Materials And Equipment:
a. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or
potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
b. Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed by conditional use permit if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a
plan approved by the city council. The city may require the applicant to provide a financial
security or cash escrow in order to ensure compliance with the plan.
6. Additional Provisions: The provisions of subsection (E) of this section shall also apply.
(E) Standards For Flood Fringe Uses:
1. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. Existing structures may be permitted to have vehicular access at an
elevation not more than two feet (2') below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the
applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city fire marshal that emergency vehicle
access can be accommodated during a flood. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the
city council must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for times
of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local flood
emergency response procedures exist.
2. Business uses: Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at
elevations lower than the flood protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be
used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted, in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth
and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the
product number exceeds four (4) upon the occurrence of the regional flood.
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 550/771
3. Manufacturing and industrial uses: Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal
plant operations especially for streams having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land
uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out
in subsection (E)2 of this section. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be
given to the needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in floodplain areas.
4. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap,
vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The federal emergency management agency
(FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for
certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation; FEMA's
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multistructure
or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation
of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
5. Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and
adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other
encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map.
6. Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in subsection 10-10-9(B) of this chapter.
Recreational vehicles are also subject to section 7-1-8, "Outside Storage Within Residential
Neighborhoods", of this code.
7. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system that resists flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include,
but are not to be limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement
is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. (Ord.
1250, 10-18-2011)
10-10-6: GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT (GFP):
(A) Permitted Uses: Permitted uses shall include those uses permitted by subsection 10-10-4(A) of
this chapter to the extent that they are allowed in the base zoning district.
(B) Conditional And Interim Uses: All other uses than those listed in subsection (A) of this section shall
be subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria pursuant to subsection (C) of this section.
Section 10-10-4 of this chapter shall apply if the proposed use is in the floodway district and
section 10-10-5 of this chapter shall apply if the proposed use is in the flood fringe district.
(C) Procedures For Floodway And Flood Fringe Determinations Within The General Floodplain
District:
1. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the general floodplain district,
the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed
necessary by the city for the determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and of
whether the proposed use is within the floodway or flood fringe district.
a. A typical valley cross section(s) showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas
adjoining each side of the channel, cross sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed
development, and high water information.

storage elevations; the size, location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing
structures on the site, and the location and elevation of streets.
c. Photographs showing existing land uses and vegetation upstream and downstream, and soil
types.
d. Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least
five hundred feet (500') in either direction from the proposed development.
2. The applicant shall submit one copy of the above information to a designated engineer or other
expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in
the floodway or flood fringe district and to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation.
Procedures consistent with Minnesota regulations 1983, parts 6120.5000 through 6120.6200
and 44 code of federal regulations part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The
designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical
evaluation methodology with the respective department of natural resources' area hydrologist
prior to commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert shall:
a. Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
b. Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon hydraulic analysis of the
stream channel and overbank areas.
c. Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood
stages more than five-tenths foot (0.5'). A lesser stage increase than five-tenths foot (0.5') shall
be required if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increased flood damages would result.
An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed
in computing floodway boundaries.
3. The technical evaluation and findings of the designated engineer or expert shall be presented to
the city council. The city council must formally accept the technical evaluation and the
recommended floodway and/or flood fringe district boundary or deny the permit application. The
city council, prior to official action, may submit the application and all supporting data and
analyses to FEMA, the department of natural resources or the planning commission for review
and comment. Once the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries have been determined, the
city council shall refer the matter to the city planner, who shall process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of sections 10-10-4 and 10-10-5 of this chapter. (Ord.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 552/771
marshal that emergency vehicle access can be accommodated during a flood. If a variance to this
requirement is granted, the city council must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy
of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time
and local flood emergency response procedures exist. For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the
floodway and flood fringe district boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the
required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings
and platting documents.
(B) Floodway/Flood Fringe Determinations In The General Floodplain District: In the general floodplain
district, applicants shall provide the information required in subsection 10-10-6(C) of this chapter to
determine the 100-year flood elevation, the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries, and the
regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site.
(C) Removal Of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation: FEMA has established criteria for removing
the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the
100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope
protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be
investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area
designation will be requested. (Ord. 1250, 10-18-2011)

that exist consistent with the criteria specified in this chapter, and in chapter 5, "Administration",
of this title which justify the granting of the variance. No variance shall have the effect of allowing
in any district uses that are prohibited in that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection
than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower
than those required by state law. The following additional variance criteria of FEMA must be
satisfied:
a. Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in
flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
b. Variances may only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause,
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
c. Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
3. The building official or designee shall notify the suspected party of the requirements of this
chapter and all other official controls and the nature and extent of the suspected violation of
these controls. If the structure and/or use is under construction or development, the building
official or designee may order the construction or development immediately halted until a proper
permit or approval is granted by the city council. If the construction or development is already
completed, then the building official or designee may either: a) issue an order identifying the
corrective actions that must be made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure
into compliance with the official controls, or b) notify the responsible party to apply for an after

Chapter 27
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)
10-27-1: AUTHORIZATION:
PUD authorization may allow:
(A) Variety: Within a comprehensive site design concept a mixture of land uses, housing types and
densities.
(B) Sensitivity: Through the departure from the strict application of required setbacks, yard areas, lot
sizes, minimum house sizes, minimum requirements, and other performance standards associated
with traditional zoning, planned unit development can maximize the development potential of land
while remaining sensitive to its unique and valuable natural characteristics.
(C) Efficiency: The consolidation of areas for recreation and reductions in street lengths and other
utility related expenses.
(D) Density Transfer: The project density may be clustered, basing density on number of units per
acre versus specific lot dimensions.
(E) District Integration: The combination of uses which are allowed in separate zoning districts, such
as:
1. Mixed residential allows both densities and unit types to be varied within the project.
2. Mixed residential with increased density acknowledging the greater sensitivity of PUD projects,
regulation provides increased density on the property if a PUD is utilized.
3. Mixed land uses with the integration of compatible land uses within the project. (Ord. 1196, 4-6-
2010)
10-27-2: ALLOWED USES:
Uses within the PUD may include only those uses generally considered associated with the general
land use category shown for the area on the official comprehensive plan. Specific allowed uses and
performance standards for each PUD shall be delineated in an ordinance and development stage
PUD. The development stage PUD shall identify all the proposed land uses and those uses shall
become permitted uses with the acceptance of the plan. Any change in list of uses presented in the
development stage PUD will be considered an amendment to the PUD and will follow the procedures
specified in section 10-5-6 of this title. (Ord. 1196, 4-6-2010)
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 678/771
10-27-3: REQUIRED STANDARDS:
The city shall consider the proposed PUD from the point of view of all standards and purposes of the
comprehensive plan to achieve a maximum coordination between the proposed development and the
surrounding uses, the conservation of woodland, the use of pervious paving/paver systems to
increase infiltration and reduce stormwater runoff and the protection of health, safety and welfare of
the community and residents of the PUD. To these ends, the city council shall consider the location of
the buildings, compatibility, installation of fiber optics to the premises, parking areas and other features
with respect to the topography of the area and existing natural features such as streams and large
trees; the efficiency, adequacy and safety of the proposed layout of internal streets and driveways; the
adequacy and location of green areas including plant diversity of no more than twenty five percent
(25%) of any single variety of plantings; the adequacy, location and screening of parking areas; and
such other matters as the council may find to have a material bearing upon the stated standards and
objectives of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1196, 4-6-2010)
10-27-4: COORDINATION WITH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS:
Subdivision review pursuant to title 11 of this code may be carried out simultaneously with the review
of the development stage PUD. A plat shall be submitted if required by title 11 of this code, or if
required as a condition of concept stage PUD approval, or as otherwise directed by the City Council.
The plans required under this chapter shall be submitted in a form which will satisfy the requirements
of the subdivision ordinance for preliminary and final plat. (Ord. 1196, 4-6-2010)
10-27-5: REVISIONS AND/OR CHANGES:
(A) Minor Alterations Prior To Certificate Of Occupancy: Minor alterations to the location, placement
and height of structures may be authorized by the Development Review Committee (DRC) if
required by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the development stage
PUD was approved.
(B) Public Hearing: With the exception of minor changes permitted in subsection (A) of this section,
changes in uses, any rearrangement of lots, blocks and building tracts, changes in the provision of
common open spaces, and all other changes to the approved development stage PUD may be
made only after a public hearing is held pursuant to the requirements of section 10-5-6 of this title
and the changes are approved by the City Council. All changes shall be recorded as amendments
to the recorded development stage PUD. (Ord. 1467, 9-18-2018)
(C) Applicability: All of the provisions of this title applicable to the original underlying zoning district
within which the PUD Zoning District is established shall apply to the PUD Zoning District except
as otherwise provided in approval of the development stage PUD.
(D) Review: If substantial development has not occurred within a reasonable time after approval of the
PUD Zoning District, the City Council may instruct the Planning Commission to initiate rezoning to
the original zoning district. It shall not be necessary for the City Council to find that the rezoning
was in error. (Ord. 1196, 4-6-2010)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 679/771
10-27-6: PHASING AND GUARANTEE OF PERFORMANCE:
(A) The Planning Commission shall compare the actual development accomplished in the various
PUD zones with the approved development schedule.
(B) Upon recommendation of the Planning Commission and for good cause shown by the property
owner, the City Council may extend the limits of the development schedule.
(C) The construction and provision of all of the common open space and public and recreational
facilities shown on the development stage PUD must proceed at the same rate as the construction
of dwelling units, if any. The Planning Department shall review all of the building permits issued for
the PUD and examine the construction which has taken place on the site. If the rate of construction
of dwelling units is greater than the rate at which common open spaces and public and recreational
facilities have been constructed and provided, the Planning Department shall forward this
information to the City Council for possible action. (Ord. 1196, 4-6-2010)
10-27-7: CONTROL OF PUD FOLLOWING COMPLETION:
(A) Approved Development Stage PUD: The use of the land and the construction, modification or
alteration of any buildings or structures within the PUD shall be governed by the approved
development stage PUD. (Ord. 1226, 1-18-2011)
(B) Minor Changes After Issuance Of Certificate Of Occupancy: No changes shall be made in the
approved development stage PUD except upon application as provided below:
1. Any minor extensions, alterations or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be
authorized by the Development Review Committee (DRC) if they are consistent with the
purposes and intent of the development stage PUD. No change authorized by this section may
increase the footprint of any building or structure by more than thirty percent (30%).
2. Changes to exteriors of buildings and building materials, construction of accessory trash
enclosures and sheds, changes to signage, lighting, parking, landscaping and adding or altering
sidewalk/trails are permitted to the extent there are no specific conditions in the approving PUD
documents and any such changes are in compliance with this title. (Ord. 1467, 9-18-2018)
3. Any building or structure that is totally or substantially destroyed may be reconstructed only in
compliance with the development stage PUD unless an amendment to the development stage
PUD is approved under section 10-5-6 of this title. (Ord. 1226, 1-18-2011)
4. Any other changes in the development stage PUD must be authorized by an amendment to the
development stage PUD pursuant to the public hearing process outlined in section 10-5-6 of this
title. (Ord. 1454, 4-17-2018)

(Ord. 1142, 11-18-2008)
10-30A-4: GUARANTEES AND SECURITIES:
(A) Guarantee: The owner shall guarantee the growth and maintenance of all plants for a minimum of
two (2) growing seasons. The guarantee will be reduced to a one year guarantee if all green areas
are properly irrigated with an inground irrigation system. The owner is responsible for contacting
the city for a landscape installation inspection of all plantings. The guarantee period will not begin
until the landscape installation inspection has occurred and the plantings conform to the approved
landscape plan. At the end of the guarantee period, the owner is responsible to contact the city for
a final landscape inspection. All plants must be alive and installed per the approved landscape
plan. Failure to do so may result in the withdrawal of any or all necessary funds from the letter of
credit or cash security by the city to finance the completion of the required landscaping.
(B) Letter Of Credit, Cash Security: Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the owner shall supply
the city with a letter of credit or cash security in an amount not less than one hundred percent
(100%) of the total estimated landscaped value. At the request of the city, the owner shall supply
the installing contractor's official bid as verification for establishing the amount of security. At the
owner's discretion, sodding costs may be estimated and secured as part of the letter of credit for
erosion control. The security will be held by the city to ensure landscaping is installed as shown on
the approved landscape plan and that plant materials survive the guarantee period. Provided
landscaping is alive per the approved plan, the security will be returned to the owner at the end of
the required guarantee period. (Ord. 1142, 11-18-2008)

(C) Security For Single-Family And Twin Home Lots: Before a building permit is issued for a singlefamily
home or twin home, for a remodeling of a single-family home or twin home that changes the
footprint of the home, or for an accessory structure, a cash security or letter of credit in an amount
to be set by city policy 2.050, shall be furnished to the city to guarantee compliance with the
landscaping (including tree planting) requirements for the lot. A final certificate of occupancy will
not be issued until the required landscaping and trees are installed. In the event the landscaping
and tree planting is not completed, the city may enter the lot, perform the work and apply the cash
security toward the cost. Upon satisfactory completion of the landscaping and tree planting, the
security funds, without interest, less any draw made by the city, shall be returned to the person
who deposited the funds with the city. (Ord. 1353, 9-8-2015)

Prior to the issuance of a grading, filling, or excavation permit, the owner shall supply the city with all
necessary information regarding erosion control measures and security in an amount to be set by city
policy number 2.050. Upon the completion of the project and the determination that all erodible areas
have been adequately stabilized, the erosion control escrow, without interest, less any draw made by
the city, shall be released to the person who deposited the funds with the city.
If the applicant fails to comply with the approved erosion control plan, or in the event of an emergency,
the city may take such action as it deems appropriate to control erosion and charge the costs to the
applicant. If the applicant does not reimburse the city for any cost incurred for such work to remedy
erosion concerns within ten (10) days, the city may draw down the required cash escrow to pay the
costs. (Ord. 1142, 11-18-2008)

6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 740/771
1. Parking Lot Screening: Parking lot screening shall be designed to reduce the visual impact of
surface parking lots; mitigate glare from headlights; improve the aesthetic quality of the area for
users of the site, adjacent sites, roadways, and sidewalks; and define the perimeter of the
parking lot as follows:
a. Off Street Parking Containing Six Or More Parking Spaces: Between those portions of an off
street parking area containing six (6) or more parking spaces and a different zoning district or
a public street.
b. Waiver: Parking lot screening requirements may be waived in circumstances where perimeter
screening is provided or where the elevation of the parking area relative to the elevation of the
street and sidewalk would make the screening ineffectual as determined by the development
review committee (DRC).
c. Exemption For Display Pads: Items approved by the city council for display on designated
display pads are exempt from parking lot screening standards. This exemption shall only apply
to items oriented toward the public right of way and not adjacent properties. Display pads shall
be physically separated from parking lots and drive aisles and shall comply with the applicable
district's parking setback requirements. (Ord. 1301, 8-20-2013)
d. Parking Lot Screening Standards:
(1) Parking lot screening must be provided within ten feet (10') of the perimeter of the parking
lot to be screened, except for parking lots adjacent to rain gardens/bioretention systems,
other landscape features, or where the traffic sight visibility triangle may be impacted.
(2) Parking lot screening shall be a minimum of three feet (3') and a maximum of four feet (4')
in height as measured from the adjacent finished surface of the parking area. When shrubs
are used to provide the screen, such shrubs must be at least two feet (2') tall at planting and
anticipated to grow to at least three feet (3') tall at maturity. (Ord. 1316, 4-8-2014)
(3) No landscaping or screening shall interfere with driver or pedestrian visibility for vehicles
entering or exiting the premises.
(4) Screening for a parking lot may be comprised of one hundred percent (100%) evergreen
planting materials.
e. Content: Parking lot screening must consist of at least two (2) of the following:
(1) A compact hedge of evergreen or densely twigged deciduous shrubs spaced to ensure
closure into a solid hedge at maturity;
(2) A berm with plantings described above;
(3) Transit shelters, benches, bicycle racks and similar features may be integrated as a part of
the screen;
(4) Fencing may be integrated as part of the screen. All wood fencing shall be stained and
sealed with a weatherproof product. (Ord. 1301, 8-20-2013)
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 741/771
2. Parking Island Design: Off street parking areas with at least twenty five (25) parking stalls shall
contain interior landscaped islands. Such islands shall be bounded by a raised concrete curb or
approved equivalent and shall contain mulch (wood, bark, or decorative rock) or turf grass to
retain soil moisture. This provision shall not apply to parking structures. The standards for
landscape islands are as follows:
a. Landscape parking lot islands shall be required at the beginning and end of each parking row
and shall contain a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) square feet and a minimum width of
nine feet (9').
b. A minimum of one overstory tree shall be provided for each island. This provision may be
waived for islands utilized for stormwater management or other utility or safety issues as
determined by the city engineer.
c. Shrubs, perennials or ornamental grass shall be incorporated in each landscaped island.
d. Islands shall be prepared with topsoil to a depth of two feet (2') and improved to ensure
adequate drainage, nutrient and moisture retention levels for the establishment of plantings.
e. All perimeter and interior landscaped areas in parking lots shall be equipped with a permanent
irrigation system, unless drought tolerant plant materials are used exclusively. Where drought
tolerant plant materials are used, irrigation shall be required only for the two (2) year period
following plant installation and may be accomplished using hoses, water trucks, or other
nonpermanent means.
(C) Alternative Landscape Options: The city encourages the use of special design features such as
xeriscaping; rain gardens/bioretention systems; landscaping with native species; green rooftops;
heat island reduction; and aesthetic design. All site development and redevelopment must include
two (2) of the following alternative landscape options:
1. Xeriscaping: Xeriscaping is landscaping which uses plants that have low water requirements,
making them able to withstand extended periods of drought. Xeriscaping landscapes are a
conscious attempt to develop plantings which are compatible with the environment and make a
conscious effort to minimize use of water.
2. Rain Gardens/Bioretention Systems: Bioretention systems can be described as shallow,
landscaped depressions commonly located in parking lot islands or within areas that receive
stormwater runoff. For credit under this section, the rain garden/bioretention system shall be
above ground and a visible part of the green or landscaped area. Stormwater flows into the
bioretention area, ponds on the surface, and gradually infiltrates into the soil bed. Pollutants are
removed by a number of processes including absorption, filtration, volatilization, ion exchange,
and decomposition. Filtered runoff can either be allowed to infiltrate into the surrounding soil
(functioning as an infiltration basin or rainwater garden), or discharged to the storm sewer or
directly to receiving waters (functioning like a surface filter). The use of under drain systems are
discouraged unless where infiltration is prohibited by the water resources management plan.
Runoff from larger storms is generally diverted past the area to the storm drain system.
3. Lakescaping: To preserve or restore the natural buffer along a shoreline. The buffer shall be at
least thirty feet (30') wide and be planted with native grasses and species of flowering plants.
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 742/771
4. Landscaping With Native Species: Fifty percent (50%) of the plantings used in the landscape
plan shall be of native plant communities of Burnsville on file with the city and approved by the
development review committee (DRC). These plant communities include:
a. Upland deciduous forest: Oak forest, maple basswood forest, white pine hardwood forest,
black ash swamp, and tamarack swamp.
b. Brush prairie: Dry oak savannah, oak woodland-brushland.
c. Oak openings and barrens: Dry oak savannah, oak forest.
5. Green Rooftops: Green rooftops are veneers of living vegetation installed atop buildings, from
small garages to large industrial structures. Green rooftops help manage stormwater by
mimicking a variety of hydrologic processes normally associated with open space. Plants
capture rainwater on their foliage and absorb it in their root zone, encouraging
evapotranspiration and preventing much stormwater from ever entering runoff streams. What
water does leave the roof is slowed and kept cooler, a benefit for downstream water bodies.
Green roofs are especially effective in controlling intense, short duration storms and have been
shown to reduce cumulative annual runoff by fifty percent (50%) in temperate climates.
6. Aesthetic Design: Sites shall be designed to include three (3) of the following: public art,
fountains, plazas, perennial beds, entrance landscaping, or other amenities reviewed and
approved by the development review committee (DRC).
(D) Compliance: If the applicant and the development review committee (DRC) cannot agree on the
proposed landscaping design, the applicant shall be required to make an application for a
conditional use permit to prove compatibility. (Ord. 1142, 11-18-2008)

actions will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of this title. "Unusual hardships" as used in
connection with the granting of a variance under this section means the property in question
cannot be put to a reasonable use if used under conditions allowed by the official controls, the
plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to his property not created by the
landowner, and the variances, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.
Economic considerations alone shall not constitute an unusual hardship if reasonable use for the
property exists under the terms of this title. "Unusual hardship" also includes, but is not limited to,
direct sunlight for solar energy systems. Variances shall be granted for earth sheltered construction
as defined in Minnesota statutes section 216C.06, subdivision 14, when in harmony with this title.

where such use will result in a more desirable layout than that of a rectangular gridiron pattern.
(D) Streets And Utilities Constructed To Boundary Lines: Proposed streets and utilities shall be
constructed to the boundary lines of the subdivision, unless prevented by topography or other
physical conditions or unless in the opinion of the DRC such extension is not necessary or
desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most
advantageous feature development of adjacent tracts.

are required, they shall be a minimum of five feet (5') in width, constructed of concrete material,
and be handicap accessible. Bicycle trails shall be of a design approved by the city engineer and
constructed of bituminous material.
(J) Half Streets: Dedication of half streets shall not be permitted except where it is essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision and in conformity with the other requirements of these
regulations or where it is found that it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half
when the adjoining property is subdivided.
(K) Compliance With The Comprehensive Plan: All subdivisions incorporating streets which are
identified in the transportation chapter of the comprehensive plan, as amended, shall comply with
minimum right of way, surface width and design standards identified in the plan.

6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 762/771
(A) Where land proposed for subdivision is deemed environmentally sensitive by the city, due to the
existence of wetlands, drainageways, watercourses, floodplains, steep slopes, shorelands,
restrictive soils or other environmental features, the design of said subdivision shall clearly reflect
all necessary measures of protection to ensure against adverse environmental impact, in
accordance with the provisions of title 10, chapters 8 and 10 of this code. (Ord. 1291, 3-5-2013)
11-4-8: DEDICATION FOR PUBLIC PURPOSE:
(A) Public Uses: Pursuant to Minnesota statutes, section 462.358, subdivision 2a, the city council shall
require all developers requesting platting or replatting, or the development of unplatted land in the
city to contribute lands, in the amounts listed below, to be dedicated to the public for their use as
either parks, playground, public open space, trail systems, water ponding, public lands or to
contribute an equivalent amount of cash, based upon the conditions outlined below. The form of
contribution (cash or land, or any combination thereof) shall be decided by the city council based
upon need and conformance with approved city plans. Property being replatted with the same
number of lots and same number of dwelling units shall be exempt from additional park land
dedication requirements. If the replat increases the number of lots and/or number of dwelling units,
or if land outside the previously recorded plat is added, then the park land dedication shall be
based on the additional dwelling units being added.
(B) Special Fund: All monies collected from cash contributions shall be placed in a special fund from
which only those public uses as listed in subsection (A) of this section may be constructed or
improved, or land for those same uses may be acquired. The city may elect to receive a
combination of cash, land and development of the land for park use. Cash contributions shall be
due prior to the issuance of the first building permit in the subdivision.
(C) Proposed Public Uses: Where a proposed park, playground or other recreational areas, proposed
school site or other public ground that has been indicated in the official map and/or master plan is
located in whole or in part within a proposed subdivision, such proposed public site shall be
designated as such and should be dedicated to the city, school district or other proper
governmental unit. If the applicant chooses not to dedicate an area in excess of the land required
under this section hereof for such proposed public site, the council shall not be required to act to
approve or disapprove the plat of the subdivision for a period of ninety (90) days after the applicant
meets all the provisions of this subdivision title in order to permit the council, school board or other
appropriate governmental unit to consider the proposed plat and to take the necessary steps to
acquire, through purchase or condemnation, all or part of the public site proposed under the official
map or master plan.
(D) Dedication Location: In such cases where the developer is required to dedicate land area, the city
council shall have the right to determine the geographic location and configuration of said
dedication.
(E) Dedication Formula: The dedication formula for residential land shall be based on the national
standard of providing ten (10) acres of parks and open spaces per one thousand (1,000)
population and residential subdivisions shall be computed on the proposed number of dwelling
units in a project and the average population for dwelling unit type as established by the
metropolitan council. The dedication formula for commercial and industrial district development
shall be five percent (5%) of the gross land area. Where the city council elects to take cash in lieu
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 763/771
of land, such contribution shall be based upon land dedication requirement multiplied by the
average cost per acre by zoning district as established, from time to time, by the city council.
(F) Density Or Floor Coverage: In no case shall dedication of lands for public uses as listed in
subsection (A) of this section restrict or limit proposed density or floor area coverage where
proposed plans are found to be in total compliance with this code.
(G) Park And Recreational Facilities: In residential subdivisions where active park and recreational
facilities are proposed (specifically designated on development plans) for either public or private
use, and where a cash contribution or combination dedication is required, the city council may
waive up to two percent (2%) of the dedication requirements as listed in subsection (E) of this
section.
(H) Wetlands And Ponding Areas: Wetlands, ponding areas and drainageways accepted by the city
shall not be considered in the open space land and/or cash contribution to the city.
(I) Dedication Formula For Interim Uses:
1. If land is being final platted in conjunction with the issuance of an interim use permit for the
entire plat under this title, the dedication formula set forth in subsection (E) of this section shall
apply except as modified herein. If land dedication is required, the dedication must be made at
the time of final platting; if a cash dedication is required, the following formula shall be used:
a. Five percent (5%) of the gross land area multiplied by two percent (2%) multiplied by the
average land value per acre for the zoning district equals the cash dedication for each year of
the interim use permit. At the issuance of subsequent interim use permits for the land, the same
formula will apply using the average land value per acre for the zoning district in effect at that
time.
2. The developer shall have two (2) options for paying the park dedication fees:
a. The park dedication for the whole term of the interim use permit can be paid at the time of
issuance of the permit; or
b. The fee can be paid on an annual basis over the term of the interim use by means of an
interest free special assessment on the property.
3. When a building permit is issued for a permitted use or conditional use of any part of the plat,
the final park dedication will be calculated and immediately payable based upon the average
land value per zoning district in effect at the time the building permit is issued. The following
formula will be used to figure any cash park dedication due:
a. Five percent (5%) of the gross land area multiplied by the average land value per acre for the
zoning district in effect at the time the building permit is issued minus the amount of park
dedication paid during the interim use period(s) equals the balance of cash dedication due the
city.
(J) Nexus Requirement And Appeals: As required by law, the dedication formulas established in this
section are intended to reflect an essential nexus between the fees or dedication imposed and the
city purpose sought to be achieved by the fee or dedication, and to bear a rough proportionality to
6/30/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=468 764/771
the need created by the proposed subdivision or development. Appeals regarding the proposed
fee or dedication will be subject to the provisions established in state law1. (Ord. 1291, 3-5-2013)
11-4-9: MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS:
The design standards set forth in this chapter are minimum requirements. In keeping with the spirit
and intent of this title, the city may impose additional or more stringent requirements or safeguards
concerning lot size, streets and overall design as deemed appropriate considering the property being
subdivided. (Ord. 1291, 3-5-2013)

(B) Securities: Prior to the city release of the approved final plat, the developer shall deposit with the
city an amount equal to a minimum of one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the city
engineer's estimated cost of the required improvements within the plat, either in a cash escrow or
letter of credit. The surety shall be approved by the city. As portions of the project construction are
completed, inspected and accepted by the city, the amount of the surety requirement may be
reduced. The cash escrow or letter of credit shall be conditioned upon:
1. The installation of all of the improvements required by the terms and conditions and within the
time period set forth by the city unless an extension is granted by the city council.
2. Satisfactory completion of the work and payment therefor, which work was undertaken by the
developer in accordance with the developer's agreement referred to above.
3. The developer shall pay to the city all expenses incurred by the city, including, but not limited to,
expenses for engineering, planning, fiscal, legal, construction and administration. In instances
where a cash escrow is submitted in lieu of a letter of credit, there shall be a cash escrow
agreement which shall provide that in the event the required improvements are not completed
within the approved time period, all amounts held under the cash escrow agreement shall be
automatically turned over and delivered to the city and applied by the city to the cost of
completing the required improvements. If the funds available within said cash escrow agreement
are not sufficient to complete the required improvements, the necessary additional cost to the
city may be assessed against the subdivision. Any balance remaining in the cash escrow fund
after such improvements have been made and all expenses therefor have been paid, shall be
returned to the developer. In instances where a letter of credit is used in lieu of a cash escrow,
the letter of credit shall be in a form satisfactory to the city and the terms thereof shall
substantially comply with the procedure set forth for a cash escrow fund.

3-5-2013)
11-5-5: REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO TREES IN NEW SUBDIVISIONS:
(A) The preservation of existing trees and vegetation is a goal which should be addressed prior to the
review of a subdivision by the DRC, planning commission and the city council. A woodland survey
shall be completed by the developer to identify all existing trees on the site with a trunk diameter of
four inches (4") or more, measured at four feet (4') above the ground. The survey shall also identify
all areas where trees will be saved or removed. The value of the trees remaining on the site will
determine the need for additional trees.
(B) In new subdivisions, two (2) front yard trees, one overstory, and either one ornamental or
evergreen tree, or two (2) overstory trees shall be planted per platted lot as long as they are not
identical species. Existing trees that meet the requirements of this section, may be used to satisfy
