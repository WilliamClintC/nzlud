become grievances.

Council, and that a special tax bill be issued for the costs of abating the nuisance.

representative or agents of the subject property shall be given the opportunity to present
evidence to the Fire Chief in the course of the hearing.
Should the evidence support a finding that the weeds or debris described in the notice
constitute a nuisance, the Fire Chief shall issue an order making specific findings of fact,
based upon competent and substantial evidence, which shows the existence of the nuisance
and ordering the nuisance removed or otherwise abated by the City.
The Fire Chief, upon written application by the owner at any time within the period after the
notice has been served, may grant additional time for the owner to effect the abatement of the
nuisance, provided that such extension is limited to a specific time period.
If the decision of the Fire Chief is not appealed to the Circuit Court within thirty (30) days of
the date of the mailing of the decision, the decision shall be declared final in accordance with

continued although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof. If no structural alterations are
made, a non-conforming use of a building may be changed to another non-conforming use of the same
or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a non-conforming use has been changed to a more
restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use.
The non-conforming use of a building may be hereafter extended throughout those parts of a building
which were lawfully and manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of the enactment of
this Chapter.

Every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky, except as authorized by this Article,
and ordinary projections of sills, belt courses, window air-conditioning units, chimneys,
cornices, and ornamental features may project to a distance not to exceed twenty-four (24)
inches into a required yard.
In the event that a lot is to be occupied by a group of two (2) or more related buildings to be
used for residential, institutional, hotel or motel purposes, there may be more than one (1)
main building on the lot when such buildings are arranged around a court having direct street
access; provided however:
Said court between buildings that are parallel, or within forty-five degrees (45°) of being
parallel, shall have a minimum width of thirty (30) feet for one-story buildings, forty (40)
feet for two-story buildings, and fifty (50) feet for three-story buildings, and in no case
may such buildings be closer to each other than fifteen (15) feet;
Where a court having direct street access is more than fifty percent (50%) surrounded by
a building, the minimum width of the court shall be at least thirty (30) feet for one-story
buildings, forty (40) feet for two-story buildings, and fifty (50) feet for three-story buildings.
Within any residential district, the least dimension of a yard upon which the principal
entrances or exits of a multiple dwelling race, shall be twenty (20) feet.
Where a lot is used for a commercial or industrial purpose, more than one (1) main building
may be located on the lot, but only when such buildings conform to all open space
requirements around the lot for the district in which the lot is located.
When a commercial or industrial lot abuts on a residential district, there may be imposed such
reasonable requirements as to screening and other features of development as are deemed
necessary by the City Council to prevent conditions which are objectionable or hazardous to
adjacent property, as a condition of issuance of a building permit or operating license for use

provided it is not located closer than five (5) feet to the rear lot line nor closer than three (3)
feet to a side lot line.
Front Yards.
Where an official line has been established for the future widening or opening of a street or
major thoroughfare upon which a lot abuts, then the depth of a front or side yard shall be
measured from such official line to the nearest line of the building.
On through lots, the required front yard shall be provided on each street.
Except in the "B-2" General Business District, where a lot is located at the intersection of two
(2) or more streets, there shall be a front yard of fifteen (15) feet of the side street; provided
however, that the buildable width of a lot of record at the time of passage of this Chapter
(February 1, 1966) shall not be reduced to less than thirty-two (32) feet.
Open, unenclosed porches, platforms, or paved terraces not covered by a roof or canopy and
which do not extend above the level of the first floor of the building may extend or project into
the required front yard not more than six (6) feet.
Where twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the street frontage within four hundred (400) feet
of the property in question is improved with buildings that have front yards with greater or
lesser depths than required in the district (provided that no such depth varies more than six
(6) feet from such requirement) no building shall project beyond the average front yard so
established; provided however, that a depth of front yard of more than fifty percent (50%) in
excess of the depth of the required front yard in the district in which the lot is located shall not
be required. Where forty percent (40%) or more of the street frontage is improved with
buildings that have no front yard, no front yard shall be required for the remainder of the street
frontage.
Side Yards.
For the purpose of the side yard regulations, a two-family dwelling or a multiple dwelling shall
be considered as one (1) building occupying one (1) lot.
The minimum width of side yards for schools, libraries, churches, community houses, and
other public and semi-public buildings in residential districts shall be twenty-five (25) feet.
Rear Yards. Open or lattice-enclosed fire escapes, outside stairways and balconies opening upon
fire towers, and the ordinary projections of chimneys and flues may project into the required rear
yard for a distance of not more than five (5) feet, but only where the same are so placed as not to
obstruct light and ventilation.
Corner Visibility. No sign, fence, wall, hedge, planting, or other obstruction to vision, extending to a
height in excess of three (3) feet above the established street grade, shall be erected, planted, or
maintained within the area of a corner lot that is included between the lines of the intersecting
streets and a straight line connecting them at points twenty (20) feet distant from the intersection
of the street lines, provided that the requirement shall not apply in a district where no minimum
front yard is required.
Lot Area. If the owner of a lot in any district does not own a parcel or tract of land immediately
adjacent to such lot, and if the deed or instrument under which such owner acquired title to such
lot was of record prior to the application of any zoning regulations and restrictions to the premises,
and if such lot does not conform to the requirements of such regulations and restrictions as to
width of lots and lot area per family, the provisions of such lot area per family and lot width

the ground varies from the street layout as shown on this Map.
Classify commercial or industrial uses not specifically listed in this Chapter.
Permit reconstruction of a non-conforming building otherwise prohibited by Article XIII
where such action would not constitute continuation of a monopoly.
Vary the yard regulations where there is an exceptional or unusual physical condition of a
lot not generally prevalent in the neighborhood, which condition when related to the yard
regulations of this Chapter would prevent a reasonable or sensible arrangement of
buildings on the lot.
Vary the parking regulations where it is conclusively shown that the specific use of a
building would make unnecessary the parking space otherwise required by this Chapter
or where it can be conclusively shown that adequate off-street parking to serve a
particular use has been provided by or is controlled by the municipality.
Vary the screening requirements applicable to the "B-1", "B-2" and "I-1" Districts, to

and safety or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding
area, or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the
City of Kennett.

Section 405.240. Generally.
[Ord. No. 967 Art. VII §22, 5-18-1965; Ord. No. 2331 §1(E — I), 6-15-1993; Ord. No. 2499 §1, 12-17-
1996]
The following requirements and standards of design shall apply to the subdivision of land:
Accuracy of surveyed dimensions shown on plat. A boundary traverse shall be run and all
other surveyed dimensions shown on the plat shall be to an accuracy of one (1) part to five
thousand (5,000). This traverse shall be tied to the nearest section corner, quarter-section
corner or quarter-quarter corner.
Alleys. Alleys or comparable facilities shall be provided at the rear of lots to be used for
business purposes, where the subdivider shows evidence to the Commission of the need for
alleys.
Angles of streets at intersections. Intersections of streets shall be at an angle as nearly ninety
degrees (90°) as possible, and shall not be less than seventy-five degrees (75°). Lot corners
at these intersections shall be designed with radii of not less than thirty (30) feet and shall not
project beyond the line drawn from points on the centerline of the intersecting streets sixty
(60) feet distant from the intersection of said centerlines.
Arrangement of lots as to street lines. Arrangements of lots shall be at right angles to street
lines if possible, or radial to curved street lines.
Arrangement of parcel where tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots.
In case a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall
be so arranged as to allow the extension of existing streets and future streets as defined in
the "master plan".
Benchmarks. Benchmarks shall be established within or immediately adjacent to each block
of the subdivision or each ten (10) acre part thereof. Benchmarks shall be established on
solid permanent structures or materials and the elevation thereof shall be noted on the plans
for improvement.
Building setbacks to conform to zoning regulations. Building setbacks shall in all cases
conform to, or exceed, those established in any zoning regulations.
Consideration to be given sites for schools, parks, and other public uses. Due consideration
shall be given by all subdividers and by the Commission to sites for schools, parks and other
public uses, as shown on the City Plan when adopted by the City Council.
Curvature of streets. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees (10°) in the
alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius shall be introduced. On streets
more than fifty (50) feet in width the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than three
hundred (300) feet, on other streets not less than one hundred (100) feet.
Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs) shall be designed so that turn-arounds at
the closed ends shall have a minimum radius for the outside curb of at least forty (40) feet.
Exceptions in community unit development. Whenever a subdivision is developed under a
Community Unit Plan as defined in the Zoning Code, wherein adequate park area is provided
and through traffic is adequately cared for and the majority of the minor streets are of the culde-
sac type, the Commission may vary the requirements of Section 405.240 of this Article in
order to allow the subdivider more freedom in the arrangement of the streets and lots, but at
the same time protect the convenience, health and safety of the future residents of the
subdivision, as well as the general welfare of the entire community. In no case, however, shall

ordinance.
Increasing size of corner lots. Corner lots shall be increased in size so as to permit the
establishment of front building lines on both streets.
Individual sewage disposal system and private water supply. Subdivisions proposed for either
individual sewage disposal systems or private water supply shall not be approved unless the
subdivider shows to the satisfaction of the Commission that public water and sewer are not
available. Approval of subdivision plans for either individual sewage disposal systems and/or
private water supply shall be based on specifications required by the Division of Health of
Missouri, as published in the "Guide for the Construction of Individual Water Supply and
Sewage Disposal System", provided however, that each lot shall have a minimum frontage of
one hundred (100) feet and a twenty thousand (20,000) square foot minimum lot size.
Lots to front on a public street. Each lot shall front on a public street.
Maintenance of common facilities. Where the subdivision contains paving, sewers, sewage
treatment plants, water supply systems, park areas, street trees or other physical facilities
necessary or desirable for the welfare of the area or that are of common use or benefit which
are not or cannot be satisfactorily maintained by any existing public agency, provision shall be
made by trust agreement made a part of the deed restrictions, or protective covenants
acceptable to any agency having jurisdiction over the location and improvement of such
facilities, for the proper and continuous maintenance and supervision of such facilities.
Maximum length of blocks. Blocks shall not exceed one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet in
length.
Monuments. Permanent monuments shall be set at each lot corner and at each subdivision
boundary corner. Said monuments shall be solid iron rods or steel pipe with an outside

inches and driven flush with the ground. Steel pipe monuments shall have a wall thickness of
not less than one-tenth (0.10) inches.
Relation to existing streets. The arrangements of highways and streets in new subdivisions
shall make provisions for the continuation of existing highways and streets (or their proper
projection where adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be deemed
necessary by the Commission for public requirements.
Size, width and area of lots. The size and shape of residential lots shall be as the
Commission deems appropriate for the type of building development contemplated; provided
however, that lots for residential purposes wherein both sewer and water connections are
provided, shall be a minimum of sixty (60) feet average width and one hundred twenty-five
(125) feet average depth, and they shall contain a minimum of seven thousand five hundred
(7,500) square feet. Size, width and area shall in no case be less than that specified for the
location in any zoning regulations.
Street names. Proposed streets that are in alignment with existing streets already named
shall bear their names. No new street shall duplicate names of existing streets.
Width of blocks. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow for two (2) tiers of lots of minimum
depth except where prevented by topographical conditions, location, or size of property, in
which case the Commission may alter the size.

Chapter 415. Flood Damage Prevention
Editor's Note — Ord. no. 2593, adopted on July 18, 2000, repealed this entire ch. 415 enacting the
new provisions set out herein. Former ch. 415 derived from ord. no. 2009 art. 1 — 7 §§A — E, 4-7-
1987.
Article I. Findings of Fact and Purpose
Section 415.010. Statutory Authorization.
[Ord. No. 2593, 7-18-2000]
The legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section 89.020, RSMo., delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health,
safety and general welfare. Therefore, the City of Kennett, Missouri, ordains same as follows.
Section 415.020. Findings of Fact.
[Ord. No. 2593, 7-18-2000; Ord. No. 2708 §1, 4-20-2004]
Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of Kennett,
Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood
heights and velocities; and

The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a
series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations, which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on
the particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood, which could
be expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as
delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated
December 1979, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis
of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more
than one (1) foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that
would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still
subject to inundation by the base flood.
Section 415.030. Statement of Purpose.
[Ord. No. 2593, 7-18-2000]
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to
minimize those losses described in this Section:
To establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3);
and
To meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of
flooding or cause undue increases on flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be
provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.

and unnumbered A Zones and AE Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood
Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) dated June 4, 1980, as amended, and any future revisions
thereto. In all areas covered by this Chapter, no development shall be permitted except through the
issuance of a floodplain development permit granted by the City Council or its duly designated
representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the City Council or the designated
representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare,
health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in Article IV.

requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body, and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State Statutes.
Section 415.090. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
[Ord. No. 2593, 7-18-2000]
The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on
rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams
and bridge openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway
and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage.
This Chapter shall not create a liability on the part of the City of Kennett, any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.

Section 415.180. Floodway.
[Ord. No. 2593, 7-18-2000]
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 415.040 are areas designated
as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principal that the
area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any
point.
The community shall prohibit any encroachments including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
If subparagraph (2) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this Article.

Section 415.240. Conditions for Approving Floodplain
Management Variances.
[Ord. No. 2593, 7-18-2000]
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing Subsections (B) through (F)
below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed in
the National Register of Historical Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or Local
Inventory of Historic Places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude
the structure's continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that:
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such
notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this
Chapter.

[Ord. No. 2593, 7-18-2000]
Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case-bycase
analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following
conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in Sections 415.230 and 415.240 of
this Article.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and
safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures
that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.
Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in
Zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building
components and elements (i.e. foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring,
etc.) below the base flood elevation must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance
with Section 415.150(D)(2) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure in accordance with Section 415.150(D)(1) of this Chapter. All of the
building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces
including hydrostatic, buoyancy and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood
elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed
enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with
Section 415.150(D)(4) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening
requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year
flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater in
accordance with Section 415.160(3) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway
encroachment provisions of Section 415.180(2) of this Chapter. No variances may be issued
for accessory structures within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels would
result during the 100-year flood.
Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.
No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be
paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official
that:
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
Such construction below the base flood level increase risks to life and property. Such
notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this
Chapter.
Wet-floodproofing construct construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the
community and registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any
floodplain development permit for construction.

Chapter 425. Storm Water Management Plan
Section 425.010. Introduction.
[Ord. No. 2924 §1, 6-18-2013]
Phase II of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) storm water permitting
programming, a Federal Clean Water Act requirement delegated to the Missouri Department of
Natural Resources, requires Cities with Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s) to
implement storm water maintenance and management programs as a means to control polluted
discharges.
The City of Kennett has a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) and because the City
has a population of over ten thousand (10,000), it is a Missouri regulated MS4 City and must
obtain a NPDES storm water permit. In order to obtain a permit, the City is required to develop a
Storm Water Management Plan (SMP). The Storm Water Management Plan will be a dynamic
document to be revised over time to better able the City to meet the following objectives:
Solve existing flood/drainage problems.
Prevent future flood/drainage damage.
Preserve natural and beneficial functions of the existing drainage system.
Preserve and enhance storm water quality.
In order to preserve and enhance storm water quality, the Storm Water Management Plan
summarizes the City's intentions to reduce the amount of pollution in its storm water runoff by
addressing the six (6) mandated categories of concern listed in the permit. These categories are
as follows:

The City has adapted this plan to reflect its own unique situation and intends to review and
improve this plan each year. As circumstances change, objectives 1, 2 and 3 will also be
addressed to better control storm water. This plan is a foundation on which new and innovative
ideas and solutions can be developed to better project the water quality of our local streams.
Section 425.020. City Information.
[Ord. No. 2924 §1, 6-18-2013]
Name Of City: Kennett, Missouri.
Population: Ten thousand nine hundred thirty-two (10,932).
Water Supply: One hundred (100) to one hundred thirty (130) feet deep.
Waste Water Treatment: Aerated lagoons.
Water Shed: Buffalo Ditch, Varney River Ditch, Ragland Slough.
Geologic Setting: Missouri Southeast Lowlands-Bootheel Area.
Average Rainfall: Forty-six (46) inches per year, subject to occasional thunderstorm events of over
three (3) inches possible.
Kennett is located in the Missouri Bootheel. Soil samples demonstrate late Ternary/Quaternary
geology. The Bootheel lies in a floodplain between the Mississippi and St. Francis Rivers; the land
is very flat and is now used for predominantly agricultural purposes, but was mostly abandoned,
swampy forestland before the 20th century. Between 1893 and 1989, about eighty-five percent
(85%) of the native forest were cut; the entire landscape was transformed into farmland by
extensive logging, drainage of the water shed, and the construction of flood control structures.
High levees along both courses and an extensive system of drainage ditches, diversion channels,
and controlled lakes, pumping stations and cutoffs protect much of the area from flooding.
The City has a number of deteriorated storm water drains that have been replaced or repaired
over the past several years. Due to the purchase of a combination sewer truck for cleaning storm
drainage pipes, ponding water in streets and low areas has greatly decreased.

Maintenance Officer to make inspections and perform all the duties required of him/her by this
Chapter. Upon receiving a complaint or report from any source, that a dangerous building
exists in the City, the Building Commissioner shall cause an inspection to be made forthwith.
If the Building Commissioner deems it necessary to the performance of his/her duties and
responsibilities imposed herein, the Building Commissioner may request an inspection and
report be made by any other City Department or retain services of an expert whenever the
Building Commissioner deems such service necessary.
Upon receipt of a report from the Code Enforcement/Property Maintenance Officer indicating
failure by the owner, lessee, occupant, mortgagee, agent or other persons(s) having interest
in said building to commence work of reconditioning or demolition within the time specified by
this Chapter or upon failure to proceed continuously with work without unnecessary delay, the
Building Commissioner shall hold a hearing giving the affected parties full and adequate
hearing on the matter.
Written notice of said hearing shall be given, either by personal service or by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or if service cannot be had by either of those modes of service then,
by publication in a newspaper qualified to publish legal notices, at least ten (10) days in
advance of the hearing date, to the owner, occupant, mortgagee, lessee, agent and all other
persons having an interest in said building as shown by the land records of the Recorder of
Deeds of Dunklin County, to appear before the Building Commissioner on the date specified
in the notice to show cause why the building or structure reported to be a dangerous building
should not be repaired, vacated or demolished in accordance with the statement of particulars
set forth in the Code Enforcement/Property Maintenance Officer's notice as provided herein.
Any party may be represented by counsel and all parties shall have an opportunity to be
heard.
Make written findings of fact from the evidence offered at said hearing as to whether or not
the building in question is a dangerous building within the terms of Section 535.020 of this
Chapter.
If the evidence supports a finding based upon competent and substantial evidence that the
building or structure is a dangerous building, and a nuisance and detrimental to the health,
safety or welfare of the residents of the City, the Building Commissioner shall issue an order
based upon its findings of fact commanding the owner, occupant, mortgagee, lessee, agent or
other persons(s) having an interest in said building as shown by the land records of the
Recorder of Deeds of Dunklin County to repair, vacate or demolish any building found to be a
dangerous building and to clean up the property, provided that any person so notified, shall
have the privilege of either repairing or vacating and repairing said building, if such repair will
comply with the ordinances of this City or the owner or any person having an interest in said
building as shown by the land records of the Recorder of Deeds of Dunklin County, may
vacate and demolish said dangerous building at his/her own risk to prevent the acquiring by
the City of the lien against the land where the dangerous building stands. If the evidence does
not support a finding that a building or structure is a dangerous building, or a nuisance or
detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the City, no order shall be
issued.
If the Building Commissioner or other designated officer or officers issue an order whereby
the building or structure is demolished, secured, or repaired, or the property is cleaned up, the
cost of performance shall be certified to the City Clerk or Officer in charge of finance, who
shall cause a special tax bill or assessment therefor against the property to be prepared and
collected by the City Collector or other official collecting taxes, unless the building or structure
is demolished, secured or repaired by a contractor pursuant to an order issued by the City
and such contractor files a mechanic's lien against the property where the dangerous building
is located. The contractor may enforce this lien as provided in Sections 429.010 to 429.360,

The City shall release the proceeds and any interest that has accrued on such proceeds
received under subdivision (1) of this Subsection to the insured or as the terms of the policy

building or structure and the lot on which it is located, less salvage value, shall be paid to the
insured.
If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in Subsection (A) of this Section, at
the request of the taxpayer, the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not more than
ten (10) years. The tax bill from date of its issuance shall be a lien on the property and a personal
debt against the property owner(s) until paid.
Subsection (A) of this Section shall apply to fire, explosion or other casualty loss claims arising on
all buildings and structures.
Subsection (A) of this Section does not make the City a party to any insurance contract, and the
insurer is not liable to any party for any amount in excess of the proceeds otherwise payable
under its insurance policy.
The Building Commissioner may certify in lieu of payment of all or part of the covered claim under
Subsection (A) that it has obtained satisfactory proof that the insured has removed or will remove
the debris and repair, rebuild or otherwise make the premises safe and secure. In this event, the

system.
To promote the elimination, containment, isolation, or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable water system and non-potable
water systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial-process systems.
To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will
systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water
systems.
Application. This Article shall apply to all premises served by the public potable water systems of
the City of Kennett, Missouri.
Policy.
This Article will be reasonably interpreted by the Kennett Board of Public Works hereinafter

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which
reference is made in this Article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American
Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and
to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved
will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate
or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and
suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls,
whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.)
No statement contained in this Section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or
arrangement between the City of Kennett and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste
of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the City of Kennett for treatment, subject to
payment by the industrial concern.

Section 715.030. Annual Revenues to Be Generated.
[Ord. No. 2328 Art. III, 6-1-1993]
The purpose of this Chapter is to assure that the user charge system shall generate adequate
annual revenues to pay costs of annual operation, maintenance, and replacement and the costs
associated with debt retirement of bonded capital associated with financing the sewer system
which the City may, by ordinance, designate to be paid by the user charge rate. Funds (accounts)
to accomplish this have been set by Bond Issue Ordinance No. 2328 adopted June 1, 1993. This
Sewer User Charge System Ordinance further details the sewer user charge rates and gives
illustrations of how those rates were determined.
That portion of the total user charge collected which is designated for operation, maintenance, and
replacement purposes as established in Section 715.040, shall be deposited in a separate nonlapsing
fund known as the Operating, Maintenance, and Replacement Fund and will be kept in two
(2) primary accounts as follows:
An account designated for the specific purpose of defraying operation and maintenance
costs, excluding replacement, of the sewer system (Operation and Maintenance Account).
An account designated for the specific purpose of ensuring replacement needs over the
useful life of the sewer system equipment (Depreciation and Replacement Account). Deposits
in the Replacement Account shall be made at least annually from the operation, maintenance
and replacement revenue in the amount of twenty-six thousand dollars ($26,000.00) annually.
(Reference is made to Appendix "B", which is on file in the City offices.)
Fiscal year-end balances in the Operation and Maintenance Account and the Replacement
Account shall be carried over to the same accounts in the subsequent fiscal year, and shall be
used for no other purposes than those designated for these accounts. Monies which have been
transferred from other sources to meet temporary shortages in the Operation, Maintenance, and
Replacement Funds shall be returned to their respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of
the user charge rates for operation, maintenance and replacement. The user charge rate(s) shall
be adjusted such that the transferred monies will be returned to their respective accounts within
the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the monies were borrowed.
Section 715.040. Charges Determined — How.
[Ord. No. 2328 Art. IV, 6-1-1993; Ord. No. 2494 §1, 12-3-1996]
For residential contributors, monthly sewer user charges will be based on water used during the
current month as determined by water meter(s) acceptable to the City.
For industrial and commercial contributors, sewer user charges shall be based on water used
during the current month as determined by water meter(s) acceptable to the City. If a commercial
or industrial contributor has a consumptive use of water, or in some other manner uses water
which is not returned to the wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor may
be based on a wastewater meter(s) or separate water meter(s) installed and maintained at the

contributor's expense and in a manner acceptable to the City; however, separate meters for lawn
sprinkling are not allowable.
(Reference is made to Appendix "A", which is on file in the City offices). For users residing within
the City limits of Kennett, Missouri, the minimum sewer charge per month for the first (1st) one
thousand (1,000) gallons of water used shall be one dollar sixty-six cents ($1.66) for a five-eighths
(?) inch meter and two dollars forty-one cents ($2.41) for a one (1) inch water meter. In addition,
each contributor shall pay a user charge rate of eighty-six cents ($0.86) per each one thousand
(1,000) gallons of water (or wastewater) used (or contributed) over one thousand (1,000) gallons
for operation, maintenance, replacement, debt retirement, and other miscellaneous expenses as
determined in the preceding Section. The maximum monthly sewer charge assessed to any
single-family residential contributor shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00).
For sewer users who obtain water partially or wholly from a source other than the City water
system, then said user shall pay the same rates as set forth in Section 715.040 (D). In the
absence of a water meter, the amount of water used shall be estimated by the Utilities
Superintendent of the Kennett Board of Public Works. The water use estimate shall be reviewed at
least annually, or more often if the City so decides, by the Utilities Superintendent of the Kennett
Board of Public Works, or his/her representative, and modified as necessary.
For sewer users residing outside the City limits of Kennett, Missouri, a flat rate may be charged in
addition to the rates set forth in Section 715.040(C). The amount of the additional flat charge shall
be determined and recommended by the Utilities Superintendent of the Kennett Board of Public
Works. The flat rate shall be reviewed at least annually, or more often if the City so decides, by the
Utilities Superintendent of the Kennett Board of Public Works, or his/her representative, and
modified as necessary.
(Reference is made to Appendix "A", which is on file in the City offices). For those contributors
who contribute wastewater, the strength of which is greater than normal domestic sewage, a
surcharge in addition to the normal user charge will be collected. The surcharges for operation,
maintenance, and replacement are:
$0.12 per pound BOD
$0.05 per pound SS
$0.00 per pound other pollutant(s) (to be determined as necessary)
Any user discharging, or proposing to discharge, any toxic pollutant(s) that will, or could, increase
the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the City's sewer system, or any user
discharging any substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable
increases in the cost of operation, maintenance, or replacement of the sewer system, shall pay for
such increased costs. The charge to each such user shall be determined by the Utilities
Superintendent of the Kennett Board of Public Works, or his/her representative, and modified as
necessary.
The quantity of water used on premises furnished with sewer services by the City shall be
measured by the water meter or water meters serving the premises. The Utilities Superintendent
of the Kennett Board of Public Works, or his/her representative, shall have access to the premises
