involve the operation of a commercial motor vehicle, and for which no points are assessed by
the Missouri Department of Revenue or the Missouri Department of Revenue is authorized to
assess no more than four (4) points to a person's driving record upon conviction. A minor
traffic violation shall include amended charges for any minor traffic violation. Minor traffic
violation shall exclude a violation for exceeding the speed limit by more than nineteen (19)

ordinance violation and there shall be no penalty or fine declared for such breach or violation, any
person who shall be convicted thereof shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each offense or imprisoned for not to exceed three (3) months, or suffer both such
fine and imprisonment as may be just; provided, however, that where the City and the State both
prescribe the same offense, the penalty for violating the City provision shall be the same as is set
by Statute (except that imprisonment may be in the City Jail) but may not exceed the maximums
set forth above. In the event, however, a person shall be convicted of the same or similar violation
of this Code for a third time, then the fine imposed for such violation shall be not less than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) and the imprisonment imposed shall be for not less than five (5) days,
and there shall be imposed both such fine and imprisonment as the judge of the Municipal Court
shall determine appropriate after considering these minimum standards for fines and
imprisonment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a person over the age of eighteen (18) years shall
be convicted for violation of the provisions of Section 210.340 or Section 210.345 of this Code for
a second time, then the fine imposed for such violation shall not be less than three hundred dollars
($300.00) and there shall be imposed such fine as the judge of the Municipal Court shall
determine appropriate, after considering this minimum standard for fines. Further notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Court shall not assess a fine, if combined with the amount of
Court costs, totaling in excess of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) for a minor traffic
violation or for municipal ordinance violations committed within a twelve-month period beginning
with the first violation, two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the first such violation, two hundred
seventy-five dollars ($275.00) for the second violation, three hundred dollars ($300.00) for the
third (3rd) violation, and four hundred fifty dollars ($450.00) for the fourth (4th) and any

The style of the ordinances of the City shall be: "Be it ordained by the Board of Aldermen of the
City of Manchester, State of Missouri, as follows:" No ordinance shall be passed except by bill,
and no bill shall become an ordinance unless on its final passage a majority of the members
elected to the Board of Aldermen shall vote for it, and the "ayes" and "nays" be entered on the
journal. Every proposed ordinance shall be introduced to the Board of Aldermen in writing and
shall be read by title or in full two (2) times prior to passage, and no bill shall be read two (2) times
at any one (1) meeting except in case of an emergency. In case of such emergency, a bill may be
read two (2) times at any one (1) meeting, but only with the consent of the majority of the
members of the Board of Aldermen present at such meeting. Such consent shall establish the
emergency. If the proposed ordinance is read by title only, copies of the proposed ordinance shall
be made available for public inspection prior to the time the bill is under consideration by the
Board of Aldermen. No bill shall become an ordinance until it shall have been signed by the
Mayor, or person exercising the duties of the Mayor's office, or shall have been passed over the
Mayor's veto as is provided by law.
Before the final passage, an amended paragraph of a bill must be read actually as it shall read
after final passage, including the amendment incorporated since the bill's introduction. Any
Alderman or Aldermen introducing a bill may make an amendment to that bill at any time, either
verbally or in writing, without the approval of the Board; amendments made by an Alderman who
did not introduce the bill may be made verbally or in writing, but such amendment must receive the
same approval required to pass an ordinance; otherwise, such amendment shall fail to be
incorporated into the bill at the time such bill shall be voted upon for passage. Any amendment by
any Alderman to a bill after its second reading, however, must be in writing, except with the
unanimous approval of the other Aldermen present.
Only an introducer of a bill may move for its second (2nd) reading, but any Alderman may call for
a vote of passage after a bill has been read the second (2nd) time. Any bill which has no action
taken on it at four (4) successive regular meetings of the Board shall be automatically removed
from the agenda and may be placed on the agenda at its former procedural position only with the

When voting on a resolution, motion or bill, a member of the Board of Aldermen may vote for the
matter, against the matter or abstain from voting. An abstention shall be counted as neither a vote for
the proposition nor against the proposition but shall be recorded merely as an abstention. If an
abstention is premised upon a member's conflict of interest, it shall be the duty of that member so
voting to inform the Board of the existence of such a conflict. If an abstention is premised upon a
member's uncertainty or indecision, the reason(s) for such uncertainty or indecision shall be
specifically made known to the Board.

The Mayor shall have a seat in and preside over the Board of Aldermen, but shall not vote on any

party. He/she shall exercise a general supervision over all the officers and affairs of the City, and shall

Every bill duly passed by the Board of Aldermen and presented to the Mayor and by him/her approved
shall become an ordinance, and every bill presented as aforesaid, but returned with the Mayor's
objections thereto, shall stand reconsidered. The Board of Aldermen shall cause the objections of the
Mayor to be entered at large upon the journal, and proceed at its convenience to consider the question

interested parties and shall include:
A statement of the time, place and nature of the hearing;

Following the hearing, the Board of Aldermen shall make a determination conclusively
resolving any unresolved issues, which shall be final and binding and not subject to review. If
the Board of Aldermen orders a rerun election, the order shall contain the date of the election
and set forth the date of eligibility for purposes of voting in the election. The date of the
election shall not be less than thirty (30) days from the date an election is directed.
In evaluating disputes concerning the election, the Board of Aldermen may consider, but shall
not be bound by, precedent from other cities, other states and/or the National Labor Relations
Act.[1]
Editor's Note: See 29 U.S.C. § 151 et seq.
The decision of the Board of Aldermen on such disputes will be final and binding.
If there is no dispute concerning the election, then the results of the election will become final
seven (7) days after the report on the election is issued.
After the results of the election become final, if a majority of the members of the bargaining unit
voted to be represented by the labor organization, the Board of Aldermen will recognize the labor
organization as representing the employees of the bargaining unit.
No labor organization may seek to represent any bargaining unit (or portion of any bargaining unit)
by secret ballot election more than once in any consecutive twenty-four-month period.
In the event that the majority of the employees in a designated bargaining unit determine that they
no longer wish to be represented by a recognized labor organization, they may revoke their
designation of the labor organization by tendering a signed and dated petition for revocation to the
Board of Aldermen. Upon receipt of such a petition, the Mayor will designate a three-person
Recognition Committee (consisting of the City Administrator and two (2) members appointed from
among the members of the Board of Aldermen) to determine if the petition to revoke
representation is authentic. Upon the report of the Recognition Committee, if the petition is
determined to be authentic, the Board of Aldermen shall then revoke recognition of the labor
organization as bargaining agent for that bargaining unit.
The City's obligation to recognize the labor organization and/or bargain with the labor organization
shall automatically expire on the second anniversary of the election. The labor organization may,
however, file a new petition pursuant to Section 125.020 on or after said second anniversary.
Section 125.040. Collective Bargaining.
[Ord. No. 13-2058 §1, 9-16-2013]
In the event that the majority of members of the bargaining unit vote to be represented by the
labor organization for purposes of collective bargaining, a City negotiator, designated by the Mayor
and approved by the Board of Aldermen, will meet with the labor organization to confer and
discuss wages, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment, with the goal of reaching
a mutually satisfactory proposed collective bargaining agreement to be submitted to the Board of
Aldermen for approval.
If the City negotiator and the labor organization reach a tentative agreement on a proposed
collective bargaining agreement, the proposed agreement will be submitted to the Board of
Aldermen as an agenda item for consideration on their next regularly scheduled meeting. At
that meeting, the Board of Aldermen will approve, reject or hold the proposed collective
bargaining agreement open for further discussion.
If the City negotiator and the labor organization are unable to reach an agreement on the
terms of a proposed collective bargaining agreement after substantial negotiations, the City
negotiator may unilaterally submit the City negotiator's proposed collective bargaining

prospective suppliers of the item to be purchased or services to be performed. If three (3)
responsible suppliers cannot be reasonably located, the department head shall certify that
fact to the City Administrator upon presentation of the bids. Notice of the invitation to bid shall
be posted in the lobby of City Hall and on the City's website.
Sealed bids shall be received by the appropriate department head and shall be identified as

Section 205.150. Appeal and Hearing.
[Ord. No. 13-2060 §1, 11-4-2013]
If the circumstances surrounding the classification as a dangerous animal under any of the

Section 205.160. Exemptions To Dangerous Animal
Classification.
[Ord. No. 13-2060 §1, 11-4-2013]
The Chief of Police may, because of extenuating circumstances, determine from the investigation
of an incident that an animal is not dangerous. Extenuating circumstances include, but are not
limited to, if the threat, injury, or damage was sustained by a person who, at the time, was
committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner or keeper of
the animal, or was teasing, tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the animal, or has, in the past, been
observed or reported to have teased, tormented, abused, or assaulted the animal or was
committing or attempting to commit a crime. However, the owner, being responsible for said
animal, shall be warned of the animal's tendencies and shall take appropriate action to prevent
subsequent incidences. A determination that the animal is not dangerous does not exempt the
owner from being cited for other animal control ordinance violations.
Animals owned by governmental or law enforcement agencies when being used in the services of
those agencies are exempt.
Determinations that an animal is not dangerous are not binding, and upon further information or
future incidents, the Chief of Police may revise his previous decision and declare an animal
dangerous.

An animal responsible for a provoked severe or fatal attack should be maintained as a dangerous
animal pursuant to other provisions of this chapter.
Section 205.180. Owners' Responsibilities.
[Ord. No. 13-2060 §1, 11-4-2013]

register shall constitute a violation of this Section. Notice of this requirement shall be given by
posting a copy of this Section in City Hall and on the City's website.
Rabies Quarantine Impoundment. Any dangerous animal which bites or scratches a human,

human, shall be impounded for a ten-day rabies quarantine in accordance with the other
provisions of this Code.
Any dangerous animal shall wear, at all times, a bright orange collar with a large brightly
colored metal tag attached to the collar so the animal can readily be identified as a dangerous

animal. The bright orange collar shall be of an orange color substantially similar to the blaze
orange (also known as hunter orange) required by the Missouri Department of Conservation
for hunter clothing.
Loose, Unconfined Or Missing Dangerous Animal. The owner or keeper shall notify the Police
Department immediately if a dangerous animal is loose, unconfined or missing, has attacked
another animal or has attacked a human being.
Reporting Requirements. The owner or keeper shall notify the Police Department within
twenty-four (24) hours of the following events:
Death or transfer of ownership. If a dangerous animal has been sold, given away or
otherwise transferred in ownership or possession, the owner or keeper shall provide the
Police Department with the name, address and telephone number of the new owner or
keeper, and, if the animal is kept within the City limits of Manchester, the new owner or
keeper must comply with the requirements of this chapter. If a dangerous animal has
died, the owner shall notify the Police Department of that fact so the animal can be
removed from the dangerous animal registry.
New address. Should the owner or keeper move from one address within the corporate
City limits to another address within the corporate City limits, the owner or keeper shall
provide notice of the new address where the dangerous animal is being kept.
Confinement.
All dangerous animals must be securely confined indoors or in a securely enclosed and
locked pen, kennel or other structure, except when leashed and muzzled as provided
herein. The pen, kennel or other structure must be suitable to prevent the entry of young
children and designed to prevent the animal from escaping. Such pen, kennel or other
structure must have minimum dimensions of five (5) feet by ten (10) feet and must have
secure sides and secure top attached to all sides. The pen, kennel, or other structure
must be locked with a key or combination lock when dangerous animals are confined

to all sides; however, if it has no bottom secured to the sides, the sides must be
embedded in the ground no less than twelve (12) inches. The enclosure must also
provide protection from the elements for the animal.
The enclosure, when occupied by a dangerous animal, shall not be occupied by any
other animal. If the dangerous animal is a female with offspring under three (3) months of
age, the offspring may occupy the same enclosure as the mother.
All structures erected to house dangerous animals must comply with all zoning and
building regulations of the City. All such structures must be adequately lifted and
ventilated and kept in a clean and sanitary condition.
No dangerous animal may be kept on a porch, patio, or in any part of a house or
structure that would allow the animal to exit such building on its own volition. In addition,
no such animal may be kept in a house or structure when the windows are open or when
screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacle preventing the animal from exiting
the structure.
Signs. The owner or keeper shall display a sign on his premises that there is a dangerous
animal on the property and which bears a symbol warning children of the presence of a
dangerous animal. This sign shall be visible and capable of being read from the roadway from
which the property is entered. In addition, a similar sign is required to be posted on the kennel
or pen or fenced yard of such animal.

Section 210.030. Conspiracy.
Guilt for an offense may be based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense when a person, with
the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of an offense, agrees with another person
or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such offense.
It is no defense to a prosecution for conspiring to commit an offense that a person, who knows
that a person with whom he or she conspires to commit an offense has conspired with another
person or persons to commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other person or
persons.
If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he or she can be found guilty of only one
offense so long as such multiple offenses are the object of the same agreement.
No person may be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense unless
an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or
her or by a person with whom he or she conspired.
Exceptions.
No person shall be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense if,
after conspiring to commit the offense, he/she prevented the accomplishment of the
objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his/her
criminal purpose.
The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of renunciation of criminal purpose
under Subsection (E)(1).
For the purpose of time limitations on prosecutions:
A conspiracy to commit an offense is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when
the offense or offenses which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be
committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he or she conspired;
If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him/her only if
he/she advises those with whom he/she has conspired of his/her abandonment or he/she
informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his/her
participation in it.
A person shall not be charged, convicted or sentenced on the basis of the same course of conduct
of both the actual commission of an offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense.
Note: Under certain circumstances this offense can be a felony under state law.

rented property is not a motor vehicle, if such property has not been returned within the seven-day
period prescribed in this Subsection, the owner of the property shall report the failure to return the
property to the local law enforcement agency, and such law enforcement agency may within five
(5) days notify the person who leased or rented the property that such person is in violation of this
Section, and that failure to immediately return the property may subject such person to arrest for
the violation.

the City shall have authority to immediately abate the nuisance in an appropriate manner.
Abatement — Procedure Generally. Whenever the City receives notification that a nuisance may
exist, it shall proceed as follows, except as may be otherwise provided herein:
It shall investigate the same. The City may order any person who has caused or is
maintaining the nuisance to appear before the Chief of Police at such time and place as the
City may direct to show cause, if any, why that person should not abate the nuisance. Every
person required to appear before the Chief of Police shall have at least ten (10) days' notice
thereof.
Such notice shall be signed by the Code Enforcement Officer and shall be served upon that
person by delivering a copy thereof to the person, or by leaving a copy at his/her residence
with some member of the family or household over fifteen (15) years of age, or upon any

the notice cannot be given for the reason that the person named in the notice or his/her agent
cannot be found in the City, of which fact the return upon such notice of the officer serving the
same shall be conclusive evidence, such notice shall be posted on the property, giving at
least ten (10) days' notice from the final publication date of the time fixed for the parties to
appear before the Chief of Police.
If after hearing all the evidence the Chief of Police determines that a nuisance exists, he/she
may direct the Code Enforcement Officer or other City Official to order the person to abate the
nuisance within seven (7) days or within such other time as the Chief of Police may deem
reasonable. Such order shall be served in the manner provided in this Section for service of
the order to show cause. The order may further provide that the appropriate City Official be
directed to abate the nuisance if the order is not obeyed within the time period set by the
Chief of Police, and that a special tax bill be issued for the costs of abating the nuisance.
If the order has not been obeyed within the time period set by the Chief of Police, the
appropriate City Official shall proceed to abate the nuisance in the manner provided by the
order of the Chief of Police, and the cost of same, if ordered by the Chief of Police, may be
assessed as a special tax against the property so improved or upon which such work was
done. If the owner fails to pay the amount of the expenses, the City Administrator shall certify
to the City Clerk the costs of such removal or abatement, and such costs shall thereafter be
included in a special tax bill or added to the annual real estate tax bill, at the City Clerk's
option, for the property, and, if by way of addition to the real estate tax bill, the certified costs
shall be collected by the Collector of Revenue of St. Louis County in the same manner and
procedure for collecting real estate taxes.
The certified costs, if not paid when due, shall be considered delinquent, and the collection of
the delinquent bill shall be governed by the laws governing delinquent and back taxes.
The certified costs, from the date of certification, shall be deemed a personal debt against the
owner and shall also be a lien on the property until paid.
Notice. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any reference in this Chapter to the need
for a notice to a property owner or occupant of property on which a nuisance is alleged to be
occurring shall mean a notice, in writing, which shall specifically describe each condition of the lot
or land declared to be a nuisance, and which notice shall identify what action will remedy said
nuisance. Unless a condition presents an immediately, specifically identified risk to the public
health or safety, the notice shall provide a reasonable time, but not less than ten (10) days, in
which to abate or commence removal of each condition identified in the notice. Written notice may
be given by personal service or by first-class mail to both the occupant of the property at the
property address and the owner of the property at the last known address of said owner, if not the
same.

Exemption. Outdoor cooking activities conducted by civic, religious and charitable institutions
which engage in such activities fewer than two (2) times per calendar year are exempt from the
permitting requirements of this Section. The Board of Aldermen may also waive the requirements
of this Section for other infrequent and sporadic outdoor cooking activities associated with
charitable or community purposes if the Board believes the frequency, duration, hours of
operation, location, surrounding land uses and topography, and other relevant factors make
imposition of the permitting requirements hereinafter provided unnecessary.
Permit Required For Outdoor Commercial Cooking Activities. No person or entity that is in the
business of selling and/or preparing food shall engage in any outdoor cooking activities without
first obtaining an annual permit issued by the City, in accordance with the following standards:
The application for the permit or renewal shall be made, in writing, on a form and with such
information as is required by the City and an application fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
All applications for an initial permit or a renewal application involving a material change in the
nature, duration or frequency of the proposed activity or the equipment or location to be
utilized shall be accompanied by an odor dissipation study performed by an environmental
engineer or other person qualified to complete such a study. An odor dissipation study must
consider the following:
The density and proximity of residential districts to the proposed site of the outdoor
cooking activities;
Prevailing wind patterns, atmospheric conditions and natural barriers such as trees and
structures that will affect where and how far odors travel;
The proximity to existing permitted outdoor cooking activities and the potential effect of
cumulative odors;
The character and strength of the odor;
The character and density of any particulate matter that would be produced;
The frequency and duration of intended outdoor cooking activities;
The results of any odor measurements taken utilizing an olfactometer or any other device
commonly used to detect the strength of odors; and
The effect of any proposed mitigating device or practice, such as the use of scrubbers.
In considering an application for an initial permit or a renewal application involving a material
change in the nature, duration or frequency of the proposed activity or the equipment or
location to be utilized, the City shall consider the findings of the odor dissipation study and the
written report of the Fire Marshal on the question of whether the proposed activity and
equipment complies in all respects with best practices in fire prevention and control. In
addition, and for renewal applications, the City shall also consider any other factors pertinent
to the permit application such as the proximity of other land uses, topography of the area, the
potential effect of siting and operation of the proposed facility on traffic, parking and public
safety, demands on public services, the availability and proximity of cleaning and drainage
facilities, and any other circumstances which the City may find relevant in light of the nature,
duration and frequency of the proposed activity and existing uses and structures in the
vicinity. The City may also condition the issuance of a permit on compliance with any
requirements or recommendations of the Fire Marshal, and/or require the installation of
mediation devices such as smoke scrubbers, if the City determines such conditions or
devices will assist in ameliorating foreseeable adverse consequences of the proposed

which the permitted facility has been operated in the past, whether the permittee has
consistently complied with all applicable standards and conditions and operated the permitted
facility in a clean and healthful manner, and whether the permitted activity has intruded upon
the peaceable enjoyment of nearby properties or caused unreasonable particulate or odor
pollution.
Safety Standards.
Outdoor cooking devices shall be constructed from non-combustible materials and shall be
securely affixed to the ground at all times in order to protect against high winds and inclement
weather conditions. Outdoor cooking devices shall be insulated by means of exterior
"jacketing" with heat-shielding material.
Outdoor cooking devices shall be "skirted" around the bottom in order to mitigate against
collection of debris, and the areas surrounding outdoor cooking devices shall be kept in a
sufficient state of cleanliness at all times and so as not to attract vermin or insects and so as
to avoid litter. Provision shall be made for the capture, collection and removal of ash,
drippings, bits of food, and other detritus associated with the cooking process in such a
manner that the same shall not fall upon the ground.
Outdoor cooking devices shall be enclosed by fencing using concrete-filled bollards as fence
posts for protection from vehicular traffic and for restriction of pedestrian access. In the event
that an outdoor cooking device is subjected to graffiti or otherwise vandalized, immediate
steps shall be taken to remove the same and remedy the situation. No signs or banners of
any kind (other than a discrete manufacturer's name plate and technical data) may be affixed
on or to the cooking device or surrounding equipment unless approved as part of the sign
regulations applicable to the property where situated or otherwise in compliance with the
City's sign regulations.
Outdoor cooking devices must be fueled via dedicated underground natural gas lines; no
propane tanks or other removable tanks shall be permitted for fueling outdoor cooking
devices.
Outdoor cooking devices shall not be installed and/or maintained in any one (1) or more
marked parking places on the property where situated if to do so will reduce the number of
parking spots provided on the property to a number below that required by the City's
Municipal Code.
An outdoor cooking device must be located at least three hundred (300) linear feet distant
from any residential zoning district lying adjacent to the property where situated.
An outdoor cooking device must be located: (i) at least fifty (50) linear feet distant from the
closest exterior portion of any wall (including any window or door opening on or within the
wall) of any building(s) within the property where situated, or (ii) if there is a sidewalk
alongside and serving any building(s) within the property where situated, then at least fifty
(50) linear feet from the outside edge (the edge closest to the street or parking lot) of any
such sidewalk alongside and serving any building(s) within the property where situated;
provided that, upon request of the person or entity making application for a permit under this
Section, an outdoor cooking device may be located less than fifty (50) linear feet distant from
the closest exterior portion of the wall of the building(s) or the closest sidewalk alongside and
serving such building(s), subject to the outdoor cooking device being located to the rear of the
building(s) and subject to the approval of the City and the Fire Marshal with jurisdiction over
the property where the building(s) is (are) located.
In addition to the foregoing safety standards, construction and placement of outdoor cooking
devices shall comply with all applicable fire and building codes.

Revocation Of Permit. If, in the opinion of the City, an outdoor cooking device is operated in a
manner that is detrimental to the area by allowing unreasonable, excessive, prolonged, or
disturbing odor or smoke so as to unreasonably disturb any person or property, the City may
revoke or amend the permit to operate the outdoor cooking device and abate the nuisance created
thereby in accord with the procedures of this Section. Any person or entity aggrieved by any
determination of the City pursuant to this Section may appeal the decision to the City
Administrator by filing with the City Administrator a written request therefor stating wherein and
why the decision is in error and specifying the facts in support of the appellant's position within five

All development projects, as defined in this Chapter, require tree preservation.
A Tree Survey and a Tree Preservation Plan, prepared by an ISA Certified Arborist, shall be
submitted as part of the City's plan review process.
A Tree Survey shall be in map form and identify the location of existing individual trees
greater than eight (8) inches in DBH, as well as each tree species, DBH and condition.
Woodlands greater than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of contiguous tree canopy may be
delineated as a group and described by forest type and total canopy area;
A Tree Preservation Plan shall be in map form and identify proposed actions to protect
existing trees (public and private) and woodlands on site. Tree Preservation Plans shall show
the proposed development and the location of all trees to be protected, as well as
preservation efforts (protection fencing, signage, root pruning, retaining walls, etc.) to be
installed to protect the critical root zone of existing trees. A limit of disturbance line shall

Tree removal is discouraged but may be approved to allow for maximum use of a site. In these
cases, required minimum woodland preservation, canopy replacement and approval by the City's
Planning and Zoning Commission shall apply.
Where contiguous woodland is to be removed, the developer must retain a minimum thirty
percent (30%) of existing woodland. Woodland preservation should prioritize riparian
corridors, quality species composition and buffer zones.
Any woodlands kept beyond the required thirty percent (30%) may be counted toward the
total caliper of individual trees to be replaced when individual trees are removed.
Where individual trees eight (8) inches in DBH or greater not located in a woodland are to be
removed, trees must be replaced with new trees totaling one-third (1/3) of the number of
caliper inches (i.e. 3:1 ratio of DBH removed and caliper inches replaced).
When possible, replacement trees shall be replanted on site in addition to the required
landscaping. If the site cannot accommodate all required replacement trees, trees may be
planted in public parks or public open space, as directed and approved by the City.
When no appropriate tree locations are available, a payment of one hundred twenty dollars
($120.00) per replacement caliper inch may be paid to the City's Tree Fund; the amount
payable hereunder shall not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per acre.
If thirty percent (30%) woodland preservation, or a 3:1 individual tree replacement, is impossible,
based on unique conditions or circumstances, a developer may request a variance from the City's
Board of Adjustment. No variance will be granted that goes against the spirit and intent of this
Chapter. Additional mitigation fees and accommodations may be applied.
Removal of trees on a development project prior to receiving a Tree Removal Permit will be in
violation of this Chapter and subject to penalties stated in this Code.
Where trees preserved in a development die within one (1) year of project completion, the
developer shall pay an assessment equal to the appraised value of the tree that died. Appraised
value will be calculated based on direction from the most current version of the Guide for Plant
Appraisal authored by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers.
The provisions of Chapters 405 and 415 of this Code, as applicable, must also be adhered to
during the course of development.
Section 250.100. Violation And Penalty.
[Ord. No. 17-2194 § 1, 9-18-2017]
Violation of this Chapter, excluding violations to tree preservation, shall be subject to the penalty
provisions of Section 100.100 of this Code.
If a person removes, damages or performs any prohibited act to any public tree without the
authority provided by this Chapter or City approval, the City Administrator may require
compensatory payments based on the appraised landscape value of the tree(s) removed.
Violation of Tree Preservation during development shall be fined as specified.
Payments shall be made into the City Tree Fund for future forestry efforts in the City.

shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
Green indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the
same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.060,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow,

Steady yellow indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in Section 315.060, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian
shall then start to cross the roadway.
Steady red indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except as provided in paragraph
(b) of this Subsection.
The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the

Section 320.110. Increased Safety Area.
[Ord. No. 18-2242, 12-3-2018]
Purpose. The Board of Aldermen is greatly concerned for the safety of the City's children,
pedestrians and motorists, and believes that slowing traffic will decrease the likelihood of a fatality
or serious injury. The Board has further determined that although it has been studying all options
and has requested the City's Police Department to increase enforcement measures, there has not
been a significant reduction in speeding and safety complaints in certain residential areas. The
Board has further determined that increasing fines in certain areas will have some deterrent effect
on speeding.
Increased Safety Area. For the purposes of this Section, "Increased Safety Area" shall be those
roadways, or portions thereof, that are established by the Board of Aldermen as set forth in
Subsection (D).
Process. Before establishing an Increased Safety Area, the Board of Aldermen shall request a
staff review and recommendation by the City's Public Works Department and Police Department.
Staff shall develop criteria under which all proposed Increased Safety Areas shall be
evaluated.
In evaluating and preparing the recommendation for the Board with regard to a proposed
Increased Safety Area, the Public Works Department and Police Department are authorized
to conduct traffic assessments, engage traffic engineering consultants, perform surveys and
other community engagement, and/or implement any other techniques or studies necessary
to make the recommendation.
An Increased Safety Area shall only be established after a staff recommendation that such a
designation is warranted, and the Board of Aldermen finds it to be necessary for public safety.
Establishment. If based on the staff report the Board determines that it is necessary for public
safety that an area be designated by ordinance as an Increased Safety Area, fines shall be double
the standard fine for traffic violations in that area. Any streets, or portions thereof, within the City
limits of the City of Manchester that are designated by ordinance as double fine zones as provided
herein shall be listed on a schedule entitled Schedule I — Increased Safety Areas, appended to
and printed in the City's Traffic Code.
Double Fine Zone.
If the Board designates by ordinance a roadway, or portion thereof, as an Increased Safety
Area to be a double fine zone, anyone found guilty of a violation involving:
Sections 320.030, 320.060 and 320.070 (speeding);
Section 340.240 (following too close);
Section 340.170 (careless and imprudent driving);
Section 340.180 (improper lane usage); or
Sections 335.040 — 335.060 (failure to yield);
In an Increased Safety Area shall be fined at a rate not less than double the standard fine
for such violation as provided in the schedule established by the City. Nothing herein
shall authorize a fine over two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00), inclusive of court
costs for a minor traffic violation (as defined in Section 100.100 of this Code). The City

shall ensure that proper signage is installed notifying the traveling public of the existence
of the Increased Safety Area and that violators will be subject to double the standard fine.
Notice. Prior to the enforcement of any ordinance instituting a double fine zone, appropriate
signage shall be installed notifying the public that speeding in the area is subject to double fines;
and notification of the establishment of an Increased Safety Area and the double fines for
speeding therein should also be made through the City's website for a period of up to thirty (30)
days after the Board's designation of an Increased Safety Area.

Right turns. Both the approach for a right turn and a right turn shall be made as close as
practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway, except where multiple turn lanes
have been established.
Left turns on two-way roadways. At any intersection where traffic is permitted to move in both
directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left turn shall be
made in that portion of the right-half of the roadway nearest the centerline thereof and by
passing to the right of such centerline where it enters the intersection and after entering the
intersection the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the
centerline of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be made in
that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection.
Left turns on other than two-way roadways. At any intersection where traffic is restricted to
one (1) direction on one (1) or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn
left at any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand lane
lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such vehicle and after entering
the intersection the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection, as nearly as
practicable, in the left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in such direction upon the
roadway being entered, except where multiple turn lanes have been established.
Designated two-way left turn lanes. Where a special lane for making left turns by drivers
proceeding in opposite directions have been indicated by official traffic control devices:
A left turn shall not be made from any other lane;
A vehicle shall not be driven in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn
from or into the roadway or when preparing for or making a u-turn when otherwise
permitted by law; and
A vehicle shall not be driven in the lane for a distance more than five hundred (500) feet.

such signs are in place. Signs indicating the direction of lawful traffic movement shall be placed at
every intersection where movement of traffic in the opposite direction is prohibited.
Section 330.020. One-Way Streets and Alleys.
Upon those streets and parts of streets and in those alleys described and designated by ordinance,
vehicular traffic shall move only in the indicated direction when signs indicating the direction of traffic
are erected and maintained at every intersection where movement in the opposite direction is
prohibited.
Section 330.030. Authority To Restrict Direction of Movement On
Streets During Certain Periods.
The City Traffic Engineer is hereby authorized to determine and designate streets, parts of streets
or specific lanes thereon upon which vehicular traffic shall proceed in one (1) direction during one
(1) period and the opposite direction during another period of the day and shall place and maintain
appropriate markings, signs, barriers or other devices to give notice thereof. The City Traffic
Engineer may erect signs temporarily designating lanes to be used by traffic moving in a particular

the City Traffic Engineer to place and maintain a stop sign, or on the basis of an engineering and traffic
investigation at any intersection a yield sign, on each and every street intersecting such through street
unless traffic at any such intersection is controlled at all times by traffic control signals; provided
however, that at the intersection of two (2) such through streets or at the intersection of a through
street and a heavy traffic street not so designated, stop signs shall be erected at the approaches of
either of said streets as may be determined by the City Traffic Engineer upon the basis of an
engineering and traffic study.
Section 335.030. Other Intersections Where Stop or Yield
Required.
The City Traffic Engineer is hereby authorized to determine and designate intersections where
particular hazard exists upon other than through streets and to determine whether vehicles shall stop
at one (1) or more entrances to any such intersection in which event he/she shall cause to be erected
a stop sign at every such place where a stop is required, or whether vehicles shall yield the right-ofway
to vehicles on a different street at such intersection as prescribed in Subsection (A) of Section
335.040 in which event he/she shall cause to be erected a yield sign at every place where obedience
thereto is required.

An operator or driver when stopping, or when checking the speed of the operator's vehicle, if
the movement of other vehicles may reasonably be affected by such checking of speed, shall
extend such operator's arm at an angle below horizontal so that the same may be seen in the
rear of the vehicle.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the right shall extend such operator's arm
at an angle above horizontal so that the same may be seen in front of and in the rear of the
vehicle and shall slow down and approach the intersecting highway as near as practicable to
the right side of the highway along which such operator is proceeding before turning.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the left shall extend such operator's arm
in a horizontal position so that the same may be seen in the rear of the vehicle and shall slow
down and approach the intersecting highway so that the left side of the vehicle shall be as
near as practicable to the centerline of the highway along which the operator is proceeding
before turning.
The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by a signal
light or signal device in good mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would
not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by
such light or device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand
and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds
twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to
the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen
(14) feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles. The provisions of this
Subsection shall not apply to any trailer which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand
signals of the operator or of the signalling device upon the vehicle pulling such trailer;
provided further, that the provisions of this Section as far as mechanical devices on vehicles
so constructed that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of
such vehicle as above provided shall only be applicable to new vehicles registered within this
State after the first (1st) day of January, 1954.

Section 340.220. Stopping For School Bus.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway upon meeting or overtaking from either direction any
school bus which has stopped on the highway for the purpose of receiving or discharging any
school children and whose driver has in the manner prescribed by law given the signal to stop
shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus
resumes motion, or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State Law:
Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading". Each school bus subject to the provisions of Sections
304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device
approved by the State Board of Education, which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.
Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school system which has a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted
entirely in front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels, and which is used
for the transportation of school children shall be equipped with a crossing control arm. The
crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from
the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right side of the
front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri school children
who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading
or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to
drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district has the
authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or
more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to
stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a
stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers
should proceed with caution, and in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the
school bus with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at
any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided
by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2)
lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the
road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred
(500) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder
and a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in
each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such
time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or
overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite
direction on a highway containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading
zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or controlled access highway at a point where
pedestrians are not permitted to cross the roadway.

Section 340.230. Right-Of-Way At Intersection — Signs At
Intersections.
The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to a vehicle which
has entered the intersection from a different highway, provided however, there is no form of traffic
control at such intersection.
When two (2) vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on
the right. This Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from opposite
directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is attempting to or is making a left turn.
The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close
thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
The driver of a vehicle intending to make a left turn into an alley, private road or driveway shall
yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction when the making of
such left turn would create a traffic hazard.
The City may, on any section of road where construction or major maintenance operations are
being effected, fix a speed limit in such areas by posting of appropriate signs, and the operation of
a motor vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so posted shall be deemed prima facie
evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a violation of Section 340.170.
Section 340.240. Distance At Which Vehicle Must Follow.
The driver of a vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonably safe and

No owner of a motor vehicle registered in this State or required to be registered in this State shall
operate the vehicle, or authorize any other person to operate the vehicle registered or maintain
registration of a motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle, upon the streets
or the alleys of this City, unless the owner maintains the financial responsibility as required in this
Section which conforms to the requirements of the laws of this State. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained
financial responsibility unless such person has financial responsibility which covers the person's
operation of the other's vehicle. However, no owner shall be in violation of this Subsection if
he/she fails to maintain financial responsibility on a motor vehicle which is inoperable or being
stored and not in operation.
For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall mean the ability to respond in
damages for liability on account of accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said
financial responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, in the
amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1)
person in any one (1) accident, and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the amount of fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of two (2) or more persons in
any one (1) accident, and in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to
or destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.
Proof of financial responsibility may be shown by any of the following:
An insurance identification card issued by a motor vehicle insurer or by the Director of
Revenue of the State of Missouri for self-insurance. A motor vehicle liability insurance policy,
a motor vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the name and address of
the insurer, the name and address of the named insured, the policy number, the effective
dates of the policy and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five (5) digits
of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if the insurance policy covers five (5) or
more motor vehicles shall be satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance
identification card.
A certificate of the State Treasurer of a cash or security deposit according to Section 303.240,
RSMo.
A surety bond according to Section 303.230, RSMo.
Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the insured motor vehicle or by the
operator of the motor vehicle if the proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator
rather than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall exhibit the insurance
identification card on the demand of any Peace Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or
commercial vehicle inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident while
that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the officer's or inspector's duties.

Penalty — Confiscation of False Evidence.
No person shall display evidence of insurance to a Law Enforcement Officer knowing there is no valid
liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle as required pursuant to this Article, or knowing the
evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance. If
the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator for displaying invalid
evidence of insurance, the officer shall confiscate the evidence for presentation in court. Any person
convicted of violating this Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.
Section 390.160. Alteration, Production or Sale of Invalid
Insurance Card.

which is compatible with the "H" Historic District plan and with historic and architectural
qualities, or if the owner seeks to demolish the structure for the purpose of terminating the
operation of the improvement and/or replacing it with a building of a non-historic character.
In the case of application for the demolition of a designated historic building for the purpose of
terminating the operation of the improvement and/or replacement of it with a building of a nonhistoric
character, the Planning and Zoning Commission, as promptly as practical and with the
aid of such experts as it deems necessary, shall devise, in consultation with the applicant, a
plan whereby the structure may be preserved.
The owner of a designated historic building shall be bound by the plan proposed by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, except that the owner may appeal said plan to the City's
Board of Adjustment within ten (10) days after receipt of the plan from the Planning and
Zoning Commission. The Board of Adjustment shall, thereafter, affirm or reverse the decision
by the Planning and Zoning Commission concerning said plan, which such decision by the
Board of Adjustment shall conform in all respects to the provisions of these Zoning
Regulations and which shall be final and binding on the City and applicant.
Exclusions. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance or repair
of buildings within the "H" Historic District which involve no change in design, material, color or
outward appearance, nor shall it be so construed as to affect any permit issued by the Building
Official prior to the effective date of this Chapter.
Stopping Work Without A Permit. The Building Official shall promptly stop any work initiated
without or contrary to a permit issued under this Chapter.
Landmarks Fund. The Board of Aldermen is hereby authorized to accept gifts and grants on behalf
of the City of Manchester made specifically for the study, acquisition, designation and preservation
of officially designated landmarks. All such gifts and grants accepted by the City shall be set aside
in a special fund known as the "Landmarks Fund" and such fund shall be distributed, administered
and disbursed by the City Administrator after consultation with the Board of Aldermen, based upon
the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Approval By Board Of Aldermen Of Applications For Demolition Of Designated Historic Buildings.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the approval by the Planning and Zoning
Commission of an application for the demolition of a designated historic building shall not be
considered final until such approval has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Aldermen of
the City or until the expiration of sixty (60) days of such approval by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, whichever shall occur first.
The Variance Of Requirements Due To The Widening/Relocation Of Highway 141 (Woods Mill
Road). An historic building, as designated on the Historic Master Plan for Manchester, which is
proposed to be relocated within the "H" Historic District of the City of Manchester because of, and
only because of, the widening/relocation of Highway 141 (Woods Mill Road) and which would
otherwise be destroyed if not so relocated, shall comply, other relevant provisions of this Chapter
notwithstanding, with the following criteria:
The front yard of such historic building shall be not less than seven (7) feet; and
The parking requirements for such historic building shall be as determined appropriate by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, but in no event less than fifty percent (50%) of the parking

Intent.
The purpose of the following provisions is to recognize the historical heritage of the City of
Manchester; to promote the Planned Business Development District as both a residential and
business community; and to allow for the adaptation of the Planned Business Development
District into a walkable town center as present and future development and redevelopment is
achieved.
The "PBD" District allows for a wide range and diversity of land uses to encourage a denser
pattern of development particularly where retail, office or residential uses mix within
multistoried buildings. Strong, pedestrian connections within the District facilitates human
connection and interaction, and minimizes traffic congestion. The "PBD" is supported by open
spaces, plazas, fountains, public art, public parking, lighting, directional signage, other
streetscape improvements and, where possible, mass transit service.
The intent of the Planned Business Development District is to allow a mix of uses that
complement the historic design of buildings by their size, nature, and appeal to the public.
Site consolidation for redevelopment may occur with special consideration for parking, access
management, traffic considerations, drainage, land and streetscaping, and design features in
concert with the vision articulated in the City's Comprehensive Plan.
Permitted Uses. The following uses have been determined to be consistent with the purpose and
intent expressed for the District. The intent of the Planned Business Development District is to
allow a mix of uses that complement the historic design of buildings by their size (less than eight
thousand (8,000) square feet, unless otherwise specified), nature, and appeal to the public. These
uses are allowed, provided they receive all the necessary approvals and permits from the City of
Manchester:
Accessory uses.
Antique stores.

approval process. The interior or rear portions that do not abut street frontage may be
paved for drive aisles, parking lots or landscaped as needed to satisfy other provisions of
these District requirements.
Building materials and design.
Materials.
Where buildings are preserved or maintained, original materials should be used in
rehabilitation, renovation, and reconstruction. Where they cannot, new material
should match the original in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities.
Substitute materials are acceptable if the form and design of the substitute conveys
the visual appearance of the original.
For new construction, brick, brick-like or stone materials are the most appropriate
materials on facades facing a street, walkway or parking lot and are required. Other
masonry units may be used on interior walls. Synthetic sidings such as vinyl,
aluminum and synthetic stucco (EIFS products) are not historic cladding materials in
the Planned Business Development District and their use is prohibited.
Design.
The buildings in the current area to be covered by the Planned Business
Development District vary tremendously with different architectural styles and by
historic periods. Such details include cornices, roof overhangs, chimneys, lintels,
sills, brackets, exterior materials, window openings, window shutters, entrance
decoration, and storefront elements. It is important to acknowledge that many of the
older buildings have recognizable architectural styles and features. If renovated or
rehabbed, these unique features are encouraged to be maintained or restored on
existing buildings.
With possible in-fill development and redevelopment, this new development pattern
is expected to enhance the potential of the Planned Business Development District.
Walls between buildings could be shared or abut each other on the sides, and the
fronts facing the street should abut the public right-of-way. The design of new
development/redevelopment should be harmonious in form, materials, siting and
scale. Features on new construction shall reinforce scale and character of the
surrounding area by including elements such as storefronts, vertical and horizontal
divisions, upper story windows and decorative features. Dividing facades into bays
helps reduce the scale, and adding detailed elements creates a human scale for the
entire block.
New buildings should be similar in mass and scale with adjacent structures or to the
common overall building mass within the block. Facades facing streets and parking
lots should have character-defining elements, including, but not limited to, windows,
entrances/doorways, transoms, cornices, awnings, lighting, signage and color. New
additions should not destroy historic materials that characterize the property, and the
new additions should differentiate themselves from the existing building but be
compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features of the existing
building and surrounding styles.
Openings: windows and storefronts. New construction in the District should follow the
rhythm, patterns, and ratio of walls to windows and doors of existing buildings as much
as possible and relate to and be compatible with adjacent facades. New buildings or
design shall follow traditional openings such as the recessed jamb on masonry buildings
and the surface-mounted frame on frame buildings or have some other unique, defining
character as opposed to designing openings that are flush with the rest of the wall.
Traditionally designed commercial buildings will have distinctive rows of upper floor

windows and storefronts on the first level. They may vary in size, type, and decoration,
but the windows, frames, openings, and spacing shall be uniform on each floor. Large
display windows are encouraged at the street level. Window types should be compatible
with those found in the District, and window framing appropriate to the historic profile is
acceptable. Any paned windows should be truly divided and not have the clip-on, fake
muntin bars which are not permitted. Storefront entrances should be centered on the wall
with a recessed entrance door. Above-the-door windows and display windows should
have continuous transom windows capped with a cornice that also separates the
storefront from the upper floors. This area could also serve as sign area. Any new or
replacement windows should provide character definition to the building. Clear, insulated
glass is recommended, although interior storm windows may be added. Tinted or
reflective glass or applied films are not permitted.
Rear of buildings. The rear of the buildings facing an interior parking area shall provide
an entrance to the store. Install adequate lighting with sufficient brightness and style that
relates to the character of the building for customer and store security. Rear entry points
shall have enough space to comfortably enter the building and meet all handicapped
requirements. Ensure fire escapes meet safety regulations and that no site elements
inhibit proper egress. Ensure rear porches are well maintained and if used as upper floor
entrance(s), are well lit and meet the building codes. Trash and recycling containers
should be kept away from the rear of the buildings. Consolidate and screen mechanical
and utility equipment in one location. Landscape planters to enhance and highlight the
rear entrance shall be provided.
Signs. Signs in the Planned Business Development District shall be restricted to 1)
projecting signs, 2) wall signs, 3) window signs, 4) electronic message signs, 5) ground
signs, 6) monument signs, and 7) directional signs. (Signs on awnings are covered in the
next Section.) They shall be placed so that they do not obstruct architectural elements
and details that define the design of the building. Ground or monument signs, in general,
are not an appropriate type of sign in a downtown area except for use in the front yard of
a residence that has been converted to commercial use or, in the case of certain
recognized uses, where the building is not positioned near the edge of the right-of-way.
[Ord. No. 15-2097 §1, 2-17-2015]
Projecting signs. The bottom edge of projecting signs for commercial buildings
should be at least ten (10) feet above the sidewalk and project no more than three
(3) feet from the surface of the building. They should not be placed above the
cornice line of the first floor level unless they have a clearance of less than ten (10)
feet. The sign area shall be limited to twenty-four (24) square feet. For residentialtype
buildings used for commercial purposes, projecting signs attached to the wall at
the first floor or porch column are appropriate and should not be located higher than
the top of the porch.
Wall signs. Flat wall signs for commercial buildings can be located above the
storefront, within the frieze of the cornice, on covered transoms, or on the pier that
frames display windows or generally on flat, unadorned surfaces of the facade or in
areas clearly suitable for sign locations. For residential-type buildings used for
commercial purposes, a flat sign attached to the wall at the first floor or between the
porch columns is appropriate. Wall signs shall be no more than five percent (5%) of
the outline of the wall that faces a street or parking area. No signs shall be painted
on the buildings; however, wall murals for public art purposes shall be considered
after careful review by the Building Official for compatibility with the district character.
Window signs. Window signs (interior and exterior) should be approximately five and
one-half (5.5) feet above the sidewalk at the center point. Optional locations could
include eighteen (18) inches from the top or the bottom of the display window glass.
Window signs shall be permitted on the glazing of doors and on upper floor windows
for separate building tenants. Window signs shall be limited to one (1) window per

signs in windows shall be no more than two (2) square feet and only display whether
the establishment is open or closed and time and temperature. There shall be no
advertising with electronic message signs in windows.
Electronic message signs.
An electronic message sign will only be allowed on a lot in excess of one-half
(1/2) acre.
[Ord. No. 18-2205, 2-5-2018]
The location of the sign shall be erected only by attachment to or placement as
a ground or monument sign. The ground or monument sign with an electronic
message sign shall not exceed nine (9) feet in height. No electronic message
signs shall be added to an existing or new pole, pylon, wall, or window signs.
The maximum area of such sign shall not exceed forty-five (45) square feet or
fifty percent (50%) of the total sign area for the ground or monument sign,
whichever is less. The base of the ground or monument sign shall not be
included in the sign area calculations.
Only one (1) electronic message sign per establishment is allowed.
The leading edge of the sign shall be a minimum distance of one hundred (100)
feet from an abutting City residential district boundary.
Animation that does not flash or blink may be used as background. This shall
not include video signs which, in all circumstances, are prohibited.
The text displayed per line on the message signs at any one (1) time shall be
limited to fifteen (15) words.
The use of flashing, blinking characters or continuous message movement is
prohibited.
The maximum brightness of electronic message signs shall not exceed five
thousand (5,000) candelas per square meter during the daylight hours or five
hundred (500) candelas per square meter between sunset to sunrise. The sign
must have an automatic dimmer control or other photosensitive device which
automatically adjusts the brightness and contrast of the sign from the higher
allowed illumination level to the lower allowed level for the time period between
one-half (1/2) hour before sunset and one-half (1/2) hour after sunrise.
Any portion of the message must have a minimum duration of five (5) seconds
and must be a static display. Transition time must be no longer than one (1)
second.
The message displayed on such sign may be changed no more than twice in
any twelve-hour period.
Electronic signs, such as gas prices or time and temperature, will not be
restricted in frequency of message change but must follow all signage
regulations set forth in this Chapter.
Audio speakers or any form of pyrotechnics are prohibited.
Changes to the text on an electronic message sign will not require subsequent
permits; however, it is expected that all graphics and lettering shall meet the

storefronts. They also protect pedestrians from the weather, shield window displays
from sunlight and conserve energy. There are three types of awnings permitted in
the District: 1) standard slope fabric awnings, 2) boxed or curved fabric awnings and
3) canopies and marquees. Aluminum or plastic awnings are not permitted.
Design and placement. Awnings and canopies should be placed over
storefronts, porches, doors or window openings so they do not obscure
elements and damage materials. Designs shall not interfere with existing signs
or distinctive architectural features for the building or with street trees, lights or
other elements along the street. The bottom of the awning valance must be at
least seven (7) feet above the ground or sidewalk to which it relates. The color
of the awning should be coordinated with the overall building color scheme.
Solid colors, wide stripes, and narrow stripes may be appropriate, but not overly
bright or complex patterns. Shiny, plastic-like fabrics are not permitted.
Signs on awnings. Only the front panel or valance of the awning shall be
allowed for signage. Letters can be sewn, screened, applied or painted on the
awning fabric. The minimum space between the edge of the letter and the top
and bottom of the valance should be two (2) inches.
In aggregate, there shall be no more than two (2) signs per wall facing a street of
parking area (excluding a ground or monument sign), and the total square footage of
all signage shall not exceed fifty (50) square feet.
Traffic management.
Access. Access management guidelines are intended to reduce direct curb cuts onto
Manchester Road from individual properties. Through directional signage and other
visual clues, traffic in the District will be funneled back onto Manchester Road at
signalized intersections. Only through redevelopment will existing curb cuts be
eliminated. In addition, developers shall be responsible for installing signals, medians,
creating turn lanes and other improvements to facilitate access management within the
Manchester Road corridor as well as approaches to and from the intersecting streets. As
Manchester Road is under the jurisdiction of MoDOT, any work in the Manchester Road
corridor will require its approval. Traffic studies including progression analyses and other
studies including signal warrants may be required for MoDOT to agree to major corridor
improvements.
Internal circulation between properties. The design for internal circulation shall be
appropriately related to access points and provide for safe and efficient movement of
vehicles and pedestrians between adjacent properties. Internal circulation between
adjacent properties should be facilitated with cross-access easements and the
connecting of parking lots in order to reduce the number of short trips on Manchester
Road.
Circulation within the overall "PBD" Zoning District. To the extent possible,
redevelopment should encourage and facilitate the establishment of a grid network of
streets to improve the overall flow of traffic in the District. This is coupled with the
installation, where possible, of secondary streets running parallel to Manchester Road. In
addition to relieving traffic pressure on Manchester Road, the secondary system of
streets will serve as the primary access point for adjoining businesses and their parking
lots.
Parking and loading. Off-street parking and loading standards shall be as found in

Trees, plantings, and open space. Tree plantings and other plantings, especially
indigenous species that require minimal maintenance, shall be provided in all public
areas. Care shall be taken in selection of such plantings so that the canopy effect does
not block storefronts and signage of adjacent commercial buildings. Portable landscape
planters may be used where appropriate so long as they do not block sidewalks.
Streets, parking, and paving. Where new streets are created, there should be an effort to
connect into the existing grid network to provide alternative access through the District
other than on Manchester Road. Paving should be of a consistent material. On new
streets or where streets are widened, sidewalks, street trees, and other elements that
emphasize human scale shall be provided. Parking lots shall be screened with trees and
shrubs from adjacent streets and sidewalks and include interior planting islands to
provide shade and visual relief from large expanses of paving. These areas shall have
irrigation or available water for landscape maintenance. Install adequate lighting in
parking areas to provide security, selecting appropriate historically styled light fixtures for
the historic setting.
Pedestrian walks and curbs. Paving units such as brick pavers or patterned concrete
materials shall be used on all pedestrian walks. Where there are curb cuts for vehicular
access across pedestrianways, they shall be marked with a change in materials, texture,
color, or grade. Curbing shall be of a stone or exposed concrete aggregate. Distinctive
crosswalk treatments at key intersections or crossings are encouraged. Pedestrian links
to important areas of activity shall be provided. Street furniture elements and obsolete
signs and poles shall not block sidewalks.
Street furniture and lighting. The styled light fixtures on the south side of Manchester
Road in the District shall be expanded to the other streets in the District. The design of
these may vary in different parts of the District. Adequate lighting at critical areas of
pedestrian/vehicular conflict such as parking lots, alleys and crosswalks shall be
provided. These light standards shall provide outlets for seasonal lighting and brackets
for hanging banners and decorations for special events. Historic-style benches shall be
placed at key locations in the District, and trash receptacles should match in design.
Existing or future street furniture such as newspaper boxes, bicycle racks, drinking
fountains, planters and bollards shall be compatible in design, color and materials with
existing materials used in the District.
Signals and utilities. Utilities shall be placed underground wherever possible or located
behind buildings. Surface equipment shall be screened. Transformers and overhead
wires shall be placed so they are as visually unobtrusive as possible. Dumpsters and
trash storage shall be similarly sited and screened.
Public signs, plaques, fountains, and art. Public directional and informational signs in the
District shall conform to existing City standards created for this purpose. Logos, colors
and lettering styles shall conform as additional signage is needed in the District. Street
identification and block numbering shall conform to the standards developed for the
District, including the distinctive logo and colors. Local historical plaques commemorating
significant events, buildings, landmarks, and individuals shall be provided in the District.
Fountains, plazas, benches, and seasonal plantings that add a historic element or design
shall be provided where appropriate. Public art in the form of sculptures, monuments and
statues may be installed but only if it does not block the path of pedestrians. Wall murals
will be considered on exposed walls and with an appropriate design. There shall be no
commercial advertising in any way on a wall mural. Traffic signal control boxes may be
designed and painted with appropriate approvals.
Sidewalk cafes. Elements separating the outdoor dining area from the pedestrianways
and sidewalks shall consist of G-7 size chains or larger, bollards three (3) inches in
diameter, and wrought iron or painted metal. Black shall be the preferred color for these
elements.

Screening of HVAC units and refuse containers. Heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
units shall be fully screened from public view by an element of the building or by a
separate, permanently installed screen or fence, extending a minimum of one (1) foot
above the equipment, harmonizing with the building in material color, size and shape.
Refuse containers or refuse storage areas shall be hidden from public view, either from

Interpretation Of Specific Requirements.
The parking requirements in this Article do not limit other parking requirements contained in
the district regulations.
The parking requirements in this Article do not limit special requirements which may be
imposed with planned unit developments or uses permitted by approval of a special use.
Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be construed to be the next
highest whole number.
Except as otherwise provided, the number of employees shall be compiled on the basis of the
maximum number of persons employed on the premises at one (1) time on an average day or
average night, whichever is greater. Seasonal variations in employment may be recognized in
determining an average day.
The parking space requirements for a use not specifically listed in the chart shall be the same
as for a listed use of similar characteristics of parking demand generation.
Whenever a building or use constructed or established after the effective date of this Chapter
is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating
capacity, or otherwise to create a need for an increase of ten percent (10%) or more in the
number of parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or
change. Whenever a building or use existing prior to the effective date of this Chapter is
enlarged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more in floor area or in the area used, said
building or use shall then and thereafter comply with the parking requirements of the district in
which it is located.

Location Of Parking Spaces In The "H" Historic District. Within the "H" Historic District, the
required parking may be located anywhere within the district or adjacent to the district. Two (2) or
more uses or establishments within the district may set aside a parking lot for joint use, provided
the parking spaces equal the total required for each of the uses, and provided that maintenance
and control of such lot is arranged in a manner approved by the City.
Design Standards.
Minimum Space Area. For the purpose of these regulations, and except as hereinafter
provided for in the "H" Historic District, an off-street parking space is an all-weather surfaced
area, either asphalt, concrete or other material approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, but not rock or macadam, not in a street or alley, and, for angled and
perpendicular parking spaces, having an area of not less than nine (9) feet in width and
twenty (20) feet in length (exclusive of driveways), and, for parallel parking, having an area of
not less than nine (9) feet in width as measured perpendicular to the travel lane, nor less than
twenty-four (24) feet in length as measured parallel to the travel lane, all permanently
reserved for the temporary storage of one (1) vehicle and connected with a street or alley by a
paved driveway which affords ingress and egress for an automobile without requiring another
automobile to be moved. Within the Historic District, cobblestones, bricks or other similar
materials may be utilized as the surfaced area.
[Ord. No. 16-2148 §1, 5-16-2016]
Drainage and maintenance. Off-street parking facilities shall be drained to eliminate standing
water and prevent damage to abutting property and/or public streets and alleys and surfaced
with erosion-resistant material in accordance with applicable City specifications. Off-street
parking areas shall be maintained in a clean, orderly and dust-free condition at the expense of
the owner or lessee and not used for the sale, repair or dismantling or servicing of any
vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies.
Entrances and exits. Location and design of entrances and exits shall be in accord with the
requirements of applicable regulations and standards and access to and egress to any public
right-of-way shall occur only in locations approved by the City of Manchester.
Lighting. Adequate lighting shall be provided if off-street parking spaces are to be used at
night. The lighting shall be arranged and installed in a manner approved by the Building
Official, and the light source shielded in the manner required by the ordinances of the City of
Manchester.

Family Residential or "C-1" and "C-2" Commercial Districts, there shall be one (1) shade tree
planted for each two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of parking area. Such trees,
at time of planting, shall have a trunk diameter not less than three (3) inches. Only hard
maple, ash, oak and sweet gum trees shall qualify as trees acceptable for compliance under
this Section.

Interpretation Of Specific Requirements.
The loading space requirements in this Article do not limit special requirements which may be
imposed in connection with uses permitted by approval of a special use permit.
Under the provisions of Article XVI, the Planning and Zoning Commission may reduce the
loading space requirements whenever the character of the use is such as to make
unnecessary the full provision of loading facilities or where provision is made for community
loading facilities or where provision of loading space requirements is impractical under certain
conditions for uses which contain less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of floor area.
Design Standards.
Minimum size. For the purpose of these regulations, a loading space is a space within the
main building or on the same lot, providing for the standing, loading or unloading of trucks,
having a minimum area of five hundred forty (540) square feet, minimum width of twelve (12)
feet, a minimum depth of thirty-five (35) feet, and a vertical clearance of at least fifteen (15)
feet.
Drainage and maintenance. Off-street loading facilities shall be drained to eliminate standing
water and prevent damage to abutting property and/or public streets and alleys and surfaced
with erosion-resistant material in accordance with applicable City specifications. Off-street
loading areas shall be maintained in a clean, orderly and dust-free condition at the expense of
the owner or lessee and not used for the sale, repair, dismantling, or servicing of any vehicles,
equipment, materials or supplies.

Article IX. Supplementary Regulations — Communications
Antennas And Support Structures
Section 405.420. Purposes.
[Ord. No. 17-2188 § 1, 6-5-2017[1]]
The general purpose of this Article is to regulate the placement, construction and modification of
telecommunications towers, support structures and antennas in order to protect the health, safety
and welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the
development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in and around the City
of Manchester. Specifically, to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, this Article is intended
to:
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and
systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of Manchester;
Minimize adverse visual impacts of communications antennas and support structures through
careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
Maximize the use of existing and new support structures so as to minimize the need to
construct new or additional facilities;
Maximize the co-location of facilities on any new support structures;

Section 405.550. Application Procedure.
[Ord. No. 99-1145 Art. 6 §5(5.3), 9-20-1999]
Applications for special use permits for new uses, construction, extensions or alterations, or for
extensions or alterations of existing uses and uses previously authorized shall be made to the
Board of Aldermen on forms provided by the City together with copies of a plot or development
plan and necessary descriptive material sufficient to define clearly the intensity and extent of the
intended use. The Board of Aldermen, or its designee, shall forthwith refer the application to the
City's Planning and Zoning Commission to investigate and report as to the matters set forth in
Section 405.540 hereof and as to the effect of such building, buildings, structures or uses upon
traffic hazards or congestion, the character of the neighborhood, the general welfare of the
community, the public utility facilities and fire hazards. Such fee as shall from time to time be
established by the Board of Aldermen shall be paid at the time of the filing of the application to the
City Administrator of the City of Manchester and in the event that the Board of Aldermen does not
establish such a fee by City ordinance, the fee shall be three hundred dollars ($300.00). Under no
condition shall said sum or any part thereof be refunded for failure of the Board of Aldermen to
grant said special use permit. The City's Planning and Zoning Commission shall file its report with
the Board of Aldermen within ninety (90) days from the date of the first meeting in which such
matter is upon its agenda, the Board of Aldermen upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the
Board after making a determination that there is no just cause for the Commission's delay, may
remove the matter from the Commission's jurisdiction with no report. Nothing herein, however,
shall prevent an applicant and the Commission from agreeing to have an application postponed to
a Commission agenda beyond the above-referenced ninety-day period. Where deemed
necessary, the Commission may require a traffic analysis and/or projected sales figures to assist
in evaluating the application. The Building Official may issue building permits without prior
approval of the Commission for items of a minor nature such as garages, carports, breezeways,
room additions and other accessory buildings not exceeding five hundred (500) square feet in total
area, swimming pools or other minor construction in residential districts. Any application for
commercial construction, extension or alteration of existing uses and uses previously authorized
by this Section, except for minor interior renovations, however, shall be referred to the
Commission to investigate and report as to the effect of said building or use upon traffic and fire
hazards, the character of the neighborhood and the general welfare of the community.
[Ord. No. 18-2247, 1-21-2019]
In case of an adverse report by the Commission, the Commission shall forward to the Board of
Aldermen its separate written report stating the reasons for such adverse report and the reasons
for its recommended denial of the application for special use permit.

owners within one hundred eighty-five (185) feet distant from the parcel being considered for the
special use permit. The applicant for the special use permit shall supply to the City the names and
addresses of all persons to receive notice pursuant to the provisions hereof. Failure of any
property owner to receive notice hereunder shall not affect the proceedings hereunder unless the
Board of Aldermen shall determine that the failure to receive notice was caused by willful actions.
After such hearing, the Board of Aldermen shall determine whether such exception:
Will substantially increase traffic hazards or congestions.

uses in surrounding area.
Otherwise complies in all respects with the terms and provisions of this Chapter and of the
Code of Ordinances of the City of Manchester.

Subsections (1) through (5) above, and be affirmative as to all subjects referred to in
Subsections (6) through (9) above, and all applicable matters in Section 405.540 above
have been adequately provided for, then the application shall be granted. If the findings
of the Board of Aldermen be affirmative as to any of the subjects referred to in
Subsections (1) through (5) above, or be negative as to any of the subjects referred to in
Subsections (6) through (9) above, or if any of the applicable matters set forth in Section
405.540 are not adequately provided for, then the application shall be denied.
Any applicant who shall accept and begin its use pursuant to a special use permit granted
pursuant to this Chapter shall be deemed to have accepted all of the conditions made a part
thereof, and in the event that said applicant shall then or in the future fail to comply with any of the
conditions made a part of the special use permit, the Board of Aldermen, after hearing and upon
notice having been given, may revoke such special use permit.
Any special use permit granted hereunder shall be deemed to have been abandoned one (1) year
after the date of the adoption of the ordinance granting same unless the holder of such special use
permit has received from the City of Manchester a business license or its equivalent within such

Section 405.570. Conditions.
[Ord. No. 99-1145 Art. 6 §5(5.5), 9-20-1999]
In approving special use permits, the Board of Aldermen shall have the authority to impose such
conditions as it determines necessary to satisfy the criteria established in this Article. All conditions
relating to or limiting the use, status or operation of the development after issuance of a business
license shall be posted in a conspicuous public place on the premises prior to the issuance of the
business license. So long as a substantial part of the development remains in single ownership or
ownership of any part of the property is retained or held by the developer or by its trustees with duties
imposed under the special use permit, or by conditions imposed under authority hereof, such person or
persons shall maintain such list of conditions in a conspicuous public place; and failure to do so shall
constitute a violation of this Section and be cause for the revocation of the special use permit.

permit, the applicant (and the owner of the property, if other than the applicant) shall be notified of
the denial and neither the Planning and Zoning Commission nor the Board of Aldermen shall
consider any other application for a special use permit concerning the same property, or any part
thereof, unless:
Twelve (12) months have elapsed since the date of the denial; or
Five (5) members of the Board of Aldermen vote to reconsider the denied application,
provided such reconsideration hereunder shall be only available one (1) time to any applicant
or owner of the property, if other than the applicant.

satisfy the requirements of said Section 405.540 of Article X, as determined by the Planning and
Zoning Commission of the City, in its sole judgment, such use shall lose its non-conforming use status
at such time as it no longer satisfies the requirements of Section 405.160 of Article IV of these Zoning
Regulations relating to non-conforming uses.

Chapter 410. Floodplain Management
Article I. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, and
Purposes
Section 410.010. Statutory Authorization.
[Ord. No. 99-1145 Art. 8, 9-20-1999; Ord. No. 00-1177 §1, 3-6-2000; Ord. No. 14-2091 §1, 11-3-2014]
The Legislature of the State of Missouri has, in RSMo. Section 79.110, delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health,
safety and general welfare. Therefore, the Board of Aldermen of the City of Manchester, Missouri,
ordains as follows.
Section 410.020. Findings of Fact.
[Ord. No. 99-1145 Art. 8, 9-20-1999; Ord. No. 00-1177 §1, 3-6-2000; Ord. No. 14-2091 §1, 11-3-2014]
Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of
Manchester, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood
heights and velocities; and
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a
series of interrelated steps:
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on
the particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could
be expected to have a one-percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on

Located within areas of special flood hazard established herein are areas designated as
floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters
that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the
area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any
point.
The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
If the provisions hereof are satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions hereof.
In unnumbered A Zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or other sources as
set forth herein.

Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in Subsection
(B) through (F) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half
(1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or a local inventory
of historic places upon a determination that the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's
continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing, over the signature of a community official, that (1)
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for onehundred
dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood
level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all
variance actions as required by this Chapter.
Section 410.250. Conditions for Approving Variances for
Accessory Structures.
[Ord. No. 99-1145 Art. 8, 9-20-1999; Ord. No. 00-1177 §1, 3-6-2000; Ord. No. 14-2091 §1, 11-3-2014]
Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case-bycase
analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following
conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth herein.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and
safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures
that are constructed at grade and wet-floodproofed:
Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in
Zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building
components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes,
flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation must be built with flood-resistant materials in
accordance with this Chapter.

The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure in accordance with this Chapter. All of the building's
structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces, including
hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood
elevation or floodproofed so that it is contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure
that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with this Chapter.
The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening
requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls subject to the 100-year
flood contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in
accordance with this Chapter.
The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway
encroachment provisions of this Chapter. No variances may be issued for accessory
structures within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels would result during
the 100-year flood.
Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.
No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be
paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing, over the signature of a community official,
that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one-hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (2) such construction
below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this Chapter.
Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community
and registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain
development permit for construction.

and amending this Chapter, and such City Plan shall be incorporated into this Chapter and be a
part of this Chapter in graphic form. All proposed subdivisions shall be reviewed against the
standards and requirements of the City Plan.
All streets, parks, open space or other features or standards of the City Plan applicable to a tract
or parcel of land proposed to be subdivided shall be included in the plat of such subdivision
substantially as shown on the City Plan. Refinements and modifications of the features required by
the City Plan may be approved by the Commission when this will improve the design of the
subdivision and further the purposes of the City Plan.
The approved City Plan with all amendments thereto shall be signed by the Mayor and City Clerk
and filed with the City Clerk.
Section 415.050. Minimum Standards of Design and
Development.
[Ord. No. 69 §V, 7-5-1960]
No subdivision plat shall be approved by either the Commission or by the Board unless it
conforms to the following minimum standards and requirements.
Potential dwellings displaced by private parks or open space.
When private parks or open space are included in the plat, the subdivider may provide for
that number of dwelling units that he/she would be permitted to build under the Zoning
Regulations if no private parks or open space were included in the subdivision, but such
dwelling units must be located within that portion of the tract or parcel indicated for
residential use by the City Plan.
In order that potential dwellings displaced by private parks or open space can be
accommodated in the subdivision, the yard and lot size established by the Zoning
Regulations for that tract or parcel can be reduced, but no lot shall be created having an
area of less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet or frontage of less than eighty (80)
feet at the building line, or a front yard of less than twenty (20) feet. The Commission
shall permit lots to be reduced only when it finds that the proposed subdivision conforms
substantially to the City Plan, makes good use of topography and natural features,
provides needed open space and contributes variety and interest to the character of its
neighborhood without adversely affecting adjacent property. Requirements such as for
minimum lot area and side or rear yard, replacing those that are permitted to be reduced
under this provision, shall be included in the subdivision plat or restrictions, and
subsequent replacement and extension of buildings shall be controlled by such plat or
restrictions.
Parks and open space on the City Plan.
When private parks or open spaces are indicated on the City Plan within the tract or
parcel to be subdivided, the plat shall set aside such areas for use by owners of the lots.
A site for a school, public building, church, or other public or semi-public use indicated on
the City Plan within the tract or parcel to be subdivided shall be reserved for a period of
one (1) year from the date of recording of the final plat so that it can be acquired by an

appropriate agency. The provisions of Section 415.050(1) shall not apply to such public
or semi-public sites.
Other private parks and open spaces. Private parks and open space in addition to those
proposed in the City Plan may be provided in the plat by the subdivider, subject to the
approval of the Commission as to the extent, location and purpose of such areas. Historic
buildings or sites, parkway strips, ornamental parks, traffic circles, easements along streams
and buffer strips along roads or to separate conflicting uses and land reserved for agriculture
may be included as open space when appropriate.
Streets.
The location, width and typical cross-section of all streets shall substantially conform to
the City Plan and shall be designed to relate to existing and future streets, to
topographical and natural conditions, to public convenience and necessity, to visual
character and to the proposed uses of the land to be served by the streets. The
subdivider may be required to continue adjoining streets through the area being
subdivided, when necessary, to provide for local movements of vehicles or to enable
adjoining property to be properly subdivided.
Streets shall have the following right-of-way, except as increased or decreased by the
City Plan or varied in unusual circumstances by the Commission:
Major streets — Eighty (80) feet minimum
Collector streets — Sixty (60) feet minimum
Residential streets — Fifty (50) feet minimum
Minor streets — Forty (40) feet minimum
Frontage road — Fifty (50) feet minimum
Where a minor street of greater than two hundred fifty (250) feet in length is required to
terminate in a circular open space, said open space shall have a minimum radius of fifty
(50) feet. Except in unusual instances, no cul-de-sac shall exceed five hundred (500) feet
in length.
Intersections with a major street or collector street shall be designed as nearly as
possible at right angles.
All streets shall be dedicated to the appropriate public agency. Reserve strips controlling
access are prohibited except when control is placed in the City under conditions
approved by the Commission. Private streets are discouraged, but where built, they shall
be maintained solely and perpetually by the trustees or Board of Managers.
When a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the
Commission may require frontage roads, double frontage with screen planting contained
in a reservation of land along the rear property line through which no access shall be
permitted, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be
appropriate to separate through and local traffic to develop all major streets according to
limited access principles and to protect residential uses from through traffic. A frontage
road that will serve only one (1) tier of residential lots and will not be used for access to a
school, church or other non-residential building with a right-of-way of thirty (30) feet and a
pavement width of fourteen (14) feet may be approved by the Commission with the
advice of the Building Official.
Easements.
Easements of not less than five (5) feet in width shall be provided on each side of all rear
lot lines and side lines, where necessary, for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary

sewers, gas, water and heat mains. Easements of greater width may be required along
lines or across lots where necessary for the extension of mains, sewers and similar
utilities. When alleys are provided, utilities may be located within the alley.
Whenever any stream or surface watercourse is located in an area that is being
subdivided, the subdivider shall, at his/her own expense, straighten, widen or improve the
channel so that it will properly carry surface water and may provide or be required to
provide an adequate easement along each side of the stream, which easement shall be
for the purpose of widening, improving or protecting the stream and for recreational use.
Straightening, widening or improving the channel shall be unnecessary when the
easement is sufficient to contain the stream in time of flood and to contain stormwater
runoff without eroding or raveling the natural channel.
Blocks.
The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with regard to adequate
building sites suitable to the special needs of the use contemplated and the limitations
and opportunities of topography.
Super-blocks indented by cul-de-sacs and containing interior open space shall be
permitted, when properly designed. A crosswalk of ten (10) feet may be required when
necessary for pedestrian access and circulation.
Blocks adjacent to a major street shall be designed to minimize points of ingress and
egress.
Lots.
All lots shall be designed to provide desirable building sites properly related to
topography, natural features, streets and land use.
Depth and width of lots laid out for other than single-family dwelling purposes shall be
adequate for off-street service, parking and protection of adjacent uses or streets, as
required by the type of use and development contemplated.
(Reserved)
Maintenance of common facilities. Where the subdivision contains paving, sewers, sewage
treatment plants, water supply systems, park areas, a swimming pool, street trees or other
physical facilities necessary or desirable for the welfare of that subdivision which are not or
cannot be satisfactorily maintained by any existing public agency, provision shall be made by
trust agreement made a part of the deed restrictions, or protective covenants acceptable to
any agency having jurisdiction over the location and improvement of such facilities, for the
proper and continuous maintenance and supervision of such facilities. The restrictions shall
empower the trustees to later dedicate such common open space to the City of Manchester
for public use and maintenance, but no such subsequent dedication shall be effective unless
accepted by the Board of Aldermen of the City of Manchester. The final plat and deed
restrictions shall specify that land set aside for common use be retained for such purposes for
a period of at least twenty (20) years. Nothing herein shall require the City to provide
maintenance for any common facilities described herein.
Improvements. Before the final plat of any subdivided area shall be approved by the Board of
Aldermen and recorded, the subdivider shall make and install the improvements described in
this Subsection. In lieu of final completion of the minimum improvements before the plat is
finally approved, the subdivider may post a surety bond or escrow agreement approved by
the Attorney of the City of Manchester, which bond or escrow agreement will insure to the City
that the improvements will be completed by the subdivider within two (2) years after the final
approval of the plat. The amount of the bond or escrow agreement shall not be less than the

estimated cost of the improvements, and the amount of the estimate must be approved by the
City Engineer. Said estimate shall be prepared by the subdivider. If the improvements are not
completed within the specified time, the Board of Aldermen may use the bond or funds in
escrow, or any necessary portion thereof, to complete same.
Should the subdivider desire to provide a surety bond, the bond form shall be approved
by the Attorney of the City of Manchester.
Should the subdivider desire to provide an escrow agreement, it shall:
Be approved by the Attorney as to legal form;
Be executed by the Mayor subject to the approval of the Board of Aldermen;
Guarantee the improvements set forth in the approved final plat by providing for a
deposit with a qualified escrow depositary of that sum of lawful money of the United
States of America which the Board of Aldermen shall reasonably estimate as the
cost of said improvements;
Provide that the escrowed sum shall be held in special escrow account by the
escrow holder, subject to the audit of the City of Manchester; and
The escrowed sum shall be held by the escrow holder, as in the agreement
provided, until such time as the Mayor shall, upon approval by the Board of
Aldermen, by written authorization addressed to the escrow holder, release the
escrow sum. Should it be necessary for the City to complete the improvements as
provided in the approved final plat, the Mayor, upon the approval of the Board of
Aldermen, shall release the escrow sum for disbursement by the escrow holder for
the payment of labor and material used in the construction and installation of the
improvements guaranteed as the work progresses. In no case shall an authorization
be given for the release, nor shall the escrow holder release, more than ninety
percent (90%) of the escrow sum until said improvements and installations have
been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter and approved by
the Board of Aldermen.
The minimum improvements installed in any subdivision before the plat can be finally
approved shall be in accordance with the following Subsections: (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)
(4), (c)(5), (c)(6) and (c)(7).
The subdivider shall grade and improve all new streets and alleys (if any) within the
subdivided area. The paving on such new streets shall be concrete or bituminous
macadam having a minimum thickness of base and surface as required by the City
Engineer and a minimum width of pavement as required by the following table:

When a proposed subdivision adjoins or includes an existing street which is shown
as a major street or collector street on the City Plan, sufficient land shall be
dedicated for such street as required by Section 415.050(4)(b), with the additional
land to be added equally to both sides of the present right-of-way. The subdivider
may be required to widen or improve existing pavement when it is less than twenty
(20) feet in width, in poor condition, in the vicinity of certain intersections as
required above or when the subdivision proposes to create lots with direct access
to an existing major or collector street. Open channels (sodded or paved) may be
built in lieu of curb and gutter, at the discretion of the Commission, with the advice
of the City Engineer. Curbs and gutters shall be of concrete or bituminous
macadam as permitted by the Commission on advice of the City Engineer. The
type of curb or open channel shall be dependent on location, topography and
general layout of the subdivision and adjacent streets or subdivisions.
All lots shall be served by a public water system. The subdivider shall show the
Commission prior to approval of the final plat that mains and hydrants have been
installed or security provided in lieu thereof to the satisfaction of the public utility, and
that hydrants have been located as required by the standards of the West County
Fire Protection District.
The subdivider shall install sanitary sewers and provide a connection for each lot.
Such installations shall be in accordance with the standards and specifications of,
and before the improvement is started the plan therefor shall be approved by, the
Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District, St. Louis County Health Department and the
Commission. If no existing outlet sewers are within reasonable distance, the
subdivider shall make such provisions for the treatment or disposal of the sewerage
as will satisfy the City, State and County health officials and before the plat shall be
approved, the subdivider shall present to the Commission an order from City and
State or County health officials showing that the treatment or disposal facilities will
properly care for and protect the health, safety and welfare of the existing and
probable future population within the subdivision and surrounding area.
Storm sewers shall be installed to standards and specifications approved by the
Commission and Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District. Open channels may be used
in lieu of pipe when the City Plan indicates continuous open space along the natural
drainage channel, and additional open channel may be employed when approved by
the Commission, with the advice of the City Engineer.
Street lights shall be installed along all minor streets, residential streets and collector

101.1 Title: These regulations shall be known as the "Land Disturbance Code" of St. Louis
County, Missouri, hereinafter referred to as "this Code."
101.2 Introduction: On construction or land disturbance sites, soil is highly vulnerable to
erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality
and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Deposits of
eroded soil also necessitate maintenance of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes. In
addition, clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation
necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. Construction activities also utilize materials and
generate wastes, which if not properly controlled can pollute receiving waters.
101.3 Purpose: The purpose of this Code is to safeguard persons, protect property, and
prevent damage to the environment in St. Louis County. This Code will also promote the
public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and
maintenance of any development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results
in the movement of earth on land in St. Louis County.
101.4 Scope: This Code provides for the safety, health and welfare of the public by regulating
and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other
activity that disturbs land surfaces or results in the movement of earth in the unincorporated
part of St. Louis County, Missouri.
101.5 Definitions: For the purpose of this Code, the following terms, phrases, words, and their
derivations shall have the meanings given herein. Where terms are not defined by this
Section, such terms shall have ordinarily accepted meanings such as the context implies.

the penalty amount is paid and the violator has complied with all other regulations
pertaining to the issuance of permits.
b. If the Building Commission determines that no permit was required, the Department
shall immediately cancel the stop work order.

Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic
response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development and redevelopment sites.
The City of Manchester, therefore, establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations
applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the control of stormwater runoff
for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the
regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development and redevelopment projects,
plus other construction activities, in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff
rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion and non-point source pollution associated
with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health, safety and
welfare.
Section 425.030. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 08-1852 §1, 2-19-2008]
The purpose of this Chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and
controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety and welfare of the public residing in
watersheds within the City of Manchester. This Chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the
following objectives:
Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding,
siltation, increases in stream temperature and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity
of stream channels;
Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
developments which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
Make efforts to minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from a
specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic
regime to the extent determined practicable by the City;
Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non-point source pollution,
wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these
management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety;
Improve development design in the following way:
By providing a planned mixture of land uses while maintaining adequate open space,
common facilities, and buffers between uses;
By permitting land use designs that incorporate natural terrain features, to preserve trees
and natural open spaces and encourage the philosophy of design with nature;
By providing a mixture of housing types while maintaining density standards to protect
residents from overdevelopment;
By allowing non-residential uses within the development, thereby discouraging strip
commercial development;
By encouraging pedestrian and non-motorized vehicle paths and ways utilizing natural
terrain features rather than traditional design;

Where feasible, secure a conservation easement from new developments to protect the
natural resources on existing land parcels. Such conservation easements would not
prohibit the installation of sanitary and storm sewers, ponds, wetlands or other best
management practices (BMPs) that may be appropriate in these areas.
Article II. Application
Section 425.040. Application.
[Ord. No. 08-1852 §1, 2-19-2008; Ord. No. 09-1967 §2, 12-21-2009]
This Chapter shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications, unless eligible for an
exemption or granted a waiver by the City's Planning and Zoning Commission as listed below. The
Chapter also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability
criteria, if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following
applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may
take place at different times on different schedules. In addition, all plans must also be reviewed to
ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained during and after development of
the site and that post-construction runoff levels are consistent with regional watershed plans.
Possible exemptions or waivers include:
For development sites two thousand (2,000) square feet or less, the requirements of this
Chapter may not apply.
For development sites from over two thousand (2,000) square feet to under one (1) acre, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may waive these requirements so long as the amount of
impervious cover created is less than forty percent (40%) of the total development site.
For development sites equal to or greater than one (1) acre, the development shall implement
and enforce a program to address the quality of long-term stormwater runoff from new
development and redevelopment projects. This includes projects less than one (1) acre that
are part of a larger common plan of development or sale, that discharge into the permittee's
regulated small MS4. The development shall ensure that controls are in place that have been
designed and implemented to prevent or minimize water quality impacts by reasonably
mimicking pre-construction runoff conditions by effectively utilizing water quality strategies
and technologies to the maximum extent practicable. The developer shall assess site
characteristics at the beginning of the construction design phase to ensure adequate planning
for stormwater program compliance. The purpose for this approach is to arrive at designs and
practices that provide for most effective water quality treatment through infiltration, flow rates
and similar site-design opportunities. In addition to the SWPPP document submittal, a
separate "post-construction runoff control program" shall be submitted. These documents
shall include the following information at a minimum or as otherwise determined by the City's
Planning and Zoning Commission.
A stormwater management strategy for the site must be developed to minimize water
quality impacts, by reasonably mimicking pre-construction runoff conditions in affected
new development and incorporating water quality protection in affected redevelopment
projects to the maximum extent practicable and include a combination of structural and/or
non-structural BMPs appropriate for the site. Development plans that consider the use of
infiltration, evapotranspiration or water re-use such as grassed swales, bioretention cells,
cisterns, green roofs, planter boxes, street retrofits, parking-lot infiltration or other
approved measures are encouraged by the City.

A maintenance plan must be recorded under MSD's requirements to ensure adequate
long-term operation and maintenance of selected BMPs.
The City of Manchester's strategy is to provide requirements and standards to direct
growth to identified areas, protect sensitive areas such as wetlands and riparian areas,
maintain and/or increase open space (including a dedicated funding source for open
space acquisition), provide buffers along sensitive water bodies, minimize impervious
surfaces and minimize disturbance of soils and vegetation will be through the
implementation of the MSD "Site Design Guidance, Tools for Incorporating Post-
Construction Stormwater Quality Protection into Concept Plans and Land Disturbance
Permitting" in addition to implementation of the other elements of this Chapter and Code.
These regulations shall apply to all zoning districts of the City.
All uses, special and permitted, in the various zoning districts of the City shall comply with the
procedures and standards of each respective District and of this Chapter. In the event of any
conflict between the respective zoning district regulations and the regulations of this Chapter, the
regulations, standards and procedures of this Chapter shall control.
Article III. Regulations
Section 425.050. Regulations — Generally.
[Ord. No. 08-1852 §1, 2-19-2008]
When a site development plan is submitted to the City that is considered a redevelopment project,
decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be governed by special
stormwater sizing criteria found in the then current Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District (MSD)
Storm Water Design Manual. These criteria are dependent on the amount of impervious area
created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all
redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the City's Planning and Zoning
Commission. The City Engineer is to certify that the MSD sizing criteria is met prior to the
submittal of development plans to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to control the peak and overflow
rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation
of stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and
to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots and landscaped
areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity.
All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not discharge untreated stormwater
directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local water body without adequate treatment. Where such
discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be
assessed using a method acceptable to the City and MSD. In no case shall the impact on
functional values be any more than allowed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USCOE) or the
Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR).
Annual ground water recharge rates shall be maintained by promoting infiltration through the use
of structural and non-structural methods. At a minimum, annual recharge from the postdevelopment
site shall mimic the annual recharge from pre-development site conditions, where
such ground water conditions are prevalent. Such rates, where applicable, shall be determined
prior to the submission of plans to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
For a new development, structural stormwater treatment practices shall be designed to remove
eighty percent (80%) of the average annual post-development total suspended solids load (TSS).
It is presumed that a BMP complies with this performance standard if it is:

Stormwater is generated from highly contaminated source areas known as "hotspots".
The following land uses and activities have been deemed by MDNR and other agencies
as being stormwater hotspots:
Vehicle salvage yards and recycling facilities*
Vehicle service and maintenance facilities
Vehicle and equipment cleaning facilities*
Fleet storage areas (bus, truck, etc.)*
Industrial sites (reference SIC codes outlined in Appendix D.6. of the EPA
stormwater program)
Marinas (service and maintenance)*
Outdoor liquid container storage
Outdoor loading/unloading facilities
Public works storage areas
Facilities that generate or store hazardous materials*
Commercial container nursery
Other land uses and activities as designated by MDNR (refer to MDNR website at
http://www.dnr.mo.gov/env/wpp/permits/wpcpermits- stormwter.htm)
*Stormwater pollution prevention plan implementation is required for these
land uses or activities under the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) stormwater program (see Appendix D.6).
As determined by the MDNR, a separate permit from the State of Missouri may be required.
Water quality pretreatment involves the removal of pollutants from urban runoff through the
following types of mechanisms: sedimentation, flotation, filtration, infiltration, adsorption,
biological uptake, biological conversion, degradation or other scientifically proven method.
While large highways (average daily traffic volume (ADT) greater than thirty thousand
(30,000) vehicles) and retail gasoline outlet facilities are generally not designated as
stormwater hotspots, it is important to ensure that highway and retail gasoline outlet
stormwater management plans adequately protect ground water.
Section 425.120. Treatment/Geometry Conditions.
[Ord. No. 08-1852 §1, 2-19-2008]
All stormwater management practices shall be designed to capture and treat stormwater runoff
according to the specifications outlined in the Stormwater Design Manual. These specifications
designate the water quantity and quality treatment criteria that apply to an approved stormwater
management practice.

[Ord. No. 08-1852 §1, 2-19-2008]
All stormwater management practices shall have a landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be
in the development or redevelopment and how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. All
BMP plans requiring extensive vegetation shall be properly designed by a qualified professional such
as a horticulturist, arborist, engineer, landscape architect or soil conservation district.
Section 425.140. Maintenance Agreements.
[Ord. No. 08-1852 §1, 2-19-2008]
All stormwater treatment practices shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to
ensure the system functions as designed. This agreement shall include any and all maintenance
easements required to access and inspect the stormwater treatment practices, and to perform routine
maintenance, as necessary, to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater treatment facility. In
addition, a covenant specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater
treatment facilities shall be recorded with the St. Louis County Recorder of Deeds prior to issuance of
any permits for land disturbance activities.
Section 425.150. Non-Structural Stormwater Practices.
[Ord. No. 08-1852 §1, 2-19-2008]
The use of non-structural stormwater treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the
reliance on structural facilities. Credit in the form of reductions in the amount of stormwater that
must be managed can be earned through the use of non-structural practices that reduce the
generation of stormwater from the site. These non-structural practices are explained in detail in
the current design manual and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of non-structural
practices must ensure that these practices are documented and remain unaltered by subsequent
property owners.
All sites must be properly stabilized before permanent stormwater BMPs are considered complete.

shall make and maintain records of the installation (as-built drawings) and of all maintenance
and repairs and shall retain the records for a period of not less than five (5) years. Such
records shall be made available to the City during inspection of the facilities and at other
reasonable times, upon request. Copies of the as-built drawings shall be submitted to the
City, as well as any drawings that show substantial repair or modifications to the facilities.
The developer or redeveloper shall establish a landscaping plan which provides for the
maintenance of vegetation at the site after construction is completed, including who will be
responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed
to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved.
All developers and redevelopers must prepare and implement an erosion and sediment
control plan for all construction activities related to implementing any on-site stormwater
management practices.
Article V. Stream Buffer Protection Standards
Section 425.170. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 08-1852 §1, 2-19-2008]
The primary purpose of the stream buffer protection standards is to maintain land adjacent to streams
in a vegetated state in order to enhance and maintain water quality, protect stream channel wetlands,
minimize stormwater runoff, reduce sedimentation and erosion, conserve plant and wildlife habitat, and
protect wildlife movement corridors.

These stream buffer protection standards shall apply to intermittent streams, perennial streams
and ponds and lakes. Stream buffers shall be clearly indicated on all development plans, site
plans, preliminary plats and final plats.
Where maps show a difference in stream type for a particular reach of stream, the City approved
map that shows the greater level of stream protection shall apply as determined applicable.
Section 425.190. Stream Buffer Size.
[Ord. No. 08-1852 §1, 2-19-2008]
Stream buffers shall be required on each side of the stream and shall begin at the most landward limit
of the top of the bank, perpendicular to the direction of stream flow. Stream buffers for both intermittent
and perennial streams shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet in width, unless otherwise provided by the
City's Planning and Zoning Commission.
Section 425.200. Stream Buffer Use Limitations.
[Ord. No. 08-1852 §1, 2-19-2008]
Land within the stream buffer shall not be included in calculations of minimum lot size
requirements.
Buildings and other features that require grading and construction shall be set back at least ten
(10) feet from the edge of the stream buffer.
To avoid a loss of effectiveness in protecting streams, the stream buffer shall remain in a natural,
undisturbed state, except as provided by this Section or as allowed pursuant to a waiver granted
by the City's Planning and Zoning Commission during the site plan approval process.
In cases where natural stream buffer vegetation is determined undesirable and a nuisance, the
buffer may be landscaped and revegetated in a manner approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
All construction shall be designed and constructed to minimize the amount of intrusion into the
stream buffer and to minimize clearing, grading, erosion and water quality degradation.
Crossing of stream buffer by streets, driveways, recreational features, utilities, bridges or other
facilities shall be permitted provided such crossing is designed to minimize the amount of intrusion
into the stream buffer. Such construction may run generally within and parallel to the stream buffer
only where no alternative location is practical and when such minimizes the amount of intrusion
into the stream buffer.
Stormwater control structures and temporary erosion control structures shall be considered utilities
for the purposes of this Section and shall be permitted in a stream buffer, provided:
The property owner or applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City Engineer or
his/her designee that such facilities cannot be practicably located outside of the stream buffer
and that any proposed stormwater control structure is sited and designed to minimize
disturbance of the stream and stream buffer. Siting stormwater control structures away from
the stream channel shall be considered preferable to siting such structures in the stream
channel;
Alternate methods of stormwater and erosion control shall be considered prior to approval of
such structures in the stream buffers; and

A vegetated buffer of a width determined by the City Engineer or his/her designee may be
required around any stormwater control structures located within a stream buffer.
For development on lots of record created prior to January 1, 1997, septic system drain field repair
areas may be allowed in a stream buffer, provided:
The intrusion into the stream buffer is the minimum necessary;
The intrusion shall not result in an undisturbed stream buffer of less than thirty (30) feet; and
The property owner or applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the St. Louis County
Health Department that the repair area cannot be located outside of the stream buffer.
Sanitary sewer lines on an alignment generally parallel to the stream may be allowed in a stream
buffer, provided that:

[Ord. No. 08-1852 §1, 2-19-2008]
Perennial streams may be piped, thereby exempting the piped section of the stream from stream
buffer requirements, only when allowed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and not be in
conflict with the USCOE 404 permit conditions. A USCOE 404 permit may be required when:
The site plan proposing perennial stream piping includes features on the site, such as Best
Management Practices, that provide water quality benefits at least equal to those of the
stream buffer; and
The proposed perennial stream piping is not substantially in conflict with the other objectives
of this Chapter.
Intermittent streams may be piped where there is no conflict with the USCOE 404 permit
conditions, thereby exempting the piped section of the stream from stream buffer requirements,
only when the Planning and Zoning Commission or, for projects that do not require a site plan by
any other provision of this Chapter, the City Engineer or his/her designee determines that:

The City of Manchester hereby adopts the Property Maintenance Code as its Minimum Housing
Code which was adopted with certain amendments by St. Louis County, Missouri, Ordinance No.
24,440 on July 14, 2010.
The Property Maintenance Code is hereby amended as follows:
Add 107.6: If the owner, occupant, mortgagee, or lessee fails to comply with the order within thirty
(30) days, the Building Commissioner shall cause such building or structure to be repaired,
vacated or demolished and the property cleaned up as the facts may warrant; and the Building
Commissioner shall certify the cost of the work borne by the City of Manchester for such repair,
vacation or demolition or cleaned up to the City Clerk as a special assessment represented by a
special tax bill against the real property affected; said tax bill shall be a lien upon such property
and shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owner(s) unless the building or
structure is demolished, secured or repaired by a contractor pursuant to an order issued by the
City of Manchester and such contractor files a mechanic's lien against the property where
violation(s) occur. The contractor may enforce this lien as provided in Sections 429.010 to 429.360
RSMo. Except as provided in Section 107.7 of this Section, at the request of the taxpayer this
special tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not more than ten (10) years; said
assessment shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum until paid.
Add 107.7: As to damage or loss to a building or other structure by or arising out of any fire,
explosion or other casualty loss, if an order is issued by the Code Official as provided in Section
107.6, and a special tax bill or assessment is issued against the property, it shall be deemed a
personal debt against the property. If there are proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a
covered claim, payment made for damage or loss to a building or other structure caused by or
arising out of any fire, explosion or other casualty loss, the following procedure is establisher for
the payment of up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the insurance proceeds, as set forth in
Subdivisions (a) and (b) of the Section. This Subsection shall apply only to a covered claim
payment that is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the face value of the policy covering a building
or other structure:
The insurer shall withhold from the covered claim, payment up to twenty-five percent (25%) of
the covered claim payment, and shall pay such monies to the City of Manchester to deposit
into an interest-bearing account. Any named mortgagee on the insurance policy shall
maintain priority over any obligation under this Chapter.
The City of Manchester shall release the proceeds and any interest that has accrued on such
proceeds received under Subdivision (a) of this Subsection to the insured or as the terms of
the policy and endorsements thereto provide within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such
insurance monies, unless the City of Manchester has instituted legal proceedings of 107.6 of
this Section. If the City of Manchester has proceeded under the provisions of 107.6 of this
Section, all monies in excess of that necessary to comply with the provisions of 107.6 of this
Section for removal, securing, repair and clean up of the building or structure and the lot on
which it is located, less salvage value, shall be paid to the insured.
Add 107.8: If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in 107.7 of this
Section, at the request of the taxpayer, the tax bill may be paid in installments over a
period of not more than ten (10) years. The tax bill from the date of its issuance shall be
a lien on the property and a personal debt against the owner(s) until paid.
Add 107.9: Section 107.7 of this Section shall apply to fire, explosion or other casualty
loss claims arising on all buildings and structures.
Add 107.10: Section 107.7 of this Section does not make the City of Manchester a party
to any insurance contract, and the insurer is not liable to any party for any amount in
excess of the proceeds otherwise payable under its insurance policy.
Add 107.11: The Building Commissioner may certify in lieu of payment of all or part of
the covered claim under Section 107.7 that it has obtained satisfactory proof that the
insured has removed or will remove the debris and repair, rebuild or otherwise make the
premises safe and secure. In this event, the Building Commissioner shall issue a

insurance company with the written certificate provided from this Section.
Any person violating any of the provisions of the code adopted in this Section shall be deemed
guilty of an ordinance violation and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in an amount not
exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or be imprisoned in the City or County Jail for a

[CC 1979 §23-21; Ord. No. 01-1247 §4, 3-19-2001]
In the making of excavations in any public way or place, the excavated materials from the
trenches must be placed where they will cause the least possible inconvenience to the public. The
width of excavation must be no greater than is necessary for doing the work, and shoring and
bracing must be used as necessary to keep the sides of the trench vertical and to prevent caving.
Adequate provision for proper drainage of the areas surrounding the work must be maintained at
all times.
All excavations must be completed in a timely manner and maintain traffic flows at all times in
accordance with the conditions of the excavation permit. Where an excavation is made entirely
across a public highway, and adequate detour for traffic is not available, substantial driveway must
be maintained across such excavation until such excavation is refilled. Detours may not be
established except on special permit from the City Engineer, and then only after notice to the Chief
of Police of the City and the Fire Protection District. Any public ways or place disturbed, interfered
with or injured in making any excavation must be restored, replaced and repaired to as good
condition as existed before such excavation was made.
Every person who makes or causes to be made any excavation in or adjoining any public way or
place shall provide, erect and maintain at all times along the lines of work all such barricades,
signs, lights and warning signals as may be necessary to protect the public from the hazards
arising from the operation.
In addition to the foregoing, all excavations shall satisfy the following permit conditions:
Proper work signage shall be placed appropriately.
All disturbed areas must be restored to their original condition and in conformance with
Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District and St. Louis County specifications.
The applicant shall provide and maintain traffic control measures at all times. All barricades
must have lights and be in working condition. Applicant shall follow applicable articles of the
"St. Louis County Standard Specifications for Highway Construction". Failure to provide
proper traffic control, protect the streets from possible damage, protect City property, and
provide proper safety measures in the interest of public safety shall result in the City taking
whatever action is necessary to restore disrupted areas and the immediate revocation of this
excavation permit, as well as undertake legal action to recover expended public funds above
the submitted deposit amount.
Applicant must maintain street traffic flow at all times.
Any and all other work necessary to provide a complete and satisfactory job must be
undertaken by applicant.
The work must be completed in the established time frame.
No requirements of this permit shall prevent a public utility company from making emergency
repairs which benefit the health, welfare and the general well-being of the City's residents.
All excavation and restoration work in the public rights-of-way shall conform to the applicable
Standard Construction Specifications For Sewers And Drainage Facilities of the Metropolitan St.
Louis Sewer District (MSD), the St. Louis County Standard Specifications For Highway
Construction and those additional requirements of the City of Manchester.

were removed, and such replacement shall be accomplished in compliance with the requirements
of the City Engineer or his/her authorized representative.
In addition to any other fee required herein, an inspection fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per
hour, while backfilling and repaving is in process, shall be paid to the City by any contractor or

Department of Public Works, a final estimate of the actual quantities of the work done will be
prepared by the City Engineer. The rates to be charged in preparing the cost estimates shall be at
the prevailing rate, as reasonably determined by the City Engineer in his/her sole discretion. If the
final estimate is less than the deposit amount made at the time of the permit application, a refund
will be made; if such final estimate is greater, a charge will be made for the balance. No
subsequent excavation permit will be issued until such balance has been paid in full.

damages received or sustained by any person, persons or property on account of the excavation
work or on account of or in consequence of any neglect in safeguarding the work. Such insurance
must be carried with a firm or corporation which has been licensed to carry on such business in
the State of Missouri and must be kept continuously in force as long as the excavation work is in
process. A copy of the certificate of insurance policy must be filed with the City, with proof that the
policy is in full force and effect, and that said insurance will not be altered, amended, terminated or
ended without prior notice having been given to the City.
In lieu of such insurance, the applicant may deposit a surety bond in the sum of one million dollars
($1,000,000.00), conditioned that it will pay any judgment recovered by any person or persons
injured, or any property damage incurred, on account of the excavation work or on account of or in

Section 525.040. Assessment.
[Ord. No. 14-2074 §1, 6-16-2014]
When law enforcement personnel discover property where methamphetamine has been produced,
or where the equipment and chemicals to produce methamphetamine are present in sufficient
quantities to warrant enforcement action, they will take samples using a methamphetamine field
test kit. The field test used shall be of the type approved by law enforcement officials, industry
experts and the courts and shall measure the presence of methamphetamine residue on surfaces
at a level that is at least as high as the levels established in Section 525.060 below. This
assessment shall be performed by personnel who the Code Official has determined are
appropriately trained, and the assessment shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
Assessment of the number and type of structures present on the property where
methamphetamine may have been produced.
Identification of structural features that may indicate separate functional spaces, such as
attics, false ceilings and crawl spaces, basements, closets and cabinets.
Identification of the manufacturing methods based on observations, reports from law
enforcement personnel and knowledge of manufacturing methods.
Identification of possible areas of contamination based on visual observation, reports from law
enforcement personnel, proximity to chemical storage areas, waste disposal areas or cooking
areas, signs of contamination such as staining, etching, fire damage, outdoor areas of dead
vegetation, or based on the professional judgment of the person collecting the samples.
Identification of adjacent units and common areas to determine the likelihood that
contamination has spread or may have been tracked.
Identification of common ventilation systems with adjacent units or common areas.
The taking of photographs of the property and, if determined appropriate, adjoining properties.
On the basis of the analysis of these areas and the judgment of the person collecting the data, a
sampling plan will be formulated to determine the areas with the greatest probability of containing
the highest possible concentrations of contaminants. Samples will be taken with techniques that
are appropriate for the surface being sampled, using media and testing kits designed to detect the
presence of methamphetamine, the results of which are determined at the time the samples are
collected.
If the field test reveals the presence of methamphetamine at levels in excess of the levels
established herein, the structure shall be considered unsafe for human habitation, and it will be
posted as an unsafe structure by the Code Official. A structure or unit that is posted as unsafe
shall not be occupied until the Code Official orders that designation removed.

as provided in Section 525.060 fails to voluntarily mitigate the violation, the Code Official may
serve a notice of violation and proceed in accordance with Section 114 of the International
Residential Code or may declare the structure as unsafe and proceed in accordance with Sections
112 and 116 of the International Building Code. The Code Official may request AmerenUE to
disconnect electrical service until the decontamination is complete.
Section 525.080. Post-Decontamination Sampling.

When the owner arranges for decontamination, following the completion of the work, the owner will
notify the City that work is complete and schedule a time for post-remediation testing. The structure
must be tested in the presence of a trained law enforcement officer of the City. The owner must
provide test results as evidence that the property is compliant with this Chapter. Should the results of
the post-remediation sampling show the presence of methamphetamine in excess of the standards
established by this Chapter, further steps shall be taken to decontaminate the structure and additional
testing shall be done in the presence of a trained law enforcement officer of the City. Each time an
inspector for the City is present, the owner shall pay an inspection fee of forty dollars ($40.00). The
post-remediation sampling and testing must be performed by a company the Code Official has
determined to be qualified and shall be performed in accordance with the appropriate sections of the
United States Environmental Protection Agency Voluntary Guidelines for Methamphetamine
Laboratory Cleanup, August, 2009, as may be updated from time to time. Photographs of the property
and, if determined appropriate, adjoining properties shall be taken during the post-contamination
testing.
Section 525.090. Final Action.
[Ord. No. 14-2074 §1, 6-16-2014]
After the property has been decontaminated and the Code Official is in possession of evidence that the
pertinent chemical levels are below the levels established by this Chapter, the structure will be
considered safe and suitable for human habitation. If electric service has been disconnected, the Code
Official will notify AmerenUE that the unsafe condition has been mitigated and service can be restored.
The property owner shall be responsible for all reconnection fees.

entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented uses
on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the City of Manchester
Board of Aldermen, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime
Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50(1976),
FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991), City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), and on studies in other communities,
including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota;
Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles,
California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;
Cleveland, Ohio; Beaumont, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; Bellevue, Washington;
New York, New York; and St. Croix County, Wisconsin; and also on findings from the Report of the
Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6,
1989, State of Minnesota), and more recently the Survey of Texas Appraisers — Secondary
Effects of Sexually-Oriented Businesses on Market Values & Secondary Effects of "Off-Site"
Sexually-Oriented Businesses (June 2008, Texas City Attorney's Association), the Board of
Aldermen finds:
Research and studies of municipalities throughout this country indicate that the presence of
sexually oriented businesses is consistently and strongly associated with perceived
decreases in value of both residential and commercial properties and the facilitation of illicit
and undesirable activities.
Research and studies of municipalities also show that sexually oriented businesses can
adversely affect the character and quality of life of a town and can be incompatible with
surrounding uses, particularly when the sexually oriented businesses are concentrated within
a limited geographic area or are located in proximity to residences, day care centers, schools,
houses of worship, public parks or recreational areas, or another sexually oriented business.
Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities
that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is
presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the
activities that occur on their premises.
Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in this Chapter as adult theaters
and adult cabarets, engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than
employees of other establishments.
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented
businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for
viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy
conditions.
Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented
businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented
businesses.
At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually
oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human
immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B
amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported
cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) caused by the human

immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: Six hundred (600) in 1982; two hundred
fifty-three thousand four hundred forty-eight (253,448) in 1992; and one million two hundred
eighty-one thousand seven hundred eighty-seven (1,281,787) in 2017.
As of 2016, there are twelve thousand one hundred four (12,104) persons reportedly living
with AIDS in the State of Missouri.
Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons
testing positive for the HIV antibody test with one million eight thousand nine hundred twentynine
(1,008,929) diagnoses reported in the United States in 2016.
The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high
level, with nearly one-half million (500,000) cases being reported in 2016.
In Missouri, reported cases of acute viral hepatitis C, acute viral hepatitis B, Hepatitis A,
primary and secondary syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea have all increased over the
previous year.
In his report of October 22, 1986, the Surgeon General of the United States has advised the
American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact,
intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an
infected mother to her newborn.
According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and
gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the
activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of
the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate
those activities and maintain those facilities.
Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually
oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films.
Research and studies show that crime increases in the vicinity of sexually oriented
businesses and that a store that sells sexually explicit media and miscellaneous adult
merchandise exclusively for off-site use attracts the same soft target patrons, causing thereby
the same crime-related secondary effects found for on-site sexually oriented businesses.
The findings noted in Subsections (B)(1) through (18) raise substantial governmental concerns.
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably
regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that
reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses.
Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate to require reasonable
assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths
advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity
occurring in adult theaters.
Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current
employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal

behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing
minors from working in such establishments.
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day
operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is
substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid
in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount
of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this Chapter is
designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct.
The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime
leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of
this Chapter.
The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as
a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted
diseases.
The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the City of Manchester will be
promoted by the enactment of this Chapter.

Section 620.010. St. Louis County Amusement Code Adopted By
Reference.
[CC 1980 §5-1; Ord. No. 81-004 §2, 6-1-1981]
The Amusement Code, as amended, adopted by St. Louis County on May 16, 1980, as may be from
time to time amended, is hereby adopted as the Amusement Code of the City of Manchester, the same
as if fully set out herein.
Chapter 625. Cable Communications
Section 625.010. General Provisions.
[CC 1979 §7½-1; Ord. No. 95-826 §1, 10-2-1995]
Title. This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Cable Communications Regulatory
Code."
Purpose. The City finds that further development of cable systems has the potential to be of great
benefit to the City and its residents and businesses. Cable technology is rapidly changing, and
cable plays an essential role as part of the City's basic infrastructure. Cable systems extensively
make use of scarce and valuable public rights-of-way, in a manner different from the way in which
the general public uses them, and in a manner reserved primarily for those who provide services
to the public, such as utility companies. A cable company currently typically faces very limited
competition; thus, the grant of a franchise has the effect of giving the holder extensive economic
benefits and places the holder in a position of public trust. Because of these facts, the City finds
that public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory
powers vested in the City or such persons as the City so designates to protect the public and to
ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest. In light of the foregoing, the
following goals, among others, underlie the provisions set forth in this Chapter:
Cable service should be available to as many City residents and businesses as possible and
provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the public.
A cable system should be capable of accommodating both present and reasonably
foreseeable future cable-related needs of the community.
A cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so that
changes in technology may be integrated to the maximum extent possible into existing

system facilities, taking into account all relevant factors including costs.
A cable system should grow and develop and be responsive to the needs and interests of the
community.
The City intends that all provisions set forth in this Chapter be construed to serve the
public interest and the foregoing public purposes, and that any franchise issued
pursuant to this Chapter be construed to include the foregoing findings and public
purposes as integral parts thereof.
Existing Franchise And Agreements. To the extent permitted by law, this Chapter shall apply to
franchises and other agreements in effect at the time of adoption of this Chapter.

by any person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already have more than a
fifty percent (50%) ownership interest, alone or collectively.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, "franchise transfer" does not include:
Disposition or replacement of worn out or obsolete equipment, property or facilities in the
normal course of operating a cable system, including the renewal or extension of
equipment or property leases and contracts; or
Acquisition, transfer, sale or other disposition of leases, licenses, easements, and other
interests in real property in the normal course of operating a cable system and not
involving the relinquishment of any right or power affecting the franchisee's ability to
provide services in whole or in part;
Pledge or mortgage of a franchisee's assets to a financial institution in return for sums
necessary to construct or operate (or both) the cable system, provided that such pledge
or mortgage and related agreements obligate and limit such financial institution as
follows: any foreclosure or exercise of lien over the franchise or facilities shall only be by
assumption of control over the entire cable system; prior to assumption of control, the
institution shall notify the City that it or a designee acceptable to the City will take control
of and operate the system, and shall submit a plan for such operation insuring continued
service and compliance with this Chapter and all franchise obligations during the term the
institution exercises such control; and the institution shall not exercise control for longer
than one (1) year unless extended by the City for good cause and shall prior to the
expiration of such period (as extended) obtain the City's approval of a franchise transfer
for the remaining term of the franchise or award of a new franchise to another qualified
person pursuant to this Chapter; or
Assignment of the franchise to another entity wholly owned by the franchisee or the
owners of the franchisee, provided an owner of the franchisee has guaranteed its
obligations under the franchise agreement and the assignment does not affect such
guaranty, and the franchisee and the guarantor(s) provide signed written notice of such
assignment at least thirty (30) days in advance of the assignment which demonstrates
the conditions of this exception have been satisfied.

derived from the operation of a cable system to provide cable services, including the studios and
other facilities associated therewith, within the City. "Gross revenues" include, by way of
illustration and not limitation, monthly fees charged subscribers for any basic, optional, premium,
per-channel, per-program, or other service; installation, disconnection, reconnection, and changein-
service fees; leased channel fees; late fees and processing fees; franchise fees, fees or
payments received from programmers for carriage of programming on the system (which does not
include contributions to joint marketing efforts); revenues from rentals or sales of converters or
other equipment; studio rental and production fees; advertising revenues; revenues from program
guides; and revenues from home shopping and bank-at-home channels. "Gross revenues" shall
not include any taxes on services furnished by a franchisee or other person which are imposed
directly on any subscriber or user by the United States, the State of Missouri, the City, or other
governmental unit and which are collected by a franchisee or other person on behalf of said
governmental unit. "Gross revenues" shall not include revenues of another person to the extent
already included in the "Gross revenues" of one person hereunder, or any proceeds from the sale
or exchange of the system. "Gross revenues" shall not include revenues for goods and services
which are not provided over the system, even if such goods and services are ordered using the
system. In the event a person receives revenues for operations within and without the City of
which no specific portion can be attributed to operations in the City, "Gross revenues", with
respect to such revenues, shall mean the portion thereof derived by multiplying such revenues by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of subscribers in the City and the denominator of
which is the total number of subscribers in the area generating such revenues. Franchise fees are
based on "Gross revenues" as provided in Section 625.100. Gross revenues shall only include
revenues to the extent franchise fees thereon can legally be passed on to the subscribers.

consistent with the purposes for which it was dedicated, may be used for the purpose of installing
and maintaining a cable system. No reference herein, or in any franchise agreement, to a "public
right-of-way" shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the City that its interest or
other right to control the use of such property is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and
a franchisee shall be deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the City and as the
City may have the undisputed right and power to give.

SUBSCRIBER
Any person who legally receives any cable service delivered over a cable system and the City in

Section 625.030. Grant of Franchise.
[CC 1979 §7½-3; Ord. No. 95-826 §3, 10-2-1995; Ord. No. 96-883 §1(Exh. A), 8-19-1996]
Grant Of Franchise. The City may grant one (1) or more cable television franchises containing
such provisions as are reasonably necessary to protect the public interest, and each such
franchise shall be awarded in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Chapter. This
Chapter may be amended from time to time, and in no event shall this Chapter be considered a
contract between the City and a franchisee such that the City would be prohibited from amending
any provision hereof; provided, no such amendment shall in any way impair any contract right or
increase obligations of a franchisee under an outstanding and effective franchise except in the
lawful exercise of the City's police power.
Franchise Required.
No person may construct, operate, or maintain a cable system or provide cable service over a
cable system within the City without a franchise granted by the City authorizing such activity.
No person may be granted a franchise without having entered into a franchise agreement with
the City pursuant to this Chapter. For the purpose of this provision, the operation of part or all
of a cable system within the City means the use or occupancy by facilities of public rights-ofway
within the City whether or not any subscriber within the City is served. A system shall be
deemed as using or occupying public rights-of-way even though such use or occupancy is
solely by reason of use of distribution facilities furnished by a telephone or other company
pursuant to tariff or contract. A system shall not be deemed as operating within the City even
though service is offered or rendered to one (1) or more subscribers within the City, if no
public right-of-way is used or occupied. The location within the City of a microwave or similar
relay, interconnection or program origination facility not involving the use or occupancy of
public rights-of-way shall not be deemed operation within the City. In all respects, franchise
agreements shall be issued so as to provide equal protection under the law and to prevent
unlawful disparate treatment of persons which operate or construct cable systems or provide
cable services over a cable system.
To the extent a common carrier (or any other person) is providing video programming to
subscribers using radio communications, such common carrier (or other person) must obtain
a franchise as required pursuant to this Chapter but shall not be subject to requirements
imposed by the Cable Act through this Chapter. To the extent a common carrier is providing
transmission of video programming on a common carrier basis, such common carrier must
obtain a franchise as required pursuant to this Chapter, but shall not be subject to
requirements imposed by the Cable Act through this Chapter (but this Section shall not affect
the treatment of a facility of a common carrier as a cable system). To the extent a common
carrier (or any other person) is providing video programming by means of an open video
system pursuant to certification approved by the FCC, such common carrier (or other person)
need not obtain a franchise pursuant to this Chapter, but shall be subject to requirements
imposed by the Cable Act through this Chapter as permitted by Federal law, and shall pay to
the City fees on gross revenues for the provision of cable service equal to and in lieu of the

franchise fee imposed hereunder on cable operators in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter. To the extent that a common carrier is providing video programming to its
subscribers in a manner other than that described above in this Subsection (2) such common
carrier must obtain a franchise as required pursuant to this Chapter and shall be subject to
requirements imposed by the Cable Act through this Chapter.
Length Of Franchise. No franchise shall initially be granted for a period of more than twenty (20)
years or less than four (4) years, except that a franchisee may apply for renewal or extension
pursuant to this Chapter.
Franchise Characteristics.
A franchise authorizes use of public rights-of-way for installing, operating, and maintaining
cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit, and other devices necessary and
appurtenant to the operation of a cable system to provide cable service within a franchise
area, but does not expressly or implicitly authorize a franchisee to provide service to, or install
a cable system on private property without owner consent through eminent domain or
otherwise (except for use of compatible easements pursuant to and consistent with Section
621 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 541(a)(2)), or to use publicly or privately owned
poles, ducts or conduits without a separate agreement with the owners.
A franchise shall not mean or include any franchise, license, or permit for the privilege of
transacting and carrying on a business within the City as generally required by the ordinances
and laws of the City other than this cable communications regulatory code, or for attaching
devices to poles or other structures, whether owned by the City or other person, or for
excavating or performing other work in or along public rights-of-way. A franchise shall not
confer any authority to provide telecommunications services or any other communications
services besides cable services. A franchise shall not confer any implicit rights other than
those mandated by Federal, State or local law.
A franchise is non-exclusive and will not explicitly or implicitly preclude the issuance of other
franchises to operate cable systems within the City; affect the City's right to authorize use of
public rights-of-way by other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes as it
determines appropriate; or affect the City's right to itself construct, operate, or maintain a
cable system, with or without a franchise.
Once a franchise agreement has been accepted and executed by the City and a franchisee,
such franchise agreement shall constitute a valid and enforceable contract between the
franchisee and the City, and the terms, conditions, and provisions of such franchise
agreement, subject to this Chapter and all other duly enacted and applicable laws, shall
define the rights and obligations of the franchisee and the City relating to the franchise.
All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of
the public rights-of-way, and the City reserves the right to reasonably designate where a
franchisee's facilities are to be placed within the public rights-of-way through its generally
applicable permit procedures without materially adding to the obligations of the franchisee.
A franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public trust and personal to the original
franchisee. No franchise transfer shall occur without the prior written consent of the City upon
the application made by the franchisee pursuant to this Chapter and the franchise agreement,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and any purported franchise transfer made
without application and prior written consent shall be void and shall be cause for the City to
revoke the franchise agreement.
Franchisee Subject To Other Laws — Police Power.
A franchisee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with all applicable Federal, State
and local laws, including this Chapter. A franchisee shall at all times be subject to all lawful

exercise of the police power of the City, including but not limited to all rights the City may have
under 47 U.S.C. Section 552, all powers regarding zoning, supervision of construction,
assurance of equal employment opportunities, control of public rights-of-way, and consumer
protection.
No course of dealing between a franchisee and the City, or any delay on the part of the City in
exercising any rights hereunder, shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the City or
acquiescence in the actions of a franchisee in contravention of such rights except to the
extent expressly waived in writing or expressly provided for in a franchise agreement.
The City shall have full authority to regulate cable systems, franchisees, and franchises as
may now or hereafter be lawfully permissible. Except where rights are expressly waived by a
franchise agreement, they are reserved, whether or not expressly enumerated.
Interpretation Of Franchise Terms.
In the event of a conflict between this Chapter and a franchise agreement, the provisions of
the franchise agreement control except where the conflict arises from the lawful exercise of
the City's police power.
The provisions of this Chapter and a franchise agreement will be liberally construed in
accordance with generally accepted rules of contract construction and to promote the public
interest.
Operation Of A Cable System Without A Franchise. Any person who occupies public rights-of-way
for the purpose of operating or constructing a cable system or provides cable service over a cable
system and who does not hold a valid franchise from the City shall be subject to all requirements
of this Chapter, including but not limited to its provisions regarding construction and technical
standards and franchise fees. In its discretion, the City at any time may by ordinance require such
person to enter into a franchise agreement within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written notice to
such person from the City that a franchise agreement is required; require such person to remove
its property and restore the affected area to a condition satisfactory to the City within such time
period; grant a revocable permit to operate for a period not to exceed two (2) years provided such
period begins on the expiration date of a franchise previously issued to such person; direct
municipal personnel to remove the property and restore the affected area to a condition
satisfactory to the City and charge the person the costs therefor, including by placing a lien on the
person's property as provided in connection with abating nuisances; or take any other action it is
entitled to take under applicable law. In no event shall a franchise be created unless it is issued by
ordinance of the City pursuant to this Chapter and subject to a written franchise agreement.
Acts At Franchisee's Expense. Any act that a franchisee is or may be required to perform under
this Chapter, a franchise agreement, or applicable law shall be performed at the franchisee's
expense, without reimbursement by the City, unless expressly provided to the contrary in this
Chapter, the franchise agreement, or applicable law.
Eminent Domain. Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to impair or affect, in any way or to
any extent, the City's power of eminent domain.
Exclusive Contracts And Anti-Competitive Acts Prohibited.
No franchisee or other multichannel video programming distributor shall enter into or enforce
an exclusive contract for the provision of cable service or other multichannel video
programming with any person, or demand the exclusive right to serve a person or location, as
a condition of extending service to that or any other person or location.
No franchisee or other multichannel video programming distributor shall engage in acts that
have the purpose or effect of limiting competition for the provision of cable service or services
similar to cable service in the City, except for such actions as are expressly authorized by law.

Section 625.040. Applications For Grant, Renewal, Modification
or Transfer of Franchises.
[CC 1979 §7½-4; Ord. No. 95-826 §4, 10-2-1995; Ord. No. 96-883 §1(Exh. A), 8-19-1996]
Written Application.
A written application shall be filed with the City Clerk for grant of an initial franchise; renewal
of a franchise under 47 U.S.C. Section 546(a)-(g) or Section 546(h); modification of a
franchise agreement; or franchise transfer. An applicant shall demonstrate in its application
compliance with all requirements of this Chapter and all applicable laws.
To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of the application shall be submitted together with
ten (10) copies. The application must be accompanied by the required filing fees, conform to
any applicable request for proposals, and contain all required information. All applications
shall include the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of persons authorized to act on
behalf of the applicant with respect to the application.
All filed applications shall be made available by the City Clerk for public inspection. Each filed
application shall be reviewed promptly by the City for completeness.
Application For Grant Of A Franchise, Other Than A Cable Act Renewal Franchise.
Upon receipt of an application for a franchise other than a cable act renewal franchise, the
Board of Aldermen may commence a proceeding to identify the future cable related needs
and interests of the community. Upon completion of that proceeding, or after receipt of the
application if no such proceeding is commenced, the Board of Aldermen shall either evaluate
the application or issue an RFP, which shall be mailed to the applicant and made reasonably
available to any other interested person. The procedures, instructions, and requirements set
forth in an RFP shall be followed by each applicant as if set forth and required herein. The
City may seek additional information from any applicant and establish deadlines for the
submission of such information. If the City issues an RFP, it shall evaluate all timely
responses.
In evaluating an application for a franchise including a response to an RFP, the City shall
consider, among other things, the following factors:
The extent to which the applicant substantially complied with the applicable law and the
material terms of any franchises in other communities.
Whether the quality of the applicant's service under any franchises in other communities,
including signal quality, response to customer complaints, billing practices, and the like,
was reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities served.
Whether there is adequate assurance that the applicant has the financial, technical, and
legal qualifications to provide cable service in the City.
Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established by the City and
is otherwise reasonably likely to meet the future cable related needs and interests of the
community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.
Whether there is adequate assurance the applicant will provide suitable public,
educational, and governmental access facilities.
Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted and in the public interest considering the
immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way that would be used by the cable
system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would

require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use
of the public rights-of-way.
Whether the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant owns or controls any other cable
system in the City, or whether grant of the application may eliminate or reduce
competition in the delivery of cable service in the City.
If the Board of Aldermen finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering
the factors set forth shove, the City shall prepare a final written franchise agreement under
this Chapter that incorporates, as appropriate, the commitments made by the applicant and
establish a deadline for the applicant to sign it and submit it for approval. If the applicant signs
the franchise agreement and timely submits it for approval, the City shall issue a franchise by
Chapter adopted no less than thirty (30) days after the filing of the original application.
If the Board of Aldermen denies a franchise, it will issue a written decision explaining why the
franchise was denied.
Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the Board of Aldermen shall hold a
public hearing; however, the City may reject without hearing any application that is incomplete
or fails to respond fully to an RFP.
This Chapter is not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant standing to challenge the
issuance of a franchise to another person, or to limit such standing.
Application For Grant Of A Cable Act Franchise Renewal. Applications for franchise renewal under
the Cable Act shall be received and reviewed in a manner consistent with Section 626 of the
Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 546. If neither a franchisee nor the City activates in a timely manner,
or can activate, the renewal process set forth in 47 U.S.C. Section 546(a) — (g) (including, for
example, if the provisions are repealed), and except as to applications submitted pursuant to 47
U.S.C. Section 546(h), the provisions of Section 625.040(B) shall apply and a renewal request
shall be evaluated using the same criteria as any other request for a franchise.
The following requirements shall apply to renewal requests properly submitted pursuant to the
Cable Act:
If the provisions of 47 U.S.C. Section 546(a) — (g) are properly invoked, the Board of
Aldermen shall, in accordance with the time limits of the Cable Act, commence and
complete a proceeding to review the applicant's performance under the franchise during
the then current franchise term and to identify future cable-related-community needs and
interests. Upon completion of the proceeding, the Board of Aldermen may issue a RFP.
The Board of Aldermen, or its designee, shall establish deadlines and procedures for
responding to the RFP, may seek additional information from the applicant, and shall
establish deadlines for the submission of such additional information. Alternatively, an
applicant can submit a proposal for renewal on its own initiative.
Following receipt of renewal proposals (and such additional information as may be
provided in response to requests) the Board of Aldermen will provide prompt public
notice of such proposals and thereafter either determine that the franchise should be
renewed or make a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed.
This determination shall be made in accordance with the time limits established by the
Cable Act, including sufficient time to comply with the following procedures.
If the Board of Aldermen preliminarily determines that the franchise should not be
renewed, which determination can be made by resolution, and the applicant that
submitted the renewal proposal notifies the City Clerk in writing within twenty (20) days
after receipt of the preliminary determination that it wishes to pursue any rights to an
administrative proceeding it has under the Cable Act, then, if required, the Board of
Aldermen shall commence an administrative proceeding after providing prompt public

notice thereof, in accordance with the Cable Act. The City may also commence such a
proceeding on its own initiative if it so chooses.
If the Board of Aldermen decides to grant renewal, which decision shall be made by
resolution, the City shall prepare a final written franchise agreement that incorporates, as
appropriate, the commitments made by the applicant in the renewal proposal and
establish a deadline for the applicant to sign it and submit it for approval. If the applicant
signs the franchise agreement and timely submits it for approval, the City shall issue a
franchise by ordinance. If the franchise agreement is not so accepted and approved
within the time limits established by 47 U.S.C. Section 546(c)(1) and the City, renewal
shall thereupon be deemed preliminarily denied, and if the applicant notifies the City
Clerk in writing within twenty (20) days after the expiration of the time limit established by
47 U.S.C. Section 546(c)(1) that it wishes to pursue any rights to an administrative
proceeding it has under the Cable Act, then, if required, the Board of Aldermen shall
commence an administrative proceeding after providing prompt public notice thereof, in
accordance with the Cable Act. The City may also commence such a proceeding on its
own initiative if it so chooses.
If an administrative proceeding is commenced pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 546(c), the
applicant's renewal proposal shall be evaluated considering such matters as may be
considered consistent with Federal law. The following procedures shall apply:
The Board of Aldermen shall, by resolution, appoint an administrative Hearing Officer or
officers (referred to hereafter as "Hearing Officer"). The Board of Aldermen may appoint
itself or one (1) or more of its members as hearing officer or any other qualified person
consistent with the Cable Act and other applicable law.
The Hearing Officer shall establish a schedule for proceeding which allows for written
discovery (requests for admissions, production of documents and interrogatory
responses), production of evidence, and subpoenaing and cross-examination of
witnesses. Depositions shall not be permitted unless the party requesting the deposition
shows that written discovery and hearing subpoena will not provide it an adequate
opportunity to require the production of evidence necessary to present its case. The
Hearing Officer shall have the authority to require the production of evidence as the
interests of justice may require, including to require the production of evidence by the
applicant that submitted the renewal proposal and any affiliate of such applicant. The
Hearing Officer shall not prohibit discovery on the ground that evidence sought is
proprietary or involves business secrets, but rather shall issue protective orders which
allow reasonable and necessary discovery without making such information available to
competitors. Any order of the Hearing Officer may be enforced by imposing appropriate,
sanctions in the administrative hearing or by action of the Board of Aldermen.
The Hearing Officer may conduct a prehearing conference and establish appropriate
prehearing orders. The City and the applicant shall be the only parties. The City may
have special counsel to represent its interests at the hearing so that the City Attorney
may advise the Board of Aldermen as it makes its decision.
The Hearing Officer may require the City and the applicant to submit prepared written
testimony prior to the hearing. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the applicant shall
present evidence first, the City shall present evidence second, and the applicant shall be
allowed the opportunity to present rebuttal evidence. Any reports or the transcript or
summary of any proceedings conducted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 546(a) shall for
purposes of the administrative hearing be regarded no differently than any other
evidence. The City and the applicant must be afforded full procedural protection
regarding evidence related to these proceedings, including the right to refute any
evidence introduced in these proceedings or sought to be introduced by the other party.
Both shall have the opportunity to submit additional evidence related to issues raised in

There shall be a transcribed proceeding during which each party will be allowed to
present testimony (live, or written if so required) and cross-examine the witnesses of the
other party.
Following completion of any hearing, the Hearing Officer shall require the parties to
submit proposed findings of fact with respect to the matters that the Board of Aldermen is
entitled to consider in determining whether renewal ought to be granted. Based on the
record of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall then prepare written findings with respect
to those matters, and submit those findings including a decision and the reasons therefor,
to the Board of Aldermen and to the parties (unless the Hearing Officer is the Board of
Aldermen, in which case the written findings shall constitute the final decision of the City).
If the Hearing Officer is not the Board of Aldermen, the parties shall have thirty (30) days
from the date the findings are submitted to the Board of Aldermen to file exceptions to
those findings. The Board of Aldermen shall thereafter issue a written decision granting
or denying the application for renewal, consistent with the requirements of the Cable Act,
based on the record of such proceeding, stating the reason for the decision. A copy of
the final decision of the Board of Aldermen shall be provided to the parties.
The proceeding shall be conducted with due speed. Any decision to renew a franchise
shall be made by ordinance enacted no less than thirty (30) days after the filing of the
application, and subsequent to preparation of a written franchise agreement consistent
with the decision by the City and signature thereof by the applicant.
In conducting the proceeding, and except as inconsistent with the foregoing, the Hearing
Officer will follow the Missouri Administrative Procedures Act, as amended. The Hearing
Officer may request that the Board of Aldermen adopt additional reasonable and
necessary procedures and requirements by resolution.
This Section does not prohibit any franchisee from submitting or the City from considering an
informal renewal application pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 546(h), which application may be
granted or denied in accordance with the provisions of 47 U.S.C. Section 546(h). A
franchisee's written request to commence informal renewal proceedings pursuant to 47
U.S.C. 546(h) shall qualify as an informal renewal application and franchisee shall only be
required to provide the information requested in Section 4(d) to the extent specifically
requested by the City, unless the formal renewal process is subsequently invoked. If such an
informal renewal application is granted, including during the course of formal renewal
proceedings, then the steps specified in Subsections (C)(1) and (C)(2) of this Section need
not be taken, notwithstanding the provisions of those subsections. However, the City will
provide the public with adequate notice before making a decision on such an application, and
will make any decision to renew by ordinance enacted no less than thirty (30) days after the
filing of the application, and subsequent to the preparation of a written franchise agreement
by the City and signature thereof by the applicant. Unless otherwise directed by the City, an
informal renewal application shall contain the information required under Section 625.040(D).
The provisions of this Chapter shall be read and applied so that they are consistent with
Section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 546, as amended.
Contents Of Franchise And Renewal Applications. An RFP for the grant of a franchise, including

application is filed, subsequent to preparation of a modified written franchise agreement by
the City and signature thereof by the applicant.
An extension of a franchise term by less than four (4) years shall constitute a modification. An
extension of a franchise term by four (4) years or more shall be processed through formal or
informal renewal procedures.
Franchise Transfers.
City approval required. No franchise transfer shall occur without prior written application to
and written approval of the Board of Aldermen by ordinance enacted after a public hearing,
and only then upon such terms and conditions as the Board of Aldermen reasonably deems
necessary and proper. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any reported franchise
transfer made without such prior approval shall be void and shall be cause for the City to
revoke the franchise agreement. A grant of a franchise involves personal credit, trust, and
confidence in the franchisee, and franchise transfer without the prior written approval of the
Board of Aldermen shall be considered to impair the City's assurance of due performance.
The granting of approval for a franchise transfer in one (1) instance shall not render
unnecessary approval of any subsequent franchise transfer.
Application.
The franchisee shall promptly notify the City Clerk in writing of any proposed franchise
transfer. If any franchise transfer should take place without prior notice to the City, the
franchisee will promptly notify the City Clerk in writing that such a franchise transfer has
occurred.
At least one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to the contemplated effective date
of a franchise transfer, the franchisee shall submit to the City Clerk an application for
approval of the franchise transfer. Such an application shall provide information on the
proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical and other
qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the franchise transfer on
subscriber rates and service. At a minimum, unless waived by the City, the following
information must be included in the application:
All information and forms required under Federal law;
All information described in Section 625.040(D)(1) through (5), (9), (11), (13) through
(15) of this Chapter, regarding the transferee instead of the applicant, and regarding
the franchise transfer rather than initial or renewal franchise;
A description of any business relationships or transactions of any kind, past, present,
or anticipated, between the franchisee, or its owners or affiliates, and the transferee,
or its owners or affiliates, other than the proposed transaction;
Any contracts, financing documents, or other documents that relate to the proposed
transaction, and all documents, schedules, exhibits, or the like referred to therein;
A description of the sources and amounts of the funds to be used in the proposed
transaction, indicating how the debt-equity ratio of the system will change in the
course of the transaction; what entities will be liable for repayment of any debt
incurred; what interest, payment schedule, and other terms or conditions will apply to
any debt financing; any debt coverages or financial ratios any potential transferees
will be required to maintain over the franchise term if the proposed transaction is
approved; what financial resources would be available to the system under the
control of the proposed transferee;
Any other information necessary to provide a complete and accurate understanding
of the financial position of the system before and after the proposed franchise

transfer, including but not limited to projected income statements and cash flow
statements, including capital investments, for at least five (5) years after the
proposed franchise transfer, assuming the franchise transfer is approved, stating
specifically what assumptions are being made with respect to any rebuild or upgrade
of the system; and
A statement that the franchisee is in compliance with its franchise obligations over
the term of the franchise, or specific descriptions of any non-compliance of which the
franchisee or any potential transferee is aware.
For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a franchise transfer, the
Board of Aldermen and its agents may inquire into the legal, technical, and financial
qualifications of the prospective transferee as may be allowed by law and such other
matters as the Board of Aldermen may deem necessary to determine whether the
franchise transfer is in the public interest and should be approved or denied. The
franchisee and any prospective transferees shall assist the City council in any such
inquiry, and if they fail to reasonably cooperate, the request for approval of franchise
transfer may be denied. Proprietary information shall be protected from disclosure to
competitors to the extent permitted by law.
Determination by City.
In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or grant subject to conditions an
application for approval of a franchise transfer, the Board of Aldermen shall consider the
legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the system;
whether any requested waivers under applicable law are in the best interests of the
public whether the franchisee is in compliance with its franchise agreement and this
Chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such non-compliance;
and whether operation by the transferee on approval of the franchise transfer would
adversely affect the City's interest under this Chapter, the franchise agreement, other
applicable law, or the public interest, or make it less likely that the future cable-related
needs and interests of the community would be satisfied.
The City shall make its determination in accordance with any time limits imposed by
Federal law, including under 47 U.S.C. Section 537(e).
Any purported franchise transfer made without the Board of Aldermen's prior written
approval shall be void, and shall make a franchise subject to revocation at the Board of
Aldermen's sole discretion, and make any other remedies available to the City under the
franchise or other applicable law. Acceptance of filing of an application for approval of a
franchise transfer later than one hundred twenty (120) days before the purported
effective date of the franchise transfer shall not validate the transaction or excuse the late
filing, and in such an instance the City shall retain the right to make its decision regarding
such a franchise transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days unless action is required
sooner by law.
Transferee's agreement. No application for approval of a franchise transfer shall be granted
unless and until the proposed transferee submits an agreement in writing that it will abide by
and accept all terms of this Chapter and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume the
obligations and liabilities, known and unknown, of the previous franchisee under this Chapter
and the franchise agreement for all purposes, including renewal, unless the Board of
Aldermen approves a modification of the franchise agreement pursuant to Section 625.040 in
conjunction with its approval of the franchise transfer, in which case the proposed transferee's
agreement shall refer to the franchise agreement as so modified.
Approval does not constitute waiver. Approval by the Board of Aldermen of a franchise
transfer does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the City under this
Chapter or a franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the franchise

Filing Fees And Deposits. To be acceptable for filing, an application under this Section 625.040
shall be accompanied by a filing fee in the following amounts to cover the City's internal
administrative costs incidental to the franchising process:
1. For an initial franchise $1,000.00
2. For renewal of a franchise under 47 U.S.C. Section 546(a) — (g) $1,000.00

4. For modification of a franchise agreement $500.00
5. For approval of a franchise transfer $500.00
Public Proceedings. An applicant shall be notified of any public proceedings held in connection
with the evaluation of its application and shall be given an opportunity to be heard thereat. Notice
of all public proceedings of the City shall be published and posted in accordance with its usual
practices.
Intergovernmental Cooperation. By resolution of the Board of Aldermen, any part or all of the
process established by this Section 625.040 may be conducted in concert with other political
subdivisions served or to be served by the applicant.
Section 625.050. Construction Provisions.
[CC 1979 §7½-5; Ord. No. 95-826 §5, 10-2-1995; Ord. No. 96-883 §1(Exh. A), 8-19-1996]
System Construction Schedule. Every franchise agreement shall specify the construction schedule
that will apply to any required construction, upgrade, or rebuild of the cable system. Failure on the
part of a franchisee to commence and diligently pursue such requirements and complete the
matters set forth in its franchise agreement or to comply with the system design and construction
plan submitted to the City, including by providing the equipment specified (or its equivalent) and by
following generally accepted installation practices (except insofar as those plans or practices, if
carried out, would result in construction of a system which could not meet requirements of
Federal, State or local law; and except for such minor modifications as are typical in the industry),
shall be grounds for revocation of its franchise under and pursuant to the terms of Section
625.120(E); provided, however, that the Board of Aldermen in its discretion may extend the time
for the completion of construction and installation for additional periods by resolution in the event a
franchisee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reason of circumstances beyond its control
and requests such an extension in writing. A franchisee's failure to comply with provisions of the
construction plan approved by the Board of Aldermen shall also be grounds for imposition of
penalties pursuant to Section 625.120(H).
Construction Procedures.
A franchisee shall construct, operate and maintain the cable system subject to the supervision
of all of the authorities of the City who have jurisdiction in such matters, and in compliance
with all laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations affecting the system.
The system, and all parts thereof, shall be subject to periodic inspection by the City.
No construction, reconstruction or relocation of the system or any part thereof within the
public rights-of-way shall be commenced until written permits have been obtained from the
proper City officials. In any permit so issued, such officials may impose such conditions and
regulations as a condition of the granting of the permit as are reasonably necessary for the
purpose of protecting any structures or facilities in the public rights-of-way and for the proper

restoration of such public rights-of-way and structures and facilities, and for the protection of
the public and the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
The Board of Aldermen may by resolution or ordinance, from time to time, issue such
reasonable rules and regulations concerning the construction, operation and maintenance of
the system as are consistent with the provisions of this Chapter and franchises issued
pursuant to this Chapter.
Construction Standards.
The construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of a cable system shall be in
accordance with all applicable sections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,
the National Electrical Safety Code, the National Electric Code, National Cable Television
Association Standards of Good Engineering Practices; Obstruction Marking and Lighting,
Federal Aviation Administration; Construction, Marking and Lighting of Antenna Structures,
Federal Communications Commission Rules Part 17; AT&T Manual of Construction
Procedures (Blue Book); franchisee's Construction Procedures Manual; other Federal, State
or local laws and regulations that may apply to the operation, construction, maintenance, or
repair of a cable system, including, without limitation, local zoning and construction codes,
and laws and accepted industry practices, all as hereafter may be amended or adopted. In
the event of a conflict among codes and standards, the most stringent code or standard shall
apply (except insofar as that code or standard, if followed, would result in a system that could
not meet requirements of Federal, State or local law). The City may adopt additional
reasonable standards as required to ensure that work continues to be performed in an orderly
and workmanlike manner, or to reflect changes in standards which may occur over a
franchise term.
All wires, cable lines, and other transmission lines, equipment, and structures shall be
installed and located to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of
property owners, including the City.
All electronic equipment shall be of good and durable quality.
Without limiting the foregoing, antennas and their supporting structures (towers) shall be
designed in accordance with the Uniform Building Code and Electronics Industry Association
RS22A Specifications, as amended, and shall be painted, lighted, erected, and maintained in
accordance with all applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration
and all other applicable Federal, State or local laws, codes, and regulations, all as hereafter
may be amended or adopted.
Without limiting the foregoing, all of a franchisee's plant and equipment, including, but not
limited to, the antenna site, headend and distribution system, towers, house connections,
structures, poles, wires, cable, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, fixtures, and apparatuses shall
be installed, located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired,
maintained, and operated in accordance with good engineering practices, performed by
experienced and properly trained maintenance and construction personnel so as not to
endanger any person or property or to unreasonably interfere in any manner with the public
rights-of-way or legal rights of any property owner including the City or unnecessarily hinder
or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
All safety practices required by law shall be used during construction, maintenance, and
repair of a cable system. A franchisee shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted
methods and devices to prevent failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury,
or nuisance to the public.
Any and all public rights-of-way, public property, or private property disturbed or damaged
during the construction, repair, replacement, relocation, operation, maintenance, or

construction of a system shall be repaired or replaced by the franchisee within a reasonable
time specified by the City.
A franchisee shall, by a reasonable time specified by the City, protect, support, temporarily
disconnect, relocate, or remove discrete portions of its property when required by the City by
reason of traffic conditions; public safety; public right-of-way construction; public right-of-way
maintenance or repair (including resurfacing or widening); change of public right-of-way
grade; construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal
lines, tracks, or any other type of government-owned communications system, public work or
improvement or any government-owned utility; public right-of-way vacation; or for any other
purpose where the convenience of the City would be reasonably served thereby; provided,
however, that the franchisee may abandon any property in place if approved by the City in
writing, and provided further that the franchisee shall not be required to make permanent
changes in its facilities to accommodate the installation of another cable system, nor should it
be required to make temporary changes solely to disrupt its business or otherwise provide an
unfair advantage to a competitor. No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of the
property of a franchisee and a franchisee shall not be entitled to any compensation therefor.
No location of any pole or wire-holding structure of a franchisee shall be a vested interest.
If any action under the preceding paragraph is reasonably required to accommodate the
construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of another person that is authorized to use
the public rights-of-way, a franchisee shall, after thirty (30) days' advance written notice, take
action to effect the necessary changes requested. The franchisee shall be reimbursed by
such other person for costs reasonably incurred in taking such action. The Board of Aldermen
may resolve disputes as to responsibility for costs associated with the removal, relaying, or
relocation of facilities if the parties are unable to do so themselves, and if the matter is not
governed by a valid contract between the parties.
In the event of an emergency, or where a cable system creates or is contributing to an
imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the City may remove, relay, or relocate the
pertinent parts of that cable system without prior notice. No charge shall be made by
franchisee against the City for restoration and repair.
A franchisee shall, on the request of the City or any person holding a permit issued by the
City, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings or oversized
vehicles. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid
by the person requesting same, and the franchisee shall have the authority to require such
payment in advance, except in the case where the request is made by the City on its own
behalf, in which case no such payment shall be required. The franchisee shall be given not
less than forty-eight (48) hours' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes
unless the Board of Aldermen has declared an emergency.
A franchisee shall have the authority to trim trees that overhang a public right-of-way of the
City so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and
cables of the franchisee, at its own expense subject to the supervision and direction of the
City. Trimming of trees on private property shall require written permission of the property
owner. All cut materials shall be properly disposed.
A franchisee shall use, with the owner's permission, existing underground conduits or
overhead utility facilities whenever feasible and may not erect poles in public rights-of-way

be unreasonably withheld. Copies of agreements for use of conduits or other facilities shall be

feeder and drop cable shall be constructed underground. Whenever and wherever all electric
lines and telephone lines are moved from overhead to underground placement, all cable
system cables shall be similarly moved and the cost of movement of its cable shall be solely
the obligation of the franchisee. In cases of new construction or property development where
utilities are to be placed underground, on request of franchisee the developer or property
owner shall give a franchisee reasonable notice of the particular date on which open
trenching will be available to franchisee for installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and
laterals to be provided at the franchisee's expense. The franchisee shall also provide
specifications as needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring
facilities within the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except
that if the franchisee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals within five
(5) working days of the date the trenches are available, as designated in the notice given by
the developer or property owner, then should the trenches be closed after the five-day period,
the cost of new trenching is to be borne by the franchisee.
The City shall have the right to install and maintain free of charge upon any poles or within
any conduit owned by a franchisee any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably
interfere with the cable system operations of the franchisee.
Prior to construction or rebuild of a cable system, a franchisee shall first submit to the Board
of Aldermen for approval a concise description of the cable system proposed to be erected or
installed, including engineering drawings, if required by the Board of Aldermen, together with
a map and plans indicating the proposed location of all such facilities, and obtain written
approval therefor from the Board of Aldermen, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
Any contractor or subcontractor used for work or construction, installation, operation,
maintenance, or repair of system equipment must be properly licensed under laws of the
State and all applicable local ordinances, and each contractor or subcontractor shall have the
same obligations with respect to its work as a franchisee would have under the franchise
agreement and applicable laws if the work were performed by the franchisee. The franchisee
must ensure that contractors, subcontractors and all employees who will perform work for it
are trained and experienced. The franchisee shall be responsible for ensuring that the work of
contractors and subcontractors is performed consistent with the franchise and applicable law,
shall be fully responsible for all acts or omissions of contractors or subcontractors, shall be
responsible for promptly correcting acts or omissions by any contractor or subcontractor, and
shall implement a quality control program to ensure that the work is properly performed.
Upon failure of a franchisee to commence, pursue or complete any work required by law or by
the provisions of this Chapter to be done in any street, within the time prescribed and to the
reasonable satisfaction of the City, the City may, at its option, after thirty (30) days' notice to
franchisee, cause such work to be done and the franchisee shall pay to the City the cost
thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the City to franchisee within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such itemized report.
The franchisee shall make no paving cuts or curb cuts except after written permission has
been given by the City, which permission shall not unreasonably be withheld.
The franchisee shall install in conduit all cable passing under any major roadway.
Area Served. A franchisee shall build and maintain its system so that within a reasonable period of
time, as established by the franchise, it is able to provide service to all households desiring service
located within the franchise area without any construction charges (other than standard
connection charges and drop charges as indicated in Section 625.050(E)(2)). A franchisee must
build and maintain its system so that it can extend service to households desiring service located
outside the franchise area in accordance with Section 625.050(E)(1) through (4). Connections to
commercial customers shall be governed by Section 625.050(E)(5).

Line Extension Requirements.
For areas within the City limits but outside the franchise area, including areas annexed
after the effective date of its franchise, a franchisee shall upon request of the Board of
Aldermen extend its trunk and distribution system to serve households desiring service
without any construction charge (other than standard connection charges and drop
charges as indicated in Section 625.050(E)(2)), unless the franchisee demonstrates to
the Board of Aldermen's satisfaction evidenced by written decision that circumstances
justify a specific charge, where the number of potential subscribers to be passed by such
extension is equal to or greater than twenty-five (25) potential households per cable mile
measured from the point on the system where such extension would originate.
In the event that the requirements set forth in the foregoing subparagraph (a) are not
met, the franchisee shall on request of the Board of Aldermen extend its cable system
based upon the following cost-sharing formula. The franchisee shall contribute an
amount equal to the construction costs per mile multiplied by the length of the extension
in miles, multiplied by a fraction where the numerator equals the number of potential
households per cable mile at the time of the request and the denominator equals twentyfive
(25). Households requesting service as of the completion of construction can be
required to bear the remainder of the total construction costs on a pro rata basis.
Installation of drops. Except as Federal rate regulations may otherwise require, the franchisee
shall not assess any additional cost for service drops of one hundred twenty-five (125) feet or
less unless the franchisee demonstrates to the Board of Aldermen's satisfaction, evidenced
by written decision, that circumstances justify a specific charge. Where a drop exceeds one
hundred twenty-five (125) feet in length, a franchisee may charge the subscriber for the
difference between franchisee's actual costs associated with installing a one hundred twentyfive
(125) foot drop, and the franchisee's actual cost of installing the longer drop, provided
that drop length shall be the shorter of
The actual length of installed drop; or
The shortest practicable distance to the point where the franchisee would be required to
extend its distribution system.
Location of drops. Except as Federal rate regulations may otherwise require, in any area
where a franchisee would be entitled to install a drop aboveground, the franchisee will provide
the subscriber the option to have the drop installed underground, but may charge the
subscriber the difference between the actual cost of the aboveground installation and the
actual cost of the underground installation.
Time for extension. A franchisee must extend service to any person who requests it within
seven (7) days of the request within the franchise area or where service can be provided by
activating or installing a drop within one hundred twenty-five (125) feet of the existing
distribution system;
Because existing conditions can vary dramatically, the franchisee may in its discretion require
commercial customers to pay all reasonable costs of connection (including time and
materials) in excess of the average cost of connection for residential services.
System Tests And Inspections.
Tests. A franchisee shall perform the following tests to demonstrate compliance with the
requirements of the franchise and other performance standards established by Federal law.
All tests shall be conducted in accordance with Federal rules and in accordance with the most
recent edition of NCTA's "Recommended Practices for Measurements on Cable Television

Systems," or if no recent edition exists, such other appropriate manual as the parties may
designate.
Preconstruction quality control on cable and equipment. A franchisee shall perform
preconstruction quality tests on system components. In case of passive components, this
will include testing a significant sample of devices to verify compliance with
manufacturer's specifications.
All trunk and distribution cable shall be sweep-tested on the reels to verify
compliance with manufacturer's specifications for frequency response and loss.
All trunk and distribution amplifiers shall be bench-tested to verify compliance with
manufacturer's specifications.
No component shall be used in the system which fails to meet manufacturer's
specifications. A franchisee shall maintain in the Metropolitan St. Louis area records
of all pre-construction tests, which the City may inspect during normal business
hours on reasonable notice.
Acceptance tests. A franchisee shall perform acceptance tests prior to subscriber
connection. The tests shall demonstrate that the system components are operating as
expected. The test results shall be submitted to the City Clerk for review by the City. The
franchisee shall have the obligation, without further notice from City, to take corrective
action if any system components are not operating as expected. Unless the City
determines test results are not adequate to demonstrate system compliance with the
standards described above and objects within three (3) working days of receipt of the test
results, the portion of the system covered by the tests will be deemed approved for
subscriber connection.
Continuing tests.
The franchisee shall select locations at the extremities of the system to install
equipment to establish sufficient permanent test points in accordance with Federal
law and sound engineering practices. The franchisee shall perform proof of
performance tests at these locations at least once every six (6) months through the
life of the franchise except as Federal law otherwise limits its obligation, and at other
times and points where complaints indicate tests are warranted. The tests shall
demonstrate system compliance with technical specifications established pursuant to
franchise, or other applicable law. If the City requests to witness the tests, it shall be
notified in writing delivered to the City Clerk at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance
of any testing.
A written report of all test results shall be filed with the City Clerk within thirty (30)
days of each test. If the location fails to meet performance specifications, the
franchisee, without requirement of additional notice or request from the City, shall
take corrective action, retest the location and advise the City of the action taken and
results achieved by writing filed with the City Clerk. The City shall have the option of
witnessing such follow-up tests and shall be notified in writing delivered to the City
Clerk at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of any such follow-up testing.
At any time after commencement of service to subscribers the City may require
additional tests, full or partial repeat tests, different test procedures, or tests involving
a specific subscriber's terminal. Requests for such additional tests will be made on
the basis of complaints received or other evidence indicating an unresolved
controversy or significant non-compliance, and such tests will be limited to the
particular matter in controversy. The City may conduct such tests independently on
three (3) days' advance notice to franchisee. The City will endeavor to so arrange its

franchisee and the subscriber(s).
All reports of test results shall include executive summaries.
Test procedures used in verification of the performance criteria set forth herein, if not as
set forth in Section 76.609, Subpart K of the FCC Rules and Regulations, shall be in
accordance with good engineering practice and shall be fully described in attachment to
the annual certificate filed with the City
To the extent that the report of measurements as required above may be combined with
any reports of measurements required by the FCC or other regulatory agencies, the City
shall accept such combined reports, provided that all standards and measurements
herein or hereafter established by the City are satisfied.
Inspections. The City may conduct inspections of the system, including to assess compliance
with the construction and installation practices manuals and design plans. The franchisee
shall be notified in writing of any violations found during the course of inspections. The
franchisee must bring violations into compliance within thirty (30) days of the date notice of
violation is given, and must submit a report to the City Clerk describing the steps taken to
bring itself into compliance. Inspection does not relieve the franchisee of its obligation to build
in compliance with all provisions of the franchise.
Use Of Public Property.
Should the grades or boundaries of the public rights-of-way which the franchisee is authorized
to use and occupy be changed at any time during the term of the franchise granted, the
franchisee shall, if necessary, at its own cost and expense, relocate or change its system so
as to conform with the new grades or boundaries.
Any alteration to the existing water mains, sewerage or drainage system or to any City, State
or other public structures or facilities in the public rights-of-way required on account of the
construction of the system in the public rights-of-way shall be made at the sole cost and
expense of the franchisee. During any work of constructing, operating or maintaining of the
system, the franchisee shall also, at its own cost and expense, protect any and all existing
structures and facilities belonging to the City and any other person. All work performed by the
franchisee pursuant to this Section shall be done in such reasonable manner prescribed by
the City or other officials having jurisdiction thereover.
Interference With Public Projects. Nothing in this Chapter shall be in preference or hindrance to
the right of the City and any board, authority, commission or public service corporation to perform
or carry on any public works or public improvements of any description.
Publicizing Proposed Construction Work. Unless not possible due to emergency circumstances,
franchisee shall publicize proposed construction work at least ten (10) days prior to
commencement of that work by causing written notice of such construction work to be delivered to
the City Clerk. In addition, unless not possible due to emergency circumstances, before entering
onto any person's property, a franchisee shall contact the property owner or occupant at least one
(1) day in advance. If a franchisee must enter a private building, it must have permission of the
owner or occupant.
System Maintenance.
Interruptions to be minimized. A franchisee shall schedule maintenance so that activities likely
to result in an interruption of service are performed during periods of minimum subscriber use
of the system.

Continuity Of Service.
It shall be the right of all persons in a franchisee's franchise area to receive all available
services from the franchisee as long as their financial and other obligations to the franchisee
are satisfied, and subject to reasonable construction standards and schedules, and subject to
availability of legal access to the location.
A franchisee shall make every reasonable effort to provide all subscribers with continuous
uninterrupted service. At the City's request, a franchisee shall operate its system for a
temporary period under a revocable permit granted expressly by ordinance or tacitly following
the termination of its franchise or franchise transfer as necessary to maintain service to
subscribers, and shall cooperate with the City to assure an orderly transition from it to another
franchisee or system operator (the "transition period"). The transition period shall be no longer
than the reasonable period required for another franchisee to commence service, and shall
not be longer than two (2) years. During the transition period, the franchisee shall continue to
be obligated to comply with the terms and conditions of its franchise agreement and
applicable laws and regulations, and will thereupon continue to receive operating revenues
during such transition period.
Section 625.060. System Facilities, Equipment and Services.
[CC 1979 §7½-6; Ord. No. 95-826 §6, 10-2-1995]
Compliance With Franchise Agreement. In addition to satisfying such requirements as may be

but not limited to those pertaining to public, educational and governmental access facilities, every
franchisee shall comply with the conditions set forth in this Section, except as prohibited by
Federal law.
Full Service To Municipal Buildings. A franchisee shall, on request of the City, install, at no charge,
at least one (1) service outlet at all City occupied buildings, public libraries and all primary and
secondary education public and private schools within the franchise area, and shall install and
charge only its reasonable costs for any additional service outlets requested for such locations, so
long as such additional installations will not interfere with the quality and operation of the
franchisee's system or signal thereon, and the quality and manner of installation of such additional
outlets shall have been approved by the franchisee (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld) and shall comply with all City, State and Federal laws and regulations. The franchisee
shall provide basic cable service and expanded basic cable service to all outlets in such buildings
free of charge. A franchise may specify other requirements regarding the availability of facilities for
municipal use. Use of such facilities shall comply with applicable law.

Any cable system within the City shall meet or exceed the technical standards set forth in 47
C.F.R. 76.61 et seq., and any other applicable Federal technical standards, including any
such reasonable standards as hereafter may be amended or adopted by the Board of
Aldermen in a manner consistent with Federal law.
A franchisee shall use equipment generally used in high quality, reliable, modern systems of
similar design, including, but not limited to, back-up power supplies at the fiber nodes and
head-ends capable of providing power to the system for a minimum of two (2) hours in the
event of an electrical outage, plus adequate portable generators to cover longer outages. The
obligation to provide backup power supplies requires the franchisee to install equipment that
will:
Cut in automatically on failure of commercial utility AC power;
Revert automatically to commercial power when it is restored; and
Prevent the standby power source from powering a "dead" utility line.
In addition, the design and construction of a system shall include

A franchisee shall design its system so that it may be interconnected with any or all other
systems or similar communications systems in the area. Interconnection of systems may be
made by direct cable connection, microwave link, satellite or other appropriate methods.
Upon receiving the directive of the Board of Aldermen to interconnect, the franchisee shall
immediately initiate negotiations with the other affected system or systems so that costs may
be shared proportionately for both construction and operation of the interconnection link.
The Board of Aldermen may in writing grant reasonable extensions of time to interconnect or
rescind its request to interconnect upon its own initiative or upon petition by the franchisee to
the Board of Aldermen. The Board of Aldermen shall rescind the request if it finds that the
franchisee has negotiated in good faith and the cost of interconnection would cause an
unreasonable increase in subscriber rates.
No interconnection shall take place without prior written approval of the Board of Aldermen. A
franchisee seeking approval for interconnection shall demonstrate that all signals to be
interconnected will comply with FCC technical standards for all classes of signals and will
result in no more than a low level of distortion.
The franchisee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation, regional interconnection
authority or State or Federal regulatory agency which may be established for the purpose of
regulating, facilitating, financing or otherwise providing for the interconnection of
communications systems beyond the boundaries of the City.

Performance Evaluation.
A franchise may require specific performance review sessions. The Board of Aldermen may,
at its discretion, hold additional performance evaluation sessions, but not more frequently
than once every three (3) years except as otherwise agreed to by franchisee. All such
evaluation sessions shall be open to the public, and announced in a newspaper of general
circulation. Franchisee shall be notified by mail.
Topics that may be discussed at any evaluation session may include, but are not limited to,
system performance and construction, franchisee compliance with this Chapter and a
franchise agreement, customer service and complaint response, subscriber privacy, services
provided, programming offered, service rate structures, franchise fees, penalties, free or
discounted services, applications of new technologies, judicial and FCC filings, and line
extensions.
During the review and evaluation by the City, a franchisee shall fully cooperate with the City
and shall promptly provide such information and documents as the City may need to
reasonably perform its review.
Voluminous Materials. If any books, records, maps or plans, or other requested documents are too
voluminous, or for security reasons cannot be moved, then a franchisee may request that the
inspection take place at some other location outside the Metropolitan St. Louis area, provided that
the franchisee must pay all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the City in inspecting those
documents or having those documents inspected by its designee. Any payments made by the
franchisee hereunder are not a franchise fee and fall within one (1) or more of the exceptions in 47
U.S.C. Section 542(g)(2).
Retention Of Records — Relation To Privacy Rights. Each franchisee shall take all steps required,
if any, to ensure that it is able to provide the City all information which must be provided or may be
reasonably requested under this Chapter or a franchise agreement, including by providing
appropriate subscriber privacy notices. Nothing in this Section shall be read to require a
franchisee to violate 47 U.S.C. Section 551.
Section 625.080. Consumer Protection and Customer Service
Provisions.
[CC 1979 §7½-8; Ord. No. 95-826 §8, 10-2-1995; Ord. No. 96-883 §1(Exh. A), 8-19-1996]
Telephone And Office Availability.
Each franchisee shall maintain an office at a convenient location to subscribers, not
necessarily within the franchise area, that shall be open during normal business hours to
allow subscribers to request service, pay bills, and conduct other business. Each franchisee
shall perform service calls, installations, and disconnects at least during normal business
hours, provided that a franchisee shall respond to outages twenty-four (24) hours a day,
seven (7) days a week. Outage reports should be addressed within twenty-four (24) hours.
Each franchisee shall establish a publicly listed local toll-free telephone number. The phone
must be answered by customer service representatives at least during normal business hours
for the purpose of receiving requests for service, inquiries, and complaints from subscribers;
after those hours a franchisee shall arrange for the phone to be answered so that customers
can register complaints and report service problems on a twenty-four (24) hour per day, seven
(7) day per week basis, and so that the franchisee can respond to service outages as
required herein.
Under normal operating conditions, telephone answering time shall not exceed thirty (30)
seconds, and the time to transfer the call to a customer service representative (including hold
time) shall not exceed an additional thirty (30) seconds. Under normal operating conditions a

customer will receive a busy signal less than three percent (3%) of the time. These standards
shall be met ninety percent (90%) of the time, measured quarterly. When the business office
is closed, an answering machine or service capable of receiving and recording service
complaints and inquiries shall be employed. The after-hours answering service shall comply
with the same telephone answer time standard set forth in this Section. Upon request by the
City, franchisee shall supply information demonstrating that it is meeting the standards set
forth herein.
A franchisee must hire sufficient staff so that it can adequately respond to customer inquiries,
complaints, and requests for service in its office, over the phone, and at the subscriber's
residence.
Scheduling Work.
All appointments for service, installation, or disconnection shall be specified by date. Each
franchisee shall specify a specific time at which the work shall be done, or offer a choice of
time blocks, which shall not exceed four (4) hours in length, unless the subscriber agrees to a
longer period of time. Franchisee may also, upon request, offer service installation calls
outside normal business hours, for the express convenience of the customer. If at any time an
installer or technician believes it impossible to make a scheduled appointment time, an
attempt to contact the customer will be made prior to the time of appointment and the
appointment rescheduled at a time convenient to the customer.
Subscribers who have experienced two (2) missed appointments due to the fault of a
franchisee shall receive installation free of charge, if the appointment was for installation. If an
installation was to have been provided free of charge, or for other appointments, the
subscriber shall receive a fifty percent (50%) discount on one (1) month of basic cable service
tier or its equivalent not to exceed twenty dollars ($20.00).
With regard to mobility-limited customers, upon subscriber request, each franchisee shall
arrange for pickup and/or replacement of converters or other franchisee equipment at the
subscriber's address or by a satisfactory equivalent (such as the provision of a postageprepaid
mailer).
Under normal operating conditions, requests for service, repair, and maintenance must be
acknowledged by a trained customer service representative within twenty-four (24) hours, or
prior to the end of the next business day, whichever is earlier. A franchisee shall respond to all
other inquiries (including billing inquiries) within five (5) business days of the inquiry or
complaint.
Under normal operating conditions, installations made within one hundred twenty-five (125)
feet of the existing distribution system shall be completed within seven (7) business days after
the order is placed. Repairs and maintenance for service interruptions and other customer
location repairs must be completed within twenty-four (24) hours, or if it is not possible to
complete such work within twenty-four (24) hours, then work must be commenced within such
time period and be diligently continued thereafter until completed. Work on all other requests
for service on franchisee's facilities must be begun by the next business day after notification
of the problem, and must be completed within three (3) days from the date of the initial
request, except installation requests, provided that a franchisee shall complete the work in the
shortest time possible where, for reasons beyond the franchisee's control, the work could not
be completed in those time periods even with the exercise of all due diligence; the failure of a
franchisee to hire sufficient staff or to properly train its staff' shall not justify a franchisee's
failure to comply with this provision. Except as Federal law permits, no charge shall be made
to the subscriber for this service, unless required due to damage caused by a subscriber.
Franchisee shall not cancel a service or installation appointment with a customer after the
close of business on the business day preceding the appointment.

notice of any significant changes in the information required to be provided by this Section.
Such notice shall be in writing and by announcement on the system. Franchisee may provide
notice of service and rate changes to subscribers using any reasonable written means at its
sole discretion. Franchisee need not provide prior notice of any rate change that is the result
of a regulatory fee, franchise fee, or any other fee, tax, assessment or charge of any kind
imposed by any Federal agency, State, or franchising authority on the transaction between
the franchisee and the subscriber.
All franchisee promotional materials, announcements, and advertising of residential cable
service to subscribers and the general public, where price information is listed in any manner,
shall clearly and accurately disclose price terms. In the case of pay-per-view or pay-per-event
programming, all promotional materials must clearly and accurately disclose price terms and
in the case of telephone orders, a franchisee shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the
customer service representatives clearly and accurately disclose price terms to potential
customers in advance of taking the order.
Each franchisee shall maintain a public file containing all notices provided to subscribers
under these customer service standards, as well as all written promotional offers made to
subscribers.

for good cause and for the shortest time possible and, except in emergency situations, only after a
minimum of forty-eight (48) hours prior notice to subscribers and the City of the anticipated service
interruption; provided, however, that planned maintenance that occurs between the hours of 12:00
Midnight and 6:00 A.M. shall not require such notice to subscribers, so long as notice to the City is
given no less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to such an anticipated service interruption.

A franchisee's billing statement must be clear, concise and understandable, must itemize
each category of service and equipment provided to the subscriber and must state clearly the
charge therefor. A franchisee's billing statement must comport with applicable State and
Federal law.
A franchisee's billing statement must show a specific payment due date not earlier than the
fifteenth (15th) day of the month (or equivalent period) in which the service being billed is
rendered. Any balance net received within fifteen (15) days after the due date may be
assessed a reasonable processing charge based on costs and/or a late fee. Late fees shall
not exceed three-fourths of one percent (0.75%) per month.
A franchisee must notify the subscriber that he/she can remit payment in person at the
franchisee's office(s) and inform the subscriber of the address of the office(s).
Subscribers shall not be charged a processing fee or late fee or be otherwise penalized for
any failure by a franchisee, including failure to timely or correctly bill the subscriber, or failure
to properly credit the subscriber for a payment timely made.
On request, the account of any subscriber shall be credited a prorated share of the monthly
charge for the service if said subscriber is without service or if service is substantially
impaired for any reason for a period exceeding four (4) hours during any twenty-four (24) hour
period, except where it can be documented that a subscriber seeks a refund for an outage or
impairment which that subscriber caused, or in the case of a planned outage occurring
between the hours of 12:00 Midnight and 6:00 A.M. of which the City received the required
prior notice.
Franchisee shall respond to all written billing complaints from subscribers within thirty (30)
days.

The subscriber's next billing cycle following resolution of the refund request;
The date of return of all equipment to franchisee, if service has been terminated.
Credits for service shall be issued no later than the subscriber's next billing cycle after the
determination that the credit is warranted.
Disconnection/Downgrades.
A subscriber may terminate service at any time.
A franchisee shall promptly disconnect or downgrade any subscriber who so requests by
giving at least one (1) day's notice and reasonably cooperating with the franchisee regarding
the removal of the franchisee's equipment from the subscriber's location. No charge may be
imposed for any voluntary disconnection, and downgrade charges must comply with the
requirements of Federal law. No charge may be imposed by any franchisee for any cable
service delivered after the requested date of disconnection.
A subscriber may be asked, but not required, to disconnect a franchisee's equipment and
return it to the nearest business office.
Any security deposit and/or other funds due the subscriber shall be refunded on disconnected
accounts after the equipment has been recovered by the franchisee. The refund process shall
take a maximum of thirty (30) days, from the date disconnection was requested to the date
the customer receives the refund.
If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber or other fee or charge, a franchisee may
disconnect the subscriber's service outlet; however, such disconnection shall not be effected

until after thirty (30) days from the due date. If the subscriber pays all amounts due, including
late charges, before the date scheduled for disconnection, the franchisee shall not disconnect
service. After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all fees or charges due,
including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, and any reasonable security
deposit, the franchisee shall promptly reinstate service on request.
A franchisee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if the subscriber is damaging or
destroying the franchisee's cable system or equipment. After disconnection, the franchisee
shall restore service after the subscriber provides adequate assurance that it has ceased the
practices that led to disconnection, and paid all proper fees and charges, including any
reconnect fees and amounts owed the franchisee for damage to its cable system or
equipment and any reasonable security deposit.
A franchisee may also disconnect a subscriber that causes signal leakage in excess of
Federal limits. It may do so without notice, provided that the franchisee shall immediately
notify the subscriber of the problem and, once the problem is corrected, reconnect the
subscriber.
Except as Federal law may otherwise provide, a franchisee may remove its property from a
subscriber's premises within sixty (60) days of the termination of service, voluntarily or
involuntarily. If a franchisee fails to remove its property in that period, the property shall be
deemed abandoned.
Changes In Service.
Before a franchisee unilaterally alters the service it provides to a class of subscribers, it must
provide the City and each affected subscriber thirty (30) days' written notice by any
reasonable means at its sole discretion, explain the substance and full effect of the alteration,
and provide the subscriber the right within the thirty-day period following notice to opt to
receive any combination of services offered by franchisee. Except as Federal law otherwise
provides, subscribers may not be required to pay any charge (other than the regular service
fee), including an upgrade or downgrade charge, in order to receive the services selected. No
charge may be made for any service or product that the subscriber has not affirmatively
indicated it wishes to receive. Payment of the regular monthly bill does not in and of itself
constitute such an affirmative indication.
If a franchisee plans to provide a premium channel without charge to subscribers who do not
subscribe to such premium channel, the franchisee shall, not later than thirty (30) days before
such premium channel is provided without charge, notify all subscribers in writing by any
reasonable means at its sole discretion of its plans including the time period involved, notify
all subscribers they have a right to request that the premium channel be blocked, and block
the premium channel upon the request of a subscriber. For purposes of this Section, the
phrase "premium channel" shall mean any pay service offered on a per program basis which
offers movies rated by the Motion Picture Association of America as X, NC-17, or R.
Deposits. A franchisee may require a reasonable, non-discriminatory deposit on equipment
provided to subscribers. Deposits shall be placed in an interest-bearing account, and the
franchisee shall return the deposit upon return of the equipment, plus interest earned to the date
repayment is made to the subscriber, less any deduction for damages to the equipment or unpaid
charges.
Subscriber Control. A franchisee shall comply with all applicable laws regarding subscriber ability
to block audio and/or video signals.

The City reserves the right to regulate service and equipment rates to the maximum degree permitted

Section 625.100. Franchise Fee.
[CC 1979 §7½-10; Ord. No. 95-826 §10, 10-2-1995; Ord. No. 96-883 §1(Exh. A), 8-19-1996]
Requirement. A franchisee and any other person providing cable service over a cable system shall
pay the City franchise fees, which may be passed on to subscribers as provided by law. Every
franchise agreement shall specify the amounts a franchisee is initially required to pay as a
percentage of gross revenues, but if the specified amount is less than the maximum or if the
maximum amount permitted increases, the City may increase it to any amount up to the maximum
allowed by law after ninety (90) days notice to the franchisee, so long as the increase may by law
be passed on to subscribers.
Not A Tax Or In Lieu Of Any Other Tax Or Fee.
The franchise fee is not a tax, license or fee subject to any requirement of voter approval, but
rather is a rental charge for special and individualized use of public property.
The franchise fee is in addition to all other fees and all taxes and payments that a franchisee
or other person may be required to pay under any Federal, State or local law, including any
applicable property and amusement taxes, except to the extent that such fees, taxes, or
assessments are a franchise fee under 47 U.S.C. Section 542.
Payments.
The franchise fees and any other costs or penalties assessed by the City against a franchisee
or any other person shall be paid quarterly to the City and shall commence as of the effective
date of a franchise. The City shall be furnished at the time of each payment with a statement
certified by the franchisee's or other person's respective financial representative or an
independent certified public accountant reflecting the total amount of gross revenues for the
payment period. Payments shall be made to the City no later than forty-five (45) days
following the end of each calendar quarter.
In the event any franchise fee or other payment is not made on or before the date specified
herein, the franchisee and any other person shall pay interest charges computed from such
due date, at an annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the City's primary
depository bank during the period such unpaid amount is owed, plus two percent (2%) of the
amount due to defray the City's additional expenses by reason of the delinquency.
No Accord Or Satisfaction. No acceptance of any payment by the City shall be construed as a
release or an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums
payable as franchise fees under this Chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of a
franchisee or other person.
Audit.
The City shall have the right to inspect all reasonably necessary records and the right to audit
and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this Chapter. The franchisee
shall be responsible for providing the records to the City at an office located within the
Metropolitan St. Louis area. Such records shall be maintained for at least five (5) years. The
City's audit expenses shall be borne by the franchisee if the franchise fees paid during the
audit period are less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the amount owed according to the
audit. Any additional amounts due to the City as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty

(30) days following written notice to the franchisee by the City of the underpayment, which
notice shall include a copy of the audit report or within thirty (30) days following resolution of
any dispute regarding such notice, whichever is later. If recomputation results in additional
revenue to be paid to the City, such amount shall be subject to interest as specified in Section
625.100(D)(2). All costs incurred by a franchisee hereunder are not franchise fees, and fall
within one (1) or more of the exceptions set forth in 47 U.S.C. Section 542(g)(2) and shall not
be passed on to the subscribers in any form.
A franchisee shall maintain its fiscal and financial records and have all relevant fiscal and
financial records maintained by others on its behalf in such a manner as to enable the City to
determine the cost of assets of the franchisee which are used in providing services within the
City and to determine gross revenues.
A franchisee shall report on a quarterly basis to the City Clerk the name and address of each
and every person providing telecommunications and other communications services over the
cable system for which charges are assessed to subscribers but not received by the
franchisee, as well as all such services being provided by the franchisee in addition to cable
services unless franchisee already has a separate written franchise or license from the City to
provide such services.
Section 625.110. Insurance — Surety — Indemnification.
[CC 1979 §7½-11; Ord. No. 95-826 §11, 10-2-1995]

the State of Missouri, with a B+7 or better rating of insurance by Best's Key Rating Guide,

franchisee shall keep on file with the City certificates of insurance.
Additional Insureds — Prior Notice Of Policy Cancellation. All general liability insurance policies
shall name the City, its officers, boards, board members, commissions, commissioners, agents,
and employees as additional insureds and shall further provide that any cancellation or reduction
in coverage shall not be effective unless thirty (30) days' prior written notice thereof has been
given to the City Clerk. A franchisee shall not cancel any required insurance policy without

Failure Constitutes Material Violation. Failure to comply with the insurance requirements set forth
in this Section shall constitute a material violation of a franchise.
Indemnification.
A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the
City, its officials, boards, board members, commissions, commissioners, agents, and
employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, and judgments
for damages or equitable relief arising out of the construction, maintenance, or operation of its
cable system; copyright infringements or a failure by the franchisee to secure consents from
the owners, authorized distributors, or licensees of programs to be delivered by the cable
system; the conduct of the franchisee's business in the City; or in any way arising out of the
granting of a franchise or a franchisee's enjoyment or exercise of a franchise granted
hereunder, regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or
prohibited by this Chapter or a franchise agreement.
Specifically, but not by way of limitation on the scope of Subsection (1) above, a franchisee
shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City, and in
their capacity as such, the officers, agents, and employees thereof, from and against any and
all claims, suits, actions, liability, and judgments for damages or otherwise subject to Section
638 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 558, arising out of or alleged to arise out of the
installation, construction, operation, or maintenance of its system, including but not limited to
any claim against the franchisee for invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person,
or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trade mark, trade name, service mark, or
patent, or of any other similar right of any person. This indemnity does not apply to
programming carried on any channel set aside for public, educational, or government use, or
channels leased pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 532, unless the franchisee was in any respect
engaged in determining the editorial content of the program, or prescreened the programming
for the purported purpose of banning or regulating indecent or obscene programming.
The indemnity provision includes, but is not limited to, the City's reasonable attorneys' fees
incurred in defending against any such claim, suit, or proceeding prior to franchisee assuming
such defense. The City shall notify a franchisee of claims and suits as soon as practicable,
but failure to give such notice shall not relieve a franchisee of its obligations hereunder. Once
a franchisee assumes such defense, the City may at its option continue to participate in the
defense at its own expense.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Chapter, the City shall not be so
indemnified or reimbursed in relation to any amounts attributable to the City's own negligence,
willful misconduct, intentional or criminal acts, including in the performance of its obligations
under this Chapter or a franchise agreement.
Section 625.120. Performance Guarantees and Remedies.
[CC 1979 §7½-12; Ord. No. 95-826 §12, 10-2-1995]
Security Fund.
Prior to a franchise becoming effective and on each anniversary date thereafter during the
franchise term including the date of termination, the franchisee shall post with the City Clerk
sufficient funds to serve as a cash security deposit to be used as a security fund to ensure the
franchisee's faithful performance of and compliance with all provisions of this Chapter, the
franchise agreement, and other applicable law, and compliance with all orders, permits, and
directions of the City, and the payment by the franchisee of any claims, liens, fees, or taxes
due the City which arise by reason of the construction, operation, or maintenance of the
system. The amount of the security fund on deposit shall be equal to three percent (3%) of
3/5/2020 City of Manchester, MO Ecode360

the franchisee's projected annual gross revenues for the upcoming year, or in the instance of
the final deposit, three percent (3%) of the actual gross revenues for the preceding year.
In lieu of a cash security fund, a franchisee may file and maintain with the City Clerk an
irrevocable letter of credit with a surety acceptable to the City in the amount specified in the
preceding paragraph to serve the same purposes as set forth therein. Said letter of credit
shall remain in effect for the full term of the franchise plus an additional six (6) months
thereafter, or longer if there is any outstanding obligation or default on the part of the
franchisee, as determined by the Board of Aldermen. The franchisee and its surety shall be
jointly and severally liable under the terms of the letter of credit for the franchisee's failure to
ensure its faithful performance of and compliance with all provisions of this Chapter, the
franchise agreement, and other applicable law, and compliance with all orders, permits, and
directions of the City, and the payment by the franchisee of any claims, liens, fees, or taxes
due the City which arise by reason of the construction, operation, or maintenance of the
system. The letter of credit shall provide for thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the City of
any intention on the part of the franchisee to cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise materially alter
its terms. Neither the filing of a letter of credit with the City, nor the receipt of any changes
recovered by the City thereunder, shall be construed to excuse unfaithful performance by the
franchisee or limit the liability of the franchisee under the term of its franchise for damages,
either to the full amount of the letter of credit or otherwise.
The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other
rights of the City, whether reserved by this Chapter or authorized by other law or a franchise
agreement, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund
or letter of credit will affect any other right the City may have.
The following procedures shall apply to drawing on the security fund and letter of credit:
If the franchisee fails to make timely payment to the City of any amount due as a result of
a franchise, fails to make timely payment to the City of any amounts due under a
franchise agreement or applicable law, fails to make timely payment to the City of any
taxes due, or fails to compensate the City within ten (10) days of written notification that
such compensation is due for any damages, costs, or expenses the City suffers or incurs
by reason of any act or omission of the franchisee in connection with its franchise
agreement or the enforcement of its franchise agreement, the City may withdraw the
amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, from the security fund or from funds
available under the letter of credit.
Within three (3) days of a withdrawal from the security fund or under the letter of credit,
the City shall mail, by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of the
amount, date, and purpose of such withdrawal to the franchisee.
If at the time of a withdrawal from the security fund and under the letter of credit by the
City, the amounts available are insufficient to provide the total payment towards which the
withdrawal is directed, the balance of such payment shall continue as the obligation of
the franchisee to the City until it is paid.
No later than thirty (30) days after mailing of notification to the franchisee by certified
mail, return receipt requested, of a withdrawal under the security fund or letter of credit,
the franchisee shall deliver to the City for deposit in the security fund an amount equal to
the amount so withdrawn or shall restore the letter of credit. Failure to make timely
delivery of such amount to the City or to restore the letter of credit shall constitute a
material violation of the franchise.
Upon termination of the franchise under conditions other than those stipulating forfeiture
of the security fund, the balance then remaining in the security fund shall be withdrawn
by the City and paid to the franchisee within six (6) months of such termination, provided
that there is then no outstanding obligation or default on the part of the franchisee.

In addition to or in lieu of a security fund or letter of credit, a franchise may require such
guarantees as the City deems to be in the public interest.
Performance Bond.
Prior to any cable system construction, upgrade, or other such work in the public rights-ofway,
a franchisee shall establish in the City's favor a performance bond to ensure the
franchisee's faithful performance of the construction, upgrade, or other work. The amount of
such performance bond shall be equal to ten percent (10%) of the total cost of the work
unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement.
In the event a franchisee subject to such a performance bond fails to complete the cable
system construction, upgrade, or other work in the public rights-of-way in a safe, timely, and
competent manner, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, there shall be
recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or
loss suffered by the City as a result, including the full amount of any compensation,
indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the franchisee, or the
cost of completing or repairing the system construction, upgrade, or other work in the public
rights-of-way, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the
bond. The City may also recover against the bond any amount recoverable against a security
fund where such amount exceeds that available under a security fund.
Upon completion of the system construction, upgrade, or other such work in the public rightsof-
way and payment of all construction obligations of the cable system to the satisfaction of
the Board of Aldermen, the Board of Aldermen shall eliminate the bond after a time
appropriate to determine whether the work performed was satisfactory, which time shall be
established considering the nature of the work performed.
The performance bond shall be issued by a surety with a B+7 or better rating of insurance in
Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition; shall be subject to the approval of the
City Attorney; and shall contain the following endorsement:
"This bond may not be cancelled, or allowed to lapse until sixty (60) days after receipt by the
City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond
of intent to cancel or not to renew."
Failure Constitutes Material Violation. Failure to maintain a required security fund, letter of credit,
or performance bond shall constitute a material violation of a franchise.
Remedies. In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity, the City may apply any one
(1) or a combination of the following remedies in the event a franchisee violates this Chapter, its
franchise agreement, other applicable ordinances, or applicable State or Federal law:
Revoke the franchise or shorten the term pursuant to the procedures specified in this Chapter.
Impose penalties available under Section 625.120(H) and other applicable State and local
laws for violation of City ordinances.
In addition to or instead of any other remedy, seek legal or equitable relief from any court of
competent jurisdiction.
Apply any remedy provided for in a franchise agreement, including enforcing provisions, if
any.
Shortening, Revocation Or Termination Of Franchise.
The City shall have the right to shorten the term of a franchise to a term not less than thirtyone
(31) months from the date of the action shortening the franchise term, or to revoke the
franchise, for a franchisee's substantial and ongoing failure to construct, operate, or maintain

the cable system as required by this Chapter or a franchise agreement; for defrauding or
attempting to defraud the City or subscribers; if the franchisee is declared bankrupt; or for any
other substantial and ongoing material violation of this Chapter or substantial and ongoing
material violation of a franchise agreement. To invoke the provisions of this Section, the Board
of Aldermen shall give the franchisee written notice of such intent. If within thirty (30) calendar
days following such written notice from the City to the franchisee, the franchisee has not
completed corrective action or corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously
pursued to the satisfaction of the Board of Aldermen, the Board of Aldermen may give written
notice to the franchisee of its decision to commence a proceeding to consider shortening the
term of or revoking the franchise, stating its reasons; provided that no opportunity to cure
shall be afforded in the event the franchisee is declared bankrupt. Revocation for bankruptcy
shall be governed by Section 625.120(E)(3).
Prior to shortening the term or revoking a franchise, the Board of Aldermen shall hold a public
hearing, after giving at least fifteen (15) calendar days' notice by posting and publication, at
which time the franchisee and the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Following
the public hearing, the Board of Aldermen may determine whether to shorten the franchise
term or to revoke the franchise based on the information presented at the hearing, and other
information of record. If the Board of Aldermen determines to shorten a franchise term or
revoke a franchise, it shall make such decision by ordinance setting forth the reasons for its
decision. The City may make such decision conditional on a franchisee's failure to resolve
outstanding problems or take appropriate steps to resolve such problems within a specific
period of time. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the franchisee.
Any franchise may, at the option of the Board of Aldermen following a public hearing, be
revoked by ordinance one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after an assignment for the
benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the
franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit
of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that one hundred twenty (120) day
period:
Such assignment, receivership, or trusteeship has been vacated; or
Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of
this Chapter and the existing franchise agreement and has executed an agreement,
approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the
terms and conditions of this Chapter and the existing franchise agreement.
In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of a material portion of the facilities,
equipment, or property of a franchisee (other than pursuant to a pledge or mortgage
which qualified as a exception to the definition of a "franchise transfer" and after which
the franchise transfer was ultimately approved), the Board of Aldermen may revoke the
franchise, following a public hearing before the Board of Aldermen, by serving notice on
the franchisee and the successful bidder, in which event the franchise and all rights and
privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate thirty (30) calendar days
after serving such notice, unless:
The Board of Aldermen has approved the franchise transfer; and
The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the City to assume and be
bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and this Chapter.
If the Board of Aldermen revokes a franchise, if a franchise expires, or if for any other reason
a franchisee abandons, terminates, or fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers
after notice and reasonable opportunity to cure of at least thirty (30) days, the following
procedures and rights are effective:
3/5/2020 City of Manchester, MO Ecode360

The Board of Aldermen may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities and
equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so
within a reasonable period of time, the Board of Aldermen may have the removal done at
the former franchisee's or surety's expense. In removing its plant, structures, and
equipment, the franchisee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be
made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good condition as prevailed
prior to the franchisee's removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting the
electrical or telephone cable wires, or attachments. The City shall inspect and approve
the condition of the public ways and public places, and cables, wires, attachments and
poles after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance as provided herein shall
continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by
the franchisee with the terms and conditions of this paragraph and this Chapter. In the
event of a failure by the franchisee to complete any such work or any other work required
by City law or ordinance within the time as may be established and to the reasonable
satisfaction of the City, the City may cause such work to be done and the franchisee shall
reimburse the City the reasonable cost thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of an
itemized list of such costs.
At the expiration of the term for which any franchise is granted (if renewal is either not
sought or denied) the City, at its election, shall have the right to purchase and take over
all or any part of a cable system located within the City upon the payment to the
franchisee of a sum equal to the fair market value of the system or the part taken (based
on system value as a going concern). In the event of revocation, as provided for in this
Chapter, the City at its election, shall have the right to purchase and take over all or any
part of a cable system located within the City upon payment to franchisee of a sum equal
to an equitable price for the system or the part taken. If the City elects to purchase only a
part of the system, the fair market value shall include both the fair market value of the
part purchased together with the diminution in value of the part not purchased. The price
for the cable system or the part taken, shall not include, and the franchisee shall not
receive, anything for the value allocated to the franchise itself unless such valuation is
now or subsequently provided for by the Cable Act or in the franchise itself. Upon the
exercise of the option by the City and its service of an official notice of such action upon
the franchisee, the franchisee shall immediately transfer to the City possession and title
to all of the purchased facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable system, with
any existing liens and encumbrances (provided the City can require application of
purchase price to such liens and encumbrances at closing); and the franchisee shall
execute such warranty deeds or other instruments of conveyance to the City as shall be
reasonably necessary for this purpose. Each contract entered into by franchisee with
reference to its operations under the franchise shall be subject to the exercise of this
option by the City.
If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee during the franchise term, or if the
franchisee fails to operate its system in accordance with this Chapter during any
transition period, or the franchisee otherwise terminates the franchise, upon decision of
the Board of Aldermen made after providing the franchisee reasonable notice of at least
thirty (30) days and an opportunity to be heard, the ownership of all portions of the cable
system in public rights-of-way shall revert to the City and the City may sell, assign, or
transfer all or part of the assets of the system, or the Board of Aldermen, at its option,
may operate the system, designate another entity to operate the system temporarily until
the franchisee restores service under conditions acceptable to the City or until the
franchise is revoked and a new franchisee selected by the City is providing service, seek
an injunction requiring the franchisee to continue operations, and/or seek to recover all
damages sustained as a result of such abandonment or failure to operate. A franchisee
retains all rights to contest such actions and all rights to compensation provided by law. A
franchisee shall be deemed to have abandoned its system, or failed to operate its system
during any transition period, if:

The franchisee fails to provide cable service in accordance with its franchise over a
substantial portion of the cable system for ninety-six (96) consecutive hours, unless
the Board of Aldermen authorizes a longer interruption of service in writing; or
The franchisee, for any period, willfully and without cause refuses to provide cable
service in accordance with its franchise over a substantial portion of the cable
system.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, where the City has issued a franchise
requiring the completion of construction, system upgrade, or other specific obligation by a
specified date, failure of the franchisee to complete such construction or upgrade, or to
comply with such other specific obligations as may be required, within such time limits, as
same shall be extended by the Board of Aldermen for good cause shown by the franchisee,
will result in the forfeiture of the franchise upon decision of the Board of Aldermen made after
providing the franchisee with reasonable notice of at least thirty (30) days and an opportunity
to be heard.
Remedies Cumulative. All remedies under this Chapter and the franchise agreement are
cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one (1) remedy shall not foreclose
use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of penalties relieve a franchisee
of its obligations to comply with its franchise. Remedies may be used alone or in combination as
permitted by law; in addition, the City may exercise any rights it has at law or equity.
Relation To Insurance And Indemnity Requirements. Recovery by the City of any amounts under
insurance, a performance bond, a security fund or letter of credit, or otherwise does not limit a
franchisee's duty to indemnify the City in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a franchisee of
its obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts owed to the City, or in any respect prevent the
City from exercising any other right or remedy it may have.
Penalties. For violation of provisions of this Chapter, subject to judicial procedures, penalties shall
be chargeable to the franchisee as follows:
For purportedly transferring the franchise without approval: five hundred dollars ($500.00) per
day for each violation for each day the violation continues;
For violation of customer service standards: one hundred dollars ($100.00) per violation for
each day the violation continues; and
For all other material violations for which actual damages may not be ascertainable: five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for each violation for each day the violation continues.

Discriminatory Practices Prohibited.
A franchisee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against
subscribers, users, programmers, or residents or businesses in the City on the basis of race,
color, religion, national origin, sex or age.
A franchisee shall not unreasonably discriminate among similarly situated persons or take any
retaliatory action against a person because of that person's exercise of any right it may have
under Federal, State or local law, nor may the franchisee require a person to waive such
rights as a condition of providing service.

A franchisee shall not deny access to cable service or levy different rates and charges on any
group of potential residential cable subscribers because of the income of the residents of the
local area in which such group resides.
A franchisee is prohibited from unreasonably discriminating in its rates or charges or from
granting undue preferences to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or
potential subscribers; provided, however, that a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide
promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts
are offered on a non-discriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the City;
and a franchisee may offer reasonable discounts for senior citizens or the economically
disadvantaged, discounts or customer specific pricing for bulk rate customers, and such other
discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide under Federal law, if such discounts are applied
in a uniform and consistent manner. A franchisee shall comply at all times with all applicable
Federal, State and City laws, and all executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination.
Equal Employment Opportunity. A franchisee shall not refuse to employ, discharge from
employment, or discriminate against any person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or
privileges of employment because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or age. A franchisee
shall comply with all Federal, State and local laws and regulations governing equal employment
opportunities, as the same may be from time to time amended, including but not limited to 47
U.S.C. Section 554.
Subscriber Privacy. A franchisee shall at all times abide by and protect the privacy of all
subscribers pursuant to the provisions of Section 631 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 551. A

have under applicable law, including but not limited to 47 U.S.C. Section 555(a), a franchisee shall
have no recourse whatsoever against the City or its officials, members, boards, commissions,
agents or employees for any loss, costs, expense, liability, or damage arising out of any action
undertaken or not undertaken pursuant to a franchise agreement or any provision or requirement
of this Chapter or because of the enforcement of this Chapter or the City's exercise of its authority

The City hereby reserves to itself the right to intervene in any suit, action or proceeding
involving any provision of this Chapter.
Specific mention of the materiality of any of the provisions herein is not intended to be
exclusive of any others for the purpose of determining whether any failure of compliance
hereunder is material and substantial.
No franchisee shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this
Chapter by reason of any failure of the City to enforce prompt compliance. Nor shall any
inaction by the City be deemed to waive a provision or render void any provision of this
Chapter.
Incorporation By Reference. Any franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter shall by implication
include a provision which shall incorporate by reference this Chapter into such franchise as fully
as if copied therein verbatim.
Force Majeure. A franchisee shall not be deemed in default of provisions of its franchise where
performance was hindered by war or riots, civil disturbances, floods, or other natural catastrophes
beyond the franchisee's control or work delays caused by waiting for utility providers (including

attached, and a franchise shall not be revoked or a franchisee penalized for such non-compliance,

the health, safety, and integrity of the public, public rights-of-way, public property, or private

converters, inside wire, and other similar equipment, subject to market availability, and a
franchisee shall provide information to subscribers which will allow them to adjust such
devices so that they may be used with the franchisee's system.
A franchisee shall not, as a condition of providing service, require a subscriber or potential
subscriber to remove any existing antenna, or disconnect an antenna except at the express
direction of the subscriber or potential subscriber, or prohibit or discourage a subscriber from
installing an antenna switch, provided that such equipment and installations are consistent
with applicable codes.

As required by Section 67.2692, RSMo., this Subsection (D) shall be enforced only as follows:
Each video service provider shall implement an informal process for handling inquiries
from the City and customers concerning billing issues, service issues and other
complaints. If an issue is not resolved through this informal process, the City may request
a confidential non-binding mediation with the video service provider, with the costs of
such mediation to be shared equally between the City and the video service provider.
In the case of repeated, willful and material violations of the provisions of this Section by
a video service provider, the City may file a complaint on behalf of a resident harmed by
such violations with Missouri's Administrative Hearing Commission seeking an order
revoking the video service provider's Public Service Commission authorization. The City
or a video service provider may appeal any determination made by the Administrative
Hearing Commission under this Section to a court of competent jurisdiction, which shall
have the power to review the decision de novo. The City shall not file a complaint seeking
revocation unless the video service provider has been given sixty (60) days' notice to
cure alleged breaches but has failed to do so.

Any PEG channel that is not substantially utilized by the City may be reclaimed and
programmed by the video service provider at the provider's discretion. If the City finds and
certifies that a channel that has been reclaimed by a video service provider will be
substantially utilized, the video service provider shall restore the reclaimed channel within one
hundred twenty (120) days. A PEG channel shall be considered "substantially utilized" when
forty (40) hours per week are locally programmed on that channel for at least three (3)
consecutive months. In determining whether a PEG channel is substantially utilized, a
program may be counted not more than four (4) times during a calendar week.
The operation of any PEG access channel and the production of any programming that
appears on each such channel shall be the sole responsibility of the City or its duly appointed
agent receiving the benefit of such channel, and the video service provider shall bear only the
responsibility for the transmission of the programming on each such channel to subscribers.
The City must deliver and submit to the video service provider all transmissions of PEG
content and programming in a manner or form that is capable of being accepted and
transmitted by such video service provider holder over its network without further alteration or
change in the content or transmission signal. Such content and programming must be
compatible with the technology or protocol utilized by the video service provider to deliver its
video services. The video service provider shall cooperate with the City to allow the City to
achieve such compatibility.
The City shall make the programming of any PEG access channel available to all video
service providers in a non-discriminatory manner. Each video service provider shall be
responsible for providing the connectivity to the City's or its duly appointed agent's PEG
access channel distribution points existing as of August 27, 2007. Where technically
necessary and feasible, video service providers shall use reasonable efforts and shall
negotiate in good faith to interconnect their video service networks on mutually acceptable
rates, terms and conditions for the purpose of transmitting PEG programming. A video service
provider shall have no obligation to provide such interconnection to a new video service
provider at more than one (1) point per headend, regardless of the number of political
subdivisions served by such headend. The video service provider requesting interconnection
shall be responsible for any costs associated with such interconnection, including signal
transmission from the origination point to the point of interconnection. Interconnection may be
accomplished by direct cable microwave link, satellite or other reasonable method of
connection acceptable to the person providing the interconnect.
The franchise obligation of an incumbent cable operator to provide monetary and other
support for PEG access facilities existing on August 27, 2007 shall continue until the date of
franchise expiration (ignoring any termination by notice of issuance of a video service
authorization) or January 1, 2012, whichever is earlier. Any other video service provider shall
have the same obligation to support PEG access facilities as the incumbent cable operator,
but if there is more than one (1) incumbent, then the incumbent with the most subscribers as
of August 27, 2007. Such obligation shall be prorated, depending on the nature of the
obligation, as provided in Section 67.2703.8, RSMo. The City shall notify each video service
provider of the amount of such fee on an annual basis, beginning one (1) year after issuance
of the video service authorization.
A video service provider may identify and pass through as a separate line item on
subscribers' bills the value of monetary and other PEG access support on a proportionate
basis.
Compliance With Other Regulations. All video service providers shall comply with the right-of-way
use and zoning regulations established in Sections 626.030 and 626.040 of this Chapter and with
all other applicable laws and regulations.

ROW Permits.
Application requirements.
Any person desiring to perform ROW work must first apply for and obtain a ROW permit,
in addition to any other building permit, license, easement, franchise or authorization
required by law. In the event of a need for emergency ROW work, the person conducting
the work shall as soon as practicable notify the City of the location of the work and shall
apply for the required ROW permit as soon as practicable following the commencement
of the work, not to exceed the third (3rd) business day thereafter. The Director may
design and issue general permits for emergency ROW work for several different locations
or throughout the City.
An application for a ROW permit shall be submitted to the Director. The Director may
design and make available standard forms for such applications, requiring such
information as allowed by law and as the Director determines in his or her discretion to
be necessary and consistent with the provisions of this Chapter and to accomplish the
purposes of this Chapter. Each application shall at minimum contain the following
information for the proposed ROW work, unless otherwise waived by the Director:

nature, dimensions, location and description of the applicant's proposed work or
facilities, their proximity to other facilities that may be affected by the proposed work
and the number of street crossings and their locations and dimensions, if applicable;
Projected commencement and termination dates and anticipated duration of the
work or, if such dates are unknown, a representation that the applicant shall provide
the Director with reasonable advance notice of such dates once they are
determined;
Copies of any required certificates of insurance or performance and maintenance
bonds.
The information required by the application may be submitted in the form maintained by
the applicant, provided it is responsive to the application's requirements and the applicant
shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time to complete the application based on the
amount of data or information requested or required.
Each such application shall be accompanied by the following payments:
An application fee approved by the City to cover the cost of processing the
application;
Any other amounts due to the City from the applicant including, but not limited to,
prior delinquent fees, costs and any loss, damage or expense suffered by the City
because of the applicant's prior work in the rights-of-way or for any emergency
actions taken by the City, but the Director may modify this requirement to the extent
the Director determines any such fees to be in good faith dispute.
Applicants shall participate in any joint planning, construction and advance notification of
such work, including coordination and consolidation of any excavation of or disturbance
to the rights-of-way, as directed by the Director. When deemed necessary to accomplish
the goals of this Section and to the extent permitted by law, the City reserves the right,
when feasible and reasonable, to require the sharing of facilities by ROW users.
Applicants shall cooperate with each other and other ROW users and the City for the
best, most efficient, least intrusive, most aesthetic and least obtrusive use of the rightsof-
way.
The Director shall establish procedures allowing applicants to ascertain whether existing
capacity may be available from other persons utilizing the rights-of-way along the
intended path of any proposed work. The Director shall also maintain indexes of all ROW
permits issued, both by the ROW user and by the affected rights-of-way.
Application review and determination.
The Director shall promptly review each completed application for a ROW permit and
shall grant or deny all such applications as provided herein within thirty-one (31) days of

Has paid the appropriate fees; and
Is in full compliance with this Chapter and all other City ordinances. The Director
may establish procedures for bulk processing of applications and periodic payment
of fees to avoid excessive processing and accounting costs.
It is the intention of the City that interference with, damage to, excavation or disruption of,
or the placement of facilities within, the City's rights-of-way should be minimized and

limited in scope to the extent allowed by law to achieve the purposes of this Chapter.
When reasonable and necessary to accomplish such purposes, the Director may require
as alternatives to the proposed ROW work either less disruptive methods or different
locations for facilities, provided that any required alternative:
Shall not increase expenses by more than ten percent (10%) of the applicant's costs
for the work as proposed;
Shall not result in a decline of service quality; and
Shall be competitively neutral and non-discriminatory. The Director shall justify to the
applicant that the required alternative is reasonable and necessary.
Upon receipt of an application, the Director shall determine whether any portion of the
rights-of-way will be affected by the proposed work and whether the interference,
disruption or placement of facilities will be more than minor in nature. In determining
whether the proposed work is more than minor in nature, the Director shall consider the
nature and scope of the work, its location and duration and its effect on the rights-of-way,
the use thereof and neighboring properties.
If the applicant can show to the Director's reasonable satisfaction that the work
involves no interference, disruption, excavation or damage to, or only minor
interference with, the rights-of-way, or that the work does not involve the placement
of facilities or involves time-sensitive maintenance, then the Director shall promptly
grant the ROW permit.
If the Director determines that the effect on the rights-of-way will be more than minor
in nature and no exemption under the above paragraph (c)(1) or any other provision
of this Chapter applies, the Director shall schedule and coordinate the work and
grant the ROW permit accordingly. When reasonable and necessary to accomplish
the purposes of this Chapter, the Director may postpone issuance of a ROW permit
and may give public notice of the application in an attempt to identify whether other
person(s) intend to do work in the same area within a reasonable period of time, so
that all ROW work in the area can be coordinated. Due regard shall be accorded
applicants that are required by any law, rule, regulation, license or franchise to
provide service to the area defined in the application. The Director shall not impose
any coordination or scheduling requirements that prevent or unreasonably delay an
applicant's access to the ROW or that create a barrier to entry.
Each ROW permit issued by the Director shall include:
Projected commencement and termination dates or, if such dates are unknown at
the time the permit is issued, a provision requiring the ROW user to provide the
Director with reasonable advance notice of such dates once they are determined;
Length of affected rights-of-way, number of road crossings and identification and
description of any pavement or curb cuts included in the work;
Information regarding scheduling and coordination of work, if necessary;
The location of any of the applicant's facilities, both those proposed and existing,
and the location of any known facilities owned by another person that may be
affected by the proposed work;
An acknowledgment and representation by the applicant to comply with the terms
and conditions of the ROW permit and this Chapter; and
Such conditions and requirements as are deemed reasonably necessary by the
Director to protect structures and other facilities in the rights-of-way from damage, to

restore such rights-of-way and any structures or facilities, to ensure the reasonable
continuity and sight lines of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and to protect property
values, the aesthetics of adjoining properties and neighborhoods and the public
health, safety and welfare.
The Director may deny an application, if denial is deemed to be in the public interest, for
the following reasons:
Delinquent fees, costs or expenses owed by the applicant;
Failure to provide information required by the application or this Chapter;
The applicant being in violation of the provisions of this Chapter or other pertinent
and applicable City ordinances;
Failure to return the ROW to its previous condition under previously issued ROW
permits or after prior excavations by the applicant;
For reasons of environmental, historic or cultural sensitivity as defined by applicable
Federal, State or local law;
For the applicant's refusal to comply with alternative ROW work methods, locations
or other reasonable conditions required by the Director; and
For any other reason to protect the public health, safety and welfare, provided that
such denial does not fall within the exclusive authority of the Missouri Public Service
Commission or interfere with a ROW user's right of eminent domain of private
property, and provided further that such denial is imposed on a competitively neutral
and non-discriminatory basis.
Permit revocation and ordinance violations.
The Director may revoke a ROW permit without fee refund after notice and an
opportunity to cure, but only in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and
conditions of the permit or this Chapter. Prior to revocation, the Director shall provide
written notice to the ROW user identifying any substantial breach and allowing a
reasonable period of time not longer than thirty (30) days to cure the problem, which cure
period may be immediate if certain activities must be stopped to protect the public safety.
The cure period shall be extended by the Director on good cause shown by the ROW
user. A substantial breach includes, but is not limited to, the following:
A material violation of a provision of the ROW permit or this Chapter;
An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the ROW permit or this
Chapter, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the
City or its residents;
A material misrepresentation of fact in the ROW permit application;
A failure to complete ROW work by the date specified in the ROW permit, unless an
extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete the work is due to reasons
beyond the ROW user's control; and
A failure to correct, upon reasonable notice and opportunity to cure as specified by
the Director, work that does not conform to applicable national safety ordinances,
industry construction standards, this Chapter or any other applicable ordinances,
provided that City standards are no more stringent than those of a national safety
ordinance.

Work In The ROW.
Jurisdiction, inspection and stop work orders.
All facilities and ROW work shall be subject to inspection by the City and the supervision
of all Federal, State and local authorities having jurisdiction in such matters to ensure
compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations and
the ROW permit.
The Director shall have full access to all portions of the ROW work and may issue stop
work orders and corrective orders to prevent unauthorized work or substandard work as
established in Subsection (C)(7) hereof. Such orders:
May be delivered personally or by certified mail to the address(es) listed on the
application for the ROW permit or the person in charge of the construction site at the
time of delivery;
Shall state that substandard work or work not authorized by the ROW permit is being
carried out, summarize the substandard or unauthorized work and provide a period
of not longer than thirty (30) days to cure the problem, which cure period may be
immediate if certain activities must be stopped to protect the public safety; and
May be enforced by equitable action in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County,
Missouri, and in such case the person responsible for the substandard or
unauthorized work shall be liable for all costs and expenses incurred by the City in
enforcing such orders, including reasonable attorney's fees, in addition to any and all
penalties established in this Chapter.
Underground facilities.
In conjunction with the City's long-standing policy favoring underground construction, no
person may erect, construct or install new poles or other facilities above the surface of
the rights-of-way without the written permission of the City, unless the City's authority has
been pre-empted by State or Federal law. Such permission may be granted through a
ROW permit when other similar facilities exist above ground or when conditions are such
that underground construction is impossible, impractical or economically unfeasible, as
determined by the City, and when in the City's judgment the above ground construction
has minimal aesthetic impact on the area where the construction is proposed.
During installation of facilities and to the extent authorized by law, existing underground
conduits shall be used whenever feasible and permitted by the owner thereof.
In the case of new construction or property development, the developer or property
owner shall give reasonable written notice to other potential ROW users as directed by
the City of the particular date on which open trenching will be available for installation of
facilities. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring facilities within the
development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except that if the
facilities are not installed within five (5) working days of the date the trenches are
available as designated in the notice given by the developer or property owner, then once
the trenches are thereafter closed, the cost of new trenching shall be borne by the person
installing the facilities.
Above ground facilities.

The Director may designate certain locations or facilities in the ROW to be excluded from
use by the applicant for its facilities including, but not limited to:
Ornamental or similar specially designed street lights;
Designated historic areas;
Facilities, equipment, structures or locations that do not have electrical service
adequate or appropriate for the proposed facilities or cannot safely bear the weight
or wind loading thereof;
Facilities, equipment, structures or locations that in the reasonable judgment of the
Director are incompatible with the proposed facilities or would be rendered unsafe or
unstable by the installation; and
Facilities, equipment, structures or locations that have been designated or planned
for other use or are not otherwise available for use by the applicant due to
engineering, technological, proprietary, legal or other limitations or restrictions.
Above ground facilities shall be a neutral color and shall not be bright, reflective or
metallic. Black, gray and tan shall be considered neutral colors, as shall any color that
blends with the surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the facilities.
Facilities shall be located in such a manner as to reduce or eliminate their visibility. A
sight proof landscape screen may be required for any authorized above ground facilities
taller than three (3) feet in height or covering in excess of four (4) square feet in size.
Such screening shall be sufficient to reasonably conceal the facility. A landscape plan
identifying the size and species of landscaping materials shall be approved by the
Director prior to installation of any facility requiring landscape screening. The person
having facilities within the ROW shall be responsible for the installation, repair or
replacement of screening materials. Alternative screening or concealment may be
approved by the Director to the extent it meets or exceeds the purposes of these
requirements.
Above ground facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as not
to emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise and shall comply with all other applicable
regulations and standards established by the City or State or Federal law.
If the application of this Subsection excludes locations for above ground facilities to the
extent that the exclusion conflicts with the reasonable requirements of the applicant, the
Director shall cooperate in good faith with the applicant to attempt to find suitable
alternatives, but such alternatives may exceed the cost increase limitation established by
Section 626.030(B)(2)(b) and the City shall not be required to incur any financial cost or
to acquire new locations for the applicant.
Relocation of equipment and facilities.
In the event of an emergency, or where construction equipment or facilities create or are
contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety or property, the City may, to the
extent allowed by law, remove, re-lay or relocate such construction equipment, or the
pertinent parts of such facilities, without charge to the City for such action or for
restoration or repair. The City shall attempt to notify the person having facilities within the
ROW prior to taking such action, but the inability to do so shall not prevent same.
Thereafter, the City shall notify the person having facilities within the ROW as soon as
practicable.
At the City's direction, all facilities shall be moved underground and the cost shall be
solely the obligation of the person having facilities within the ROW (or as otherwise
allowed or required by law).

At the City's direction, a person having facilities within the ROW shall protect, support,
disconnect, relocate or remove facilities, at its own cost and expense, when necessary to
accommodate the construction, improvement, expansion, relocation or maintenance of
streets or other public works or to protect the ROW or the public health, safety or welfare.
A person having facilities within the ROW shall, on the reasonable request of any person
and after reasonable advance written notice, protect, support, disconnect, relocate or
remove facilities to accommodate such person, and the actual cost, reasonably incurred,
of such actions shall be paid by the person requesting such action. The person having
facilities within the ROW taking such action may require such payment in advance.
Rather than relocate facilities as requested or directed, a ROW user may abandon the
facilities if approved by the City as provided in Subsection (C)(6) of this Section.
No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of property, and no person shall be
entitled to any compensation therefor. No location of any facilities within the rights-of-way
shall be a vested interest.
Property repair and alterations.
During any ROW work, the person doing the work shall protect from damage any and all
existing structures and property belonging to the City and any other person. Any and all
rights-of-way, public property or private property disturbed or damaged during the work
shall be repaired or replaced by the person doing the work or the person on whose behalf
the work is being done, and such person shall immediately notify the owner of the fact of
any damaged property. Such repair or replacement shall be completed within a
reasonable time specified by the Director and to the Director's satisfaction.
Any alteration to the existing water mains, sewerage or drainage system or to any City,
State or other public structures or facilities in the rights-of-way required on account of the
construction, installation, repair or maintenance of facilities within the rights-of-way shall
be made at the sole cost and expense of the owner of such facilities.
Removal, abandonment, transfer, and relocation of facilities.
If a person having facilities within the ROW installs the facilities within the ROW without
having complied with the requirements of this Chapter or abandons the facilities, the City
may require the removal of the facilities, remove the facilities at the expense of the
person having facilities within the ROW or require the transfer of the facilities as provided
herein.
If the City requires removal of the facilities, the person shall obtain a ROW permit and
shall abide by all requirements of this Chapter. The liability, indemnity, insurance and
bonding requirements required herein shall continue in full force and effect during and
after the period of removal and restoration and until full compliance by the person with
the terms and conditions of the ROW permit and the requirements of this Chapter.
If the person fails to remove the facilities after having been directed to do so, the City
may, to the extent permitted by law, have the removal done at the person's expense.
Alternatively, the City may permit the abandonment, without removal, of the facilities if the
Director determines that abandonment is not likely to prevent or significantly impair the
future use, repair, excavation, maintenance or construction of the ROW.
If the person fails to remove the facilities after having been directed to do so, the City
may, to the extent permitted by law, decide that the ownership of the facilities should be
transferred to the City or to such person as directed by the City. In either case, the owner
of the facilities shall submit a written instrument, satisfactory in form to City, transferring

to the City, or to such person as directed by the City, ownership of the facilities. The City
may sell, assign or transfer all or part of the facilities so transferred.
The City shall not remove or seek to possess or transfer the facilities until thirty (30) days
have passed following written notice by the Director to the person having facilities within
the ROW of the City's intent to so act. The Director may choose not to act on good cause
shown by the person having facilities within the ROW.
Standards for ROW work.
Except for emergency ROW work as provided in Section 626.030(B)(1)(a), ROW work
shall be performed only upon issuance and in accordance with the requirements of a
ROW permit. At all times during the work, ROW permits shall be conspicuously displayed
at the work site and shall be available for inspection by the Director.
If at any time it appears that the duration or scope of the ROW work is or will become
materially different from that allowed by the ROW permit, the ROW user shall inform the
Director. The Director may issue a waiver, an extension or a revised ROW permit or
require that the ROW user reapply for a ROW permit in accordance with all requirements
of this Chapter.
ROW users shall not open or encumber more of the rights-of-way than is reasonably
necessary to complete the ROW work in the most expeditious manner or allow
excavations to remain open longer than is necessary to complete the work.
All ROW work that affects vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed,
barricaded and otherwise protected at the ROW user's expense. The ROW user shall be
responsible for providing adequate traffic control to the area surrounding the work as
determined by the Director.
The ROW user shall perform the ROW work at such times that will allow the least
interference with the normal flow of traffic and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood
as permitted by the Director. Unless otherwise provided by the Director in the permit,
non-emergency ROW work on arterial and collector streets may not be accomplished
during the hours of 7:00 A.M. to 8:30 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. in order to minimize
disruption of traffic flow.
The ROW user shall notify the City no less than three (3) working days in advance of any
ROW work that would require any street closure or would reduce traffic flow to less than
two (2) lanes of moving traffic for more than four (4) hours. Except in the event of
emergency ROW work, no such closure shall take place without notice and prior
authorization from the City.
All ROW work shall be in accordance with all applicable sections of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970, the National Electrical Safety Code and other Federal,
State or local laws and regulations that may apply including, without limitation, local
health, safety, construction and zoning ordinances, and laws and accepted industry
practices, all as hereafter may be amended or adopted. In the event of a conflict among
ordinances and standards, the most stringent ordinance or standard shall apply (except
insofar as that ordinance or standard, if followed, would result in facilities that could not
meet requirements of Federal, State or local law).
All facilities shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference with the rights
and convenience of property owners, other ROW users and the City. Facilities shall not
be placed where they will disrupt or interfere with other facilities or public improvements
or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents and

All facilities shall be of good and durable quality.
All ROW work shall be conducted in accordance with good engineering practices,
performed by experienced and properly trained personnel so as not to endanger any
person or property or to unreasonably interfere in any manner with the rights-of-ways or
legal rights of any property owner, including the City, or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct
pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
All safety practices required by law shall be used during ROW work, including commonly
accepted methods and devices to prevent failures and accidents that are likely to cause
damage, injury or nuisance to the public.
Any contractor or subcontractor of a ROW user must be properly licensed under laws of
the State and all applicable local ordinances, and each contractor or subcontractor shall
have the same obligations with respect to its work as a ROW user would have pursuant

other extraneous markings on the facilities or in the ROW, whether relating to the ROW
user or any other person, except such necessary minimal markings approved by the City
as necessary to identify the facilities for service, repair, maintenance or emergency
purposes or as may be otherwise required to be affixed by applicable law or regulation.
Unless otherwise approved in writing by the City, a ROW user shall not remove, cut or
damage any trees or their roots within the ROW.

of the Director. Restoration of the ROW shall be completed within the dates specified in
the ROW permit unless the Director issues a waiver, extension or a new or revised ROW
permit.
It shall be the duty of any person making an excavation in the ROW to backfill such
excavations and restore the surface in accordance with the City's minimum prescribed
standards for such surfaces or the following standards as determined by the Director.
If the excavations are made in the improved portion of the ROW, twelve (12) inches

base and the CLSM to prevent the material from bleeding into the rock base. The
remaining eight (8) inches will be restored by placing a twenty-eight (28) day
minimum strength, four thousand five hundred (4,500) psi concrete mix.
If the excavations are made in the improved portion of an asphalt or combination
street, twelve (12) inches of granular backfill will be placed over exposed facilities,
and CLSM will fill the hole within nine (9) inches of the finished surface. There will be
a plastic membrane placed between the rock base and the CLSM to prevent the
material from bleeding into the rock base. The remaining nine (9) inches will be
restored by placing a six (6)inch thick, twenty-eight (28) day minimum strength, four
thousand five hundred (4,500) psi concrete mix under a three (3) inch asphalt
concrete lift of type C mix to meet existing grades.
Construction of asphalt driveway entrances in residential ROW will be constructed of
six (6) inches of compacted rock base and three (3) inches of type C asphalt
concrete mix. Construction of asphalt driveway entrances in commercial ROW will
be constructed of four (4) inches of compacted rock base, seven and one-half (7½)
inches of type X and three (3) inches of type C asphalt concrete mix. Concrete
driveway approaches will consist of a four (4) inch compacted rock base and be a
minimum of six (6) inches thick in residential ROW and eight (8) inches thick in
commercial ROW.
If a ROW user fails to restore the ROW within the date specified either by the ROW
permit or any extension thereof as granted by the Director, the City may perform its own
restoration. The City may also opt to perform its own restoration regardless of any failure
by the ROW user, in which case the ROW permit, or any amendment or revision thereto,
shall note such option. In either event, if the City performs the restoration, the ROW user
shall be responsible for reimbursing the City's reasonable actual restoration costs within
thirty (30) days of invoice.
Every ROW user to whom a ROW permit has been granted shall guarantee for a period
of four (4) years the restoration of the ROW in the area where the ROW user conducted
excavation. During this period the ROW user shall, upon notification from the Director,
correct all restoration work to the extent necessary as required by the Director. Said work
shall be completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days from
receipt of the Director's notice unless otherwise permitted by the Director. If a ROW user
fails to restore the ROW within the time specified, the City may perform the work and the
ROW user shall be responsible for reimbursing the City's reasonable actual restoration
costs within thirty (30) days of invoice. The Director may extend the cure period on good
cause shown.
A ROW user shall not be relieved of the obligation to complete the necessary right-ofway
restoration and maintenance because of the existence of any performance bond
required by this Chapter.
Any person performing ROW work shall provide written notice to all property owners within
one hundred eighty-five (185) feet of the site at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to any
installation, replacement or expansion of its facilities. Notice shall include a reasonably
detailed description of work to be done, the location of work and the time and duration of the
work.

Performance and maintenance bonds.
Prior to any ROW work a ROW user shall establish in the City's favor a performance and
maintenance bond in an amount to be determined by the Director to ensure the
restoration of the rights-of-way. The bond shall continue in full force and effect for a

period of twenty-four (24) months following completion of the work. The Director shall
have the authority to extend the maintenance bond period for up to an additional twenty
four (24) months. The Director may waive this requirement when the work involves no or
only minor disruption or damage to the rights-of-way. The Director shall waive this
requirement when the ROW user has twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net
assets and does not have a history of non-compliance with State and local regulations.
If a ROW user fails to complete the ROW work in a safe, timely and competent manner,
or if the completed restorative work fails without remediation within the time period for the
bond (as determined by the Director), then after notice and a reasonable opportunity to
cure there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the
bond, any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result, including the full amount of
any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of
the ROW user and the cost of completing work within or restoring the rights-of-way, plus
a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the bond. The City
may also recover against the bond any amount recoverable against a security fund or
letter of credit where such amount exceeds that available under a security fund or letter
of credit.
Upon completion of ROW work to the satisfaction of the Director and upon lapse of the
bond period, including any extension by the Director, the City shall release the bond.
The bond shall be issued by a surety with an "A" or better rating of insurance in Best's
Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition, shall be subject to the approval of the City's
attorney and shall contain the following endorsement:
"This bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty
(60) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent
to cancel or not to renew."
In lieu of the bond required herein, the ROW user may establish in the City's favor such
other security as the Director may determine to be commensurate with the noted bonding
requirements including, but not limited to, an annual bond to be maintained in the
minimum amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00).
Insurance.
All ROW users shall maintain, for the duration of any ROW work and, when applicable,
for as long as the ROW user has facilities within the rights-of-way, at least the following
liability insurance coverage: Workers' Compensation and employer liability insurance to
meet all requirements of Missouri law and commercial general liability insurance with
respect to the construction, operation and maintenance of the facilities and the conduct of
the ROW user's business in the City in the minimum amounts of:
Two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) for property damage resulting from any one
accident;
Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for personal bodily injury or death resulting from
any one (1) accident; and
Two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) for all other types of liability.
These insurance requirements shall not be construed to limit the
liability of any person or to impose any liability on the City or to
waive any sovereign immunity.

All insurance policies shall be with sureties qualified to do business in the State of
Missouri with an "A" or better rating of insurance by Best's Key Rating Guide,
Property/Casualty Edition and in a form approved by the City.
All insurance policies shall be available for review by the City, and a ROW user having
facilities within the rights-of-way shall keep on file with the City current certificates of
insurance.
All general liability insurance policies shall name the City, its officers, boards, board
members, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees as additional insureds
and shall further provide that any cancellation or reduction in coverage shall not be
effective unless thirty (30) days' prior written notice thereof has been given to the
Director. A ROW user shall not cancel any required insurance policy without submission
of proof that it has obtained alternative insurance that complies with this Chapter.
The Director may exempt in writing from these insurance requirements any self-insured
ROW user, provided that the ROW user demonstrates to the Director's satisfaction that
the ROW user's self-insurance plan is commensurate with said requirements and that the
ROW user has sufficient resources to meet all potential risks, liabilities and obligations
contemplated by the requirements of this Chapter. The Director may require a security
fund or letter of credit as a condition to a self-insured's exemption. The Director shall
waive this requirement when the ROW user has twenty-five million dollars
($25,000,000.00) in net assets and does not have a history of non-compliance with
applicable regulatory law.
Indemnification.
Any ROW user granted a ROW permit and any person having facilities within the rightsof-
way, as partial consideration for the privilege granted, shall, at its sole cost and
expense, indemnify, hold harmless and defend the City, its officials, boards, board
members, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees against any and all
claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and judgments for damages or equitable
relief arising out of:
Any ROW work including, but not limited to, the construction, maintenance, repair or
replacement of the facilities;
The operation of its facilities;
Failure to secure consents from landowners; or
Any actions taken or omissions made by the person pursuant to the authority of this
Chapter.
The foregoing indemnity provisions include, but are not limited to, the City's reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or proceeding prior to
the person assuming such defense. The City shall notify a person of claims and suits
within seven (7) business days of its actual knowledge of the existence of such claim, suit
or proceeding. Once a person assumes such defense, the City may at its option continue
to participate in the defense at its own expense.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Chapter, the City shall not be
so indemnified or reimbursed in relation to any amounts attributable to:
The City's own negligence, willful misconduct, intentional or criminal acts; or
The City acting in a proprietary capacity to deliver service(s) within the City.

Recovery by the City of any amounts under insurance, a performance bond or otherwise
does not limit a person's duty to indemnify the City in any way; nor shall such recovery
relieve a person of amounts owed to the City or in any respect prevent the City from
exercising any other right or remedy it may have.
Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this Chapter shall, upon conviction by the
City's Municipal Court, be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00)
or by imprisonment not to exceed ninety (90) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
Each day the violation continues may be charged as a separate offense.
Dispute Resolutions, Appeals And Arbitration.
The Director shall make a final determination as to any matter concerning the grant, denial or
revocation of a ROW permit as provided in this Chapter. On the request of an applicant or a
ROW user and within a reasonable period of time, the Director also shall make a final
determination as to any other issue relating to the use of the ROW, the imposition of any fee
or the application of any provision of this Chapter, provided however, that this review shall not
apply to matters being prosecuted in the Municipal Court. Any final determination of the
Director shall be subject to review as provided herein.
Any person aggrieved by a final determination of the Director may appeal in writing to the City
Manager within five business (5) days thereof. The appeal shall assert specific grounds for
review and the City Manager shall render a decision on the appeal within fifteen (15) business
days of receipt affirming, reversing or modifying the determination of the Director. The City
Manager may extend this time period for the purpose of any investigation or hearing deemed
necessary. A decision affirming the Director's determination shall be in writing and supported
by findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
Any person aggrieved by the final determination of the City Manager may file a petition for
review pursuant to Chapter 536, RSMo., as amended, in the Circuit Court of the County of St.
Louis. Such petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the City Manager's final
determination.

On agreement of the parties and in addition to any other remedies, any final decision of
the City Manager may be submitted to mediation or binding arbitration.

each party shall pay its own costs, disbursements and attorney fees.
In the event of arbitration, the City Manager and the applicant or ROW user shall agree to
a single arbitrator. The costs and fees of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the

three (3) person arbitration panel consisting of one (1) arbitrator selected by the City
Manager, one (1) arbitrator selected by the applicant or ROW user and one (1) person
selected by the other two (2) arbitrators, in which case each party shall bear the expense
of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear with the other party the expense of
the third (3rd) arbitrator and of the arbitration. Each party shall also pay its own costs,
disbursements and attorney fees.

law or by the provisions of this Chapter to be done in any street, within the time prescribed
and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City, the City may, at its option, after thirty (30) days'
notice, cause such work to be done and the ROW user shall pay to the City the cost thereof in
the itemized amounts reported by the City to the ROW user within thirty (30) days after receipt
of such itemized report.
Upon ten (10) days' written notice and with the supervision of the City, or as otherwise
provided by law, a ROW user shall have the authority to trim trees that overhang rights-of-way
of the City so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with its
facilities, at its own expense subject to the supervision and direction of the City. Nothing in
this paragraph shall authorize the trimming of trees on private property without permission of
the property owner. All cut materials shall be properly disposed.
During ROW work by a ROW user, the City shall have the right to install and to thereafter
maintain, at its own cost in any excavation to or other applicable disturbance of the ROW any
parallel facilities of its own that do not unreasonably interfere with the operations of other
facilities.
Nothing in this Chapter shall be in preference or hindrance to the right of the City and any

within or outside of the City using facilities located within the City.
Facilities Permits.
Any person desiring to place facilities on private property must first apply for and obtain a
facilities permit in addition to any other building permit, license, easement, franchise or
authorization required by law. The Director may design and make available standard forms for
such applications, requiring such information as allowed by law and as the Director
determines in his or her discretion to be necessary and consistent with the provisions of this
Chapter and to accomplish the purposes of this Chapter. Each application shall at minimum
contain the following information, unless otherwise waived by the Director:
The name of the person on whose behalf the facilities are to be installed and the name,
address and telephone number of a representative whom the City may notify or contact
at any time (i.e., twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week) concerning the
facilities;
A description of the proposed work, including a site plan and such plans or technical
drawings or depictions showing the nature, dimensions and description of the facilities,
their location and their proximity to other facilities that may be affected by their
installation.
Each such application shall be accompanied by an application fee approved by the City to
cover the cost of processing the application.
Application review and determination.
The Director shall promptly review each application and shall grant or deny the
application within thirty-one (31) days. Unless the application is denied pursuant to
subparagraph (d) hereof, the Director shall issue a facilities permit upon determining that
the applicant:
Has submitted all necessary information;
Has paid the appropriate fees; and
Is in full compliance with this Chapter and all other City ordinances. The Director
may establish procedures for bulk processing of applications and periodic payment
of fees to avoid excessive processing and accounting costs.
It is the intention of the City that proposed facilities will not impair public safety, harm
property values or significant sight lines or degrade the aesthetics of the adjoining
properties or neighborhood, and that the placement and appearance of facilities on
private property should be minimized and limited in scope to the extent allowed by law to
achieve the purposes of this Section. To accomplish such purposes, the Director may
impose conditions on facilities permits, including alternative landscaping, designs or
locations, provided that such conditions are reasonable and necessary, shall not result in
a decline of service quality and are competitively neutral and non-discriminatory.
An applicant receiving a facilities permit shall promptly notify the Director of any material
changes in the information submitted in the application or included in the permit. The
Director may issue a revised facilities permit or require that the applicant reapply for a
facilities permit.
The Director may deny an application, if denial is deemed to be in the public interest, for
the following reasons:
Delinquent fees, costs or expenses owed by the applicant;

such denial does not fall within the exclusive authority of the Missouri Public Service

Permit revocation and ordinance violations.
The Director may revoke a facilities permit without fee refund after notice and an
opportunity to cure, but only in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and
conditions of the permit or this Chapter. Prior to revocation, the Director shall provide
written notice to the responsible person identifying any substantial breach and allowing a
reasonable period of time not longer than thirty (30) days to cure the problem, which cure
period may be immediate if certain activities must be stopped to protect the public safety.
The cure period shall be extended by the Director on good cause shown. A substantial
breach includes, but is not limited to, the following:
A material violation of the facilities permit or this Chapter;

or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the City or its
residents;
A material misrepresentation of fact in the permit application;
A failure to complete facilities installation by the date specified in the permit, unless
an extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete the work is due to reasons
beyond the applicant's control; and
A failure to correct, upon reasonable notice and opportunity to cure as specified by
the Director, work that does not conform to applicable national safety ordinances,
industry construction standards or the City's pertinent and applicable ordinances
including, but not limited to, this Chapter, provided that City standards are no more
stringent than those of a national safety ordinance.
Any breach of the terms and conditions of a facilities permit shall also be deemed a
violation of this Chapter, and in lieu of revocation the Director may initiate prosecution of
the applicant or the facilities owner for such violation.
Appeals and alternative dispute resolution.
Any person aggrieved by a final determination of the Director may appeal in writing to the
City Manager within five business (5) days thereof. The appeal shall assert specific
grounds for review, and the City Manager shall render a decision on the appeal within
fifteen (15) business days of its receipt affirming, reversing or modifying the

reasonableness of the decision. Any person aggrieved by the final determination of the
City Manager may file a petition for review pursuant to Chapter 536, RSMo., as

selected by the other two (2) arbitrators, in which case each party shall bear the

Facilities Regulations.
The following general regulations apply to the placement and appearance of facilities:
Facilities shall be placed underground, except when other similar facilities exist above
ground or when conditions are such that underground construction is impossible,
impractical or economically unfeasible as determined by the City, and when in the City's
judgment the above ground construction has minimal aesthetic impact on the area where
the construction is proposed. Facilities shall not be located so as to interfere, or be likely
to interfere, with any public facilities or use of public property.
Facilities shall be located in such a manner as to reduce or eliminate their visibility. Nonresidential
zoning districts are preferred to residential zoning districts. Preferred locations
in order of priority in both type districts are:
Thoroughfare landscape easements;
Rear yards; and
Street side yards on a corner lot behind the front yard setback. Placements within
side yards not bordered by a street or within front yards are discouraged.
Facilities shall be a neutral color and shall not be bright, reflective or metallic. Black, gray
and tan shall be considered neutral colors, as shall any color that blends with the
surrounding dominant color and helps to camouflage the facilities. Sightproof screening,
landscape or otherwise, may be required for facilities taller than three (3) feet in height or
covering in excess of four (4) square feet in size. Such screening shall be sufficient to
reasonably conceal the facility. A landscape plan identifying the size and species of
landscaping materials shall be approved by the Director prior to installation of any facility
requiring landscape screening. The person responsible for the facilities shall be
responsible for the installation, repair or replacement of screening materials. Alternative
concealment may be approved by the Director to the extent it meets or exceeds the
purposes of these requirements.
Facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a safe manner and so as to not emit any
unnecessary or intrusive noise and in accordance with all applicable provisions of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the National Electrical Safety Code and all
other applicable Federal, State or local laws and regulations.

No person shall place or cause to be placed any sort of signs, advertisements or other
extraneous markings on the facilities, except such necessary minimal markings approved
by the City as necessary to identify the facilities for service, repair, maintenance or
emergency purposes or as may be otherwise required to be affixed by applicable law or
regulation.
If the application of this Subsection excludes locations for facilities to the extent that the
exclusion conflicts with the reasonable requirements of the applicant, the Director shall
cooperate in good faith with the applicant to attempt to find suitable alternatives, but the
City shall not be required to incur any financial cost or to acquire new locations for the
applicant.
Any person installing, repairing, maintaining, removing or operating facilities, and the person
on whose behalf the work is being done, shall protect from damage any and all existing
structures and property belonging to the City and any other person. Any and all rights-of-way,
public property or private property disturbed or damaged during the work shall be repaired or
replaced, and the responsible person shall immediately notify the owner of the fact of the
damaged property. Such repair or replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time
specified by the Director and to the Director's satisfaction.
The applicant shall provide written notice to all property owners within one hundred eighty-five
(185) feet of the site at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to any installation, replacement or
expansion of its facilities. Notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of work to be
done, the location of work and the time and duration of the work.
At the City's direction, a person owning or controlling facilities shall protect, support,
disconnect, relocate or remove facilities, at its own cost and expense, when necessary to
accommodate the construction, improvement, expansion, relocation or maintenance of streets
or other public works or to protect the ROW or the public health, safety or welfare.
If a person installs facilities without having complied with the requirements of this Chapter or
abandons the facilities, said person shall remove the facilities, and if the person fails to
remove the facilities within a reasonable period of time, the City may, to the extent permitted
by law, have the removal done at the person's expense.
Facilities shall be subject to all other applicable regulations and standards as established as
part of the City Code including, but not limited to, building codes, zoning requirements and
rights- of-way management regulations in addition to the regulations provided herein.
