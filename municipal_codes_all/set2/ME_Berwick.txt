administrative appeal. The determination of appropriateness shall include consideration of the
probable changes in traffic volume and type, parking, noise, potential for litter, wastes or byproducts,
fumes, odors, or other nuisances likely to result from such change of use. The
performance standards in Article VII of this ordinance shall apply to such requests to establish
new non-conforming uses.
4. Use of Land. A non-conforming use of land may not be extended into any part of the
remainder of a lot of land. A non-conforming use of land which is accessory to a nonconforming
use of a building shall be discontinued at the same time the non-conforming use of
the building is discontinued.
In the case of earth removal operations, the removal of earth may not be extended as a nonconforming
use beyond the required setback lines of the specific parcel upon which such
operations were in progress when such use became non-conforming. Adjacent parcels in the
same or different ownership shall not be eligible for exemption under the non-conforming use
provisions unless earth removal operations were in progress on these parcels before these
provisions were enacted. The provision of required off-street parking for an existing nonconforming
use shall not be considered the expansion of said use.
C. Non-Conforming Structures. (Pertaining to dimensional requirements. Applications
regarding non-conforming use shall be reviewed under the provisions above.)
1. Enlargements Controlled. A non-conforming structure shall not be added to or enlarged
unless such addition or enlargement conforms to all the regulations of the district in which it is
located, or a variance is obtained, except that dwellings in the residential districts which are
situated entirely within the front setback area may be enlarged provided such enlargement does
not encroach upon the existing front setback or upon any other required setback areas of the lot.
The addition of an open patio with no structures elevated above ground level shall not
constitute the expansion of a non-conforming structure.
The addition of steps or the enclosure of an existing porch shall not constitute the expansion
of a non-conforming structure. But the addition of a deck shall constitute the expansion of a
non-conforming structure and shall meet all the dimensional requirements of this ordinance.
Construction or enlargement of a foundation beneath the existing structure shall not be
considered an expansion of the structure provided that the structure and new foundation are
placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by
the Planning Board, basing its decision on the criteria specified in section 5.2.C.4, that the
completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure; and that
the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three additional feet.
2. Discontinuance. Discontinuance of the use of a legally existing non-conforming structure
shall not constitute abandonment of the structure. Conforming use of the structure may be
commenced at any time.
3. Lack of Required Parking or Loading Space. A building or structure which is nonconforming
as to the requirements for off-street parking and/or loading space shall not be
enlarged, added to, or altered unless off-street parking and/or loading space is provided to bring
parking and/or loading space into conformance with the requirements of this ordinance for both
the addition or alteration and for the original building or structure, or a variance is obtained.
- 31 -
4. Relocation. A nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the
parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all
setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Board of Appeals, and
provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system
meets the requirements of state law and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal
Rules (Rules), or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said Rules.
In no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming.
In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical
extent, the Planning Board shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential
for soil erosion, the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties, the
location of the septic system and other on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type and
amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation.
5. Replacement. A nonconforming structure on a non-conforming lot of record may by
replaced or reconstructed provided that:
a. The new structure is reconstructed or replaced within the footprint of the previous structure, or
that the new structure is located on the lot so that the existing non-conformity is improved upon
and not increased in any way.
b. In order to replace or reconstruct a non-conforming structure on a nonconforming lot of record
a permit must be obtained from the Code Enforcement Officer prior to any demolition or
building removal and the structure must be replaced no less than 180 days from receipt of the
permit.
c. Any manufactured housing proposed for replacement must be a HUD-code home as defined
under Manufactured Housing in the Berwick land use ordinance.
D. Non-conforming Lots of Record.
1. Vacant. A vacant non-conforming lot of record may be built upon provided it is not
contiguous with any other vacant lot in the same ownership. A vacant lot of record does not
have to meet area or frontage requirements of this ordinance. However, all other dimensional
standards of this ordinance shall be met unless a variance is obtained from the Board of Appeals.
Buildings shall be limited to a single family or two-family dwelling unit unless the property has
frontage on Route 9 or Route 4 and the use is permitted in the pertinent zoning district.
2. Built Lots. A non-conforming lot of record that was built upon prior to the enactment or
subsequent amendment of the ordinance is subject to the following restrictions. The structure(s)
may be repaired, maintained, or improved, and may be enlarged in conformity with all
dimensional requirements of this ordinance except lot area, lot width, or lot frontage. If the
proposed enlargement of the structure(s) cannot meet the dimensional requirements of this
ordinance a variance shall be obtained from the Board of Appeals.
3. Contiguous Built Lots. If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in single or joint
ownership of record at the time of adoption of this ordinance, if all or part of the lots do not meet
the dimensional requirements of this ordinance, and if a principal use or structure exists on each
lot, the non-conforming lots may be conveyed separately or together, providing the State
Minimum Lot Size Law and Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied with. If two or
more principal uses or structures existed on a single lot of record on the effective date of this
ordinance, each may be sold on a separate lot provided that the above referenced law and rules
are complied with. When such lots are divided each lot thus created must be as conforming as
possible to the dimensional requirements of this ordinance.
- 32 -
4. Contiguous Lots - Vacant or Partially Built. If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are
in single or joint ownership of record at the time of or since adoption or amendment of this
ordinance, if either or both of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional requirements of
this ordinance or subsequent amendments, and if two or more of the lots are vacant or contain
only an accessory structure, the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to meet the
dimensional standards, except where rights have vested, or the lots have frontage on parallel
streets and state laws are complied with.
E. Vested Rights.
Non-conforming use rights cannot arise by the mere filing of a notice of intent to build, and
application for building permits, or an application for required state permits and approvals. Such
rights arise when actual construction has begun, or in the case of pending applications, when the
review process on a complete application commences. Such construction must be legal at the
time it is commenced and the owner must be in possession of and in compliance with all validly
issued permits, both state and local. The right to develop a non-conformity shall automatically be
lost, even if the owner or agent did not intend to abandon the project, if such development or
construction is not substantially complete within two years of the adoption or amendment of this
ordinance.
5.3 Mixed Use.
Mixed use means the development of a lot, building, structure or portion thereof which combines
a residential and non-residential use. Mixed uses are allowed only under the following
conditions:
1. Each use must comply with all performance standards of this ordinance applicable to that use.
2. Where different dimensional requirements apply to the different uses, the more restrictive
requirements shall apply to the entire mixed use.
3. If any of the uses requires conditional use approval, the Planning Board shall consider the
impacts and effects of the entire mixed use when the Board applies the conditional use approval
criteria and when the Board determines what limiting conditions, if any, are required.
4. Where there is any conflict or inconsistency between any of the standards of this ordinance as
applied to the different uses, the more restrictive standards shall govern the entire mixed use.
5. A mixed use shall meet the minimum lot size for a residential use plus half the minimum lot
size for each additional commercial/industrial use.
6. Mixed uses located in the Village Overlay have no minimum lot size required although
Shoreland Zoning standards are still applicable.
7. Industrial uses may not co-locate on the same lot with residential uses.

ARTICLE VI DISTRICT REGULATIONS
6.1 Basic Requirement.
Permitted uses and conditional uses in all districts shall conform to all applicable specifications
and requirements. A plumbing permit, building permit, and/or Certificate of Occupancy shall be
required for all buildings, structures, uses of land and buildings, and sanitary facilities, according
to the provisions of this ordinance with the following exceptions: repairs, replacement, and/or
normal maintenance not requiring structural elements, decorative changes in existing structures
or buildings, patios, fences, driveways (not to exceed lot coverage) and yard sales provided that
the activity is in conformance with federal, state or local laws and does not involve any physical
modifications or changes requiring a permit under this ordinance.
See Section 14.13 for district regulations in the Shoreland Zone.
6.1.2 Omitted Uses.
In the event that a proposed use is not specifically identified in the tables, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall select the listed use which most closely resembles the proposed use in impact and
intensity. (A useful guide for examining nonresidential uses is the “North American Industry
Classification System.”)
In cases where no listed use is reasonably construed to closely resemble the proposed use, the
Code Enforcement Officer may determine that there is no listing for the proposed use and that
therefore it is not permitted in any zoning district.
6.2 Land Use District Regulations.
Land uses permitted in each district, in conformance with the General Performance Standards in
Article VII and, where appropriate, the Specific Performance Standards of Article VIII are
shown in the following table.

Notes:
1. In C/I, R1, R2 & RC/I, the setback may be reduced to the average of like setbacks of the existing
structures on abutting properties.
2. The setback along a railroad spur may be waived for loading facilities that require rail access.
3. Two-family dwellings require twice the lot size as single-family dwellings. Multifamily dwellings
require a minimum lot size which equal that required for the equivalent number of single family
dwelling units.
- 40 -
4. No land in a deeded right of way may be used to meet any of the dimensional requirements of this
ordinance.
5. The frontage requirement for lots on curves with a centerline radius of 100 feet or less may be

portion of the building shall not expand by 30 percent or more in volume or floor area
during the lifetime of the structure. Average of the abutters (footnote #1 above) would apply if this
average was less than ten feet.
9. One acre equals 43,560 square feet or 4,840 square yards.
10. All uses within the Village Overlay District are exempt from dimensional requirements of the
underlying District, except the 25’ setback requirement from the river, and subject to the requirements
established in Section 6.4. Uses within the Village Overlay District that are located in the Shoreland
Zoning District are subject to all applicable dimensional requirements of the underlying Shoreland zone
pursuant to Section 14.15.
11. If more than one single family dwelling is located on a single lot, the lot size shall equal that
required for the equivalent number of single family dwelling units. The dwelling units shall be placed
on the lot and separated from one another in such a manner that if the lot were divided each dwelling
unit would meet all dimensional requirements.
* Lots containing only commercial or industrial uses may be allowed a maximum lot coverage
percentage of 50%.
6.3.1 Residential Growth Limitation Provisions.

amendment shall be limited to three (3), except as noted in Section 6.3.1.E below.
B. Within the R-2 District the number of residential building permits shall be limited to 20 permits
in any given subdivision within any given calendar year, if such subdivision is served by public
water and sewer service (See Section 7.11, Sewage Provisions and 7.20, Water Supply). The
Planning Board may require the phasing of a project according to Section 13.6 of the Berwick
Subdivision Regulations. Any subdivision within the R-2 District and not served by both water
and sewer will be limited to three (3) building permits per calendar year per subdivision from
the effective date of this ordinance amendment except as noted in Section 6.3.1.E., below.
- 41 -

of the effective date of this ordinance amendment, the limit on the number of permits to three
(3) shall not apply, however those subdivisions either approved or pending as of the
effective date of this ordinance amendment will be subject to a limit of nine (9) permits per
calendar year.
E. For determining number of permits to be issued; if a parcel is split or conveyed into 2 parcels 3
years prior to application for subdivision, the number of permits will be issued based on the
parent parcel.
6.4 Village Overlay District - Form-Based Code Districts
The purpose of Form-Based Code is to:
? Allow for a diversity of appropriate and compatible uses within a zoning district
? Provide a more concise process for design, review and approval of structures.
? Deliver a development outcome that is more consistent with a traditional pedestrian
oriented street development pattern
Berwick’s Form-Based Code zoning district is the Village Overlay District which overlays
portions of the R1, SC/I and C/I Zoning Districts.
FIGURE 1. – Map of Village Overlay District - See the Town of Berwick’s Zoning Map at
berwickmaine.org/maps as the map may be amended from time to time.
6.4.1 General: Purpose and Intent
A. The Village Overlay District is intended to promote the development of the former tannery site,
which is bounded by Sullivan Street, Wilson Street and School Street. The establishment of the
Village Overlay District is consistent with the vision presented in the Comprehensive Plan which
includes the Berwick Downtown Vision Report and Implementation Plan.
B. The Village Overlay District will utilize the former tannery site, transforming it into a new
village center that repurposes older buildings and allows for new buildings that will offer
economic and commercial opportunities while also recognizing the Town’s industrial past. The
reuse of the industrial buildings along with new buildings, a new street, and new public and
private spaces will become the foundation of a thriving downtown.
C. The Form-Based Code establishes standards for use and design of new and existing buildings,
including size, height and required features as well as criteria related to roads, sidewalks, parking
areas and open space.
- 42 -
6.4.2 Village Overlay District
A. Objectives
1. The Village Overlay District will improve and expand Berwick’s downtown and provide
connections to the open spaces and adjacent residential neighborhoods.
2. The Village Overlay District will allow for repurposing of existing former industrial
buildings for commercial and residential uses, thereby allowing for a core downtown area
of higher density, mixed use, buildings including low-impact industry, offices, retail and
other commercial businesses and multifamily housing.
3. Continuous open space (known as a greenway) will run through the former tannery site
connecting the recreational river area and the downtown neighborhoods to the
community open space near the former Estabrook School.
4. The Village Overlay District will have a tight network of streets, including a new main
street, with wide sidewalks, street trees and buildings set close to the street or with
frontage on pleasing outdoor public spaces. A greenway connects public open spaces and
the downtown to adjacent neighborhoods.
5. A wide range of residential buildings; including single-family, two-family, town houses
or row houses and apartment houses will be allowed in the district.
6.4.2.1 Design Standards
A. Key Design Features of the Village Overlay District:
? 3 to 4 story mixed use buildings on Main Street with front façade detailing
? Active interaction between public and private spaces
? Increased density
? Increased availability of on-street parking
? Wide sidewalks
? Street trees
? Small off-street parking areas
? Public commons, outdoor spaces for restaurants and open space for civic activities
? Well defined corner buildings at the Main Street intersections with Wilson and Sullivan
Streets.

Notes:
1. Where the calculation of the aforementioned parking spaces results in a fractional part of a
complete parking space, the parking spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest
number.
2. The above are minimum standards, and additional parking spaces shall be required if these prove
to be inadequate. However, within the C/I and SC/I Districts, where a new use or expanded use
in an existing building cannot meet the above parking standards, the Planning Board may, as a
conditional use in accordance with this chapter, waive the above requirements.
3. Where floor space is to be used in calculating the number of required parking stalls, gross floor
space shall be used unless otherwise noted.
7.9 Refuse Disposal.
The applicant shall provide for the disposal of all solid and liquid wastes on a timely basis and in
an environmentally safe manner. The Planning Board shall consider the impact of particular
industrial or chemical wastes or by-products upon the town's facilities (in terms of volume,
flammability or toxicity) and may require the applicant to dispose of such wastes elsewhere, in
conformance with all applicable state and federal regulations. The Board may require the
applicant to specify the amount and exact nature of all industrial or chemical wastes to be
generated by the proposed operation.
7.10 Traffic.
Proposed developments shall provide for safe access and egress to roads. Safe access shall be
assured by providing an adequate number and location of access/egress points with respect to
sight distances, intersections, and other traffic generators. The proposed development shall not
have an unreasonable impact on local roads by degrading the levels of service and shall assure
safe interior circulation patterns by separating vehicular and pedestrian traffic within the site.
Access/egress points shall be designed in accordance with the following safe sign distances.
Speed Limit Recommend Minimum
25 mph 250 ft. 175 ft.
30 mph 300 ft. 210 ft.
35 mph 350 ft. 245 ft.
40 mph 400 ft. 280 ft.
The Maine Department of Transportation may be consulted on plans reviewed under this
ordinance.
7.11 Sewage Provisions.
A. When not serviced by the public sewerage system, the approval of building permit applications shall
be subject to presentation of a completed site evaluation form (HHE-200) which evidences adequate soil
conditions for sewage disposal.
B. When two or more lots or buildings in different ownership share a common subsurface disposal
system, the system shall be owned and maintained in common by an owners' association. Covenants in
the deeds for each lot shall require mandatory membership in the association and provide for adequate
funding of the association to assure proper maintenance of the system.
C. Industrial or commercial waste waters may be discharged to municipal sewers only and in such
quantities and/or of such quality as to be compatible with commonly accepted municipal sewage
treatment operations. Such wastes may require pretreatment at the industrial or commercial site in order
to render them amenable to municipal treatment processes. Pretreatment includes, but is not limited to,
- 62 -
screening, grinding, sedimentation, pH adjustment, surface skimming, chemical oxidation and reduction
and dilution. The disposal of industrial or commercial waste waters by means other than the municipal
sewerage system must comply with the laws of the State of Maine concerning water pollution. Wash
water or other process water carrying stone dust, stone particles, silt or other mineral matter will not be
accepted into the municipal system.
D. All subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be installed in conformance with the State of Maine
Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules.
E. Within the R-1 District, any new proposed subdivision shall be served by public sewer at the expense
of the applicant or by negotiated agreement with the Berwick Sewer District. Within the R-1 District any
new residential dwelling unit or commercial use requiring a building permit shall be served by public
sewer.
F. When a lot is not serviced by public sewage disposal, or unless the lot is part of a cluster development
served by a common subsurface disposal system, the following standards shall apply:
a. Each proposed lot must be served by a septic system located within its boundaries.
b. If the depth to a limiting factor, as defined by the above rules is less than 24 inches, both the
septic system and a replacement system site must be located within each proposed lot. The
reserve area shall be shown on the plan and restricted so it will not be built on.
c. Septic systems serving a structure on one lot are not allowed to be located on abutting or
neighboring lots.
d. In no instance shall a disposal area be on a site that requires a New System Variance from
the Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules.
7.12 Setbacks and Screening.
A. Exposed storage areas, exposed machinery, sand and gravel extraction operations, and areas used for
the storage or collection of discarded automobiles, auto parts, metals or any other articles of salvage or
refuse, shall have sufficient setbacks and screening (such as a stockade fence or a dense evergreen hedge
six feet or more in height) to provide a visual buffer sufficient to minimize their impact on other land
uses and properties in the area.
B. Where a potential safety hazard to children would be likely to arise, physical screening sufficient to
deter small children from entering the premises shall be provided and maintained in good condition.
7.13 Signs.
A. General Requirements
All signs must be stationary and permanently installed except where exempted by the ordinance. No sign
shall be comprised of or illuminated by intermittent light except digital public service messages such as
time, date, temperature, etc. All lighting shall be hooded or shielded to prevent direct illumination of
public streets or abutting properties. Projecting signs shall maintain a minimum height clearance of eight
feet above ground level, project only at an angle 90 degrees from the surface, and not extend more than
four feet. The sign face shall not exceed six square feet per side, and the length to width ratio shall not
exceed 2:1.
B. The following signs are exempted from land use requirements: temporary signs, memorial tablets,
public notices, public safety signs, real estate signs, national and state flag, religious symbols or
insignias, historical plaques, house numbers, political signs, interior signs, motor vehicle signs, service
club road signs.
C. Signs existing at the time of enactment of these regulations may be continued and maintained but not
enlarged or replaced except in conformity with these regulations.
- 63 -
In the Shoreland Commercial Industrial (SC/I) District, commercial signs may not exceed 40 square feet
in area when mounted flat against the building surface. Such signs, individual and collectively, may at
no time cover more than 20% of the gross surface area of the building face on which they are mounted.
On each premise only one sign per occupancy may be affixed to the building exterior, except
occupancies which face more than one public way may have one attached sign on each side of the
building which faces a public way. The total signage area of all signs, identifying goods or services
offered on the premises, per business shall not exceed a total of 100 sq. ft., except for corner lots which
may double this amount.

(2) Wall sign graphics may only be installed in the "signable area" of the facade (an area excluding window
or door openings, or architectural details or ornamentation).
(3) Post signs must be separated by at least 100 feet and are permitted for buildings setback 35 feet or more.
(4) Permanent signs affixed to windows may not exceed 25 percent of the window area
(5) The sign area of a post sign shall be based on only one side of a two faced sign.
(6) Does not include Stream Protection, Limited Residential and Resource Protection Districts
7.14 Soils.
All land uses shall be located on soils in or upon which the proposed uses or structures can be
established or maintained without causing adverse environmental impacts, including severe erosion,
mass soil movement, improper drainage, and water pollution, whether during or after construction.
Proposed uses requiring subsurface waste disposal, and commercial or industrial development and other
similar intensive land uses, shall require a soils report based on an on-site investigation and be prepared
by state-certified professionals. Certified persons may include Maine Certified Soil Scientists, Maine
Registered Professional Engineers, Maine State Certified Geologists and other persons who have training
and experience in the recognition and evaluation of soil properties.
The report shall be based upon the analysis of the characteristics of the soil and surrounding land and
water areas, maximum ground water elevation, presence of ledge, drainage conditions,
and other pertinent data which the evaluator deems appropriate. The soils report shall include
recommendations for a proposed use to counteract soil limitations where they exist.
7.15 Erosion and Sedimentation Control.
1. All activities which involve filling, grading, excavation or other similar activities which
result in unstabilized soil conditions and which require a permit shall require a written soil
erosion and sedimentation control plan. Erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be
designed in accordance with the Maine Erosion and Sediment Control BMP’s manual,
published by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, March 2003. The plan shall
be submitted to the permitting authority for approval and shall include, where applicable,
provisions for:
a. Mulching and revegetation of disturbed soil.
b. Temporary runoff control features such as hay bales, silt fencing or diversion ditches.
c. Permanent stabilization structures such as retaining walls or riprap.
2. In order to create the least potential for erosion, development shall be designed to fit with
the topography and soils of the site. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be
required shall be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours shall be followed as closely
as possible. The top or bottom of a cut or fill shall not be closer than ten feet to an adjoining
property unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the affected landowner and town but in no
instance shall said cut or fill exceed a three-to-one slope.
3. Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall apply to all aspects of the proposed
project involving land disturbance, and shall be in operation during all stages of the activity.
- 65 -
The amount of exposed soil at every phase of construction shall be minimized to reduce the
potential for erosion.
4. Natural and man-made drainage ways and drainage outlets shall be protected from erosion
from water flowing through them. Drainage ways shall be designed and constructed in order to
carry water from a 25 year storm or greater, and shall be stabilized with vegetation or lined with
rip-rap.
7.16 Storage.
All materials stored outdoors shall be stored in such a manner as to prevent the breeding and
harboring of insects, rats or other vermin. This shall be accomplished by enclosures in
containers, raising materials above ground, separation of material, prevention of stagnant water,
extermination procedures or other means.
7.17 Storm Water Management.
All new construction and development, whether or not served by a storm water collection and
transportation system, shall be designed to minimize storm water runoff from the site in excess
of the natural predevelopment conditions. Where possible, existing natural runoff control
features, such as berms, swales, terraces and wooded areas shall be retained in order to reduce
runoff and encourage infiltration of storm water.
For developments that create less than one acre of disturbed area, the Basic Performance
Standards specified in the Maine Department of Environmental Protection Chapter 500:
Stormwater Management, Appendix A-Erosion and Sedimentation Control rules shall be
utilized.
For developments that create one or more acres of disturbed area, the stormwater management
provisions specified in Chapters 500 and 502 of the Maine Department of Environmental
Protection Stormwater Management rules will apply.
All development plans shall define maintenance requirements and identify parties
responsible for maintenance of the storm water control system, in accordance with Section
7.23.
Storm water runoff systems should be designed to facilitate aquifer recharge when it is
advantageous to compensate for ground water withdrawals. Conversely, designs should avoid
recharge where ground water effects might be harmful. Design of permanent storage facilities
should consider safety, appearance, recreational use, and cost and effectiveness or maintenance
operations, in addition to the primary storage function. Natural overland flows, and open
drainage channel and swale locations should be the preferred alignments for major components
of a residential drainage system. The use of enclosed components (such as underground piping)
should be minimized.
7.18 Toxic and Noxious Discharges.
No use shall for any period of time discharge across the boundaries of the lot wherein it is
located toxic and noxious matter in environmental concentrations in excess of standards set
forth by the Environmental Protection Agency and/or the Maine Department of Environmental
Protection.
7.19 Water Quality.
No activity shall locate, store, discharge, or permit the discharge of any treated, untreated or
inadequately treated liquid, gaseous, or solid materials of such nature, quality, obnoxiousness,
toxicity, or temperature that run-off, seep, percolate, or wash into surface or ground waters so as
to contaminate, pollute, or harm such waters or submerged debris, soil or scum, color, odor,
- 66 -
taste, or unsightliness, or be harmful to human, animal, plant, or aquatic life. All outdoor
storage facilities for fuel, chemicals, chemical or industrial wastes, and toxic biodegradable raw
materials, shall be located on impervious pavement, and shall be completely enclosed by an
impervious dike which shall be high enough to contain the total volume of liquid depth during a
25-year storm, so that such liquid shall not be able to spill onto or seep into the ground
surrounding the paved storage area. Storage tanks for "home heating oil" and diesel fuel, not
exceeding 275 gallons in size, may be exempted from this requirement, in situations where
neither high seasonal water table (within 15 inches of the surface) nor rapidly permeable sandy
soils are involved.
7.20 Water Supply.
A. Prior to the issuance of any occupancy permit for any structure with a potable water supply
system, a water quality analysis demonstrating that the State of Maine Safe Drinking Water
Guidelines are met shall be submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer.
B. Within the R-1 District all subdivisions proposed after the effective date of this ordinance
shall be served by public water. Any new residential unit (outside of an approved subdivision)
or commercial use requiring a building permit and within 500 feet of the public water line shall
be served by public water.
7.21 Access to Lots.
No permit shall be issued to erect any structure on a lot without frontage on a public way unless
an access road meeting the following criteria has been constructed within a deeded right of way
a minimum of 50 feet in width. The access road shall be constructed to a minimum width of 12
feet if serving one dwelling unit, and 15 feet if serving two dwelling units. The access road
shall contain a minimum depth of 15 inches of bank-run gravel and have drainage ditches and
culverts at all appropriate points. Such an access road shall serve no more than two dwelling
units, except as noted below. Any access road serving three or more dwelling units shall meet
the road design and construction standards of the Town of Berwick Road Construction
Standards.
If the development is located in the R2, R3 or AP Zone, dead end streets shall remain private
until connectivity to other streets may occur except if the road is part of a subdivision approved
before the year 2019 and is still considered active by the Planning Department. If the street is
connected to another street making it a through way with a second means of egress to a public
way and built to town standards it may be petitioned to become a public way.
More than two dwelling units may be allowed on a discontinued road for those lots created prior
to March 14, 1987, provided that the road is brought up to the standards for two dwelling units
as described above. One dwelling unit shall be allowed per lot of record, and an additional
dwelling unit shall be allowed per lot of record provided that:
A. the road standards described above are met (minimum width of fifteen feet, minimum depth
of fifteen inches of bank-run gravel, and have drainage ditches and culverts at all appropriate
points), and
B. the applicable zone road frontage and lot dimensions requirements are met, and
C. the building permit is issued only to a child of the record owner (this precludes any
additional permits for those lots of record owned by other than an individual person or persons),
and
D. access to the additional dwelling unit shall be from the discontinued road and no other right
of way, and
- 67 -
E. a survey of the lot done by a State of Maine registered surveyor is recorded in the York
County Registry of Deeds prior to the issuance of the additional building permit, said registered
survey to contain the following provisions:
1. No further subdivision of this lot is permitted without compliance with the Town of
Berwick subdivision regulations then in existence.
2. No further conveyance of this lot is permitted for five years from the date of the
recording of the survey.
3. The discontinued road is not maintained nor plowed by the Town of Berwick. The
Town of Berwick is not responsible for any upgrading or plowing of the discontinued road.
Any upgrading or plowing of the discontinued road will be at the expense of the lot owner.
F. the conveyance creating a lot to the child of the record owner shall be recorded in the York
County Registry of Deeds prior to the issuance of the additional building permit and said
conveyance shall also contain the three provisions set forth in paragraph E. above as survey
requirements, and
G. the additional building permit issued contain the following provision:
NOTICE
THE DISCONTINUED ROAD IS NOT MAINTAINED NOR PLOWED BY THE TOWN OF
BERWICK. THE TOWN OF BERWICK IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY UPGRADING OR
PLOWING OF THE DISCONTINUED ROAD. ANY UPGRADING OR PLOWING OF THE
DISCONTINUED ROAD WILL BE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE LOT OWNER.
7.22 Non-Storm Water Discharge
A. Purpose. The purpose of this provision is to provide for the health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens of Berwick through the regulation of non-storm water discharges into
Berwick’s storm drainage system as required by federal and state law. This provision establishes
methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into Berwick’s storm drainage system in
order to comply with requirements of the federal Clean Water Act and state law.
B. Objectives. The objectives of this provision are:
1. To prohibit unpermitted or unallowed non-storm water discharges to the storm drainage
system; and
2. To set forth the legal authority and procedures to carry out all inspection, monitoring and
enforcement activities necessary to ensure compliance with this provision.
C. Applicability.
This Provision shall apply to all persons discharging storm water and/or non-storm water
discharges from any premises into the storm drainage system.
D. Responsibility for Administration.
The Code Enforcement Officer is the enforcement authority who shall administer, implement,
and enforce these provisions.
- 68 -
E. Prohibition of Non-Storm Water Discharges.
1. General Prohibition. Except as allowed or exempted herein, no person shall create,
initiate, originate or maintain a non-storm water discharge to the storm drainage system.
Such non-storm water discharges are prohibited notwithstanding the fact that the
municipality may have approved the connections, drains or conveyances by which a person
discharges unallowed non-storm water discharges to the storm drainage system.
2. Allowed Non-Storm Water Discharges. The creation, initiation, origination and
maintenance of the following non-storm water discharges to the storm drainage system are
allowed as long as they do not cause or contribute to a violation of the State’s water quality
standards:
a. Landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows; rising ground waters; uncontaminated
ground water infiltration (as defined at 40 CFR 35.2005(20)); uncontaminated pumped
ground water; uncontaminated flows from foundation drains; air conditioning and
compressor condensate; irrigation water; flows from uncontaminated springs;
uncontaminated water from crawl space pumps; uncontaminated flows from footing
drains; lawn watering runoff; flows from riparian habitats and wetlands; residual street
wash water (where spills/leaks of toxic or hazardous materials have not occurred, unless
all spilled material has been removed and detergents are not used); hydrant flushing and
fire fighting activity runoff; water line flushing and discharges from potable water
sources; and individual residential car washing; and dechlorinated swimming pool
discharges.
b. Discharges specified in writing by the Code Enforcement Officer as being necessary to
protect public health and safety; and
c. Dye testing, with verbal notification to the Code Enforcement Officer prior to the time
of the test.
3. Exempt Person or Discharge. This provision shall not apply to an exempt person or
discharge, except that the Code Enforcement Officer may request from exempt persons and
persons with exempt discharges copies of permits, notices of intent, licenses and orders from
the EPA or DEP that authorize the discharge(s).
F. Suspension of Access to the Municipality’s Small MS4.
The Code Enforcement Officer may, without prior notice, physically suspend discharge access to
the storm drainage system to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened non-storm water discharge to the storm drainage system which presents or may
present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the storm drainage system, or which may cause the municipality to violate the
terms of its environmental permits. Such suspension may include, but is not limited to, blocking
pipes, constructing dams or taking other measures, on public ways or public property, to
physically block the discharge to prevent or minimize a non-storm water discharges to the storm
drainage system. If the person fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the Code Enforcement Officer may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize
damage to the storm drainage system, or to minimize danger to persons, provided, however, that
in taking such steps the Code Enforcement Officer may enter upon the premises that are the
- 69 -
source of the actual or threatened non-storm water discharge to the storm drainage system only
with the consent of the premises’ owner, occupant or agent, or pursuant to an administrative
search warrant.
G. Monitoring of Discharges.
In order to determine compliance with these provisions, the Code Enforcement Officer may enter
upon and inspect premises subject to this provision at reasonable hours with the consent of the
premises’ owner, occupant or agent: to inspect the premises and connections thereon to the storm
drainage system; and to conduct monitoring, sampling and testing of the discharge to the storm
drainage system.
H. Enforcement.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision of or to fail to comply with any of the
requirements of these provisions. Whenever the Code Enforcement Officer believes that a person
has violated these provisions, the Code Enforcement Officer may enforce these provisions in

7.23 Post-Construction Stormwater Management Article.
A. Purpose
The purpose of this Post-Construction Stormwater Management Article is to provide for the
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the Town of Berwick through review and
approval of post-construction stormwater management plans and monitoring and enforcement of
compliance with such plans as required by federal and State law. This Article establishes
methods for post-construction stormwater management in order to comply with minimum
control measures requirements of the federal Clean Water Act, of federal regulations and of
Maine’s Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems General Permit.
B. Objectives
This Article seeks to meet the above purpose through the following objectives:
- 71 -
1. Reduce the impact of post-construction discharge of stormwater on receiving waters; and
2. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution,
wherever possible, through use of Best Management Practices as promulgated by the Maine
Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP) pursuant to its Chapters 500 and 502 Rules,
and ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public
safety.
C. Applicability
1. In General. This Article applies to all Development within the Municipality.
2. Exception. This Article does not apply to Development on a lot, tract or parcel less than
one acre in area where that lot, tract or parcel is part of a subdivision that is approved under this
Article; said lot, tract or parcel shall not require separate review under this Article, but shall
comply with the Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan requirements for that approved
subdivision.
D. Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan Approval
1. General Requirement. No Applicant for a building permit, subdivision approval, site
plan approval or other zoning, planning or other land use approval for Development to
which this Article is applicable shall receive such permit or approval for that Development
unless the Municipal Permitting Authority for that Development also determines that the
Applicant’s Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan for that Development meets
the requirements of this Article.
2. Performance Standards.
a. The Applicant shall make adequate provision for the management of the quantity and
quality of all stormwater generated by the Development through a Post-Construction
Stormwater Management Plan. This Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan shall
be designed to meet the standards contained in the MEDEP’s Chapters 500 and 502 Rules
and shall comply with the practices described in the manual Stormwater Management for
Maine, published by the MEDEP, January 2006, which hereby are incorporated by reference
pursuant to 30-A M.R.S.A. § 3003.
b. The Applicant may meet the quantity and quality design standards of Chapter 500 and
Chapter 502 MEDEP Rules above either on-site or off-site, but where off-site facilities are
used, the applicant must submit to the Municipality documentation approved as to legal
sufficiency by the Municipality’s attorney that the Applicant has a sufficient property interest
in the property where the off-site facilities are located -- by easement, covenant or other
appropriate legal instrument -- to ensure that the facilities will be able to provide postconstruction
stormwater management for the Development and that the property will not be
altered in a way that interferes with the off-site facilities.
c. Where the Applicant proposes to retain ownership of the Stormwater Management
Facilities shown in its Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan, the Applicant shall
submit to the Municipality documentation, approved as to legal sufficiency by the
Municipality’s attorney that the Applicant, its successors, heirs and assigns shall have the
legal obligation and the resources available to operate, repair, maintain and replace the
stormwater management facilities. Applications for Development requiring Stormwater
Management Facilities that will not be dedicated to the Municipality shall enter into a
Maintenance Agreement with the Municipality. A sample of this Maintenance Agreement is
attached as Appendix 1 to this Article.
- 72 -
d. Whenever elements of the Stormwater Management Facilities are not within the
right-of-way of a public street and the facilities will not be offered to the Municipality for
acceptance as public facilities, the Municipal Permitting Authority may require that perpetual
easements not less than thirty (30) feet in width, conforming substantially with the lines of
existing natural drainage and in a form acceptable to the Municipality’s attorney, shall be
provided to the Municipality allowing access for maintenance, repair, replacement and
improvement of the Stormwater Management Facilities. When an offer of dedication is
required by the Municipal Permitting Authority, the Applicant shall be responsible for the
maintenance of these Stormwater Management Facilities under this Article until such time (if
ever) as they are accepted by the Municipality.
e. In addition to any other applicable requirements of this Article and the Municipality’s
Municipal Code of Articles, any Development which also requires a stormwater management
permit from the MEDEP under 38 M.R.S.A. 420-D shall comply with the rules adopted by
MEDEP under 38 M.R.S.A. 420-D(1), as the same may be amended from time to time, and
the applicant shall document such compliance to the Municipal Permitting Authority. Where
the standards or other provisions of such stormwater rules conflict with municipal
ordinances, the stricter (more protective) standard shall apply.
f. For developments that result in new road construction where the facilities will be
offered to the Municipality for acceptance, the applicant shall pay an amount equal to three
percent (3%) of the road and infrastructure costs, as determined by the Municipality. For any
developments that result in privately owned and maintained stormwater management
facilities, any persons required to file an annual certification under Section E.1 of this Article
shall pay an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the site infrastructure construction costs
(parking lots, driveways, utilities, lighting, etc.), as determined by the Municipality.
g. Notice of BMP Discharge to Municipality’s MS4. At the time of application, the
Applicant shall notify the Municipal Permitting Authority if its Post-Construction
Stormwater Management Plan includes any BMP(s) that will discharge to the Municipality’s
MS4 and shall include in this notification a listing of which BMP(s) will so discharge.
E. Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan Compliance
1. General Requirements. Any Person owning, leasing or having control over Stormwater
Management Facilities required by a Post-Construction Stormwater Management Plan under this
Article shall demonstrate compliance with that Plan as follows.
a. That Person shall, at least annually, inspect, clean and maintain the Stormwater
Management Facilities, including but not limited to any parking areas, catch basins, drainage
swales, detention basins and ponds, pipes and related structures, in accordance with all

H. Basis
The Town of Berwick enacts this “Post-Construction Stormwater Management Control Article”
(the “Article”) pursuant to 30-A M.R.S.A. § 3001 (municipal home rule ordinance authority), 38
M.R.S.A. § 413 (the “Wastewater Discharge Law”), 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq. (the “Clean Water
Act”), and 40 CFR Part 122 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s regulations governing the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”)). The Maine Department of
Environmental Protection, through its promulgation of the “General Permit for the Discharge of
Stormwater from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems,” has listed the Town of
Berwick as having a Regulated Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (“Small MS4”);
under this General Permit, listing as a Regulated Small MS4 necessitates enactment of this
Article as part of the Municipality’s Storm Water Management Program in order to satisfy the
minimum control measures required by Part IV D 5 (“Post-construction stormwater management
in Development”).
7.24 Safety and Sanitation Provisions
All lots shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition and shall be kept free of
accumulations of trash, garbage, refuse or other noxious materials which may constitute a fire
hazard or a danger to health or safety. Any such condition shall be repaired, replaced, or
removed.

ARTICLE VIII PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES AND LAND USES
The following standards shall apply to all uses, both conditional and permitted, as appropriate
in the various districts. See Article XIV for standards in the shoreland zone.
8.1 Campgrounds and Tenting Grounds.
Campgrounds shall conform to the minimum requirements imposed under state licensing
procedures and the following (in cases of possible conflict, the stricter rule shall apply):
A. General.
1. A campground must be constructed on at least ten acres of land, and all camping units or
structures shall be located at least 200 feet from any residence (except residences belonging to
the campground owners).
2. Campsites shall be laid out and screened in such a manner that none are within view
from public roads, navigable rivers, existing residences or approved subdivision lots. Any
combination of evergreen planting, landscaped earthen berms, or solid fencing may be used to
achieve this screening standard when campsites would otherwise be visible from the locations
described above.
3. No trailers other than recreational vehicles as defined herein shall be permitted within
any campground, temporarily or otherwise. No camping unit shall be stored or exhibited for
sale for commercial purposes within the park.
4. Tent sites and sites for recreational vehicles (RVs) shall be laid out so that the density of
each developed acre of land does not exceed the standards below (in terms of sites per acre of
land, excluding circulation roads):
Tent sites 14 per acre
RV Sites 11 per acre
B. Parking and Circulation.
1. A minimum of 300 square feet of off-street parking plus maneuvering space shall be
provided for each recreational vehicle, tent, or shelter site. Recreational vehicles shall be so
parked in spaces that:
a. there shall be a minimum of 25 feet between vehicles; and
b. there shall be a minimum of 45 feet between all recreational vehicles/tents and all
public rights of way located inside the boundaries of the campground.
2. Vehicular access shall be provided onto a hard-surfaced road adequate for the volume
and type of traffic likely to be generated. Grades and sight distances specified in the town's
subdivision regulations shall be observed in designing all intersections. Roads shall be
constructed of at least 12 inches of bank-run gravel (no stone larger than four inches), two
inches crushed gravel (1/2 inch chips) and two applications of liquid asphalt (1/2 gallon per
square yard each application). The minimum width of roadways shall be 12 feet for one-way
roads and 22 feet for two-way roads. No vehicle parking shall be permitted on the roadway.
C. Health and Safety.
- 80 -

transporting the refuse in a closed truck or in enclosed containers or bags to an approved
disposal area at least once a week.
2. A campground shall provide water and sewerage systems, sanitary stations, and
convenience facilities in accordance with the regulations of the State Plumbing Code. In no
case shall less than one toilet, lavatory and shower be provided for each sex for every ten
camping and tent sites. All recreational vehicle sites shall be equipped with water and sewage
hook-ups, connected to approved distribution or disposal systems.
3. Fire extinguishers capable of dealing with electrical and wood fires shall be kept in all
service buildings. A suitable ingress and egress shall be provided so that every campground

by the fire chief.
D. Planning and Review.
1. Roads, parking, campsites and required facilities shall be planned in accordance with the
basic principles outlined below and shall be shown on the proposed plan which is submitted for
review and approval as a conditional use.
a. A logical sequence of entry and circulation should be created: entrance,
administration and storage, parking, campsites, toilets and laundry, playing fields or shoreline.
b. Campsites should be clustered in groups according to intensity of use (low density,
medium density, etc.) and also related to common support service areas (laundries, play areas,
etc.) serving a number of campsite clusters. The purpose is to minimize road length, increase
accessibility, and preserve open space.
c. Footpaths and roads should follow "desire lines" of pedestrian and vehicular
movement between campsites and all jointly used facilities. Parking areas may be grassed,
reinforced with open concrete blocks.
d. Access roads shall be laid out as loops to the greatest extent that is practicable,
although "cul-de-sacs" or "dead-ends" may be allowed to serve up to 20 campsites.
2. An erosion and sedimentation control plan meeting the standards of the Maine Erosion
and Sediment Control BMP’s manual, published by the Maine Department of Environmental
Protection, March 2003. In addition to data on soils, slopes and drainage, a vegetation map
showing the following items may be required:
a. The major types of vegetation should be identified and described (as to age, height,
openness or density, and pattern either natural or reforested).
b. New plantings should be selected to provide screening and shelter, to tolerate existing
and proposed site conditions, and to blend compatibility with existing natural vegetation.
c. All vegetative clearing should avoid creating straight line edges between open land
and surviving stands.
e. Areas of activity and/or traffic should be sited to avoid wildlife areas (such as
thickets for birds and small mammals, or deer yards and trails).

where reuse is therefore not practicable or economically feasible, or where a building is not
judged to be a significant component of the neighborhood's overall architectural and historic
character, the Planning Board may approve plans to replace an existing residential building with
a proposed new professional office building whose scale and design would be appropriate to the
site and to the neighborhood. The Board shall seek the recommendation of a recognized
architectural authority before granting permission to demolish.
8.8 Cluster Developments.
A. Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to allow for new concepts of housing
development where variations of design may be allowed, provided that the net residential
density shall be no greater than is permitted in the district in which the development is
proposed. Notwithstanding other provisions of this ordinance relating to dimensional
requirements, the Planning Board, in reviewing and approving proposed residential
developments located in the town, may modify said provisions related to dimensional
requirements to permit flexibility in approaches to housing and environmental design in
accordance with the following standards. This shall not be construed as granting variances.
- 88 -
B. Application Procedure.
1. The Planning Board may require subdivision development on reduced lot size in return
for open space when greater than ten units are proposed and/or more than 50 percent of the
parcel is comprised of prime agriculture or forest land based on the Town's Prime Farmland and
Agriculture District Map found in the Town Code Enforcement Office. The developer shall
submit a written application to the Board for cluster development.

b. The subdivision of tracts into parcels with more than twice the required minimum
lot size shall be laid out in such a manner as either to provide for or preclude future
division.
c. If a lot on one side of a stream, road or other similar barrier fails to meet the
minimum requirements for lot size, it may not be combined with a lot on the other
side of the stream or road to meet the minimum lot size.
d. The ratio of lot length to width shall not be more than three to one. Flag lots and
other odd shaped lots in which narrow strips are joined to other parcels in order to
meet minimum lot size requirements are prohibited.
The number of buildable lots or dwelling units in the cluster development shall in no case
exceed the number of lots or dwelling units in a standard subdivision. Estimated costs of
infrastructure development (roads, utilities, etc.) shall accompany the plan.
3. The written statement shall describe the natural features which will be preserved or
enhanced by the cluster approach. Natural features include but are not limited to moderate to
high value wildlife and waterfowl habitats, important agricultural soils, moderate to high yield
aquifers and important natural or historic sites identified by the Comprehensive Plan as worthy
of preservation.
4. The statement shall also compare the impacts upon the town from each plan. Examples
of impacts are municipal cost for roads, school busing, solid waste removal and disposal, utility
efficiencies, recreational opportunities, protection of flood water storage areas, environmental
impacts on sensitive lands caused by construction activities, underground utilities, reclamation
of land and provision of land for conservation use.

a. Conformance with Comprehensive Plan: All proposed conditional uses and site plans
shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan of the Town of Berwick and with the provisions of all
pertinent federal, state, and local codes, ordinances, and regulations.
b. Preserve and enhance the landscape: The landscape shall be preserved in its natural
state insofar as practicable by minimizing tree removal, disturbance of soil, retaining existing
vegetation during construction. After construction is complete, landscape shall be designed and
planted that will define, soften or screen the appearance of off street parking areas from the right
of way and abutting properties and/or structures in order to enhance the physical design of the
building(s) or site, and to minimize the encroachment of the proposed use on the neighboring
land uses.
c. Relationship of the proposed buildings to the environment: Proposed structures shall
be related harmoniously to the terrain and to the existing buildings in the vicinity which have a
visual relationship to the proposed buildings. Special attention shall be paid to the bulk,
location and height of the building(s) and such natural features such as slope, soil type and
drainage ways.
d. Vehicular access: The proposed site layout shall provide for safe access and egress
from public and private roads by providing adequate location, numbers and controls of access
points including site distances, turning lanes, traffic signalization when required by existing and
projected traffic flow on municipal road systems.

circulation, including walkways, interior drives, and parking areas shall provide for safe general
interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, service traffic, loading areas,
and arrangements and use of parking areas.
f. Surface water drainage: Adequate provision shall be made for surface drainage so that
removal of surface waters will not adversely affect neighboring properties, downstream
conditions, soil erosion or the public storm drainage system. Whenever possible, on-site
absorption of unpolluted run-off waters shall be utilized to permit groundwater recharge on the
site.
g. Existing utilities: The development shall not impose an unreasonable burden on
sewers, sanitary and storm drains, water lines or other public utilities.
h. Advertising features: The size, location, design, lighting and materials of all exterior
signs and outdoor advertising structures or features shall not detract from the design of proposed
buildings and structures and the surrounding properties.
i. Special features of the development: Exposed storage areas, exposed machinery
installation, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings and similar structures shall have
sufficient setback and screening to provide an audio/visual buffer to minimize their adverse
impact on other land uses within the development area and surrounding properties.
j. Exterior lighting: All exterior lighting shall be designed to minimize adverse impact
on neighboring properties.
- 116 -
k. Emergency vehicle access: Provisions shall be made for providing and maintaining
convenient and safe emergency vehicle access to all buildings and structures.

on the municipal services including municipal road systems, fire department, police department,
solid waste program, sewer treatment plant, school, open spaces, recreational programs and
facilities, and other municipal service and facilities.
m. Will not result in water or air pollution: In making this determination, it shall at a
minimum consider: The elevation of the land above sea level and its relationship to the flood
plains, the nature of soils and subsoils and their ability to adequately support waste disposal; the
slope of the land and its attest on effluents; and the applicable state and local health and water
resources regulations.
n. Has sufficient water available for the reasonable foreseeable needs of the development
(this is usually considered to be ten years approximately).
o. Will provide for adequate sewerage waste disposal.
p. Will not have adverse affects on the scenic or natural beauty of the area, aesthetics, or
rare and irreplaceable natural areas.
q. The developer has adequate financial and technical capacity to meet the above stated
standards.
r. Whenever situated in whole or in part within 250 feet of any pond, lake or river, will
not adversely affect the quality of such body of water or affect the shoreline of such body of
water, based on the standards outlined in Section 9.8.I.1.j.
s. Low Impact Design: Each applicant is required to submit a statement to the Planning
Board documenting proposed Low Impact Design (LID) for the site, which will help to reduce
storm water volumes and help to enhance storm water quality. LID includes, but is not limited
to green roofs, rain gardens, tree wells, infiltration basins, and permeable pavement.
J. Additional Requirements Attached to Conditional Uses and Site Plan Review
Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the Planning Board may attach such conditions
in addition to those required in this ordinance that it finds necessary to further the purposes of
this ordinance. Violation of any of these conditions shall be violation of this ordinance. Such

B. Variances. To authorize variances upon appeal in specific cases, but only within the
limitations set forth in this ordinance
C. Interpretations of the ordinance.
10.4 Variances.
Variances may be permitted only under the following conditions:
A. Unless otherwise provided in this ordinance, variances are obtainable only for height,
minimum lot size, minimum lot width, structure size, setbacks and open space requirements.
B. Variances cannot, under any circumstances, be obtainable for establishment of any uses
otherwise prohibited.
C. The Board of Appeals shall not grant a variance unless it finds that all the following criteria
are met:
1. That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted;
2. That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to
the general conditions in the neighborhood;
- 120 -
3. That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality; and
4. That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner. Such
hardship may be found by the Board of Appeals where the Town of Berwick Land Use
Ordinance, as applied to the applicant's property, substantially destroys or decreases the value of
the property in question for any permitted use to which the land or property can reasonably be
put. Mere inconvenience to the property owner shall not satisfy this requirement. Neither
financial hardship alone nor pleading that a greater profit may be realized from the applicant's
property were a variance granted shall be sufficient evidence of unnecessary hardship.
D. The Board shall limit any variances granted as strictly as possible in order to preserve the
terms of the ordinance as much as possible, and it may impose such conditions to a variance as
it deems necessary, to this end.
E. Disability Variance. The Board may grant a variance to a property owner for the purpose of
making that property accessible to a person with a disability who is living on the property. The
Board shall restrict any variance granted under this subsection solely to the installation of
equipment or the construction of structures necessary for access to or egress from the property
by the person with the disability. The Board may impose conditions on the variance, including
limiting the variance to the duration of the disability or to the time that the person with the
disability lives on the property. For the purposes of this section, a disability has the same
meaning as a physical or mental handicap under 5 M.R.S.A., Section 4553 and the term
"structures necessary for access to or egress from the property" is defined to include railing,
wall or roof systems necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the structure.
F. Setback Variance for Single-Family Dwellings. An ordinance adopted under this subsection
may permit a variance from a set-back requirement only when strict application of the zoning
ordinance to the petitioner and the petitioner’s property would cause undue hardship. The term
“undue hardship” as used in this subsection means:
1. The need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to
the general conditions in the neighborhood.
2. The granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality;
3. The hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner;
4. The granting of the variance will not substantially reduce or impair the use of the
abutting property; and
5. That the granting of the variance is based upon demonstrated need, not convenience,
and no other feasible alternative is available.
10.5 Appeals to the Board of Appeals.
A. Making an Appeal
1. An appeal may be taken to the Board of Appeals by an aggrieved person from any
decision of the Code Enforcement Officer. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the

10.6 Decisions of the Board of Appeals.
A. The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse

submitted to the Department of Environmental Protection within 14 days of the decision.
10.7 Stay of Proceedings.
An appeal stays all legal proceedings in a furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the
officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal has been

cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a court of record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the
appeal is taken, and on due cause shown.

made a part of this Article:
(1) Resource Protection
(2) Limited Residential
(3) Shoreland Commercial Industrial
(4) Stream Protection
B. Scale of Map. The Official Shoreland Zoning Map shall be drawn at a scale of not less than: 1
inch = 2000 feet. District boundaries shall be clearly delineated and a legend indicating the
symbols for each district shall be placed on the map.

depicting its shoreland zone.
C. Certification of Official Shoreland Zoning Map. The Official Shoreland Zoning Map shall be
certified by the attested signature of the Municipal Clerk and shall be located in the municipal
office.
D. Changes to the Official Shoreland Zoning Map. If amendments, in accordance with Section 4.8,

14.10 Interpretation of District Boundaries. Unless otherwise set forth on the Official Shoreland
Zoning Map, district boundary lines are property lines, the centerlines of streets, roads and rights of
way, and the boundaries of the shoreland area as defined herein. Where uncertainty exists as to the
exact location of district boundary lines, the Board of Appeals shall be the final authority as to
location.
NOTE: Municipalities are encouraged to incorporate specific written descriptions of district
boundaries into the Article so that disputes over district boundaries are minimized. The Maine
Supreme Judicial Court has held that the Official Shoreland Zoning Map is the primary tool to which
to refer in determining district boundaries under ordinances that are not more explicit in their district
descriptions than the language of the Guidelines, and that where there is inconsistency between the
Map and these general text descriptions of the shoreland districts as provided in the minimum
guidelines, the Map prevails.
14.11 Land Use Requirements. Except as hereinafter specified, no building, structure or land shall
hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, expanded, moved, or altered and no new lot shall be created except in conformity with
all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located, unless a variance is
granted.
14.12 Non-conformance.
A. Purpose. It is the intent of this Article to promote land use conformities, except that nonconforming
conditions that existed before the effective date of this Article or amendments
thereto shall be allowed to continue, subject to the requirements set forth in Article 12. Except
as otherwise provided in this Article, a non-conforming condition shall not be permitted to
become more non-conforming.
B. General
(1) Transfer of Ownership. Non-conforming structures, lots, and uses may be transferred,
and the new owner may continue the non-conforming use or continue to use the nonconforming
structure or lot, subject to the provisions of this Article.
(2) Repair and Maintenance. This Article allows, without a permit, the normal upkeep and
maintenance of non-conforming uses and structures including repairs or renovations that do
not involve expansion of the non-conforming use or structure, and such other changes in a
non-conforming use or structure as federal, state, or local building and safety codes may
require.
C. Non-conforming Structures
(1) Expansions. A non-conforming structure may be added to or expanded after obtaining a
permit from the same permitting authority as that for a new structure, if such addition or
expansion does not increase the non-conformity of the structure, and is in accordance with
subparagraphs (a), and (b) below.
- 130 -
(a) Legally existing non-conforming principal and accessory structures that do not meet the
water body, tributary stream, or wetland setback requirements may be expanded or
altered as follows, as long as all other applicable standards contained in this Ordinance
are met.
i. Expansion of any portion of a structure within 25 feet, horizontal distance, of the
normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland is
prohibited, even if the expansion will not increase nonconformity with the water body,
tributary stream or wetland setback requirement.
ii. Expansion of an accessory structure that is located closer to the normal high-water
line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland than the principal
structure is prohibited, even if the expansion will not increase nonconformity with the
water body or wetland setback requirement.
iii. For structures located less than 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal highwater
line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland, the
maximum combined total floor area for all portions of those structures within that 75-
foot distance is 1,000 square feet, and the maximum height of any portion of a
structure that is within 75 feet, horizontal distance, of a water body, tributary stream
or upland edge of a wetland is 20 feet or the height of the existing structure,
whichever is greater.
iv. For structures located less than 100 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal highwater
line of a great pond classified as GPA or a river flowing to a great pond
classified as GPA, the maximum combined total floor area for all portions of those
structures within that 100-foot distance is 1,500 square feet, and the maximum height
of any portion of a structure that is within 100 feet, horizontal distance, of a great
pond is 25 feet or the height of the existing structure, whichever is greater, except that
any portion of those structures located less than 75 feet, horizontal distance from the
normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a
wetland must meet the floor area and height limits of division (iii).
- 131 -
For the purposes of Section 14.12(C)(1)(a), a basement is not counted toward floor
area.
(b) Whenever a new, enlarged, or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming
structure, the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the
setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning
Board or its designee, basing its decision on the criteria specified in Section 14.12(C)(2)
Relocation, below. If the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior
dimensions of the structure and the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated
by more than three (3) additional feet, as measured from the uphill side of the structure, it
shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure.
NOTE: The special expansion allowance provided below is available to municipalities
that wish to allow a greater expansion limit if the landowner has maintained a
quality 50 foot buffer along the water body, tributary stream or wetland, or agrees
to plant such a buffer, and agrees to implement certain measures to reduce erosion
and sedimentation from the property. If the municipality does not have adequate
resources to ensure compliance with this provision, the department recommends
that it not be incorporated into the ordinance.
(1-A) Special expansion allowance. Existing principal and accessory structures that exceed the
floor area or height limits set in Section 14.12(C)(1)(a)(iii) and 14.12(C)(1)(a)(iv) above,
may not be expanded, except that the limits may be exceeded by not more than 500 square
feet provided that all of the following requirements are met.
(a) The principal structure is set back at least 50 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal
high-water line of a water body, tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland.
(b) A well-distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation as defined in Section
14.15(Q)(2)(b), extends at least 50 feet, horizontal distance, in depth as measured from
the normal high-water line or upland edge for the entire width of the property.
If a well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation meeting the requirements of
Section 14.15(Q)(2)(b) is not present, the 500 square foot special expansion allowance
may be permitted only in conjunction with a written plan, including a scaled site drawing,
by the property owner, and approved by the Planning Board or its designee, to reestablish
a buffer of trees, shrubs, and other ground cover within 50 feet, horizontal distance, of the
shoreline or tributary stream.
(c) Adjacent to great ponds classified GPA and rivers flowing to great ponds classified GPA,
except for the allowable footpath, there exists complete natural ground cover, consisting
of forest duff, shrubs and other woody and herbaceous vegetation within 50 feet,
horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line. Where natural ground cover is lacking
the area must be supplemented with leaf or bark mulch and plantings of native shrubs,
and other woody and herbaceous vegetation in quantities sufficient to retard erosion and
provide for effective infiltration of stormwater.
- 132 -
(d)A written plan by the property owner, including a scaled site drawing, is approved by the
Planning Board and is developed, implemented, and maintained to address the following
mitigation measures for the property within the shoreland zone.
(i)Unstabilized areas resulting in soil erosion must be mulched, seeded, or otherwise
stabilized and maintained to prevent further erosion and sedimentation to water
bodies, tributary streams, and wetlands.
(ii)Roofs and associated drainage systems, driveways, parking areas, and other
nonvegetated surfaces must be designed or modified, as necessary, to prevent
concentrated flow of storm water runoff from reaching a water body, tributary stream
or wetland, Where possible, runoff must be directed through a vegetated area or
infiltrated into the soil through the use of a dry well, stone apron, or similar device.
(1-B) Planting requirements. Any planting or revegetation required as a condition to the Special
Expansion Allowance must be in accordance with a written plan drafted by a qualified
professional, be implemented at the time of construction, and be designed to meet the rating
scores contained in paragraph (b) and the ground cover requirements of paragraph (c) when
the vegetation matures within the 50 foot strip. At a minimum, the plan must provide for the
establishment of a well-distributed planting of saplings spaced so that there is at least one
sapling per 80 square feet of newly established buffer. Planted saplings may be no less than
three (3) feet tall for coniferous species and no less than six feet tall for deciduous species.
The planting plan must include a mix of at least three native tree species found growing in
adjacent areas, with no one species making up more than 50% of the number of saplings
planted unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board or its designee, based on adjacent
stand comparison. All aspects of the implemented plan must be maintained by the applicant
and future owners.
`
NOTE: Municipalities are encouraged to specify those professions which they deem qualified to
prepare planting and mitigation plans, taking into account the availability of those
professionals in the region. Such professionals may include, but are not limited to,
foresters, arborists, landscape architects, and landscape contractors.
(1-C) Filing and reporting requirements. Written plans required pursuant to Section 14.12(C)(1-
A)(d) must be filed with the registry of deeds of the county in which the property is located.
A copy of all permits issued pursuant to this section must be forwarded by the municipality to
the department within 14 days of the issuance of the permit.
(2) Relocation. A non-conforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the
parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all
setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board or
its designee, and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage
disposal system meets the requirements of State law and the State of Maine Subsurface
Wastewater Disposal Rules (Rules), or that a new system can be installed in compliance with
the law and said Rules. In no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the
structure to be more non-conforming.
In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical
extent, the Planning Board or its designee shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the
- 133 -
land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of other structures on the property and on
adjacent properties, the location of the septic system and other on-site soils suitable for septic
systems, and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation.
When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order
to relocate a structure, the Planning Board shall require replanting of native vegetation to
compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In addition, the area from which the relocated
structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation. Replanting shall be required as
follows:
(a) Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native
tree, three (3) feet in height, for every tree removed. If more than five trees are planted,
no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted.
Replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that
were removed.
Other woody and herbaceous vegetation, and ground cover, that are removed or
destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be re-established. An area at least the
same size as the area where vegetation and/or ground cover was disturbed, damaged, or
removed must be reestablished within the setback area. The vegetation and/or ground
cover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or ground cover that was disturbed,
destroyed or removed.
(b) Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the
structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses, shrubs, trees, or
a combination thereof.
(3) Reconstruction or Replacement. Any non-conforming structure which is located less
than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream, or wetland and which is
removed, or damaged or destroyed, regardless of the cause, by more than 50% of the market
value of the structure before such damage, destruction or removal, may be reconstructed or
replaced provided that a permit is obtained within eighteen (18) months of the date of said
damage, destruction, or removal, and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in
compliance with the water body, tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the
greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board or its designee in accordance
with the purposes of this Article. In no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so
as to increase its non-conformity. If the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than
the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure, except as allowed
pursuant to Section 14.12(C)(1) above, as determined by the non-conforming floor area and
volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location. If the total amount of
floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the
required setback area, no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced
or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure. When it is necessary
to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure, vegetation shall be
replanted in accordance with Section 14.12(C)(2) above.
Any non-conforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water
body, tributary stream, or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value,
or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure, excluding
- 134 -
normal maintenance and repair, may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from
the Code Enforcement Officer within one year of such damage, destruction, or removal.
In determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the
greatest practical extent the Planning Board or its designee shall consider, in addition to the
criteria in Section 14.12(C)(2) above, the physical condition and type of foundation present,
if any.
(4) Change of Use of a Non-conforming Structure. The use of a non-conforming structure
may not be changed to another use unless the Planning Board, after receiving a written
application, determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the water
body, tributary stream, or wetland, or on the subject or adjacent properties and resources than
the existing use.
In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the Planning Board shall require
written documentation from the applicant, regarding the probable effects on public health and
safety, erosion and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative cover,
visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural beauty, floodplain management,
archaeological and historic resources, and commercial fishing and maritime activities, and
other functionally water-dependent uses.
D. Non-conforming Uses
(1) Expansions. Expansions of non-conforming uses are prohibited, except that nonconforming
residential uses may, after obtaining a permit from the Planning Board, be
expanded within existing residential structures or within expansions of such structures as
allowed in 14.12(C)(1)(a) above.
(2) Resumption Prohibited. A lot, building or structure in or on which a non-conforming use
is discontinued for a period exceeding one year, or which is superseded by a conforming use,
may not again be devoted to a non-conforming use except that the Planning Board may, for
good cause shown by the applicant, grant up to a one year extension to that time period. This
provision shall not apply to the resumption of a use of a residential structure provided that the
structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes during the preceding five (5)
year period.
(3) Change of Use. An existing non-conforming use may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that the proposed use has no greater adverse impact on the subject
and adjacent properties and resources than the former use, as determined by the Planning
Board. The determination of no greater adverse impact shall be made according to criteria
listed in Section 14.12(C)(4) above.
E. Non-conforming Lots
(1) Non-conforming Lots: A non-conforming lot of record as of the effective date of this
Article or amendment thereto may be built upon, without the need for a variance, provided
that such lot is in separate ownership and not contiguous with any other lot in the same
ownership, and that all provisions of this Article except lot area, lot width and shore frontage
- 135 -
can be met. Variances relating to setback or other requirements not involving lot area, lot
width or shore frontage shall be obtained by action of the Board of Appeals.
(2) Contiguous Built Lots: If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in a single or joint
ownership of record at the time of adoption of this Article, if all or part of the lots do not
meet the dimensional requirements of this Article, and if a principal use or structure exists on
each lot, the non-conforming lots may be conveyed separately or together, provided that the
State Minimum Lot Size Law (12 M.R.S.A. sections 4807-A through 4807-D) and the State
of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied with.
If two or more principal uses or structures existed on a single lot of record on the
effective date of this Article, each may be sold on a separate lot provided that the above
referenced law and rules are complied with. When such lots are divided each lot thus created
must be as conforming as possible to the dimensional requirements of this Article.
(3) Contiguous Lots - Vacant or Partially Built: If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are
in single or joint ownership of record at the time of or since adoption or amendment of this
Article, if any of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional requirements of this
Article or subsequent amendments, and if one or more of the lots are vacant or contain no
principal structure the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to meet the dimensional
requirements.
This provision shall not apply to 2 or more contiguous lots, at least one of which is nonconforming,
owned by the same person or persons on the effective date of this Article and
recorded in the registry of deeds if the lot is served by a public sewer or can accommodate a
subsurface sewage disposal system in conformance with the State of Maine Subsurface
Wastewater Disposal Rules; and
(a) Each lot contains at least 100 feet of shore frontage and at least 20,000 square feet of lot
area; or
(b) Any lots that do not meet the frontage and lot size requirements of 14.12(E)(3)(a) are
reconfigured or combined so that each new lot contains at least 100 feet of shore frontage
and 20,000 square feet of lot area.
14.13 Establishment of Districts
A. Resource Protection District. The Resource Protection District includes areas in which
development would adversely affect water quality, productive habitat, biological ecosystems, or
scenic and natural values. This district shall include the following areas when they occur within
the limits of the shoreland zone, exclusive of the Stream Protection District, except that areas
which are currently developed and areas which meet the criteria for the Shoreland Commercial
Industrial need not be included within the Resource Protection District.
(1) Areas within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of freshwater wetlands, and
wetlands associated with great ponds and rivers, which are rated "moderate" or "high" value
waterfowl and wading bird habitat, including nesting and feeding areas, by the Maine
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIF&W) that are depicted on a Geographic
Information System (GIS) data layer maintained by either MDIF&W or the Department as of
- 136 -
December 31, 2008. For the purposes of this paragraph “wetlands associated with great
ponds and rivers” shall mean areas characterized by non-forested wetland vegetation and
hydric soils that are contiguous with a great pond or river, and have a surface elevation at or
below the water level of the great pond or river during the period of normal high water.
“Wetlands associated with great ponds or rivers” are considered to be part of that great pond
or river.
(2) Floodplains along rivers and floodplains along artificially formed great ponds along
rivers, defined by the 100 year floodplain as designated on the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard Boundary

floodplain soils.
(3) Areas of two or more contiguous acres with sustained slopes of 20% or greater.
(4) Areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres supporting wetland vegetation and hydric
soils, which are not part of a freshwater wetland as defined, and which are not surficially
connected to a water body during the period of normal high water.
NOTE: These areas usually consist of forested wetlands abutting water bodies and nonforested
wetlands.
(5) Land areas along rivers subject to severe bank erosion, undercutting, or river bed
movement.
B. Limited Residential District. The Limited Residential District includes those areas suitable for
residential and recreational development. It includes areas other than those in the Resource
Protection District, or Stream Protection District, and areas which are used less intensively than
those in the Shoreland Commercial Industrial District.
C. Shoreland Commercial Industrial District. The Shoreland Commercial Industrial District
includes the following types of existing, intensively developed areas:
(1) Areas of two or more contiguous acres devoted to commercial, industrial or intensive
recreational activities, or a mix of such activities, including but not limited to the following:

areas within two-hundred and fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line
of a great pond, or river, or within two hundred and fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the
upland edge of a freshwater wetland. Where a stream and its associated shoreland area are
located within two-hundred and fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the above water bodies or
wetlands, that land area shall be regulated under the terms of the shoreland district associated
with that water body or wetland.
14.14 Table of Land Uses.
All land use activities in the shoreland zone, as indicated in the Land Use Table in Section 6.2, shall
conform with all of the applicable land use standards in Section 14.15. The district designation for a

(2) Land below the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland and
land beneath roads serving more than two (2) lots shall not be included toward
calculating minimum lot area.
(3) Lots located on opposite sides of a public or private road shall be considered each a
separate tract or parcel of land unless such road was established by the owner of land on
both sides thereof after September 22, 1971.
(4) The minimum width of any portion of any lot within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland shall
be equal to or greater than the shore frontage requirement for a lot with the proposed use.
(5) If more than one residential dwelling unit, principal governmental, institutional,
commercial or industrial structure or use, or combination thereof, is constructed or
established on a single parcel, all dimensional requirements shall be met for each
additional dwelling unit, principal structure, or use.
B. Principal and Accessory Structures
(1) All new principal and accessory structures shall be set back at least one hundred (100)
feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of great ponds classified GPA and
rivers that flow to great ponds classified GPA, and one hundred (100) feet, horizontal
distance, from the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the
upland edge of a wetland, except that in the Shoreland Commercial Industrial District the
setback from the normal high-water line shall be at least twenty five (25) feet, horizontal
distance. In the Resource Protection District the setback requirement shall be 250 feet,
horizontal distance, except for structures, roads, parking spaces or other regulated objects
specifically allowed in that district in which case the setback requirements specified above
shall apply.
In addition:
(a)The water body, tributary stream, or wetland setback provision shall neither apply to
structures which require direct access to the water body or wetland as an operational
necessity, such as piers, docks and retaining walls, nor to other functionally waterdependent
uses.
(b) On a non-conforming lot of record on which only a residential structure exists, and it is
not possible to place an accessory structure meeting the required water body, tributary
stream or wetland setbacks, the code enforcement officer may issue a permit to place a
single accessory structure, with no utilities, for the storage of yard tools and similar
equipment. Such accessory structure shall not exceed eighty (80) square feet in area or
eight (8) feet in height, and shall be located as far from the shoreline or tributary stream
as practical and shall meet all other applicable standards, including lot coverage and
vegetation clearing limitations. In no case shall the structure be located closer to the
shoreline or tributary stream than the principal structure.
NOTE: A tributary stream may be perennial or intermittent. Where a tributary stream is
present within the shoreland zone, setback standards from that tributary stream are
applicable.
- 139 -
(2) Principal or accessory structures and expansions of existing structures which are
permitted in the Resource Protection, Limited Residential, and Stream Protection Districts,
shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet in height, and shall not exceed forty-five (45) feet in
height in the Shoreland Commercial/Industrial District. This provision shall not apply to
structures such as transmission towers, windmills, antennas, and similar structures having no
floor area.
(3) The lowest floor elevation or openings of all buildings and structures, including
basements, shall be elevated at least one foot above the elevation of the 100 year flood, the
flood of record, or in the absence of these, the flood as defined by soil types identified as
recent flood-plain soils. In those municipalities that participate in the National Flood
Insurance Program and have adopted the April 2005 version, or later version, of the
Floodplain Management Ordinance, accessory structures may be placed in accordance with
the standards of that ordinance and need not meet the elevation requirements of this
paragraph.
(4) The total footprint area of all structures, parking lots and other non-vegetated surfaces,
within the shoreland zone shall not exceed twenty (20) percent of the lot or a portion thereof,
located within the shoreland zone, including land area previously developed, except in the
Shoreland Commercial Industrial District adjacent to rivers that do not flow to great ponds
classified GPA where lot coverage shall not exceed seventy (70) percent.
(5) Notwithstanding the requirements stated above, stairways or similar structures may be
allowed with a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer, to provide shoreline access in
areas of steep slopes or unstable soils provided: that the structure is limited to a maximum of
four (4) feet in width; that the structure does not extend below or over the normal high-water
line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland, (unless permitted by the Department of
Environmental Protection pursuant to the Natural Resources Protection Act, 38 M.R.S.A.
section 480-C); and that the applicant demonstrates that no reasonable access alternative
exists on the property.
C. Piers, Docks, Wharves, Bridges and Other Structures and Uses Extending Over or Below the
Normal High-Water Line of a Water Body or Within a Wetland.
(1) Access from shore shall be developed on soils appropriate for such use and constructed
so as to control erosion.
(2) The location shall not interfere with existing developed or natural beach areas.
(3) The facility shall be located so as to minimize adverse effects on fisheries.
(4) The facility shall be no larger in dimension than necessary to carry on the activity and be
consistent with the surrounding character and uses of the area. A temporary pier, dock or
wharf shall not be wider than six feet for non-commercial uses.
(5) No new structure shall be built on, over or abutting a pier, wharf, dock or other structure
extending beyond the normal high-water line of a water body or within a wetland unless the
structure requires direct access to the water body or wetland as an operational necessity.
- 140 -
(6) New permanent piers and docks shall not be permitted unless it is clearly demonstrated to
the Planning Board that a temporary pier or dock is not feasible, and a permit has been
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection, pursuant to the Natural
Resources Protection Act.
(7) No existing structures built on, over or abutting a pier, dock, wharf or other structure
extending beyond the normal high-water line of a water body or within a wetland shall be
converted to residential dwelling units in any district.
(8) Except in the Shoreland Commercial Industrial Districts structures built on, over or
abutting a pier, wharf, dock or other structure extending beyond the normal high-water line
of a water body or within a wetland shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height above the
pier, wharf, dock or other structure.
NOTE: New permanent structures, and expansions thereof, projecting into or over water
bodies shall require a permit from the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to
the Natural Resources Protection Act, 38 M.R.S.A. section 480-C. Permits may also be
required from the Army Corps of Engineers if located in navigable waters.
F. Individual Private Campsites. Individual private campsites not associated with campgrounds are
allowed provided the following conditions are met:
(1) One campsite per lot existing on the effective date of this Article, or thirty thousand
(30,000) square feet of lot area within the shoreland zone, whichever is less, may be
permitted.
(2) Campsite placement on any lot, including the area intended for a recreational vehicle or
tent platform, shall be set back one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal
high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or river flowing to a great pond classified
GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of
other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland.
(3) Only one recreational vehicle shall be allowed on a campsite. The recreational vehicle
shall not be located on any type of permanent foundation except for a gravel pad, and no
structure except a canopy shall be attached to the recreational vehicle.
(4) The clearing of vegetation for the siting of the recreational vehicle, tent or similar shelter
in a Resource Protection District shall be limited to one thousand (1000) square feet.

- 142 -
I. Parking Areas
(1) Parking areas shall meet the shoreline and tributary stream setback requirements for
structures for the district in which such areas are located. The setback requirement for
parking areas serving public boat launching facilities in Districts other than the Shoreland
Commercial Industrial District shall be no less than fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, from
the shoreline or tributary stream if the Planning Board finds that no other reasonable
alternative exists further from the shoreline or tributary stream.
(2) Parking areas shall be adequately sized for the proposed use and shall be designed to
meet the stormwater performance standards in Article 7.17, and to meet the Stormwater
Management in Maine manual, published by the Maine Department of Environmental
Protection, January 2006, where applicable. Privately owned stormwater management
facilities shall be maintained in accordance with Article 7.23.
(3) In determining the appropriate size of proposed parking facilities, the following shall
apply:
(a) Typical parking space: Approximately ten (10) feet wide and twenty (20) feet long,
except that parking spaces for a vehicle and boat trailer shall be forty (40) feet long.
(b) Internal travel aisles: Approximately twenty (20) feet wide.
J. Roads and Driveways. The following standards shall apply to the construction of roads and/or
driveways and drainage systems, culverts and other related features.
(1) Roads and driveways shall be set back at least one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal
distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river that flows
to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance from the
normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a
wetland unless no reasonable alternative exists as determined by the Planning Board. If no
other reasonable alternative exists, the road and/or driveway setback requirement shall be no
less than fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, upon clear showing by the applicant that
appropriate techniques will be used to prevent sedimentation of the water body, tributary
stream, or wetland. Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and built
according to the standards of the Maine Erosion and Sediment Control BMP’s manual,
published by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, March 2003.
On slopes of greater than twenty (20) percent the road and/or driveway setback shall be
increased by ten (10) feet, horizontal distance, for each five (5) percent increase in slope
above twenty (20) percent.
Section 14.15 (I)(1) does not apply to approaches to water crossings or to roads or
driveways that provide access to permitted structures and facilities located nearer to the
shoreline or tributary stream due to an operational necessity, excluding temporary docks for
recreational uses. Roads and driveways providing access to permitted structures within the
setback area shall comply fully with the requirements of Section 14.15(I)(1) except for that
portion of the road or driveway necessary for direct access to the structure.
- 143 -
(2) Existing public roads may be expanded within the legal road right of way regardless of
their setback from a water body, tributary stream or wetland.
(3) New roads and driveways are prohibited in a Resource Protection District except that the
Planning Board may grant a permit to construct a road or driveway to provide access to
permitted uses within the district. A road or driveway may also be approved by the Planning
Board in a Resource Protection District, upon a finding that no reasonable alternative route or
location is available outside the district. When a road or driveway is permitted in a Resource
Protection District the road and/or driveway shall be set back as far as practicable from the
normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland.
(4) Road and driveway banks shall be no steeper than a slope of two (2) horizontal to one (1)
vertical, and shall be graded and stabilized in accordance with the provisions for erosion and
sedimentation control contained in Section 14.15(R).
(5) Road and driveway grades shall be no greater than ten (10) percent except for segments
of less than two hundred (200) feet.
(6) In order to prevent road and driveway surface drainage from directly entering water
bodies, tributary streams or wetlands, roads and driveways shall be designed, constructed,
and maintained to empty onto an unscarified buffer strip at least (50) feet plus two times the
average slope, in width between the outflow point of the ditch or culvert and the normal
high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland. Surface
drainage which is directed to an unscarified buffer strip shall be diffused or spread out to
promote infiltration of the runoff and to minimize channelized flow of the drainage through
the buffer strip.
(7) Ditch relief (cross drainage) culverts, drainage dips and water turnouts shall be installed
in a manner effective in directing drainage onto unscarified buffer strips before the flow
gains sufficient volume or head to erode the road, driveway, or ditch. To accomplish this, the
following shall apply:
(a) Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and associated water turnouts shall be spaced along
the road or driveway at intervals no greater than indicated in the following table:

natural runoff control features, such as berms, swales, terraces and wooded areas, shall be
retained in order to reduce runoff and encourage infiltration of stormwaters.
(2) Storm water runoff control systems shall be maintained as necessary to ensure proper
functioning, in accordance with Article 7.23.
NOTE: The Stormwater Management Law (38 M.R.S.A. section 420-D) requires a Stormwater
Management permit to be obtained from the Maine DEP prior to construction of a project consisting
of 20,000 square feet or more of impervious area or 5 acres or more of a developed area in an urban
impaired stream watershed or most-at-risk lake watershed, or a project with 1 acre or more of
- 145 -
developed area in any other stream, or wetland watershed. A Stormwater Permit-By-Rule is
necessary for a project with one acre or more of disturbed area but less than 1 acre impervious area
(20,000 square feet for most-at-risk lakes and urban impaired streams) and less than 5 acres of
developed area. Any development that disturbs more than one acre, but does not require any of the
following: A Stormwater Permit-By-Rule (under MEDEP Chapter 500), a full Stormwater Law
Permit (under MEDEP Chapter 500) or a Site Law Permit (under Site Location of Development, 38
M.R.S.A., Article 6 Sections 481-490), is required by MEDEP to conform to the Maine Construction
General Permit (MGCP) and submit a Notice of Intent (NOI). Developments that do require permits
under MEDEP Chapter 500 or Site Location of Development are required to comply with the
substantive requirements of MCGP, but are not required to submit a separate NOI.
M. Septic Waste Disposal
(1) All subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be installed in conformance with the State

of woody vegetation necessary to site a new system and any associated fill extensions, shall
not extend closer than seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water
line of a water body or the upland edge of a wetland and b) a holding tank is not allowed for
a first-time residential use in the shoreland zone.
NOTE: The Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules require new systems,
excluding fill extensions, to be constructed no less than one hundred (100) horizontal feet
from the normal high-water line of a perennial water body. The minimum setback distance
for a new subsurface disposal system may not be reduced by variance.
N. Essential Services
(1) Where feasible, the installation of essential services shall be limited to existing public
ways and existing service corridors.
(2) The installation of essential services, other than road-side distribution lines, is not
allowed in a Resource Protection or Stream Protection District, except to provide services to
a permitted use within said district, or except where the applicant demonstrates that no
reasonable alternative exists. Where allowed, such structures and facilities shall be located
so as to minimize any adverse impacts on surrounding uses and resources, including visual
impacts.
(3) Damaged or destroyed public utility transmission and distribution lines, towers and
related equipment may be replaced or reconstructed without a permit.
O. Mineral Exploration and Extraction. Mineral exploration to determine the nature or extent of
mineral resources shall be accomplished by hand sampling, test boring, or other methods which
create minimal disturbance of less than one hundred (100) square feet of ground surface. A
permit from the Code Enforcement Officer shall be required for mineral exploration which
exceeds the above limitation. All excavations, including test pits and holes, shall be immediately
capped, filled or secured by other equally effective measures to restore disturbed areas and to
protect the public health and safety.
Mineral extraction may be permitted under the following conditions:
- 146 -
(1) A reclamation plan shall be filed with, and approved, by the Planning Board before a
permit is granted. Such plan shall describe in detail procedures to be undertaken to fulfill the
requirements of Section 14.15 (N)(4) below.
(2) No part of any extraction operation, including drainage and runoff control features, shall
be permitted within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water
line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and
within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of any other
water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland. Extraction operations shall not
be permitted within fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, of any property line without written
permission of the owner of such adjacent property.
(3) Within twelve (12) months following the completion of extraction operations at any
extraction site, which operations shall be deemed complete when less than one hundred (100)
cubic yards of materials are removed in any consecutive twelve (12) month period, ground
levels and grades shall be established in accordance with the following:
(a) All debris, stumps, and similar material shall be removed for disposal in an approved
location, or shall be buried on-site. Only materials generated on-site may be buried or
covered on-site.
NOTE: The State of Maine Solid Waste Laws, 38 M.R.S.A., section 1301 and the solid
waste management rules, Chapters 400-419 of the Department of Environmental
Protection's regulations may contain other applicable provisions regarding disposal of
such materials.
(b) The final graded slope shall be two and one-half to one (2 1/2:1) slope or flatter.
(c) Top soil or loam shall be retained to cover all disturbed land areas, which shall be
reseeded and stabilized with vegetation native to the area. Additional topsoil or loam
shall be obtained from off-site sources if necessary to complete the stabilization project.
(4) In keeping with the purposes of this Article, the Planning Board may impose such
conditions as are necessary to minimize the adverse impacts associated with mineral
extraction operations on surrounding uses and resources.
P. Agriculture
(1) All spreading of manure shall be accomplished in conformance with the Manure
Utilization Guidelines published by the Maine Department of Agriculture on November 1,
2001, and the Nutrient Management Law (7 M.R.S.A. sections 4201-4209).
(2) Manure shall not be stored or stockpiled within two-hundred fifty (250) feet, horizontal
distance, of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, or
within one hundred (100) feet horizontal distance, of other water bodies, tributary streams, or
wetlands. All manure storage areas within the shoreland zone must be constructed or
modified such that the facility produces no discharge of effluent or contaminated storm
water.
- 147 -
(3) Agricultural activities involving tillage of soil greater than forty thousand (40,000) square
feet in surface area, within the shoreland zone shall require a Conservation Plan to be filed
with the Planning Board. Non-conformance with the provisions of said plan shall be
considered to be a violation of this Article.
(4) There shall be no new tilling of soil within two hundred fifty (250) feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA; within one hundred
(100) feet, horizontal distance, from other water bodies; nor within one hundred (100) feet,
horizontal distance, of tributary streams and freshwater wetlands. Operations in existence on
the effective date of this Article and not in conformance with this provision may be
maintained.
(5) Newly established livestock grazing areas shall not be permitted within two hundred fifty
(250) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA;
within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of other water bodies, nor; within one
hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of tributary streams and freshwater wetlands.
Livestock grazing associated with ongoing farm activities, and which are not in conformance
with the above setback provisions may continue, provided that such grazing is conducted in
accordance with a Conservation Plan.
(6) If fertilizer will be applied within one hundred (100) feet horizontal distance of the normal
high-water line of the Salmon Falls River then best management practices will be utilized
including the following:
1. Use phosphorus-free fertilizer, unless a soil test indicates a low phosphorus level, or
when establishing a new lawn from seed.
2. Do not apply fertilizer between December 1 and April 1 or to frozen ground.
3. Do not apply fertilizer or pesticides if moderate to heavy rain is imminent or if the soil
is saturated.
4. A filter strip of perennial vegetation shall be maintained along the normal high-water
line of the Salmon Falls River at a width of ten (10) feet for average slopes of less than
one (1) percent and proportionally up to at least (20) feet for slopes of fifteen (15)
percent.
NOTE: 17 M.R.S.A. section 2805(4) requires a municipality to provide the Commissioner of
Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources with a copy of any proposed ordinance that impacts farm
operations. The law further requires the Commissioner to review the proposed ordinance and
advise the municipality if the proposed ordinance would restrict or prohibit the use of best
management practices. A copy of a shoreland zoning ordinance that regulates no more
restrictively than contained in these Guidelines need not be provided to the Commissioner of
Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources.
Q. Timber Harvesting
- 148 -
(1) In a Resource Protection District abutting a great pond, timber harvesting shall be limited to
the following:
(a) Within the strip of land extending 75 feet inland from the normal high-water line in a
shoreland area zoned for resource protection abutting a great pond there shall be no
timber harvesting except to remove safety hazards.
(b) Beyond the 75 foot strip referred to in Section 14.15(P)(1)(a) above, timber harvesting is
permitted in accordance with paragraph 2 below except that in no case shall the average
residual basal area of trees over 4 ½ inches in diameter at 4 1/2 feet above ground level
be reduced to less than 30 square feet per acre.
(2) Except in areas as described in Section 14.15(P)(1) above, timber harvesting shall
conform with the following provisions:
(a) Selective cutting of no more than forty (40) percent of the total volume of trees four (4)
inches or more in diameter measured at 4 1/2 feet above ground level on any lot in any
ten (10) year period is permitted. In addition:
(i) Within one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line
of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and
within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of
other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland, there shall be
no clearcut openings and a well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation,
including existing ground cover, shall be maintained.
(ii) At distances greater than one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of a great
pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and greater
than seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of other
water bodies or the upland edge of a wetland, harvesting operations shall not create
single clearcut openings greater than ten-thousand (10,000) square feet in the forest
canopy. Where such openings exceed five-thousand (5000) square feet they shall be
at least one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, apart. Such clearcut openings
shall be included in the calculation of total volume removal. Volume may be
considered to be equivalent to basal area.
(b) No accumulation of slash shall be left within fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, of the
normal high-water line of a water body. In all other areas slash shall either be removed
or disposed of in such a manner that it lies on the ground and no part thereof extends
more than four (4) feet above the ground. Any debris that falls below the normal highwater
line of a water body or tributary stream shall be removed.
(c) Timber harvesting equipment shall not use stream channels as travel routes except when:
(i) Surface waters are frozen; and
(ii) The activity will not result in any ground disturbance.
- 149 -
(d) All crossings of flowing water shall require a bridge or culvert, except in areas with low
banks and channel beds which are composed of gravel, rock or similar hard surface
which would not be eroded or otherwise damaged.
(e) Skid trail approaches to water crossings shall be located and designed so as to prevent
water runoff from directly entering the water body or tributary stream. Upon completion
of timber harvesting, temporary bridges and culverts shall be removed and areas of
exposed soil revegetated.
(f) Except for water crossings, skid trails and other sites where the operation of machinery
used in timber harvesting results in the exposure of mineral soil shall be located such that
an unscarified strip of vegetation of at least seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, in
width for slopes up to ten (10) percent shall be retained between the exposed mineral soil
and the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland. For each ten
(10) percent increase in slope, the unscarified strip shall be increased by twenty (20) feet,
horizontal distance. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to a face sloping toward
the water body or wetland, provided, however, that no portion of such exposed mineral
soil on a back face shall be closer than twenty five (25) feet, horizontal distance, from the
normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland.
R. Clearing or Removal of Vegetation for Activities Other Than Timber Harvesting
(1) In the Resource Protection District abutting a great pond, there shall be no cutting of
vegetation within the strip of land extending 75 feet, horizontal distance, inland from the
normal high water line, except to remove safety hazards.
Elsewhere, in any Resource Protection District the cutting or removal of vegetation shall be
limited to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that district.
(2) Except in areas as described in Section 14.15P(1), above, and except to allow for the
development of permitted uses, within a strip of land extending 100 feet horizontal distance
from the high water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond
classified GPA, and 75 feet, horizontal distance, from any other water body, tributary
stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be preserved as
follows:
(a) There shall be no cleared opening greater than 250 square feet in the forest canopy (or
other existing woody vegetation if a forested canopy is not present) as measured from the
outer limits of the tree or shrub crown. However, a footpath not to exceed six (6) feet in
width as measured between tree trunks and/or shrub stems is allowed provided that a
cleared line of sight to the water through the buffer strip is not created.
(b) Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed provided that a welldistributed
stand of trees and other natural vegetation is maintained. For the purposes of
Section 14.15(P)(2)(b) a "well-distributed stand of trees" adjacent to a great pond
classified GPA or a river or stream flowing to a great pond classified GPA, shall be
defined as maintaining a rating score of 12 or more in each 25-foot by 25-foot square
(625 square feet) area as determined by the following rating system:
- 150 -
Tree at 4 1/2 feet above ground level (inches) Points
2-4 in. 1
>4-12 in. 2
>12 in. 4
Adjacent to other waterbodies, tributary streams, and wetlands, a “well-distributed stand of
trees” is defined as maintaining a minimum rating score of 8 per 25-foot square area.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than 40 percent of the total volume of trees four
(4) inches or more in diameter, measured at 4 1/2 feet above ground level may be removed in
any ten (10) year period.
(c) In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing vegetation under three (3) feet in
height and other ground cover, including leaf litter and the forest duff layer, shall not be cut,
covered, or removed, except to provide for a footpath or other permitted uses as described in
Section 14.15(R) paragraphs (2) and (2)(a) above.
(d) Pruning of tree branches, on the bottom one-third of the tree is allowed.
(e) In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation, when the removal of storm-damaged, diseased,
unsafe, or dead trees results in the creation of cleared openings, these openings shall be replanted
with native tree species unless existing new tree growth is present.
Section 14.15(R)(2) does not apply to those portions of public recreational facilities adjacent to
public swimming areas as long as cleared areas are limited to the minimum area necessary.
(f) For the purposes of Section 14.15(R)(2)(b), “other natural vegetation” is defined as retaining
existing vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other ground cover and retaining at least
three (3) saplings less than two (2) inches in diameter at four and one-half (4 1/2) feet above
ground level for each 25-foot rectangular area. If three (3) saplings do not exist, no woody
stems less than two (2) inches in diameter can be removed until 3 saplings have been recruited
into the plot.
(3) At distances greater than one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from a great pond classified
GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the
normal high water line of any water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, there
shall be allowed on any lot, in any ten year period, selective cutting of not more than forty (40)
percent of the volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured 4 1/2 feet above ground
level. Tree removal in conjunction with the development of permitted uses shall be included in the
forty (40) percent calculation. For the purposes of these standards volume may be considered to be
equivalent to basal area.
In no event shall cleared openings for any purpose, including but not limited to principal and
accessory structures, driveways, lawns and sewage disposal areas, exceed in the aggregate, 25
percent of the lot area within the shoreland zone or ten thousand (10,000) square feet, whichever is
greater, including land previously cleared.
(4) Legally existing nonconforming cleared openings may be maintained, but shall not be enlarged,
except as allowed by this ordinance.
(5) Fields and other cleared openings which have reverted to primarily shrubs, trees, or other woody
vegetation shall be regulated under the provisions of Section 14.15(R).
- 151 -
S. Erosion and Sedimentation Control
(1) All activities which involve filling, grading, excavation or other similar activities which result in
unstabilized soil conditions and which require a permit shall also require a written soil erosion and
sedimentation control plan. Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and built
according to the standards of the Maine Erosion and Sediment Control BMP’s manual, published by
the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, March 2003. The plan shall be submitted to the
permitting authority for approval and shall include, where applicable, provisions for:
(a) Mulching and revegetation of disturbed soil.
(b) Temporary runoff control features such as hay bales, silt fencing or diversion ditches.
(c) Permanent stabilization structures such as retaining walls or rip-rap.
(2) In order to create the least potential for erosion, development shall be designed to fit with the
topography and soils of the site. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required shall
be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours shall be followed as closely as possible.
(3) Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall apply to all aspects of the proposed project
involving land disturbance, and shall be in operation during all stages of the activity. The amount of
exposed soil at every phase of construction shall be minimized to reduce the potential for erosion.
(4) Natural and man-made drainage ways and drainage outlets shall be protected from erosion from
water flowing through them. Drainageways shall be designed and constructed in order to carry water
from a twenty five (25) year storm or greater, and shall be stabilized with vegetation or lined with
riprap.
T. Soils. All land uses shall be located on soils in or upon which the proposed uses or structures can be
established or maintained without causing adverse environmental impacts, including severe erosion, mass
soil movement, improper drainage, and water pollution, whether during or after construction. Proposed
uses requiring subsurface waste disposal, and commercial or industrial development and other similar
intensive land uses, shall require a soils report based on an on-site investigation and be prepared by statecertified
professionals. Certified persons may include Maine Certified Soil Scientists, Maine Registered
Professional Engineers, Maine State Certified Geologists and other persons who have training and
experience in the recognition and evaluation of soil properties. The report shall be based upon the
analysis of the characteristics of the soil and surrounding land and water areas, maximum ground water
elevation, presence of ledge, drainage conditions, and other pertinent data which the evaluator deems
appropriate. The soils report shall include recommendations for a proposed use to counteract soil
limitations where they exist.
U. Water Quality. No activity shall deposit on or into the ground or discharge to the waters of the State any
pollutant that, by itself or in combination with other activities or substances, will impair designated uses
or the water classification of the water body, tributary stream or wetland.
V. Archaeological Site. Any proposed land use activity involving structural development or soil disturbance
on or adjacent to sites listed on, or eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as
determined by the permitting authority, shall be submitted by the applicant to the Maine Historic
Preservation Commission for review and comment, at least twenty (20) days prior to action being taken
by the permitting authority. The permitting authority shall consider comments received from the
Commission prior to rendering a decision on the application.
- 152 -
NOTE: Municipal officials should contact the Maine Historic Preservation Commission for the listing
and location of Historic Places in their community.
14.16 Administration
A. Permits Required. After the effective date of this Article no person shall, without first obtaining a permit,
engage in any activity or use of land or structure requiring a permit in the district in which such activity or
use would occur; or expand, change, or replace an existing use or structure; or renew a discontinued
nonconforming use. A person who is issued a permit pursuant to this Article shall have a copy of the
permit on site while the work authorized by the permit is performed.
(1) A permit is not required for the replacement of an existing road culvert as long as:
(a) The replacement culvert is not more than 25% longer than the culvert being replaced;=
(b) The replacement culvert is not longer than 75 feet; and
(c) Adequate erosion control measures are taken to prevent sedimentation of the water, and the
crossing does not block fish passage in the watercourse.
(2) A permit is not required for an archaeological excavation as long as the excavation is conducted
by an archaeologist listed on the State Historic Preservation Officer’s level 1 or level 2 approved list,
and unreasonable erosion and sedimentation is prevented by means of adequate and timely temporary
and permanent stabilization measures.
(3) Any permit required by this Article shall be in addition to any other permit required by other law
or ordinance.
B. Permit Application
(1) Every applicant for a permit shall submit a written application, including a scaled site plan, on a
form provided by the municipality, to the appropriate official as indicated in Section 14.14.
(2) All applications shall be signed by an owner or individual who can show evidence of right, title or
interest in the property or by an agent, representative, tenant, or contractor of
the owner with authorization from the owner to apply for a permit hereunder, certifying that the
information in the application is complete and correct.
(3) All applications shall be dated, and the Code Enforcement Officer or Planning Board, as
appropriate, shall note upon each application the date and time of its receipt.
(4) If the property is not served by a public sewer, a valid plumbing permit or a completed
application for a plumbing permit, including the site evaluation approved by the Plumbing
Inspector, shall be submitted whenever the nature of the proposed structure or use would
require the installation of a subsurface sewage disposal system.
C. Procedure for Administering Permits. Within 35 days of the date of receiving a written
application, the Planning Board or Code Enforcement Officer, as indicated in 14.14, shall notify
the applicant in writing either that the application is a complete application, or, if the application

Planning Board or the Code Enforcement Officer, as appropriate, shall approve, approve with
conditions, or deny all permit applications in writing within 35 days of receiving a completed
- 153 -
application. However, if the Planning Board has a waiting list of applications, a decision on the
application shall occur within 35 days after the first available date on the Planning Board's
agenda following receipt of the completed application, or within 35 days of the public hearing, if
the proposed use or structure is found to be in conformance with the purposes and provisions of
this Article.
The applicant shall have the burden of proving that the proposed land use activity is in
conformity with the purposes and provisions of this Article.
After the submission of a complete application to the Planning Board, the Board shall approve an
application or approve it with conditions if it makes a positive finding based on the information
presented that the proposed use:
(1) Will maintain safe and healthful conditions;
(2) Will not result in water pollution, erosion, or sedimentation to surface waters;
(3) Will adequately provide for the disposal of all wastewater;
(4) Will not have an adverse impact on spawning grounds, fish, aquatic life, bird or other
wildlife habitat;
(5) Will conserve shore cover and visual, as well as actual, points of access to inland waters;
(6) Will protect archaeological and historic resources as designated in the comprehensive
plan;
(7) Will avoid problems associated with floodplain development and use; and
(8) Is in conformance with the provisions of Section 14.15, Land Use Standards.
If a permit is either denied or approved with conditions, the reasons as well as conditions
shall be stated in writing. No approval shall be granted for an application involving a
structure if the structure would be located in an unapproved subdivision or would violate any
other local ordinance, or regulation or statute administered by the municipality.
D. Expiration of Permit. Permits shall expire one year from the date of issuance if a substantial start
is not made in construction or in the use of the property during that period. If a substantial start
is made within one year of the issuance of the permit, the applicant shall have one additional year
to complete the project, at which time the permit shall expire.
E. Installation of Public Utility Service. A public utility, water district, sanitary district or any
utility company of any kind may not install services to any new structure located in the shoreland
zone unless written authorization attesting to the validity and currency of all local permits
required under this or any previous Article has been issued by the appropriate municipal officials
or other written arrangements have been made between the municipal officials and the utility.
F. Appeals
(1) Powers and Duties of the Board of Appeals. The Board of Appeals shall have the
following powers:
(a) Administrative Appeals: To hear and decide administrative appeals, on an appellate
basis, where it is alleged by an aggrieved party that there is an error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by, or failure to act by the Code
Enforcement Officer in his or her review of and action on a permit application under this
- 154 -
Article. Any order, requirement, decision or determination made, or failure to act, in the
enforcement of this Article is not appealable to the Board of Appeals.
(b) Variance Appeals: To authorize variances upon appeal, within the limitations set forth in
this Article.
(2) Variance Appeals. Variances may be granted only under the following conditions:
(a) Variances may be granted only from dimensional requirements including, but not limited
to, lot width, structure height, percent of lot coverage, and setback requirements.
(b) Variances shall not be granted for establishment of any uses otherwise prohibited by this
Article.
(c) The Board of Appeals shall not grant a variance unless it finds that:
(i) The proposed structure or use would meet the provisions of Section 14.15 except
for the specific provision which has created the non-conformity and from which relief
is sought; and
(ii) The strict application of the terms of this Article would result in undue hardship.
The term "undue hardship" shall mean:
a. That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is
granted;
b. That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property
and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
c. That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality;
and
d. That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior
owner.
(d) Notwithstanding Section 16(F)(2)(c)(ii) above, the Board of Appeals may grant a
variance to an owner of a residential dwelling for the purpose of making that dwelling
accessible to a person with a disability who resides in or regularly uses the dwelling. The
board shall restrict any variance granted under this subsection solely to the installation of
equipment or the construction of structures necessary for access to or egress from the
dwelling by the person with the disability. The board may impose conditions on the
variance, including limiting the variance to the duration of the disability or to the time

ARTICLE XV Community Facilities Impact Analysis
15.1. Purpose of Program
The Town of Berwick finds that new development places demands on municipal government to provide
new services and expand and improve public facilities. In order to provide an equitable source of
funding for these new services and facilities, the Town of Berwick has established a municipal
infrastructure facilities improvement program. Under this program, persons or entities will be charged
for an amount of the costs for creating and maintaining infrastructure, facilities, and other improvements
in proportion to the degree said persons are responsible for the need for such infrastructure, facilities and
improvements.
15.2 Authority
This section of the Berwick Land Use Ordinance is adopted pursuant to 30-A M.R.S. § 4354 et seq.
15.3 Use of Impact Fees
A. Impact fees may only be used for financing infrastructure facilities improvements needed
due to demand caused by new growth.
B. Impact fees may not be used for any of the following
1. Operations and maintenance costs, such as but not limited to paying salaries,
day-to- day operational costs or replacement of existing equipment,
2. The costs to improve infrastructure facilities to meet existing deficiencies, such
as but not limited to relieving existing congestion or overcrowding
15.4 Applicability
A. The Code Enforcement Officer shall require the applicant for a Building Permit to
participate in the municipal infrastructure facilities improvement program and pay a
development impact fee at the rate currently in effect. The total impact fee shall be paid
separately from any other fees required by this Ordinance and shall be paid at the time the
Occupancy Permit is issued
B. The Board of Selectmen shall establish the initial impact fee schedule and shall review and
revise, if necessary the impact fee schedule at least annually to reflect changes in planned
improvements current budget levels and compliance with the Town of Berwick Comprehensive
Plan and the Town's Capital Improvement Program. Prior to the establishment or revision of the
impact fee schedule, the Board of Selectmen shall hold two public hearings on the proposed fee
schedule. Notice of the public hearings shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation
within the Town at least twice. The first notice shall be published no more than thirty (30) days
in advance of the hearings and the second no less than seven (7) days in advance of the hearings.
C. The impact fee schedule shall indicate the improvements to be financed, the anticipated
schedule for construction, and the characteristic of new development by which the fee shall be
calculated (e.g., a fixed rate multiplied by the number of bedrooms, a per unit per square foot,
amount of traffic generated, etc.
- 159 -
D. The amount of the fee shall be reasonably related to the development's share of the cost of
the infrastructure facilities improvements made necessary by the development or, if the
improvements were previously constructed at municipal expense prior to the development,
the fee must be reasonably related to the portion or percentage of the improvement used by
the development.
15.5 Segregation of Impact Fees from General Fund
A. The Code Enforcement Officer shall record the name of the individual paying the
impact fee. The Tax Assessor's map and lot numbers for the property for which the
impact fee is being paid, the amount of the fee paid for the facility for which fees are
collected, and the date the impact fee was paid.
B. Upon collection of an impact fee, the Code Enforcement Officer shall transfer the
funds to the Municipal Treasurer who shall deposit the impact fee in special non lapsing
accounts dedicated for funding the improvements for which the fee is collected.
C. Impact fee funds shall be maintained separately from and shall not be combined with
other municipal revenues.
D. Funds collected as impact fees shall be expended only for the infrastructure
improvement for which the fee was collected.
15.6 Refund of Impact Fees

which have not been expended within ten (10) years of the date they were first collected. The
Board of Selectmen shall establish the procedure for refunding such impact fees. Unexpended
fees shall be returned to the owner of record at the time a refund is issued, regardless of when
said impact fees were received.

period, that begins after September 23, 1971. This definition applies whether the division is
accomplished by sale, lease, development, buildings or otherwise. The term “subdivision”
also includes the division of a new structure or structures on a tract or parcel
of land into three or more dwelling units within a five-year period, the construction or
placement of three or more dwelling units on a single tract or parcel of land and the division
of an existing structure or structures previously used for commercial or industrial use into
three or more dwelling units within a five-year period.
In determining whether a tract or parcel of land is divided into three or more lots, the first
dividing of such tract or parcel shall be considered to create the first two lots and the next
dividing of either of the first two lots, by whomever accomplished, unless otherwise
exempted herein shall be considered to create a third lot, unless:
a. Both dividings are accomplished by a subdivider who has retained one of the lots for
the subdivider’s own use as a single-family residence that has been the subdivider’s
principal residence for a period of at least 5 years immediately preceding the 2nd
division; or
b. The division of the tract or parcel is otherwise exempt under this definition.
A lot of 40 or more acres shall be counted as a lot.
A division accomplished by devise does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this
definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this definition.
A division accomplished by condemnation does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of

this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this definition.
A division accomplished by order of court does not create a lot or lots for the purposes of
this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of this definition.
A division accomplished by gift to a person related to the donor of an interest in property
held by the donor for a continuous period of 5 years prior to the division by gift does not
create a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to
avoid the objectives of this definition. If the real estate exempt under this paragraph is
transferred within 5 years to another person not related to the donor of the exempt real estate
as provided in this paragraph, then the previously exempt division creates a lot or lots
for the purposes of this subsection. “Person related to the donor” means spouse, parent,
grandparent, brother, sister, child, or grandchild related by blood, marriage, or adoption. A
gift under this paragraph cannot be given for consideration that is more than ½ the assessed
value of the real estate.
A division accomplished by gift to a municipality if that municipality accepts the gift does
not create a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition, unless the intent of the transferor
is to avoid the objectives of this definition.
A division accomplished by the transfer of any interest in land to the owners of land
abutting that land that does not create a separate lot does not create a lot or lots for the
purposes of this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives of
this subchapter. If the real estate exempt under this paragraph is transferred within 5 years
to another person without all of the merged land, then the previously exempt division
creates a lot or lots for the purposes of this definition.
The grant of bona fide security interest in an entire lot that has been exempted from the
definition under this paragraph, or subsequent transfer of that entire lot by the original
holder of the security interest or that person’s successor in interest, does not create a lot for
the purposes of this definition, unless the intent of the transferor is to avoid the objectives
of these regulations.
In determining the number of dwelling units in a structure, the provisions regarding the
determination of the number of lots shall apply, including exemptions from the definition of
a subdivision of land.
Subdivision, Major: Any subdivision containing more than four lots or dwelling units.
Subdivision, Minor: Any subdivision containing four lots or dwelling units or less.

ARTICLE 3 - DEFINITIONS - Page 7
Substantial Completion: The application of the base layer of pavement as approved by the
Town Engineer. If the subdivision is to consist of individual lots to be sold or leased by the
subdivider, the cost of construction of buildings on those lots shall not be included. If the
subdivision is a multifamily development, or if the applicant proposes to construct the
buildings within the subdivision, the cost of building construction shall be included in the
total costs of proposed improvements.
Tract or Parcel of Land: All contiguous land in the same ownership, provided that lands
located on opposite sides of a public or private road shall be considered each a separate
tract or parcel of land unless such road was established by the owner of land on both sides
thereof.
Usable Open Space: That portion of the common open space which due to its slope, drainage
characteristics and soil conditions can be used for active recreation, horticulture or
agriculture. In order to be considered usable open space, the land must not be poorly
drained or very poorly drained, have ledge outcroppings, or areas with slopes exceeding
10%.

presentation regarding the site and the proposed subdivision.
B. Following the applicant’s presentation, the Board may ask questions and make
suggestions to be incorporated by the applicant into the application.
C. The date of the on-site inspection is selected.
5.3 Submission.
The Preapplication Sketch Plan shall show in simple sketch form the proposed layout
of streets, lots, buildings and other features in relation to existing conditions. The
Sketch Plan, which does not have to be engineered and may be a free-hand penciled
sketch, should be supplemented with general information to describe or outline the
existing conditions of the site and the proposed development. It will be most helpful to
both the applicant and the Board for site conditions such as steep slopes, wet areas and
vegetative cover to be identified in a general manner. It is recommended that the sketch
plan be superimposed on or accompanied by a copy of the assessor’s map(s) on
which the land is located. The Sketch Plan shall be accompanied by:
A. A copy of a portion of the U.S.G.S. topographic map of the area showing the
outline of the proposed subdivision unless the proposed subdivision is less than ten
acres in size.
B. A copy of that portion of the county soil survey covering the proposed subdivision,
showing the outline of the proposed subdivision.
C. If the project will be connected to the Berwick Sewer District municipal sewer the
applicant will submit conceptual plans to the Berwick Sewer District and receive
conceptual approval prior to the submittal of the preliminary application to the
Town.

the proposed design and construction details shall be approved in writing by
the road commissioner or the Maine Department of Transportation, as
appropriate.
e. Where the subdivision streets are to remain private roads, the following
words shall appear on the recorded plan.
“All roads in this subdivision shall remain private roads to be maintained by
the developer or the lot owners and shall not be accepted or maintained by
the Town, until they meet the municipal street design and construction
standards.”
2. Street Design Standards.
a. These design guidelines shall control the roadway, shoulders, curbs,
sidewalks, drainage systems, culverts, and other appurtenances associated
with the street, and shall be met by all streets within a subdivision, unless

de–sac is in a wooded area prior to development, a stand of trees shall be
maintained within the center of the cul–de–sac. When not in a wooded
area it shall be grassed, landscaped, or kept in a natural state. The Board
shall require the reservation of a 20 foot easement in line with the street to
provide continuation of pedestrian traffic or utilities to the next street. The
Board may also require the reservation of a 50-foot easement in line with
the street to provide continuation of the road where future subdivision
is possible. The Board may require streets to be connected if cul-de-sacs
are located less than 600 ft. apart as measured from the center
of the cul-de-sac, or if the entrance to a dead-end street is within 600 ft.
of another entrance to a dead-end street.

APPENDIX A - Town of Berwick’s Storm Water Runoff Design Criteria - Page 1
APPENDIX A
Town of Berwick’s
Storm Water Runoff Design Criteria
Drainage Calculation Methods
The technique used for calculating storm drainage shall be the Soil Cover Complex Method
(Better known as the SCS Runoff Curve Number Method). The only exception will be for
calculating the flow to open channels or through the catch basin inlets and related closed drain
system associated with street or parking lot runoff having less than 20 acres contributing
drainage area. The designer may use either the SCS method or the Rational Method for these
instances.
Streets With Curbing and Catch Basins
Catch basin grate inlet spacing and capacity shall be analyzed to insure gutter spread (surface
flooding) does not cause a hazardous situation for vehicle traffic. It is considered hazardous if
the roadway grade and/or inefficient grate inlet capacity causes a surface water flow width
(spread width) of more than 1/2 of the travel lane width. The normal design frequency to be
used for inlet capacity and spacing shall be the 2-year frequency storm. Inlets placed at sump
locations shall be checked for capacity and spread width using the peak discharge from a 10-year
frequency storm event.
Pre- and Post-Development Runoff Comparison
For developments that create less than one acre of disturbed area, the Basic Performance
Standards specified in the Maine Department of Environmental Protection Chapter 500:
Stormwater Management, Appendix A-Erosion and Sedimentation Control rules shall be utilized.
For developments that create one or more acres of disturbed area, the stormwater management
provisions specified in Chapters 500 and 502 of the Maine Department of Environmental
Protection Stormwater Management rules will apply.
