LOCAL IMPROVEMENT POLICY
§ 32.01 (RESERVED)
§ 32.02 CLASSIFICATION OF PROJECTS
(A) In general. Public improvements are divided into the three classes specified in the following
divisions according to their respective benefit to the whole city and to property specially served by
the improvement and taking into account past city practice.
(B) Class A.
(1) Class A improvements are those which are of general benefit to the city at-large, including:
(a) Public buildings, except a building which is part of an improvement described in one
of the following divisions;
(b) Any public park, playground or recreational facility;
(c) The installation and maintenance of street lighting systems; and
(d) Any improvement not described in M.S. § 429.021, Subdivision 1, as it may be
amended from time to time.

(5) Grading, graveling, oiling and applying non-permanent surfacing to streets;
(6) Permanently surfacing residential streets; and
(7) The abatement of nuisances and the draining of swamps, marshes and ponds on public or
private property and filling the same.
(Prior Code, § 303.02)
§ 32.03 FINANCING CLASS B AND C IMPROVEMENTS
(A) It is the policy of the city to finance Class B and C improvements by the methods prescribed in
§§ 32.04 through 32.06.
(B) The apportionment of the cost between benefitted property and the city at-large and the method
of levying assessments prescribed in those sections shall be followed in each case unless the Council,
by resolution, finds that, because of special circumstances stated in the resolution, a different policy
is necessary or desirable in the particular case.
(C) Any local improvement described in M.S. § 429.021, as it may be amended from time to time,
and not placed in Class A, B or C by § 32.02 shall be financed as the Council determines to be most
feasible and equitable in each case.
(Prior Code, § 303.03)
§ 32.04 ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS FOR CLASS B IMPROVEMENTS
(A) Trunk water mains and sanitary sewers. When a water or sewer main is laid across or adjacent
to unplatted property, the city shall not defer the assessment against the unplatted property if the
assessment would be made for such an improvement in the case of platted property, but the city shall
make the assessment at the time the assessment against other property is made, apportioning the
assessment against the unplatted property on the basis of area. When a trunk sewer or water main
is constructed and is to serve also as a lateral sewer or water main for abutting property, the abutting
property shall be assessed for the cost of a lateral sewer or water main of eight inches. The
assessment for the lateral shall also include the propertys share of the trunk sewer or water main.
The cost of the trunk sewer or water main in excess of the lateral assessment shall be paid for from
general revenue.
(B) Storm sewers. Twenty five percent of the cost of constructing storm sewers shall be paid by
the city from general funds. The remainder of the cost shall be assessed against the property in the
area served by the sewer on the basis of the square footage of the property. The area to be assessed
shall be determined on the basis of topographic maps and other pertinent data.
(Prior Code, § 303.04)
34 Cokato - Administration

(B) Water and sewer. The cost of lateral water mains not exceeding six inches in diameter and of
lateral sanitary sewer mains not exceeding eight inches in diameter shall be assessed against abutting
property on the basis of benefit. The cost of water mains to be assessed includes the service lines
if furnished, hydrants and valves. The cost of sewer mains includes lines, if furnished.
(C) Streets. The cost of construction of curbs and gutters on any street, of grading, oiling and
applying non-permanent surfacing to any street, or of applying permanent surfaces to residential
streets shall be assessed on the basis of benefit.
(D) Nuisances. The cost of abating nuisances and draining of swamps, marshes and ponds on
public or private property and filling the same shall be assessed in a manner determined by the
Council in each case to measure most equitably the benefit received by property to be assessed. The
assessment in any case may be made against non-abutting property to the extent the property is
benefitted by the improvement.
(Prior Code, § 303.05)
§ 32.06 SPECIAL RULES
(A) Corner lots. In any assessment made on the basis of frontage, except one for water or sanitary
sewer, corner lots shall be assessed for footage along the front of the lot plus one-third of the side
footage. The other two-thirds of the side footage shall be spread among all other assessed
properties. In the case of an assessment for a lateral water or sewer main, Class C corner lots shall
be assessed for the footage along the front side of the lot and shall be assessed for the footage along
the front side of the street abutting the lot unless the lot is large enough to accommodate another
building which would be benefitted by construction of the second main.
(B) Intersections. The cost of water and sewer improvements in street intersections shall be
included as part of the total assessable cost. In the case of any kind of street improvement,
intersection costs shall be paid by the city.
(C) Adjusted frontage. When the amount of an assessment is determined by frontage, an equivalent
front footage shall be determined according to the following rules when an irregular lot requires an
adjustment to maintain fairness in the assessment:
(1) Front footage shall be measured at the setback on cul-de-sacs and sharply curved streets
and irregularly shaped lots;
Plans and Policies 35
(2) Equivalent front footage shall be determined by dividing the square footage of the lot by
the general lot depth of the subdivision for pie-shaped lots and irregular shaped lots where other
rules do not apply;
(3) Where frontage curves so greatly as to give a general appearance of a corner, the lot shall
be considered a corner lot and equivalent front footage, as well as side footage where required,
determined on the basis of an irregularly shaped lot; and
(4) Where a lot consists of a combination of rectangular and pie-shaped or irregular portions,
the equivalent front footage shall be determined as the sum of the straight front footage plus the
remainder in accordance with applicable rules.
(Prior Code, § 303.06)
§ 32.07 FEDERAL, STATE AND COUNTY AID USE
If the city receives financial assistance from the federal government, the state or the county to defray
a portion of the cost of a street improvement project, the aid shall be used first to reduce the share
of the project cost which would be met from general city funds according to the assessment formula
contained in this subchapter. If the aid is more than the amount of the improvement cost to be borne
by the city, the remainder of the aid so received shall be used to reduce each individual assessment
proportionately.
(Prior Code, § 303.07)
§ 32.08 BRANCH SERVICE LINES
Water and sewer lines shall be installed from the main to the front property line of property to be

of the city, for the purpose of financing local improvements.
(B) Source of funds. The fund shall be a permanent fund of the city and the monies necessary for
its maintenance shall be provided by taxation, by the appropriation of available monies from other
funds of the city and/or by the issuance and sale of permanent improvement revolving fund bonds
of the city as deemed necessary from time to time by the Council.
(C) Disposition of funds. Monies in the fund shall be used only as directed by resolution of the
Council for the purpose of advancing to local improvement funds the cost of improvements for
which assessments are to be levied. All monies so advanced to an improvement fund shall be
restored as soon as sufficient monies are received in the improvement fund, together with interest at
a rate fixed by the Council during the time for which the monies have been so furnished.
(D) Investment. Whenever there are monies in the fund not immediately needed for local
improvements, the monies shall be invested by the City Clerk-Treasurer under the direction of the
Council in any securities authorized for investment of municipal sinking funds by law.
(E) Transfer of surplus. When the fund accumulates encumbered monies in excess of any amounts
reasonably anticipated to be needed for local improvement fund advances, the Council may, by
resolution adopted by a four-fifths vote, declare any part of the excess to be surplus and transfer it
to the general fund.
(Prior Code, § 303.11)
§ 32.12 ASSESSMENT MANUAL
The City Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare an administrative manual specifying more detailed
procedures for the conduct of local improvements and the levy of special assessments in

ownership and paying the city any storage or maintenance costs incurred by it. A receipt for the
property shall be obtained upon release to the owner.

shall be sold to the highest bidder at a public auction conducted by the City Clerk-Treasurer after
two weeks published notice setting forth the time and place of the sale and the property to be sold.
(E) Disposition of proceeds. The proceeds of the sale shall be placed in the general fund of the
city. If the former owner makes application and furnishes satisfactory proof of ownership within

§ 51.003 APPLICATIONS FOR SERVICE
(A) Procedure. Applications for a water and/or sewer connection shall be made to the City

§ 51.004 SERVICE CONNECTION PERMITS
(A) Permit required; fees. No connection shall be made for water or sanitary sewer system without
a permit from the city. The City Council shall by ordinance establish the fees for said permits.
These fees shall be required under divisions (B), (C) and (D) below.
(B) Connection fees. When a connection requires installation of a service line from the main to the
property line, a permit is required from the city. The applicant may provide for the installation of
a service line. The applicant shall be responsible for the cost of making necessary connections, taps
and installation of the pipes, appurtenances and necessary street repairs to provide service to the
property with inspection by the city.
(C) Certification. No permit shall be issued unless the City Administrator or designee certifies to
the truth of one of the following, or the payment required under division (D) below is made:
(1) That the lot or tract to be served has been assessed for the cost of construction of the main
with which the connection is made or that proceedings for levying the assessment have been or
will be commenced in due course; or
(2) That the cost of construction of the main has been paid by the developer or builder platting
the lot or tract; or
(3) That, if neither of the foregoing is true, a sum equal to 110% of the cost of constructing the
main has been paid to the city in cash.
(D) Additional connection fee. If no such certificate can be issued, the applicant shall pay an
additional connection fee equal to the portion of the cost of construction of the main upon the same
basis as any assessment previously levied against other property for the main. The determination
shall be made by the City Administrator or designee. If no such assessment has been levied, the
assessable cost shall be determined upon the basis of the uniform charge that may have been or will
be charged for similar connection with the main.
(Prior Code, § 401.04) (Am. Ord. 04-2010, passed 7-12-2010)
§ 51.005 ACCOUNTING, BILLING AND COLLECTIONS
(A) Responsibility for accounts. Responsibility for accounts shall be carried in the name of the

limits of the city shall be subject to a surcharge upon the total amount of their utility bill. The City
Council shall by ordinance establish the amount of the surcharge.
10 Cokato - Public Works
(C) Multiple units. Whenever two or more residential, commercial or industrial premises with
separate plumbing facilities are located in the same building and served through one service
connection for each utility and a water meter, each unit over and above the first shall be subject to
separate surcharges for water and sewer service. When similar circumstances exist where there is
no water meter, each unit shall be considered a separate account and no surcharge under this division
will apply. The City Council shall by ordinance establish the amount of the surcharges.
(D) Bills for service. All accounts receiving services shall be charged for the value of those
services as determined in this chapter. Water and sewer shall be billed together. Bills shall be
mailed monthly by first class mail on the date established by the City Council.
(E) Partial bills; refunds. Accounts that do not receive utility service for the entire month will be
prorated. When an account has been overpaid, all excess monies will be applied toward future bills.
No cash refunds will be made except in the case of a final bill on a closed account.
(F) Delinquent accounts. All charges for water and sewer service shall be due on the monthly due
date specified for the respective account and shall be considered delinquent the first day of the month
following the initial mailing. The city shall endeavor to collect delinquent accounts promptly.
Delinquent accounts shall be subject to monthly interest charged against outstanding amounts. The
City Council shall by ordinance establish the rate of interest to be charged. In any case where
satisfactory arrangements for the payment have not been made, the Public Works Director may, after
the procedural requirements of § 51.006 have been complied with, discontinue water service to the
delinquent customer by removing the meter and/or shutting off the water at the curb stop box.
When water service to any premises has been discontinued, service shall not be restored except upon
the payment of all delinquent charges, interest and fees. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare an
assessment roll of all delinquent accounts, where satisfactory arrangements for payment have not
been made, that are in excess of 30 days past due on October 1 of each year. The assessment roll
shall be delivered to the Council for adoption at its first meeting of November of each year for
certification to the County Auditor for collection as other taxes are collected. Such action is
optional and may be subsequent to taking legal action to collect delinquent accounts.
(G) Cold Weather Rule. Pursuant to M.S. § 216B.097, as it may be amended from time to time, no
water service of a residential customer shall be discontinued if the disconnection affects the primary
heat source for the residential unit during the period between October 15 and April 15, the residential
customer has declared their inability to pay with a household income at 185% of the federal poverty
level, and such has been documented by the customer to the city. The customers account must be
current for the billing period immediately prior to October 15 or be making reasonably current
monthly payments. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall between August 15 and October 15 of each
year, notify all residential customers of these ordinance amendment provisions.

§ 51.006 PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION OF SERVICE
Water shall not be shut off for delinquency under § 51.005(F) or for a violation of rules and
regulations affecting utility service until notice and an opportunity for a hearing have first been given
the owner and/or occupant of the premises involved. The notice shall be served by United States
mail, postage prepaid and shall state that if payment is not made before a date stated in the notice
but not less than 20 days after the date on which the notice is given, the water supply to the premises
will be terminated. The notice shall also state that the occupant may, before such date, demand a
hearing on the matter, in which case the supply will not be cut off until after the hearing is held. If
the customer requests a hearing before the date specified, a hearing shall be held on the matter by a
panel consisting of the City Administrator and any two Council Members at least seven days after
the date on which the request is made. The panel shall consider all circumstances, including the
amount owed, previous efforts to collect amounts owed, any applicable statutory provisions and the
likely effect on the health and safety of the occupants of the building if water service is terminated.
If, as a result of the hearing, the panel finds that the amount claimed to be owing is actually due and
unpaid and that there is no reason why the water supply of the delinquent customer may not be shut
off in accordance with this chapter, the city may terminate service.

service connection. Whenever two or more premises with separate plumbing facilities are supplied
from one service connection with a service main, each building or part of building separately
supplied shall have a separate stop box and a separate meter or the provisions of § 51.005(C) shall
apply.
(D) Tapping mains; turning water off and on. No person except an authorized city employee shall

(F) Repair of leaks. The owner, agent or occupant shall be responsible for maintaining the service
line from the curb stop box into the building served. If leaks in the service lines are not repaired
within 24 hours after notice by the city, the city may turn the water off. The water shall not be
turned on again until a fee has been paid to the city. Whenever the flow of water is great or damage
is likely to result from the leak, the city shall turn the water off immediately upon the giving of
notice if repair is not commenced immediately. The water shall not be turned on again until repairs
are made to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director.
(G) Private water supply. No water line of the city water system shall be connected with any pump,
well or tank that is connected with any other source of water supply. Whenever any such
connection is found, the city shall notify the owner to sever the connection immediately. If the
connection is not severed within 24 hours of receipt of notice, the city shall turn off the water until
the connection is severed. Before any new connection to the city system is permitted, the
Department shall ascertain that no cross-connection will exist when the new connection is made.
(H) Restricted hours. Whenever the City Council determines that a shortage of water supply
threatens the city, it may, by resolution, impose a sprinkling ban that shall limit the times and hours
during which city water may be used for sprinkling, irrigation, car washing, air conditioning or other
specific uses. After 24-hour public notice of the ban is given by posting, publication, personal
delivery or direct mailing to each customer, no person shall use or permit water to be used in
violation thereof. Continued violation shall be cause for a discontinuance of water service as set
out in § 51.006.
(I) Permitting use by others. No person shall permit water from the city water supply to be used
for any purposes except upon his or her own premises. Anyone wishing to obtain water from a
hydrant for construction purposes shall make application to the city for the services.

hours of the day to all parts of every building connected with the city water supply in order to read
meters and make inspections. Water meters shall be kept unobstructed and accessible at all times.
(E) Complaints; meter testing. When a customer complains that a bill for any past service is
excessive, the city shall have the meter reread upon request. If the consumer remains dissatisfied,
the meter shall be tested upon written request of the customer. If the test shows an error exceeding
5% of the water consumed, an accurate meter shall be installed, and the bill shall be adjusted
accordingly. If the test shows the meter is accurate to within 5% of the water consumed, the
customer shall be charged the cost of the testing. Such adjustment shall not extend back more than
one month from the date of the written request.

certificate of occupancy is issued. All new dwellings with inactive sump pits for which a
building permit is issued after November 1, 2011 shall have plumbing installed from the sump
pit to the outside of the dwelling before a certificate of occupancy is issued. The plumbing at
the sump pit connection needs to be capable of receiving a pump. No discharge shall be
conveyed directly towards adjacent properties or to areas that will create adverse conditions.
(8) The City Administrator is authorized to issue a permit to allow a property owner to
discharge clear water into the sanitary sewer system. Prior to issuance of the permit, the City
Administrator may consult with the City Engineer or Public Works Director to verify that at
least one of the criteria to issue the permit has been satisfied. The permit shall authorize the
discharge only from November 15 to March 15, shall require the owner to permit an inspection
of the property on March 16 or as soon thereafter as possible or produce a certificate from a
licensed plumber to verify that discharge into the sanitary sewer has been discontinued. No

a change in title or property ownership of real property in the city improved with one or more
buildings or structures without first obtaining a certificate from the city indicating compliance
with the city's statutory sewer regulations, including regulations regarding the discharge of clear
water.
(2) Unless the property owner already has a certificate of compliance for a property, the owner
or owner's representative is required to apply for a certificate and complete an inspection thereof
before the property is offered for sale, gifted or transferred, and before the owner or owner's
representative enters into any purchase agreement, contract for deed or similar transaction. If
the property owner already has a certificate of compliance which is more than one year old, a
new sump pump inspection is required for all properties containing sump pumps. At the time
of application, the applicant for a certificate of compliance inspection shall pay the fee
established in the city's fee schedule.
(3) The applicant for a certificate of compliance inspection is responsible for providing an
inspection of the property after making application and payment of the fee. An inspection
shall be made either by a representative of the city or by a licensed plumber to determine
whether the property use is in accordance with city sanitary sewer regulations. The inspector
shall communicate the findings of the inspection to the property owner, including notification
of any illegal or non-compliant connections that will be severed. The entire property and all
buildings on the property shall be made available for inspection.
(4) If an inspection of the property reveals that the property is in compliance with the sanitary
sewer regulations, a certificate of compliance shall be issued in accordance with the following
terms and conditions:
(a) If the property use is determined to be in accordance with city sanitary sewer
regulations following inspection, a certificate of compliance will be issued by the city.
(b) A certificate of compliance is valid to be used for the transfer of the property.

burden
18D Cokato - Public Works
placed by the wastes upon the sewage treatment plant. If a building served by sewer is not served
by city water and the Council determines that the sewer service charge inaccurately measures use of
the sewer system, it may order the installation of a water meter to measure accurately the amount of
water used on the premises. In the case of an industry using substantial amounts of water that is
not discharged into the sewer system, the Council may order installation of a meter accurately
measuring the amount of water that enters the sewer system and fix the sewer service charge on the
basis of the amount. Insofar as practicable, installation and maintenance of such meters shall
conform to the regulations contained in this code of ordinances.
(C) Required information. The owner, occupant or person in charge of any premises shall supply
the city with the information as he or she may reasonably require relating to the use of water, use of
sewer or sewer rates. Willful failure to provide the information, willful falsification of the

CHAPTER 93: RIGHT OF WAY MANAGEMENT
§ 93.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, INTENT
To provide for the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, and to ensure the integrity of its streets and
the appropriate use of the rights-of-way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good
repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances.
Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code relating to right-of-way permits and
administration. This chapter imposes reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of
facilities and equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It
is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this chapter, persons
excavating and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear financial responsibility for their work. Finally,
this chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons using the public
rights-of-way.
This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws, Chapter 123, substantially
codified in Minnesota Statutes Sections 237.16, 237.162, 237.163, 237.79, 237.81, and 238.086 (the
"Act") and 2017 Session Laws, Chapter 94 amending the Act and the other laws governing applicable
rights of the city and users of the right-of-way. This chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with
Minnesota Rules 7819.0050 7819.9950 and Minnesota Rules Chapter 7560 where possible. To the
extent any provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that
interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and case law is intended. This
chapter shall not be interpreted to limit the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce
general ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.

(D)Small Wireless Facility Agreement. A small wireless facility shall only be collocated on a
small wireless support structure owned or controlled by the city, or any other city asset in the
right-of-way, after the applicant has executed a standard small wireless facility collocation
agreement with the city. The standard collocation agreement may require payment of the
following:
(1) Up to $150 per year for rent to collocate on the city structure.
(2) $25 per year for maintenance associated with the collocation;

deny all small wireless facilities in the application.
(C)Tolling of Deadline. The 90-day deadline for action on a small wireless facility permit
application may be tolled if:
(1) The city receives applications from one or more applicants seeking approval of permits

§ 93.14 RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION
(A)Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the patching and restoration of
the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit,
increased by as many days as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the
control of the permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under
Section 1.16.
(B) Patch and Restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city may choose either to
have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to restore the right-of-way itself.
(1) City Restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, permittee shall pay the costs
thereof within thirty (30) days of billing. If, following such restoration, the pavement
settles due to permittee's improper backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within

(2) Permittee Restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way itself, it shall at
the time of application for an excavation permit post a construction performance
bond in accordance with the provisions of Minnesota Rule 7819.3000.
(3) Degradation Fee in Lieu of Restoration. In lieu of right-of-way restoration, a right-ofway
user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However, the right-of-way user shall
remain responsible for patching and the degradation fee shall not include the cost to
accomplish these responsibilities.
(C)Standards. The permittee shall perform excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration
according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and shall comply with
Minnesota Rule 7819.1100.

perfrmed by permittee or its agents. The permittee upon notification from the city, shall correct
all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work
shall be completed within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city, not
including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force
majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under Section 1.16.
(E)Failure to Restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the
condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration
required by the city, the city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall
pay to the city, within thirty (30) days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If
permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the construction
performance bond.
§ 93.15 JOINT APPLICATIONS
(A) Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to excavate or obstruct the right-ofway
at the same place and time.
(B) Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or excavation, which
the city does not perform, may share in the payment of the obstruction or excavation permit
fee. In order to obtain a joint permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion
each will pay and indicate the same on their applications.
(C)With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or excavation
performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by two or more registrants or
a single application, are not required to pay the excavation or obstruction and degradation
portions of the permit fee, but a permit would still be required.
§ 93.16 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS
(A)Limitation on Area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way
specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the area specified in the permit,
except as provided herein. Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that
specified in the permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater
area (i) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required thereby,
and (ii) be granted a new permit or permit extension.
(B) Limitation on Dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit.
No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided herein,
continue working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end
date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit
or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. This
supplementary application must be submitted before the permit end date.
§ 93.17 OTHER OBLIGATIONS
(A) Compliance with Other Laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve permittee of
its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required
by the city or other applicable rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all
requirements of local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to Minnesota Statutes,
Section 216D.01-.09 (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System) and Minnesota Rules
Chapter 7560. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and
established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way
pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work.
(B) Prohibited Work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the city, no right-of-way
obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are
unreasonable for such work.
(C) Interference with Right-of-Way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the
natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked
within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations.
The loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area unless
specifically authorized by the permit.
(D)Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits, permittees employing
trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited to Horizontal Directional Drilling,
shall follow all requirements set forth in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 216D and Minnesota
Rules Chapter 7560 and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing underground
utilities before excavating, as determined by the City Administrator.
§ 93.18 DENIAL OR REVOCATION OF PERMIT
(A)Reasons for Denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements and
conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the denial is necessary to protect the
health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use.
(B) Procedural Requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be made in writing
and must document the basis for the denial. The city must notify the applicant or right-ofway
user in writing within three business days of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If
an application is denied, the right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified
by the city and resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of
receipt of the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be imposed. The city must
approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30 days after submission.
Note: Minn. Stat. § 237.163, Subds. 4(c) and 5(f).
§ 93.19 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work performed in the right-of-way
shall be done in conformance with Minnesota Rules 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other applicable
local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the Minnesota Statutes, Sections 237.162
and 237.163. Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with Minnesota Rules
Chapter 7560 and these ordinances. Service lateral installation is further subject to those requirements
and conditions set forth by the city in the applicable permits and/or agreements referenced in Section
1.23 subd. 2 of this ordinance.

as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution of and
upon completion of the work.
(C)Authority of City Administrator.
(1) At the time of inspection, the City Administrator may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or
well-being of the public.
(2) The City Administrator may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does
not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions, or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the permit. Within ten (10) days after issuance of the order, the
permittee shall present proof to the City Administrator that the violation has been
corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the City
Administrator may revoke the permit pursuant to Sec. 1.22.
§ 93.21 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT
(A)Emergency Situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the City Administrator of
any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may
proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Excavators'
notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill this
requirement. Within two (2) business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the
registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and
fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this
chapter for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the city will
attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially
affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems
necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant
whose facilities occasioned the emergency.
(B) Non-Emergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having
obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right-of-way must subsequently
obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all
the other fees required by the city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct
any damage to the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 93.22 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION
If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends sooner than the date given on
the permit, permittee shall notify the city of the accurate information as soon as this information is
known.
§ 93.23 REVOCATION OF PERMITS
(A) Substantial Breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right-of-way
permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any
statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial
breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
(1) The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
(2) An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the
perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens;
(3) Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right-of-way permit;
(4) The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit extension is
obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the permittee's
control; or
(5) The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition
indicated on an order issued pursuant to Sec. 1.19.
(B)Written Notice of Breach. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a substantial
breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the
permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The
demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A
substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to place additional or
revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
(C)Response to Notice of Breach. Within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving notification of the
breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will cure the
breach. Permittee's failure to so contact the city, or permittee's failure to timely submit an
acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee's failure to so contact the city,
or permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably
implement the approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one (1)
full year.
(D)Cause for Probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list of conditions of
the permit, which if breached will automatically place the permittee on probation for
one full year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or
working on right-of-way grossly outside of the permit authorization.
(E) Automatic Revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a breach as
outlined above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and permittee will
not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.
(F) Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city
for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation.
§ 93.24 MAPPING DATA
(A) Information Required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping
information required by the city in accordance with Minnesota Rules 7819.4000 and
7819.4100. Within ninety (90) days following completion of any work pursuant to a
permit, the permittee shall provide the City Administrator accurate maps and drawings
certifying the "as-built" location of all equipment installed, owed and maintained by the
permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of
all facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city's electronic
mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by the City Administrator.
Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for
revoking the permit holder's registration.
(C)Service Laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals, other
than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rules 7560.0150 subpart 2, shall require the
permittee's use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed
service laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the City
Administrator reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to
the City Administrator evidence satisfactory to the City Administrator of the installed
service lateral locations. Compliance with this subdivision 2 and with applicable Gopher
State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after
December 31, 2005 shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for
(1) payments to contractors working on a public improvement project including
those under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 429 and
(2) city approval under development agreements or other subdivision or site plan
approval under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 462. The City Administrator shall
reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such information to
the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service
laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or
future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
§ 93.25 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES
(A) Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other
applicable law, and with Minnesota Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, to the extent
the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.

segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities that is or, pursuant to current
technology, the city expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation,
obstruction, or other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the
corridors established by the city shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or
excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned
position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause
shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities,
public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the registrant.
(D) Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities found in a right-of-way
that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance
or taking possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable condition.
(E) Limitation of Space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when necessary to protect the
right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement
of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall
strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way,
but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the
particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to
essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans
for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the
public interest.

all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities are less than twenty (20) inches below a concrete or
asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact
location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
§ 93.27 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES

(30) days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each registrant shall be responsible for
the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during the city's

from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with other right-of-way repair, excavation, or
construction, unless this requirement is waived by the city.

of competent jurisdiction authorizing entry.
(Ord. 02-2011, passed 5-9-2011)
§ 95.07 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE
(A) Procedure. Except with regard to abandoned, junk or unauthorized vehicles, whenever the
peace officer or other designated official determines that a public nuisance is being maintained or
exists on the premises in the city, the official shall notify in writing the owner of record or occupant
of the premises of such fact and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The notice of
violation shall specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and the time within which the
nuisance is to be abated. If the notice of violation is not complied with within the time specified, the
official shall report that fact forthwith to the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may, after
notice to the owner or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if the nuisance is not abated
within the time prescribed by the City Council, the city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy
of the City Council order and notice of motion for summary enforcement or obtain an administrative
search and seizure warrant and abate the nuisance.
(B) Notice. Written notice of the violation, notice of the time, date, place, and subject of any
hearing before the City Council, notice of the City Council order, and notice of motion for summary
enforcement hearing shall be served by a peace officer or designated official on the owner of record
or occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered mail. If the premise is not
occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or if the owner of record or occupant refuses to accept
notice, notice shall be served by posting it on the premises.
44 Cokato - General Regulations
(C) Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where delay in
abatement required to complete the procedure and notice requirements as set forth in divisions (A)
and (B) of this section will permit a continuing nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health,
safety, or welfare, the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To
proceed with summary enforcement, the peace officer or other designated official shall determine
that a public nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in the city and that delay in
abatement will unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare. The officer or designated
official shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance,
whether public health, safety, or welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement
required to complete the procedure set forth in division (A) of this section and may order that the
nuisance be immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance is not immediately terminated or
abated, the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance.
(D) Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city, without notice or other
process, from immediately abating any condition that poses an imminent and serious hazard to
human life or safety.
(E) Noisy parties or gatherings. When a peace officer determines that a gathering is creating such
a noise disturbance as prohibited under § 95.04, the officer may order all persons present, other than
the owner or tenant of the premises where the disturbance is occurring, to disburse immediately.
No person shall refuse to leave after being ordered to do so by law enforcement. Every owner or
tenant of the premises who has knowledge of the disturbance shall make every reasonable effort to
see that the disturbance is stopped.
(F) Judicial remedy. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from seeking a judicial remedy
when no other adequate administrative remedy exists.
(Ord. 02-2011, passed 5-9-2011)
§ 95.08 RECOVERY OF COSTS
(A) Personal liability. The owner of the premises on which a nuisance has been abated by the city,
or a person who has caused a public nuisance on property not owned by that person, shall be
personally liable for the cost to the city of the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon
as the work has been completed and the cost determined, the City Clerk or other city official shall
prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due
and payable at the office of the City Clerk.
(B) Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as it may be amended
from time to time, if the nuisance is a public health or safety hazard on private property, the
accumulation of snow and ice on public sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or
outside the traveled portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City Clerk shall, on or
before September 1 next following abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along
with all other such charges as well as other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S.
§ 429.101 against
Nuisances 45
each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable. The City Council may then spread
the charges against the property under that statute and any other pertinent statutes for certification
to the County Auditor and collection along with current taxes the following year or in annual
installments, not exceeding ten, as the City Council may determine in each case.
(C) Collection of other charges. This division applies to the collection of services charges for the
abatement of nuisances other than those subject to assessment pursuant to M.S. § 429.101. For all
such other services charges and pursuant to M.S. § 415.01, the city hereby avails itself of the
authority under M.S. §§ 366.011 and 366.012 to impose and provide for the collection of services
charges related to the abatement of nuisances. All unpaid charges shall be delinquent 30 days after
a notice of delinquency is sent by the city to the owner of the affected property. The city may certify
any unpaid charge to the County Auditor on or before October 15 of each year for collection with
the property taxes levied against the property if, on or before September 15, the city has given written
notice to the owner of the property of its intention to certify the charge to the auditor. All charges
shall be subject to the same penalties, interest and other conditions provided for the collection of
property taxes.

(B) The City Council finds that vacant buildings are a major cause and source of blight in residential
and non-residential neighborhoods, especially when the owner or responsible party of the building
fails to maintain and manage the building to ensure it does not become a liability to the
neighborhood. Vacant buildings often attract transients, trespassers and criminals. Neglect of vacant
buildings and the use of vacant buildings by transients and criminals creates a risk of fire, explosion
or flooding for the vacant building and adjacent properties. Vacant properties often are used as
dumping grounds for junk and debris and frequently are overgrown with weeds and tall grass. Vacant
buildings that are boarded to prevent entry by transients and other long-term vacancies are unsightly,
discourage economic development and inhibit the increase of property values. There is a substantial
cost to the city in monitoring vacant buildings regardless of whether they are boarded. This cost
should not be borne by the general taxpayers but should be borne by those who choose to leave their
buildings vacant.

an ongoing basis during vacancy.

following requirements:
(1) General provisions. The plan shall comply with all applicable regulations and meet the
approval of the Compliance Official. It shall contain a timetable regarding use or demolition of
the property. The plan shall be completed within 30 days after the building is registered.
(2) Maintenance of building. The plan shall identify the means and timetable for addressing all

correction of those items in accordance with Chapter 95 of this code and M.S. § 429.101, as it may
be amended from time to time. In the case of an absent owner and ongoing nuisance issues, the city
need not provide notice of each abatement act to the owner. A single notice by the city to the owner
is determined to be sufficient notice that it intends to provide ongoing abatement until the owner
corrects the violations.
(D) Exemptions.
(1) Casualty damage. A building that has suffered casualty damage is exempt from the
registration requirement for a period of 90 days after the date of the casualty event if the owner

issuance of any building permits or licenses, with the exception of a demolition permit.

refundable in the event the application is denied or withdrawn. The results of the comprehensive

The Legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in M.S. Chapters 103F and 394 for counties or Chapter
462 for municipalities, as it may be amended from time to time, delegated the authority to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Minnesota Statutes
Chapter 103F, as it may be amended from time to time, further stipulates that communities subject
to recurrent flooding must participate and maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance
Program. Therefore, the City of Cokato, Minnesota does ordain as follows in this chapter.
(Ord. passed 9-9-1991)
§ 151.002 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
The purpose of this chapter is to maintain the communitys eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program and to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life,
loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all
of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(Ord. passed 9-9-1991)
§ 151.003 WARNING OF DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
(A) This chapter does not imply that areas outside of the Flood Plain District, or land uses permitted
within the districts, will be free from flooding and flood damages.
(B) This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Cokato or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decisions lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. passed 9-9-1991)
§ 151.004 ADOPTION OF FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP
(A) The Flood Insurance Rate Map for the City of Cokato, dated August 19, 1985, developed by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, is hereby adopted by reference as the Official Flood Plain
Zoning District Map and made a part of this chapter.

§ 151.006 INTERPRETATION
(A) The boundaries of the Flood Plain District shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Plain Zoning District Map.
(B) Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the Flood Plain
District, the City Council shall make the necessary interpretation based on elevations on the regional
(100-year) flood profile, if available.
(C) If 100-year flood elevations are not available, the community shall:
(1) Require a flood plain evaluation consistent with § 151.037 to determine a 100-year flood
elevation for the site; or
(2) Base its decision on available hydraulic/hydrologic or site elevation survey data which
demonstrates the likelihood the site is within or outside of the flood plain.
(Ord. passed 9-9-1991)
§ 151.007 DEFINITIONS
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context indicates or
requires a different meaning.

riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain
structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMAs requirements
incorporate
13 Cokato - Land Usage
specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot
developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a
change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
(B) Storage of materials and equipment.
(1) The storage or processing of materials that are, in times of flooding, flammable, explosive
or potentially injurious to human, animal or plant life, is prohibited.
(2) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area
within the time available after a flood warning or if placed on fill to the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
(C) Draining abilities. No use shall be permitted which will adversely affect the capacity of the
channels or floodways of any tributary to the main stream, any drainage ditch, or any other drainage
facility or system.
(D) Building elevation regulations. All structures, including accessory structures, additions to
existing structures and manufactured homes, shall be constructed on fill so that the basement floor,
or first floor if there is no basement, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The
finished fill elevation must be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation
and shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the limits of the structure constructed
thereon.
(E) All uses. Uses that do not have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet
below the regulatory flood protection elevation to lands outside of the flood plain shall not be
permitted unless granted a variance by the Board of Adjustment. In granting a variance, the Board
shall specify limitations or the period of use or occupancy of the use and only after determining that
adequate flood warning time and local emergency response and recovery procedures exist.
(F) Commercial and manufacturing uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks and
parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a
permit for the facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the
absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities greater than four feet per
second upon occurrence of the regional flood.
(G) On-site sewage treatment and water supply systems. Where public utilities are not provided:
(1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
flood waters into the systems; and
(2) New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood
waters,
Flood Plain 14
and they shall not be subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any
sewage treatment system designed in accordance with the states current statewide standards
for on-site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this section.
(H) Anchoring. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.

SUBDIVISIONS
§ 151.055 SUBDIVISIONS
(A) No land shall be subdivided and no manufactured home park shall be developed or expanded
where the site is determined to be unsuitable by the Mayor and/or City Council and the Planning and
Zoning Commission for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment
facilities. The City Council and Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the
subdivision/development proposal to insure that each lot or parcel contains sufficient area outside
of the floodway for fill placement for elevating structures, sewage systems and related activities.
(B) In the Flood Plain District, applicants for subdivision approval, development of a manufactured
home park or manufactured home park expansion shall provide the information required in
§ 151.037(A). The City Administrator shall evaluate the proposed subdivision or mobile home park
development in accordance with the standards established in §§ 151.036 through 151.038.
(C) For all subdivisions in the flood plain, the floodway and flood fringe boundaries, the regulatory
flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled or
all required subdivision drawings and platting documents.

the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the
100-year flood elevation. FEMAs requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope
protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be
investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a charge of special flood hazard area
designation will be requested.
(E) This section is not intended as a substitute for a comprehensive city or county subdivision
ordinance. It can, however, be used as an interim control until the comprehensive subdivision
ordinance can be amended to include necessary flood plain management provisions.

a communitys respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.
(B) The Board may authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, the relief or variance from the terms
of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances such as
hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under consideration, as
provided for in the respective enabling legislation for planning and zoning for cities or counties as
appropriate.
In the granting of the variance, the Board of Adjustment shall clearly identify in writing the specific
conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in the respective enabling legislation
which justified the granting of the variance.
(C) Variances from the provisions of this chapter may be authorized where the Board of Adjustment
has determined the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and the spirit and intent of this
chapter. No variance shall allow, in any district, a use prohibited in that district or permit a lower
degree of flood protection then the regulatory flood protection elevation. Variances may be used to
modify permissible methods of flood protection.
(D) The Board shall submit by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources a copy of the
application for proposal or variance sufficiently in advance so that the Commissioner will receive at

17 Cokato - Land Usage
(E) Appeals from any decision of the Board may be made, and as specified in this Communitys
Official Controls and also Minnesota Statutes.
(F) The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant for a variance that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage as is set by City Council; and
(2) The construction below the 100-year or regional flood level increases risks to life and
property. The notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. A
community shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for its issuance
and report the variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the Administrator of
the National Flood Insurance Program.

§ 151.074 NONCONFORMITIES
A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment
of this chapter but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may be continued,
subject to the following conditions:
(A) No such use shall be expanded, charged, enlarged or altered in a way which increases its
nonconformity;
(B) An alteration within the inside dimensions of a nonconforming use or structure is permissible
provided it will not result in increasing the flood damage potential of that use or structure;
(C) The cost of all structural alterations or additions both inside and outside of a structure to any
nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50% of the market value of
the structure unless the conditions of this section are satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations
and additions constructed since the adoption of the communitys initial flood plain controls must be
calculated into todays current cost, which will include all costs such as construction materials and
a reasonable cost placed or all manpower or labor. If the current cost of all previous and proposed
alterations and additions exceeds 50% of the current market value of the structure, then the structure
must meet the standards of
§§ 151.035 through 151.036 for new structures; and
(D) If any nonconforming use of a structure, land or nonconforming structure is destroyed by any
means, including floods, to an extent of 50% or more of its market value at the time of destruction,
it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. The Mayor and
City Council may issue a permit for reconstruction if the use is located outside the floodway and,
upon reconstruction, is adequately elevated of fill in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

§ 151.999 PENALTY
A violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in correction with grants of variance)
shall constitute a misdemeanor.
(A) In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning Administrator and local
government may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it including, but not limited
to, prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance availability to the
guilty party. The community must act in good faith to enforce these official controls and to correct
ordinance violations to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(B) When an ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to the attention of the Zoning
Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall immediately investigate the situation and document
the nature and extent of the violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this
information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural Resources and Federal
Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with the communitys plan of action to
correct the violation to the degree possible.

less than 500 feet for arterial streets, 300 feet for collectors and 100 feet for all other streets. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may allow greater or lesser sight distances at the recommendation
of the Engineer.
(D) Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall be avoided for local
streets.
(E) Local streets. Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic is discouraged.

measured from the centerline of the street of origin to the end of the right-of-way.
(G) Centerline gradients. All centerline gradients shall be at least 0.5% and shall not exceed the
following:
(1) Arterial streets and collector streets: 5%; and
(2) Minor streets and marginal access streets: 8%.
(H) Access to arterial streets. In the case where a proposed plat is adjacent to a limited access
highway (arterial), there shall be no direct vehicular or pedestrian access from individual lots to the
highways. As a general requirement, access arterial streets shall be at intervals of not less than
one-fourth mile and through existing and established crossroads where possible.
(I) Platting of small tracts. In the platting of small tracts of land fronting on arterial streets where
there is no convenient access to existing entrances and where access from the plat would be closer
than one-fourth mile from an existing access point, a temporary entrance permit may be granted.
Provision shall be made in the plats for the connection of roads to neighboring land. As the
neighboring land is platted and developed and access becomes possible at a preferred location, the
temporary entrance permits shall become void.
(J) Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where it will be practical to require the
dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided, in which case the dedication
of a half street may be permitted. The probable length of time elapsing before dedication of the
remainder shall be considered in this decision.
33 Cokato - Land Usage
(K) Private streets. Private streets may be permitted, however, they must conform to the same
standards as public streets.
(L) Hardship to owners of adjoining property. The street arrangements shall not be such as to cause
hardship to owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing convenient access
to it.
(Prior Code, § 904.41)
§ 152.044 BLOCKS
The length, width and acreage of blocks shall be sufficient to provide for convenient access,

locations.
(C) Natural features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for all natural
features, such as tree growth, wetlands, steep slopes, water courses, historic spots or similar
conditions and plans adjusted to preserve those which proposed development.
(D) Lot remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing of a larger
tract must be added to adjacent lots rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
(E) Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots with frontage on two parallel streets or reverse
frontage shall not be permitted except where lots back an arterial or collector street. The lots shall
have an additional depth of at least ten feet in order to allow for screen planting along the back lot
line.
(F) Septic tank and drainfield locations. On large lots (one acre or more) septic tanks and
drainfields, when permitted, shall be located in such a way as to allow future subdivision of the land.

(Prior Code, § 904.49)
IMPROVEMENTS
§ 152.080 IMPROVEMENTS LISTED AND DESCRIBED
Prior to the approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall have agreed in the manner set forth below
to install in conformity with construction plans approved by the City Engineer and in conformity
with all applicable standards and ordinances, the following improvements on the site.
(A) Monuments. Monuments of a permanent character, as required by M.S. § 505.021, Subdivision
10, shall be placed at each corner or angle on the outside boundary of the subdivision; and pipes or
steel rods shall be placed at each corner of each lot and each intersection of street centerline.
(B) Streets. The full width of the right-of-way of each street and alley dedicated in the plat shall be
graded. All streets and alleys shall be an adequate sub-base and shall be improved with an
all-weather permanent surface in accordance with the design standards specified by the city. Except
in areas where lot widths exceed 100 feet or topography or tree cover dictates otherwise, grading
shall provide for easy installation of sidewalks at some future date.
(C) Paving. The City Council may require that all streets and alleys be improved with a concrete
or bituminous surface. Paving shall be required if central sewer and water services are provided. If
central sewer and water services will not be provided for at least ten years, paving may be required.
If center sewer and water services are to be provided within ten years, paving should not be required
until after the central sewer and water services are installed. The city may require a cash deposit to
be used for paving the streets after central sewer and water services are provided. Streets to be paved
shall be surfaced for five-ton axle weight capacity.
37 Cokato - Land Usage
(D) Concrete curb and gutter. Concrete curb and gutter may be required for all paved streets.
(E) Sidewalks. Sidewalks may be required along both sides of all streets in areas where residential
density equals or exceeds three dwelling units per net acre of residentially used land or in commercial
areas.
(F) Water supply. Where a municipal water supply is available within a reasonable distance, the
subdivider may be required to provide a connection to the municipal system. The feasibility of this
requirement shall be evaluated based on the cost of constructing the connection weighed against the
cost of installing individual wells and the likelihood of an eventual municipal connection in the
future. Where a municipal connection is determined to be unfeasible, the subdivider shall either:
(1) Install a system providing each lot with an adequate supply of potable water; or
(2) State on his or her final plat that purchasers of individual lots will be required to install
their own approved wells.
(G) Street lighting. Street lighting of a type approved by the community may be required at all
intersections within the subdivision.
(H) Sewage treatment and disposal. If and when a community sewage treatment system is provided,
all new subdivisions shall be required to hook up to the community sewer system. All new private
sewage treatment systems shall conform to the standards for septic tanks and drainfields set forth in
§ 153.050.
(I) Drainage. A system that will adequately take care of the surface water runoff within the
subdivision shall be provided. Storm sewers and culverts shall be installed where necessary in
conjunction with the grading of streets. Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural
water flow and shall be of sufficient length to permit full-width roadways and required side slopes.
Drainage ditches shall be sodded to prevent erosion.
(J) Street signs. Street signs of standard design approved by the City Council shall be installed at
each street intersection.
(K) Public utilities. All utility lines for telephone and electrical service shall be placed in rear line
easements when carried on overhead poles.
(L) Park land dedication. In every plat or subdivision of land allowing development for residential
uses, a reasonable portion of the land, but not less than 10%, shall be set aside and dedicated by the
tract owner or owners to the general public as open space for park and playground purposes, public
open space or storm water holding areas or ponds. The land shall be suitable for public use as parks
and playgrounds or for one of the afore described purposes, and the city shall not be required to
accept land which will not be usable for parks and playgrounds or which would require extensive
expenditures on the part of the public to make them usable. The city shall have the option to require
cash contribution in lieu of setting aside dedicated land or in requiring a part of the land and the
balance of the land value
Subdivision Regulations 38
in cash. Any money so paid to the city shall be placed in a special fund and used only for the
acquisition of land for parks and playgrounds or the development of existing park and playground
sites or debt retirement in connection with land previously acquired for parks and playgrounds. For
purposes of this chapter, FAIR MARKET LAND VALUE is defined as the market value of the land
within the plat or subdivision as of the date presented to the City Council for preliminary approval,
or if no preliminary approval be given or required, as of the date so presented for final approval, as
determined by the City Assessor in the same manner as he or she determines, the market value of
land for tax purposes, excluding, in determining the value, all value added to the land by
improvements other than utilities, streets and other public improvements serving the land, but
including in the determination the highest and best used to which the land can be put under the
zoning districts then about to be transferred.
(Prior Code, § 904.50)
§ 152.081 PAYMENT FOR INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS
The required improvements to be furnished and installed by the subdivider, which are listed and
described above, are to be furnished and installed at the sole expense of the subdivider and at no expense
to the public; provided, however, that in the case of an improvement, the cost of which would be general
policy of the governing body be assessed only in part to the improved property and the remaining cost
paid out of general tax levy. The City Council may make provision for payment of a portion of the cost
by the subdivider and the remaining portion of the cost by the city. If any improvement installed within
the subdivision will be of substantial benefit to lands beyond the boundaries of the subdivision, the City
Council may make provision for causing a portion of the cost of the improvement representing in the
case the subdivider will be required only to pay for the portions of the whole cost of the improvements
as will represent the benefit to the property within the subdivision.

of transfer of ownership or building development does not come within the definitions of
SUBDIVISION, as defined by this chapter, a description of the land division shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator.
(B) No building permit shall be issued until the description has been received by the Zoning
Administrator and approved by the City Council. In the cases of any land divisions or combinations
involving more than two lots of record, such division or combination shall be reviewed by the

§ 153.036 FLOOD PLAIN OVERLAY (F)
(A) Purpose. The Flood Plain Overlay District is created for the purpose of controlling the
71 Cokato - Land Usage
development of the flood plain areas of the City of Cokato to minimize potential losses of life and
property due to periodic flooding, and to prevent health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and
impairment of the tax base. The regulations contained in this section are required and authorized by
M.S. Chapters 103F and 462, as it may be amended from time to time, and Minnesota Regulations
NR 85-92, whereby the legislature of the State of Minnesota has delegated the responsibility to local
government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
(B) General provisions; adoption of flood insurance study. The Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
for the City of Cokato, dated August 19, 1985, developed by the Federal Insurance Administration,
is hereby adopted by reference and made part of this chapter. A copy of the most current version of
this map shall be kept on file with the City Administrator.
(C) Lands to which chapter applies. This subchapter shall apply to all lands designated as Flood
Hazard Areas (Zone A) within the jurisdiction of the City of Cokato as shown on the FIRM.
(D) Regulatory flood protection elevation. The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an
elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood
elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a floodway.
(E) Interpretation. The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances
on the Zoning Map and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of the boundaries of a district, the Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile and other available
technical data.
(F) Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located,
extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this section and
other applicable regulations that apply to uses within the jurisdictions of this subchapter.
(G) Establishment of Flood Plain Overlay District (F); overlay concept. The Flood Plain Overlay
District (F) shall be applied to and superimposed upon any underlying district as indicated on the
Cokato Zoning Map. Where the provisions of the underlying district impose more restrictive, greater
or additional standards that those of the F District, the underlying district shall be controlling. Where
the provisions of the F District impose more restrictive, greater or additional standards than those
contained in the underlying district, the F District shall be controlling.
(H) Floodway and flood fringe areas. The City of Cokato shall determine whether any proposed
use of lands within the F District is considered floodway or flood fringe area. This determination
shall be made in accordance with the procedures established in division (L) below. If it is determined
that a proposed area lies in the floodway area, the provisions of division (I) below shall apply. If it
is determined that the proposed use lies in the flood fringe area, the provisions of division (J) below
shall apply.
(I) Floodway area; permitted uses. The following uses have a low flood damage potential and do
not obstruct flood flows. These uses shall be permitted within the floodway area as long as they are
not prohibited by any other ordinance and provided they do not require structures, fill or storage of
materials or equipment.
Zoning Regulations 72
(1) Agriculture uses such as general farming pasture, forestry, sod farming and wild crop
harvesting.
(2) Industrial: Commercial uses such as parking areas and airport landing strips.

(5) All other uses are prohibited.
(J) Flood fringe area.
(1) Permitted uses. Any use permitted within a floodway area.
(2) Conditional uses.
(a) Residences (including mobile homes and manufactured homes), accessory buildings
and other structures constructed on fill so that the basement floor or first floor, if there is
no basement, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill
elevation shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation
and shall extend at the elevation at least 15 feet beyond the limits of any structure or
building erected thereon. Fill shall be compacted and the slopes shall be protected by riprap
or vegetative covering. Residences constructed on fill shall be provided with vehicular
access no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(b) Placement of fill for any purpose not listed.

in division (J)(2)(a) above.
(K) Other similar uses; conditional use procedure. Conditional uses shall be considered, evaluated
and approved only in accordance with the administrative procedural requirements for conditional
use permits as specified in division (L) and (M) below and the requirements of this section.
(L) Procedures for evaluating proposed conditional uses within the flood plain overlay district.
(1) Upon receipt of an application for a conditional use permit for a use within the flood plain
overlay district, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as
is deemed necessary by the Planning and Zoning Commission for the determination of the
regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use is within the floodway of
flood fringe areas.
73 Cokato - Land Usage
(a) A typical valley cross-section showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land area
adjoining each side of the channel, cross sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed
development and high water information.
(b) Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground; pertinent structure,
fill or storage elevation; size, location and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing
structures on the site; location and elevations of streets; photographs showing existing land
uses and vegetation upstream and downstream and soil type.
(c) Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at
least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development.
(2) One copy of the above information shall be transmitted to a designated engineer or other
expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in
the floodway or flood fringe and to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation.
Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations NR 86-87 shall be followed in this expert
evaluation. The designated engineer or expert shall:
(a) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood;
(b) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic
analysis of the stream channel and over bank areas; and
(c) Compute the floodway necessary to convey the regional flood without increasing flood
stages more than one-half feet. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream
within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries.
(3) Based upon the technical evaluation of the designated engineer or expert, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall determine whether the proposed use is in the floodway or flood fringe
and the regulatory flood protection elevation at the site. Factors upon which the decision of the
Cokato City Council shall be based:
(a) The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by
encroachments;
(b) The danger that materials may be swept into other lands or downstream to the injury
of others;
(c) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to
prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions;
(d) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the
effect of the damage on the individual owner;
(e) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
Zoning Regulations 74
(f) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
(g) The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use;
(h) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development
anticipated in the foreseeable future;
(i) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and flood plain
management program for the area;
(j) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood
waters expected at the site; and
(l) The other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this chapter.
(M) Conditions attached to conditional use permits. Upon consideration of the factors listed above
the purposes of this chapter, the city may attach those conditions to the granting of conditional use
permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. The conditions may include, but
are not limited to, the following:
(1) Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities;
(2) Limitation on period use, occupancy and operation;
(3) Imposition of operational controls, sureties and deed restrictions;
(4) Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees and other protective
measures;

associated flood factors for the particular area; and
(6) Erosion prevention measures, including sodding, sloping and rip-rapping requirements.
(N) Subdivisions. No land shall be subdivided which is held unsuitable by the city for reason of
flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots within the flood
plain districts shall contain a building site at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All
subdivisions shall have water and sewage disposal facilities that comply with the provisions of this
chapter and have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower
than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
75 Cokato - Land Usage
(O) Utilities, railroads, roads and bridges.
(1) Public utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer and water
supply systems to be located in the flood plain shall be flood-proofed in accordance with the
State Building Code or elevated at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(2) Public transportation facilities. Roads, railroad tracks and bridges within the flood plain
shall be designed to minimize increases in flood elevations.
(a) Bridges, culverts and approach fills shall comply with provisions of Minnesota
Regulations 6 MCAR § 1.5025.
(b) Roads, railroad tracks and bridges shall be elevated above the regulator protection
elevation if failure or interpretation of transportation services would endanger the public
health or safety.
(3) Individual sewage treatment systems. Individual sewage treatment and water supply
systems shall be designed and located so that they will not be damaged or contaminate surface
water if flooded.
(P) Conditional use permit.
(1) Conditional use permit required. A conditional use permit issued by the Zoning
Administrator shall be secured prior to the construction, addition or alteration of any building,
structure; prior to the use or change of use of a building structure or land; prior to the change or
extension of a nonconforming use and prior to the placement of fill or excavation of materials
within the flood plain.

(S)Variances. The Board of Adjustment and Appeals may authorize upon appeals, variances from the
provision of this chapter as long as they will not be contrary to the public interest, and if the spirit of this
chapter will be observed. Variances may only be granted where, due to special conditions, literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. No variance
Zoning Regulations 76
shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district, permit a lower degree
of flood protection that the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area or permit
standards lower than those required by state law.
(T) Amendments. All amendments to this chapter shall be submitted to and approved by the
Commissioner of Natural Resources prior to adoption. Changes in the boundaries of the floodway
or flood fringe districts also require prior approval by the Federal Insurance Administration.

§ 153.037 SHORELAND OVERLAY (S)
(A) Purpose. The uncontrolled use of shoreland areas affects the public health, safety and general
welfare by contributing to the pollution of public waters, causing overcrowding of surface waters
and impairing the local tax base. The legislature of the State of Minnesota has delegated
responsibility to the municipalities of the State of Minnesota M.S. Chapters 103F and 462, as it may
be amended from time to time, to regulate the subdivision, use and development of shorelands in
accordance with regulations (NR 82-84) developed by the Commissioner of Natural Resources. The
City of Cokato recognizes this responsibility and adopts the following requirements to satisfy this
mandate.
(B) Additional definitions. In addition to the definitions contained in § 153.006, the following
definitions shall also apply within the Shoreland Overlay District (S). In case of conflict between
these definitions, the most restrictive shall apply.
BOATHOUSE. A structure used solely for the storage of boats or boating equipment.
BUILDING LINE. That line measured across the width of the lot at the point where the

changes from predominantly aquatic to predominantly terrestrial.
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT. A type of development which may incorporate a variety
of land uses planned and developed as a unit. The PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT is
distinguished from the traditional subdivision process of development in that zoning standards
such as density, height limits and minimum lot sizes may be altered by negotiation and
agreement between the developer, the municipality and the Commissioner of Natural
Resources. CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT is considered to be a type of Planned Unit
Development and is subject to the same review criteria.
SETBACK. The minimum horizontal distance between a structure or sanitary facility and a
road, well, highway or property lines.
SHORELAND. Land located within the following distances from protected waters:
(a) One thousand feet from the ordinary high water mark of a lake, pond or flowage; and

the rivers or streams, whichever is greater.
SUBDIVISION. Improved or unimproved land or lands which are divided for the purpose of
ready sale or lease, or divided successively within a five-year period for the purpose of sale or
lease, into three or more lots or parcels of less than five acres each, contiguous in area and which
are under common ownership or control.
SUBSTANDARD USE. Any use of shorelands existing prior to the date of enactment of this
subchapter which is permitted within the applicable zoning district but does not meet the
minimum lot area and length or water frontage, structure setbacks or other dimensional
standards of this chapter.

by the Commissioner of Natural Resources as follows:
(a) Brooks Lake (DNR I.D. #86-264p) recreational development;
(b) Sucker Creek Urban.
Zoning Regulations 78
(2) Purpose. The shorelands of the City of Cokato are hereby designated as a Shoreland
Overlay District (S). The purpose of the Shoreland Overlay District is to provide for the wise
utilization of shoreland areas in order to preserve the quality and natural character of these
protected waters of the city. The S district is shown on the zoning map.

dislocated telecommunication towers and facilities by ensuring that those structures
are appropriately located and soundly designed, constructed, and maintained and
removed promptly when no longer used or when determined to be structurally
unsound;
(4) Ensure that telecommunication towers and facilities are compatible with surrounding
land uses, especially residential uses; and
(5) Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunications services to the residents and
businesses of the city in an orderly fashion.

is greater.
A tower which exceeds 180 feet in height shall be set back from the nearest property
line a distance equal to the height of the tower plus an additional 1.5feet for every foot by
which its height exceeds 180 feet, unless an engineer certifies in writing that the tower
will collapse within a lesser distance under all reasonably foreseeable conditions. If
an applicant produces the engineering certification required in this subdivision, the
setback may be reduced to a distance no less than 75 percent of the height of the tower,
except that setbacks from land within the M-1, R-1, R-2 or R-3 zoning districts shall be a
minimum of 300 feet or 150 percent of the height of the tower, whichever is greater.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any tower which is supported by guy
wires shall comply with the full setback as provided herein and shall not qualify for
Zoning Regulations 102
any reduction in setback allowed by certification from an engineer regarding the collapse
pattern of the tower.
(3) Engineer Certification. Towers must be designed and certified by an engineer to be in
conformance with the Uniform Building Code and all other applicable standards set forth
in the city code of ordinances and to be structurally sound for conditions reasonably
likely to occur in Minnesota.

dual mode lighting from the Federal Aviation Administration.
(5) Exterior Finish. Towers not requiring specific painting or marking by the Federal
Aviation Administration must have an exterior finish approved by the city.
(6) Fencing. Fences constructed around or upon parcels containing towers, antenna support
structures, or telecommunications facilities must be constructed in accordance with any
fencing requirements applicable within the zoning district in which the tower, antenna
support structure or telecommunications facility is located, unless more stringent fencing
requirements are required by the Federal Communications Commission regulations.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any guy wire used to support a tower
shall be fenced so that it is protected against climbing and vandalism.
(7)Camouflage; Landscaping. Reasonable but creative measures must be employed to
camouflage towers from view. Landscaping on parcels containing buildings used as
antenna support structures or telecommunications facilities must meet the landscaping
requirements approved in the special use permit. Utility buildings and structures
accessory to the tower must be designed to blend in architecturally with the surrounding
environment and to meet all setback requirements applicable to the tower. Ground
mounted equipment must be screened from view by suitable vegetation, except where a
design using non-vegetative screening better reflects and complements the character of
the surrounding neighborhood. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the city
may impose more stringent screening requirements when a tower, antenna support
structure or telecommunications facility will be in close proximity to residential uses or
environmentally sensitive areas or land forms.
(8) Accessory Buildings. One accessory building not more than 2000 sq. ft. in area is
permitted per tower.
(9) Security; Signs. Towers and telecommunication facilities must be reasonably posted and

additional Franchise.
d. The City shall comply with Section 14.4 of the Cable Ordinance in the event an

of this Franchise by Grantee as required by Section 8 herein, this Franchise shall supersede
and replace any previous ordinance or other authorization granting a Franchise to Grantee,
and all rights, obligations and claims under any previous Franchise are extinguished, except
that the Grantees obligation to indemnify the City against claims that arose during the term
of the previous Franchise shall continue in full force and effect subject to applicable law.
Section 2.2 Franchise Term.
This Franchise will be in effect for a period of fifteen (15) years from the date of acceptance
by the Grantee, unless sooner renewed or revoked.
Section 2.3 Service Area.
a. This Franchise is granted for the corporate boundaries of the City, as it
exists from time to time, subject to the density requirement of Section 2.3.b below. The

Grantee will be required to serve subject to Section 2.3b below.
b. The Grantee will extend its System and offer Cable Service, within a
reasonable time, after a request for Service, to areas with a density of at least nine (9)
residential units per one-quarter (1/4) cable mile of System, as measured from the nearest
accessible Cable System tie-in point actively delivering Cable Service as of the date of

may require that Persons requesting Service pay a portion of the cost of the capital cost of
the line extension in advance. The Grantee shall provide a free written estimate of the total
cost for extension and the required payment amount within fifteen (15) days of the request
for Service. The charge for Installation or extension for each Person requesting Service
shall not exceed a pro rata share of the actual cost of extending the Service. Subscribers
shall also be responsible for any standard/non standard installation charges to extend the
Cable System from the tap to the residence.
SECTION 3. SYSTEM
Section 3.1 System Capacity.
Grantee will continue to operate a System providing a minimum of at least 75 video
programmed Channels throughout the term of this Franchise. The System must have return
capability and permit narrowcasting as provided in Section 4.2(c).
Section 3.2 Construction Deadline.
Except for Grantees System extension obligations pursuant to Section 2.3, System
construction is substantially complete. Subject to Section 2.3b above, Grantee will use
commercially reasonable efforts to complete any System extension and construction of
new facilities for new developments contemporaneous with installation of other utilities.
The City shall provide reasonable and timely advance written notice of the location of all
new developments to Grantee.
SECTION 4. COMMUNITY SERVICES
Section 4.1 Commercial Video Programming.
The Grantee will provide broad categories of video programming, including news, sports
and entertainment.
Section 4.2 PEG Access Facilities.
a. Access Channels. The Grantee shall continue to dedicate two (2) Channels
for public, education, and government access (PEG Access) programming. The two (2)
PEG Access Channels must be cablecast on the Basic Cable Service tier. All Subscribers
who receive Cable Services offered on the System must receive the PEG Access Channels
at no additional charge. Only to the extent required by Minn. Stat. §238.084, Subd. 1. (z)
and permitted by applicable law, the VHF spectrum must be used for the provision of at
least one (1) of the PEG Access Channels. Nothing herein shall diminish the Citys rights
to secure additional channels pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 238.084, Subd. 1(z), and applicable
FCC regulations.
b. Responsibility for PEG Access. The City will operate, administer, and
manage PEG Access programming pursuant to this Section 4.2. The City may delegate its
PEG Access authority and responsibilities to the Commission. The Grantee acknowledges
that the Commission may coordinate the expenditure of Franchise Fees and PEG Capital
Fees by and among the Commissions member municipalities. Nothing herein shall
obligate the City to make equipment or channels available for public access programming
or to any particular programmer.
c. Narrowcast. The System currently allows one (1) PEG Access Channel to
be narrowcast; i.e. permits a program to be cablecast on such Channel for viewing solely
by Subscribers in one City while Subscribers in adjoining cities served by the Grantee and
who are members of the Commission simultaneously view other programming on that
Channel. Grantee shall continue to ensure that such narrowcasting is provided on the
System.
d. Live Origination. The Grantee shall continue to provide two-way capability
permitting transmission of live programming from the public institutional sites listed in
Exhibit A-1 attached. The Grantee shall not be required to provide end-user equipment.
The City may designate relocated or additional live programming sites provided that the
City shall pay the actual construction cost of connecting such relocated or additional live
programming sites prior to the Grantees construction of same. The Grantee must ensure
that the System meets the technical standards attached as Exhibit B at all live origination
sites. The Grantee must further ensure that the City can narrowcast programming
originated from City Hall consistent with Section 4.2c.
e. High Definition.
(i) Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Date, unless
delayed by events out of Grantees reasonable control, the Grantee shall
convert the Commissions area-wide PEG Access Channel (i.e. the
Channel that is not narrowcast to each member city pursuant to Section
4.2(c)) to high definition (HD) provided that the programming signals
are provided to the Grantee in HD and meet Grantees technical
specifications for HD channels. Thereafter, at such time as Grantee makes
at least 90% of all non-PEG Channels available in HD, the Grantee shall
also convert the narrowcast PEG Access Channel to HD provided that
the programming signals are provided to the Grantee in HD and meet
Grantees technical specifications for HD channels. The City understands
that, although the Grantee must ensure that the PEG Access Channels are
cablecast on the Basic Cable Service tier and available to all Subscribers at
no additional charge, the HD PEG Access Channel will not be located on
the Basic Cable tier, the signal from the HD PEG Access Channels may
not be available in HD on the Basic Cable tier of service, and Grantee
shall have no obligation to carry PEG Access Channels in more than one
format; i.e. dual carriage. Grantees costs to purchase equipment to
convert and distribute programming on the PEG Access Channels in HD
will be reimbursed by the City or Commission in an aggregate amount not
to exceed Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($7500.00) within sixty
(60) days of receipt of invoices evidencing Grantees expenditures.
(ii) The City acknowledges that in order to receive Access Channels in HD
format Subscribers may be required to buy or lease special equipment, or
pay additional HD charges applicable to all HD services,
f. PEG Access Capital Support. In addition to the requirements of Section
4.2(a)-(d) above, the Grantee shall collect and remit a PEG capital fee of up to eighty-five
cents ($.85) per Subscriber, per month (PEG Capital Fee). The Grantee shall remit such
payments on the same schedule as the Franchise Fee. All amounts paid shall be subject to
audit and recomputation and acceptance thereof does not constitute an accord that amounts
paid are correct. The PEG Capital Fee as of the Effective Date is eighty-five cents ($.85)
per Subscriber, per month. Grantee may itemize any PEG Capital Fee on Subscribers
bills. Payment by Grantee must be separate from and in addition to any Franchise Fee.
g. Use of PEG Capital Fee. The City and Grantee agree that the City will
expend the PEG Capital Fees solely for capital costs (consistent with GAAP) associated
with PEG Access. In consideration for Grantees obligation to remit the PEG Capital Fee,
the City agrees to provide financial support for PEG Access that is equivalent to the amount
of PEG Capital Fees collected and provided to the City. Within sixty (60) days of written
request, the City shall provide Grantee with an annual report of any expenditures of the
PEG Access Capital Fee to insure such fees are used for capital costs related to PEG
Access. The report shall also demonstrate how the City fulfilled its requirement to provide
matching support for PEG Access. Based on the report, the Grantee may send a written
notice to the City alleging that the City failed to demonstrate that the PEG Capital Fee was
used for capital or that matching PEG Access support was provided. The City shall have
thirty (30) days after receipt of the written notice to provide additional information
demonstrating compliance with the requirements of this Section. If the Grantee continues
to allege that the City has not complied with its obligations herein, the Grantee may provide
written notice of its intent to reduce and/or discontinue collecting and remitting the PEG
Capital Fee. If the City disputes the Grantees actions, it may initiate any enforcement
action under the Cable Ordinance it deems appropriate.
h. Access Rules. The City may implement rules governing PEG Access
Channels and programming.
i. Parity of Obligations. The City will impose equivalent PEG Access
obligations on any other franchised provider of Cable Service in the City.
Section 4.3 Drops and Service to Public Buildings.
a. Subject to applicable law, the Grantee must provide, without charge,
monthly Basic Cable Service and Cable Programming Service (excluding pay-per-channel
or pay-per-program), one (1) Drop, one (1) outlet, and one (1) Converter of the type and
functionality made available to Subscribers (Complimentary Service) to the public
institutional sites listed in Exhibit A-2 attached which are served as of the Effective Date.
The programming provided by Grantee is not for public display. The City shall hold the
Grantee harmless for any copyright, or other penalties, incurred due to improper use of free
service. If additional Converters or other customer premises equipment (CPE) are
required to receive Complimentary Service, Grantee reserves the right to charge the
institution the published rate for such CPE consistent with applicable law.
b. Subject to applicable law, the Grantee shall connect such additional public
administration buildings as the City may subsequently designate, provided however, that
the Grantee shall only be required to pay the cost of the first one hundred and fifty (150)
feet of any necessary System or Drop construction as measured from an accessible System
tie-in point actively delivering Cable Service, and further provided that the City or
institution shall pay any additional mutually agreed upon construction cost. The Grantee
will have a reasonable time from the designation of additional sites to complete extension.
Institutions may add outlets at their own expense. The Grantee shall only be required to
provide Complimentary Service to the extent a newly designated building replaces a site
previously receiving such service.
Section 4.4 Receipt of Subscriber Payments
The Grantee must maintain a convenient means for Subscribers to make payments such as
the ability to make payments electronically via a company website.
SECTION 5. ADMINISTRATION PROVISIONS
Section 5.1 Franchise Fee.
a. The Grantee shall pay a Franchise Fee to the City in an amount equal to five
percent (5%) of its Gross Revenues. The Grantee shall remit Franchise Fee payments to
the City on a quarterly basis within 60 days of the close of the preceding calendar quarter.
Payments shall be based on Gross Revenues generated during the preceding calendar
quarter. In the event Grantee offers a bundle or package of Cable Services and non-Cable
Services at a discounted rate, the Grantee must allocate revenues between Cable Services
subject to the Franchise Fee and non-Cable Services that are not subject to the Fee on a
proportionate pro rata basis in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP). In no event shall the Grantee allocate the revenues to evade its Franchise Fee
obligations under this Franchise or to disproportionately reduce Gross Revenues.
b. Each Franchise Fee payment must be accompanied by a report in form
reasonably acceptable to City detailing the computation of the payment. All amounts paid
are subject to audit and recomputation by the City, and acceptance of any payment must
not be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount. In
accordance with Minn. Stat. § 541.05, any action to recover Franchise Fees must be
commenced within three (3) years of receipt of the Franchise Fee payment or due date for
such payment.
c. In the event that any Franchise payment or recomputed payment is not made
on or before the dates specified herein, Grantee shall pay an interest charge, computed from
such due date, at the annual rate of one percent over the prime interest rate.
Section 5.2 Rules of Grantee.
The Grantee may promulgate such rules, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its
business provided that such rules, terms and conditions must not be in conflict with the
provisions of this Franchise, the Cable Ordinance, or applicable laws or regulations.
SECTION 6. INDEMNIFICATION, INSURANCE, BONDS
Section 6.1 Indemnification.
By acceptance of this Franchise, the Grantee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the City
harmless in accordance with the Cable Ordinance.
Section 6.2 Insurance.
At the time of acceptance of this Franchise, the Grantee will file with the City a Certificate
of Insurance in accordance with the Cable Ordinance. The Grantee must maintain such
insurance for the entire term of this Franchise.
Section 6.3 Performance Bond.
a. The Grantee must furnish to the Commission, for the benefit of all member
cities of the Commission, a single performance bond in the amount of Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000.00) in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Commission.
The single bond provided to the Commission shall comply with the parallel bonding
requirements imposed by the other members of the Commission. The Grantee must
maintain the bond until this Franchise expires or is terminated.
b. The bond shall be conditioned upon Grantees faithful performance in
accordance with the terms of this Franchise, the Cable Ordinance, and applicable laws and
regulations. The bond must provide that in the event the Grantee fails to comply with any
law, ordinance or regulation, any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result, including
the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment
of any property of the Grantee, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys fees and costs,
up to the full amount of the security, will be recoverable jointly and severally from the
principal and surety of the bond, and further guaranteeing payment by the Grantee of
claims, liens and taxes due the City which arise. In the event this Franchise is revoked or
the rights hereunder relinquished or abandoned by Grantee, the City is entitled to collect
any resultant damages, costs or liabilities incurred by the City.
c. The City and Grantee acknowledge that it may be difficult or impossible to
accurately quantify actual damages or losses suffered by the City due to a violation or
unsatisfied obligation under this Franchise, the Cable Ordinance, or applicable laws or
regulations. Accordingly, the City may, in its reasonable discretion, collect liquidated
damages in an amount of up to Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00) per violation of
any provision of this Franchise, the Cable Ordinance, or applicable laws or regulations in
an amount not to exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) in any calendar year. Each
violation may be considered a separate violation for which separate liquidated damages
can be imposed.
d. In the event the City will make any claim against the bond or otherwise
seeks to assess liquidated damages, the City must comply with Section 14 of the Cable
Ordinance governing enforcement of this Franchise.
e. The Citys rights herein are in addition to all other rights the City may have
and the Citys exercise of such rights does not constitute an exclusive remedy nor limit any
other right.
SECTION 7. MISCELLANEOUS REQUIREMENTS
Section 7.1 Amendment of Franchise Ordinance.
The Grantee and the City may mutually agree, from time to time, to amend this Franchise.
Any changes, modifications or amendments to this Franchise must be made in writing,

substantially alter the agreement between the Parties. In the event a law, rule or regulation
is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed so that the Franchise
provision which had been held invalid, preempted or modified is no longer in conflict
therewith, such Franchise provision will return to full force and effect and thereafter be
binding upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Grantee.
Section 7.4 Nonenforcement by City.
The Grantee is not relieved of its obligations to comply with this Franchise or the Cable
Ordinance due to any failure or delay of the City to enforce prompt compliance. The City
and Grantee may only waive its rights by expressly so stating in writing.
