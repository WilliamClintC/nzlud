other conditions that should be considered. Upon receiving such order and
directions, the City Assessor shall make out an assessment roll, entering
and describing therein all the lots, premises and parcels of land to be
assessed, with the names of the persons, if known, chargeable with the
assessments thereon, and shall levy thereon and against such persons
the amounts to be assessed, in the manner directed by Council and the
provisions of this chapter applicable to the assessment, and if the several
descriptions thus to be assessed in any special assessment district shall
extend into more than one ward by themselves, separate from those of the
others. In all cases where the ownership of any description is unknown to
the City Assessor, he or she shall, in lieu of the name of the owner, insert
the name "Unknown"; and, if by mistake or otherwise, any person shall be
improperly designated as the owner of any lot, parcel of land or premises, or
if the same shall be assessed without the name of the owner, or in the name
of a person other than the owner, such assessment shall not, for any such
cause, be vitiated, but shall, in all respects, be as valid upon and against
such lot, parcel of land or premises as though assessed in the name of the
property owner, and when the assessment roll shall have been confirmed,
be a lien on such lot, parcel of land or premises and collected as in other
§ 208.06 COLDWATER CODE § 208.07

roll, he or she shall sign it and report the same to the City Manager for
submission to Council.
§ 208.08. Review and confirmation of special assessment roll. [Ord.
No. 221, passed 1-23-1961; Ord. No. 700, passed 1-23-2006]
After the filing of the special assessment roll, Council shall set a date for a
public hearing on the proposed roll and number it consecutively. Notice of
this hearing shall be given as provided in Section 208.06. Said hearing shall
be held regardless of the number of signers of any petition. At the time and
place appointed for the purpose, as aforesaid, Council and the City Assessor
shall meet and there, or at some adjourned meeting, review the assessment
and hear any objections to any assessment which may be made by any
person deeming himself or herself to be aggrieved thereby. Council may
correct said roll as to any assessment or description of premises appearing
therein, and may confirm it as reported, or as corrected; or Council may
refer the assessment back to the City Assessor for revision; or annul it and
direct a new assessment, in which case the same proceedings shall be had
as in respect to the previous assessment. When a special assessment shall
be confirmed, the City Assessor shall make an endorsement upon the roll
showing the date of confirmation.
§ 208.09. Installments, collection and interest. [Ord. No. 292,
passed 9-28-1970; Ord. No. 700, passed 1-23-2006]
Upon the confirmation of any special assessment, the amount thereof may
be divided into not more than 10 installments, one of which shall be
collected each year, at such times as Council shall determine, with annual
interest at a rate not exceeding that allowed by State legislation, but the
whole assessment after confirmation may be paid to the City Assessor
at any time in full, with the proportionate interest thereon. All special
assessments, except such installments thereof as Council shall make
payable at a future time, as provided in Section 208.08, shall be due and
payable upon confirmation.
§ 208.10. Divided land; apportionment. [Ord. No. 221, passed
1-23-1961; Ord. No. 700, passed 1-23-2006]
Should any lots or lands be divided after a special assessment thereon has
been confirmed and divided into installments, and before the collection
of all the installments, the City Assessor shall apportion the uncollected
amounts upon the several parts of lots and lands so divided. The report of
such apportionment, when confirmed by Council, shall be conclusive upon
all the parties, and all assessments thereafter made upon such lots or lands
shall be according to such division.

202:13
§ 208.11. Deficiency assessments. [Ord. No. 221, passed 1-23-1961]
Should any special assessment prove insufficient to pay for the
improvement or work for which it was levied, and the expenses incident
thereto, Council may make an additional pro rata assessment to supply the
deficiency; and in case a larger amount shall have been collected than was
necessary, the excess shall be refunded ratably to those by whom it was
paid, provided that when such excess is less than 5% of the total amount
of the assessment roll, the excess may be placed in the General Fund. No
additional assessment for any public improvement which exceeds 25% of
the original assessment shall be made, unless such additional assessment
be reviewed at a meeting of Council, for which meeting notices shall be
published as provided in the case of a review of the original special
assessment roll.
§ 208.12. Cost of improvement. [Ord. No. 221, passed 1-23-1961]
The cost of any special assessment improvement project shall include the
cost of surveys, plans, rights of way, spreading of rolls, notices, advertising,
financing and construction and all other costs incident to the making of
special assessments therefor and the financing thereof. Fringe benefit costs
and a reasonable amount for overhead may also be included in the cost of
the project.

must apply to the court in person, by mail, by telephone, or by

(a) Establishment. The City hereby establishes a Municipal Ordinance
Violations Bureau (herein referred to as the Bureau), as authorized
under Section 8396 of the Act, to accept admissions of responsibility for
Municipal civil infractions in response to Municipal civil infraction
violation notices issued and served by authorized City officials, and to
collect and retain civil fines and costs as prescribed by these Codified

shall be located at City Hall and shall be under the supervision and
control of the Finance Director. The Finance Director, subject to the
approval of Council, shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation
of the Bureau and appoint any necessary qualified City employees to
administer the Bureau.
(c) Disposition of violations. The Bureau may dispose only of Municipal
civil infraction violations for which a fine has been scheduled and for
which a certain Municipal civil infraction violation notice (as compared
with the citation) has been issued. The fact that a fine has been
scheduled for a particular violation shall not entitle any person to
dispose of the violation at the Bureau. Nothing in this chapter shall
prevent or restrict the City from issuing a Municipal civil infraction
§ 211.04 COLDWATER CODE § 211.05
202:18
§ 211.06. Schedule of fines established. [Ord. No. 500, passed
12-12-1994]
citation for any violation or from prosecuting any violation in a court
of competent jurisdiction. No person shall be required to dispose of
a Municipal civil infraction violation at the Bureau, but may have the
violation processed before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The
unwillingness of any person to dispose of any violation at the Bureau
shall not prejudice the person or in any way diminish the person's
rights, privileges and protection accorded by law.
(d) Scope of authority. The scope of the Bureau's authority shall be limited
to accepting admissions of responsibility for Municipal civil infractions
and collecting and retaining civil fines and costs as a result of those
admissions. The Bureau shall not accept payment of a fine from any
person who denies having committed the offense or admits
responsibility only with explanation, and in no event shall the Bureau
determine, or attempt to determine, the truth or falsity of any fact or
matter relating to an alleged violation.
(e) Municipal civil infraction violation notices. Municipal civil infraction
violation notices shall be issued and served by authorized City officials
under the same circumstances and upon the same persons as provided
for citations provided in Section 211.03(f) and (g). In addition to any
other information required by these Codified Ordinances or any other
ordinance, the notice of violation shall indicate the time by which the
alleged violator must appear at the Bureau, the methods by which an
appearance may be made, the address and telephone number of the
Bureau, the hours during which the Bureau is opened, the amount of
the fines scheduled for the alleged violation, and the consequences for
failure to appear and pay the required fine within the required time.
(f) Appearance; payment of fines and costs. An alleged violator receiving a
Municipal civil infraction violation notice shall appear at the Bureau
and pay the specified fine and costs at or by the time specified for
appearance in the Municipal civil infraction violation notice. An
appearance may be made by mail, in person or by representation.
(g) Procedure where admission of responsibility is not made or fine not
paid. If an authorized City official issues and serves a Municipal
ordinance violation notice and if an admission of responsibility is not
made and the civil fine and costs, if any, prescribed by the schedule of
fines for the violation, are not paid at the Bureau, a Municipal civil
infraction citation may be filed with the District Court and a copy of the
citation may be served by first class mail upon the alleged violator at
the alleged violator's last known address. The citation filed with the
Court does not need to comply in all particulars with the requirements
for citations as provided in Sections 8705 and 8709 of the Act, but shall
consist of a sworn complaint contained in the allegations stated in the
Municipal ordinance violation notice and shall fairly inform the alleged
violator how to respond to the citation.

BED AND BREAKFAST OPERATIONS
§ 808.01. Purpose. [Ord. No. 445, passed 2-26-1990]
This chapter is established to enable one- and two-family and apartment
units of historic significance to conduct bed and breakfast operations as
defined in the City Zoning Code. This chapter is enacted on the basis of
the public policy that supports the City as a tourist destination for persons
interested in the architectural and historical significance of the City's onereview
by submitting a written request to the City Clerk. Such written
request must be received by the City Clerk within 30 business days
of the date of the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals. The City
shall, within five business days of receipt of such written request, do
the following:
(1) File a petition to the Circuit Court for the County of Branch seeking
a judicial determination with respect to the validity of such denial,
and in conjunction therewith, apply for a preliminary and
permanent injunction restraining the applicant from operating the
adult entertainment business in violation of this chapter.
(2) Request that the application for issuance of a preliminary
injunction be set for a show-cause hearing within five business days
or as soon as thereafter possible. In the event that the applicant
appears at or before the time of such show-cause hearing, waives
the notice otherwise provided by Michigan Court Rule and requests
that at the time set for such hearing the court proceed to hear the
case under applicable rules of civil procedure for the issuance of a
permanent injunction on its merits, the City shall be required to
waive its application for preliminary injunction and shall join such
request. In the event that the applicant does not waive notice and/
or does not request an early hearing on the City's application for
permanent injunction, it shall nevertheless be the duty of the City
to seek the earliest possible hearing date under Michigan law and
the Michigan Court Rules.
(3) The filing of written notice of intent to contest the City's denial of
an adult entertainment license shall not in any way affect the
validity of such denial, but such denial shall be deemed invalid and
the license automatically approved if, within 15 days of the filing of
the petition, a show-cause hearing has not been scheduled.

Inspector. If the City Building Code Board of Appeals reverses the decision
of the City Building Inspector, the application shall then be forwarded to the
City Planning Commission.

No. 700, passed 1-23-2006]
After an application is duly filed with the City Clerk for a license under
this section, and the Building Inspector or the City Building Code Board of
Appeals has approved the issuance of the license, the Planning Commission

contained in Section 808.02 and upon the public need to protect
neighborhoods from detrimental change and to encourage the occupancy
and maintenance of historic buildings and structures by one- and two-family
apartment owners. In its determination, the Planning Commission shall

for such public need, and the Planning Commission shall consider the effect
upon residential neighborhoods and public convenience, concentration and
location of existing license holders, and the necessity of the issuance of

respect to basic cable service rate regulation; and
(b) Prescribe procedures to provide a reasonable opportunity for
consideration of the views of interested parties in connection with basic

This chapter shall be implemented and interpreted consistent with the
Act and the FCC Rules.
(a) A cable operator shall submit its schedule of rates for the basic service
tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates in
accordance with the Act and the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall
include, as part of its submission, such information as is necessary to

have been received by the City Clerk. Council may, by resolution or
otherwise, adopt rules and regulations as allowed by law prescribing
the information, data and calculations which must be included as part

(a) If this chapter, any rules or regulations adopted by the City pursuant to
Section 814.04(a), or any request for information pursuant to Section
814.04(b), requires the production of proprietary information, the cable
operator shall produce the information. However, at the time the
allegedly proprietary information is submitted, a cable operator may
request that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as
confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The request must
state the reason why the information should be treated as proprietary
and the facts that support those reasons. The request for confidentiality
will be granted if the City determines that the preponderance of the
evidence shows that nondisclosure is consistent with the provisions of
the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC 552. The City shall place in a
public file for inspection any decision that results in information being
withheld. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and the request
is denied:
(1) Where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase, it may
withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary
information will be returned to it; or

stayed pending review.
(b) Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld as
proprietary with the City. The City shall weigh the policy considerations
favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting
inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will then
promptly notify the requesting entity and the cable operator that
submitted the information as to the disposition of the request. It may
grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the cable
operator may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any
appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any
appeal.

PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR MEADOW VIEW SENIOR
APARTMENTS
§ 897-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and cited as the "City of Coldwater Tax
Exemption Ordinance for the Meadow View Senior Apartments."
§ 897-2. Purpose; City authority; findings of fact.
A. It is acknowledged that it is a proper public purpose of the State of
Michigan and its political subdivisions to provide housing for lowincome
persons and families and to encourage the development of such
housing by providing for a service charge in lieu of property taxes in
accordance with the Act. The City of Coldwater is authorized by the Act
to establish or change a service charge to be paid in lieu of taxes by any
or all classes of housing exempt from taxation under this Act at any
amount it chooses, not to exceed the taxes that would be paid but for
this Act. It is further acknowledged that such housing for low-income
persons and families is a public necessity, and as the City of Coldwater
will be benefited and improved by such housing, the encouragement of
the same by providing real estate tax exemption for such housing is a
valid public purpose. It is further acknowledged that the continuance of
the provisions of this chapter for the tax exemption and the service
charge in lieu of all ad valorem taxes during the period contemplated in
this chapter are essential to the determination of economic feasibility of
the housing development that is to be constructed or rehabilitated with
financing extended in reliance on such tax exemption.
B. The City of Coldwater acknowledges that the Sponsor (as defined
below) has offered, subject to receipt of an allocation under the Low
Income Housing Tax Credit Program administered by the Michigan
State Housing Development Authority, to construct, own and operate a
housing development identified as the Meadow View Senior Apartments
on certain property located at 60 Farm Lane, parcel identification
number 303-000-000-922-02, in the City of Coldwater, to serve lowincome
persons and families, and that the Sponsor has offered to pay

202:148
§ 897-4. Class of housing projects.
It is determined that the class of housing developments to which the tax
exemption shall apply and for which a service charge shall be paid in lieu of
such taxes shall be housing developments used exclusively by low-income
persons and families that are financed with a mortgage loan. It is further
determined that Meadow View Senior Apartments is of this class.
§ 897-5. Establishment of annual service charge.
The housing project identified as the Meadow View Senior Apartments and
the property on which it will be located shall be exempt from all ad valorem
property taxes from and after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy
for the development. The City of Coldwater acknowledges that the Sponsor
and the Authority have established the economic feasibility of the housing
project in reliance upon the enactment and continuing effect of this chapter,
and the qualification of the housing development for exemption from all
ad valorem property taxes and a payment in lieu of taxes as established in
this chapter. Therefore, in consideration of the Sponsor's offer to construct
and operate the development, the City agrees to accept payment of an
annual service charge for public services in lieu of all ad valorem property
taxes. Subject to receipt of a mortgage loan, the annual service charge
shall be equal to 9.5% of the annual shelter rents actually collected by
the development during each operating year. Nothing in this section shall
be construed to exempt the development and the property on which it is
to be constructed from any special assessments for street or other public
improvements or as a result of its location within a business improvement
district authorized by 1999 Public Act 49, as amended.
§ 897-6. Contractual effect.

contrary, a contract between the City and the Sponsor with the Authority
as third-party beneficiary under the contract, to provide tax exemption and
accept payments in lieu of taxes, as previously described, is effectuated by
enactment of this chapter.
§ 897-7. Limitation on payment of annual service charge.
A. Notwithstanding § 897-5, the service charge to be paid each year in lieu
of taxes for the part of the housing project that is tax exempt but which
is occupied by other than low-income persons or families shall be equal
to the full amount of the taxes which would be paid on that portion of
the housing project if the housing project were not tax exempt.
B. The term "low-income persons or families" as used herein shall be the
same meaning as found in Section 15(a)(7) of the Act.25
24.Editor's Note: See MCLA § 125.1415a(5).
25.Editor's Note: See MCLA § 125.1415a(7).
§ 897-4 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 897-8
202:149
§ 897-8. Determination and collection of service charge; lien.
The annual service charge in lieu of taxes as determined under this chapter
shall be payable in the same manner as general property taxes are payable
to the City and distributed to the several units levying the general property
tax in the same proportion as prevailed with the general property tax in
the previous calendar year. The annual payment for each operating year
shall be paid on or before September 15 of the following year. Collection
procedures shall be in accordance with the provisions of the General
Property Tax Act (1893 PA 206, as amended; MCLA § 211.1 et seq.). Annual
payments in arrears shall be subject to interest of 1% per month until
the 12th month after their due date, and to interest of 1.5% per month
retroactive to the due date for annual payments in arrears for longer than
12 months. Subject to any limitations imposed by law, the Sponsor shall
provide to the City such accounting records, audits, and financial reports
as the City shall reasonably require to verify the computation of the annual
service charge as provided by this section as of December 31 of each year.
The Sponsor shall maintain such records of rent or occupancy charges
received and the occupancy of units in the development as will permit the
City to verify which of the units in the development have been occupied by
low-income persons or families. Annual service charges payable pursuant to
this section shall be a lien on the development, and if delinquent, without
prejudice to any remedies for arrears of payment or preceding breach of
covenant, shall, at the election of the City, be collected and enforced in the
same manner as general property taxes.
§ 897-9. Duration of exemption.
This chapter shall remain in effect and shall not terminate so long as a
mortgage loan remains outstanding and unpaid and the housing project
remains subject to income and rent restrictions under the LIHTC Program.
If the development is no longer subject to income and rent restrictions
under the LIHTC Program, then the exemption from all ad valorem property
taxes established by this chapter shall terminate upon the payoff of the
mortgage loan or upon the sale of the development to an unrelated third
party.
§ 897-10. Severability.
The various sections and provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to be
severable, and should any section or provision of this chapter be declared
by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid the
same shall not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole or any section or
provision of this chapter, other than the section or provision so declared to
be unconstitutional or invalid.

of said bond, no further permit shall be granted until bond is again
furnished by said applicant as above provided.
(b) The applicant for such permit shall furnish to the City Clerk a statement
showing where such opening or excavation is to be made and the
purpose and extent thereof, or where such obstruction or repair is to be

as little as possible interference to traffic and the use of the street,
alley or thoroughfare. Sufficient help and equipment shall be provided
to expedite the work to the satisfaction of the City Manager.
(d) All openings and excavations shall be properly and substantially

promptly backfilled with like material and thoroughly settled by wetting
or tamping, and all excess material shall be promptly removed from the

the edge of the pavement or gravel and the street right-of-way line shall
be restored to their original condition. If sod is present, the sod will be
carefully cut, saved and replaced, or new sod put in after the trench
has been settled and compacted. If sod is not replaceable, the top four
inches of the trench shall be filled with stone-free topsoil. The trench
shall be seeded, mulched, watered and maintained until an adequate
grass growth is obtained.
(f) In excavating in paved streets, all materials of paving and blasting must
be removed to the side of the street with the least possible loss or injury
to the same or the surrounding pavement. After the work is completed
and proper settlement has occurred, the City will repave the opening
and charge and collect the cost of such repaving from the person to
whom the permit was granted. The City Clerk may require a deposit to
cover the cost of such repaving before issuing a permit for the work.
(g) In excavations around or near other subsurface structures, pipes,
conduits or other devices, care must be taken to properly safeguard
them from injury, and in case of interference or very close proximity to
the same, the City Manager shall determine how proper installation
shall be made.
(h) Each person, firm or corporation opening or excavating any street, alley
or thoroughfare shall keep an account of all openings or excavations so
made and, for one year after such opening or excavation, shall keep the
same filled and in repair. Should such person, firm or corporation fail to
do this, the City Clerk or City Manager shall give him, her or it notice to
do so within 10 days, and if said person, firm or corporation shall still
fail to make such repairs, the Street Department shall cause such
repairs to be made, and the cost of the same shall be charged against

(20) Sludge, unless the Director has determined that it is amenable to
treatment by the POTW and does not otherwise violate any
discharge prohibition.
(c) Pollutant concentration limits.
§ 1042.08 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1042.08
202:181
(1) Discharges made by nondomestic users having concentrations of
specific pollutants greater than the pollutant concentration limits
described in Table 1 in Appendix A at the end of this chapter30 are
prohibited, except as regulated under Subsection (d) of this
section.
(2) Measurement of pollutant concentrations.
A. The instantaneous concentration limit for a specific pollutant
shall apply to the instantaneous concentration of the pollutant
measured by sampling in accordance with § 1042.11.
B. The daily concentration limit for a specific pollutant shall apply
to the daily concentration of the pollutant measured by
sampling in accordance with § 1042.11.
(d) Special alternative limit. The Director may grant a special alternative
limit (SAL) to a user in a use permit or an order that allows discharges
to the POTW that are otherwise prohibited by this section. The SAL may
include other special arrangements between the CBPU and the user
including, but not limited to, limits less than the discharge limits in
Subsection (c) of this section. The decision to grant a SAL shall be made
at the sole discretion of the Director. The SAL or special arrangement
may be terminated or modified at will at any time by the Director. A SAL
or other special arrangement shall not create any vested rights or
property rights in the user. A SAL or other special arrangement shall
create no rights to discharge to the POTW which the user would not
have in the absence of a SAL or special arrangement. Provisions
relating to termination or modification of a SAL or special arrangement
may be more fully set forth in the SAL or special arrangement
document. As a condition precedent to the grant of a SAL or entry into a
special arrangement, the Director shall require the user to sign an
acknowledgement and acceptance of the provisions of this subsection.
Any SAL or special arrangement may contain provisions for the user to
pay a compensatory charge to the CBPU. A SAL shall not be higher than
a CPS unless a removal credit or a fundamentally different factor
variance applies to allow the user to exceed the otherwise applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. In such case, the SAL shall not
exceed the limit allowed by the removal credit or variance. A violation
of a SAL or of the terms of a special arrangement shall be in violation of
this chapter.
(1) Procedures for establishing special alternative limits. In
determining a SAL, the Director may allocate a share of the
maximum allowable industrial loading for the pollutant of concern
set forth in Subsection (d)(2) of this section among one or more
nondomestic users in amounts and on terms and conditions
deemed appropriate by the Director in accordance with SAL
procedures approved by MDEQ.
30.Editor's Note: Appendix A is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 1042.08 COLDWATER CODE § 1042.08
202:182
(2) Maximum allowable industrial loadings. The total mass of a
pollutant of concern used by or allocated to all nondomestic users,
including mass allocated by the Director in establishing SALs for
the pollutant, shall not exceed in the aggregate for all nondomestic
users the maximum allowable industrial loadings described in
Tables 2 and 3 in Appendix A at the end of this chapter.31
(e) Local initiative limits. The Director may impose limits on a user for
pollutants not specifically listed in Table 1 in Appendix A at the end of
this chapter,32 which may be in a use permit or in an order. In
determining a local initiative limit (LIL), the Director shall consider
available data on acceptable POTW pollutant loading based on POTW
design, treatability of the pollutant, the potential for pass-through or
interference, current POTW pollutant loading, the properties of the
pollutant, and other relevant factors deemed appropriate by the
Director.
(f) CPS. A user shall comply with all CPS and any other pretreatment
requirements established under §§ 307(B), 307(C), or 402(B)(8) of the
Act that are applicable to that user, as adjusted under the combined
waste stream formula in Michigan Rule R 323.2311(7). If a categorical
pretreatment standard and another limit contained in this chapter or in
an applicable State of Michigan pretreatment requirement regulate the
same pollutant, then the more restrictive of them shall apply. If a user
requests that a removal credit be applicable to that user, then such user
shall pay all costs associated with supporting, obtaining, and
administering the removal credit so that the CBPU incurs no costs. It
shall be at the sole discretion of the CBPU whether or not a removal
credit shall be established and how a removal credit shall be allocated.
(g) Trucked wastes. No wastes, pollutants, or wastewater shall be
discharged by any user or person into the POTW from a vehicle which
transported the waste or wastewater to the point of discharge, except
at discharge points, if any, designated by the CBPU, and only when
hauled in compliance with applicable law.
(h) Future conditions. Future conditions imposed on the CBPU by
government agencies with proper jurisdiction may require subsequent
amendment of this chapter by the CBPU. Where federal- or statepromulgated
pretreatment standards require limits on parameters not
covered in this chapter or limits more stringent than those specified in
the chapter, the state or federal limits shall have precedence and take
effect with respect to the applicable user on the later of their
promulgation date or the date specified for compliance with such
standards.

§ 1042.08 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1042.08
202:183
§ 1042.09. Dilution.
No user shall increase the use of potable or process water in any way for
the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment before discharge to the POTW to achieve compliance
with the standards set forth in this chapter, except upon prior written
approval from the Director, which approval shall be granted at the sole
discretion of the Director and consistent with federal and state law.
§ 1042.10. Inspections.
§ 1042.11. Sampling, analyses and tests.
(i) Reserved right of revision. The CBPU reserves the right to establish by
ordinance, rule, order, or use permit more stringent limitations or
requirements on discharges to the POTW.
(a) Authority of inspectors. The Director exhibiting proper credentials and
identification shall be permitted at all reasonable times, and at any time
in an emergency, to enter any user's property and the property of
contract municipalities without delay for the purposes of inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling, and testing in connection with
the administration and enforcement of this chapter. The user shall
advise the CBPU representative of health and safety hazards and
precautionary measures necessary to protect the health and safety of
the CBPU representative while on the user's premises. The Director
may order any user to provide written information regarding such
health and safety hazards and precautionary measures. If required by
the user, the CBPU representative intending to enter a user's property
shall be provided with an escort by the user to accompany the CBPU
representative while on the user's property. The user shall provide the
escort within a reasonable time after arrival at the user's property. In
the event of an emergency, or if the user does not provide an escort
within a reasonable time, the CBPU representative is not required to
wait for such an escort before proceeding with the entry and other
activities on the user's property. If the CBPU representative proceeds
without such an escort on the basis of an emergency or on the basis that
the user did not provide an escort within a reasonable time under the
circumstances, then the CBPU shall provide such user with a written
explanation of the situation.
(b) Other inspection. Inspection by state or federal representatives
pursuant to law shall not relieve a user from inspection by CBPU
representatives, and inspection by CBPU representatives shall not
relieve any user from compliance with lawful inspection by state and
federal representatives.
(a) Wastewater sampling and analyses.
(1) The prohibitions and restrictions in § 1042.08 or as set forth in a
SAL or LIL (which may be in a use permit), shall apply at the point
§ 1042.08 COLDWATER CODE § 1042.11
202:184
where wastewater and pollutants are discharged into the POTW.
Required pretreatment and sampling for analysis of parameters
specified in a use permit, discharge limit, CPS, or any discharge
prohibition, limitation, or standard shall be effected before such
point is reached.
(2) All measurements, sampling, tests, and analyses of the discharge
shall be determined in accordance with the EPA-approved methods
contained in 40 CFR, Part 136. In cases where 40 CFR 136
procedures are not available for or do not apply to the pollutant
involved, other sources such as "standard methods for the
examination of water and wastewater," published by the American
Public Health Association, or the most current methods published
by the American Society for Testing Material (ASTM) or another
method accepted by the Director may be used.
(3) All samples shall be collected at a time and in a manner that
ensures they are representative of the wastewater discharged
when the user's normal operations are occurring, except when
required by the CBPU to be collected at another time or in another
manner.
A. Sampling to measure the instantaneous concentration shall be
done by collecting one grab sample.
B. Sampling to measure the daily concentration shall be done by
collecting a twenty-four-hour, flow-proportioned composite
sample, except that a minimum of four grab samples shall be
collected in lieu of a twenty-four-hour, flow-proportioned
composite sample for pH, cyanide, total phenols, hexaneextractable
material, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds.
If it is not appropriate to obtain a flow-proportioned composite
sample, a time-proportioned composite sample or a minimum
of four grab samples may be used in lieu of the flowproportioned
composite sample if the user demonstrates to the
Director that a representative sample will be obtained.
Samples shall be collected during a single twenty-four-hour
period.
C. Flow volume shall be measured unless the Director approves a
method proposed by the user to estimate flow.
(b) Significant nondomestic user sampling and analyses. Unless otherwise
modified by a use permit, the following shall apply:
(1) Significant nondomestic users shall, at their expense, sample their
discharge by flow-proportioned composite sampling. Samples must
be obtained whenever the significant nondomestic user is
discharging. The flow-proportioned composite sampler shall be
programmed for a minimum of 100 sampling events per day based
on the average permitted flow per day. Dilution is prohibited (see
§ 1042.09). The significant nondomestic user shall submit a written
§ 1042.11 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1042.11
202:185
description of the specific sampling method, sampling equipment,
and sampling location to the Director and obtain the approval
of the Director. Alternately, at the discretion of the Director, a
user may provide a written description of sampling locations and
a demonstration of sampling equipment and specific sampling
methods to CBPU enforcement officer in order to obtain approval.
For significant nondomestic users with a new source, this approval
shall be obtained prior to commencement of the discharge.
Significant nondomestic users discharging as of the effective date
of this section shall make application within 60 days of such
effective date for this approval.
(2) If a significant nondomestic user does not perform self-monitoring
for purposes of determining compliance with this chapter, the
Director may obtain samples of that user's discharge for such
purposes for analysis using composite time-proportioned or flowproportioned
sampling (except for pH, fat, oil, and grease, cyanide,
sulfide and volatile organic compounds which shall be grab
samples) or may contract with an independent firm for such
sampling. Samples may be obtained by the CBPU each day,
whenever the user is discharging. The flow-proportioned composite
sampler shall be programmed for a minimum of 100 sampling
events per day based on the average permitted flow per day.
Dilution is prohibited (see § 1042.09). The significant nondomestic
user shall pay a fee to the CBPU to fully reimburse the CBPU for
such sampling and analysis, including administrative and overhead
costs. If the CBPU contracts with an independent firm for such
sampling, the significant nondomestic user shall fully reimburse
the CBPU for amounts paid by the CBPU to such firm.
(3) The significant nondomestic user shall provide equipment at its
facility to properly preserve and store all samples as required by
that user's use permit, whether or not that user is performing the
sampling.
(4) Samples shall be preserved and stored at the significant
nondomestic user's facility for every day on which a discharge
occurs. At least 10 daily samples shall be analyzed each calendar
month within the applicable holding times for sample analysis. If
the significant nondomestic user discharges for less than 10 days in
a calendar month, then the number of samples shall equal the
number of days on which there is a discharge and all such samples
shall be analyzed. Analyses shall be performed for parameters
specified in the significant nondomestic user's use permit and
sample holding time limits for sample analyses shall be met.
(5) Samples shall be analyzed at the sole cost of the significant
nondomestic user. If a significant nondomestic user does its own
sampling or causes its samples to be taken, then, such user shall
submit the samples to a laboratory (which may be the significant
nondomestic user's own laboratory) approved by the Director for
§ 1042.11 COLDWATER CODE § 1042.11
202:186
analysis. If the Director does not approve the user's chosen
laboratory, the Director shall provide the user with a written
explanation why the Director did not approve such laboratory. If
the significant nondomestic user utilizes its own laboratory, that
significant nondomestic user shall send a split sample to an
independent laboratory at least quarterly as a quality control
check. If a significant nondomestic user does its own sampling
or analysis, the CBPU may also take and have analyzed daily
composites or grabs at the sole cost of the significant nondomestic
user, in which case the Director shall provide a written explanation
within a reasonable time (after the CBPU performs such sampling)
to such user why the CBPU is performing such sampling. If the
CBPU takes the samples, the CBPU, at its discretion, may analyze
the samples in its own laboratory or contract with an independent
laboratory for the analysis.
(6) The date when a sample is taken, start time, stop time, sample type,
sample location, sampler programming information, persons
involved in the sampling, and any other data specified in advance
by the Director, shall be recorded by the significant nondomestic
user if the significant nondomestic user is self-monitoring.
(7) Flow measurements shall be taken to record the daily discharge
volume. On each sample date, flow measurements shall be taken to
record the daily discharge volume unless that is not appropriate. In
such case, flow estimates based on water meter readings may be
used if a user demonstrates to the Director that a representative
estimate will be obtained.
(8) All analytical results for the applicable periodic compliance report
period shall be submitted by the user to the CBPU in a periodic
compliance report by the 15th day of the month following the end
of the reporting period if the significant nondomestic user does
self-monitoring. The CBPU shall provide copies of analytical results
to the significant nondomestic user if the CBPU performs the
monitoring and, in the case of results that show a violation of any
pretreatment standard, shall provide such results to such user
within 10 days after the results are available to the CBPU. If a
significant nondomestic user monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required by the Director, using the procedures
described in Subsection (a) of this section, the results of such
monitoring shall be included in the next surveillance report or
other monitoring report submitted to the CBPU by that significant
nondomestic user.
(9) The CBPU shall be provided with splits of any sample taken by a
significant nondomestic user if the CBPU requests a split sample. A
significant nondomestic user shall be provided with splits of any
sample taken by the CBPU if the significant nondomestic user
requests a split sample within a reasonable time, but not to exceed
the designated holding time for the analytical procedure being
§ 1042.11 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1042.11
202:187
conducted. Split samples shall be provided at the time the sample
is taken, if possible.
(10) The significant nondomestic user (which is performing selfmonitoring)
or the CBPU (if the significant nondomestic user is not
performing self-monitoring) shall contract with an independent
company to maintain, repair, and calibrate the sampling and flow
measurement equipment and instruments used to monitor that
significant nondomestic user. Such maintenance, repair, and
calibration shall be performed as necessary so that monitoring data
is accurate and representative, but in no event less frequently than
twice in a calendar year at reasonable intervals. The CBPU, in any
event, may inspect and test a significant nondomestic user's flow
meters at reasonable times or at any time in the case of an
emergency.
(c) Other users. The Director may require any other user to install a
suitable control structure and necessary measuring and sampling
devices to facilitate the observation, sampling, and measurement of the
quantity, composition, and concentrations of discharges to the POTW.
Such structure and devices shall be constructed and installed at the
user's expense in accordance with plans submitted to the Director and
shall be maintained by the user as safe and accessible during all
reasonable times and to provide accurate and representative
monitoring data. If the user fails to install such a structure and devices,
or maintain them, the CBPU may do so at the expense of the user and
the Director may disconnect the user from the POTW.
(d) Removal of samples and data. The Director shall have the right to enter
the premises of a user for the purpose of conducting inspections and
collecting samples of wastewater and pollutants discharged into the
POTW. The Director also has the authority to make copies of analytical
reports, including, but not limited to, all raw data, laboratory bench
sheets, calibrations records, QA/QC records, sample collection
information and final sample results used in generating the final
analytical results pertaining to all discharges to the POTW.
(e) Authority to require submission of samples. The Director may require
any user to submit one or more representative samples of the
wastewater discharged, or which the user proposes to discharge, into
the POTW.
(f) Failure to allow access or removal of samples and other data. In the
event a user refuses to permit access at reasonable times, or at any
time in the event of an emergency, to the Director or to permit the
Director to obtain, take, and remove samples and make copies of other
data pursuant to this section, the Director may take any or all of the
following actions:
(1) Order the termination of the discharge of wastewater to the POTW.
(2) Order the user to permit access within a time certain.
§ 1042.11 COLDWATER CODE § 1042.11
202:188
§ 1042.12. Reporting and notices.
(3) Issue a citation for a violation of this chapter.
(4) Disconnect the user from the POTW.
(5) Seek a court order for appropriate relief.
(g) New installation of pretreatment facilities.
(1) Notices. The user or its authorized agent shall notify the Director in
writing, at least 15 days before the installation of new pretreatment
facilities, of the date it intends to commence operation thereof. A
new pretreatment facility shall not be placed in regular operation
until tests have been conducted by the user to establish that the
discharges will be in compliance with this chapter.
(2) Tests by users. A representative of the CBPU shall be permitted to
witness the tests. The cost of the tests shall be paid by the user of
the facilities.
(a) Registration required. All nondomestic users shall register with the
CBPU by submitting registration forms provided by the CBPU which
shall include information about the identity, location, and telephone
number of the user; business and manufacturing activities engaged in
by the user; and the type and amount of materials produced, used, or
stored which are, or which may be, discharged to the POTW by the user.
(b) Periodic compliance reports required. The Director, by written order or
in a user permit, may require any nondomestic user to submit periodic
reports on forms provided by the CBPU which shall include information
on the quality and quantity of wastewater and pollutants discharged
into the POTW. Said report shall include the volume of wastewater and
concentration of pollutants, and be related to pretreatment standards
as appropriate as shall be required by the Director. The names of all
person(s) responsible for operating and maintaining any pretreatment
equipment, pretreatment processes, or responsible for wastewater
management at the user's facilities shall be listed in said report with a
brief description of each person's duties. The Director may also require
additional information from such users as to materials or substances
which may be discharged to the POTW. The Director shall notify
forthwith each significant nondomestic user that it is required to file
periodic compliance reports.
(1) Initial report. Each user that has been notified of its obligation to
file periodic compliance reports shall file an initial periodic
compliance report within 30 days from the date such notice is
served upon said user.
(2) Monthly periodic compliance reports. Each user so notified by the
Director may be required to file monthly periodic compliance
§ 1042.11 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1042.12
202:189
reports for the preceding month by the date specified by the
Director.
(3) Quarterly periodic compliance reports. Each user required to
submit quarterly periodic compliance reports shall submit the same
before January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31 of each year
for the quarter ending on the last day of the preceding month.
(4) Semiannual periodic compliance reports. Each user required to
submit semiannual periodic compliance reports shall submit the
same in June and December each year, for the preceding six
calendar months.
(5) Annual periodic compliance reports. Each user required to submit
annual periodic compliance reports shall submit the same in
December each year for the preceding 12 calendar months.
(6) The Director shall coordinate reports required under this
Subsection (b) with Subsection (j) in order to avoid duplicative
reporting and to achieve consistency in report due dates.
(c) Notice of significant nondomestic user status. All users shall promptly
notify the CBPU at least 180 days in advance of a discharge which may
convert the user into a significant nondomestic user. Where a change in
discharge may convert the user into a significant nondomestic user,
such user shall promptly submit an application for a use permit to the
CBPU within 10 days after submitting such notice.
(d) Annual significant nondomestic user report. Each significant
nondomestic user shall submit, on a form provided by the CBPU, an
annual significant nondomestic user report. The report shall provide
updated information about the user's manufacturing and business
activities, materials used or stored, materials which are or may be
discharged to the POTW, pretreatment systems, slug discharge control
plans and procedures (if required), and any other information required
under § 1042.13(c) in an application for a use permit. Each significant
nondomestic user shall submit the annual significant nondomestic user
report by the 15th day of February of each year for the preceding
calendar year (January through December), unless exempted from this
requirement, in the use permit or other writing, by the Director.
(e) Notice of discharge exceedances. All users shall orally report to the
CBPU water pollution control facility within 24 hours of becoming
aware of any discharges, whether intentional or accidental, which are
known or reasonably suspected by the user to violate any prohibition or
exceed any applicable limit established in this chapter, in a use permit,
in a special agreement, in a CPS, or in any other applicable law or
regulation. The user shall, if the exceedance was based on an analyzed
sample, and if the CBPU is not performing monitoring in lieu of the user,
resample and analyze the discharge and submit the results to the CBPU
as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days after becoming aware of
such discharge. Such oral notice shall be given in advance whenever
§ 1042.12 COLDWATER CODE § 1042.12
202:190
possible and shall contain information regarding the volume, duration,
constituents, cause, loading and concentrations, actions taken or to
be taken to prevent future exceedances, and such other available
information as may be necessary to determine what impact such
discharge may have on the POTW. The user shall provide a written
follow-up notice within five days of the oral notice that contains the
same information provided orally and all other relevant information. If
the CBPU is performing monitoring of the user in lieu of the user, the
CBPU, or the user if directed to do so by the Director, shall resample
and analyze the discharge as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days
after the CBPU becomes aware of such discharge.
(f) Posting of use permit and notice of exceedance information. All
nondomestic users and any user that uses or stores substances which
potentially could be discharged to the POTW in concentrations which
exceed any discharge prohibition in § 1042.08 shall post a clearly
legible set of instructions in the area where the user manages
wastewater so that the report and notice requirements of this section
are made known and are available to the user's employees. Such users
shall also post the user's use permit along with these instructions if the
user holds a use permit. Such users shall instruct their employees who
have wastewater responsibilities on the reporting and notice
requirements of this section.
(g) Slug discharges. The Director may, by written notice to a user, require
that the user prepare and implement a slug control plan. Such plan
shall be submitted to the Director for approval as specified in the
written notice. At least once within a year of determining that a user is
significant, the Director shall evaluate significant nondomestic users to
determine whether or not the CBPU will require a plan from such
significant nondomestic users. The plan shall contain at least the
following:
(1) Description of discharge practices including nonroutine batch
discharges;
(2) A description of stored materials;
(3) Procedures for immediately notifying the CBPU of slug discharges,
including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under
§ 1042.08 with procedures for follow-up written notification within
five days;
(4) Procedures to prevent adverse impacts from accidental spills,
including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling
and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations,
control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of
containment structures or equipment, measures for containing
toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and measures and
equipment for emergency response.
(h) Notification regarding wastes which are otherwise hazardous.
§ 1042.12 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1042.12
202:191
(1) Any user that discharges to the POTW any substance which, if
disposed of other than by discharge to the POTW, would be a
hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261 or under the rules promulgated
under Part 111 of the Natural Resources and Environmental
Protection Act ("Michigan Rules") shall notify the CBPU, the U.S.
EPA Region V Waste Management Division Director, and the Chief
of the Waste and Hazardous Materials Division of the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality of such discharge. The notice
shall be given 180 days after the discharge first occurs. The notice
shall be in writing and shall include the name of the hazardous
waste set forth in 40 CFR 261 or the Michigan Rules, the hazardous
waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or
other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such
waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notice shall also
contain the following information to the extent such information is
known and readily available to the user:
A. An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
B. An estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the discharge during that calendar month;
C. An estimation of the mass of constituents expected to be
discharged during the following 12 months;
(2) Notification under this subsection must be submitted for each
hazardous substance discharged, but is not required for pollutants
already reported under self-monitoring by users under CPS
reporting requirements. A user is exempt from notification under
this subsection during a calendar month in which the user
discharges no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes unless
the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Where a new regulation first defines a
substance as a hazardous waste, notification under this subsection
shall be given within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulation. In any notice submitted under this subsection, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree the user has
determined to be economically practical.
(i) Notice by the Director to users affected by CPS. The Director shall
notify all users whom the Director knows might be subject to CPS of
that fact.
(j) Reports by users subject to CPS.
(1) Baseline report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a CPS,
or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a
category determination submission under R 323.2311(2),
whichever is later, existing nondomestic users subject to the CPS
§ 1042.12 COLDWATER CODE § 1042.12
202:192
and currently discharging, or scheduled to discharge, to the POTW
shall submit to the Director a report that contains the following:
A. Name and address of the facility including the name of the
operator and owners;
B. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the
facility;
C. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production,
and standard industrial classification of the operation or
operations carried out by the nondomestic user. The
description shall include a facility drawing and schematic
process diagram that indicates points of discharge to the
POTW and from which processes the discharges originate.
D. Information showing the measured average daily and
maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from
regulated process streams and other streams as necessary to
allow use of the combined waste stream formula specified in R
323.2311(6).
E. The pretreatment standards, including state or local
standards, applicable to each regulated process and the results
of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and
concentration or mass, where required by the standard or the
Director, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each
regulated process. Both daily maximum and average
concentration or mass, where required, shall be reported. The
sample shall be representative of daily operations. Samples
shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if the facilities exist or immediately downstream from
the regulated process if pretreatment facilities do not exist. If
other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater
before pretreatment, the nondomestic user shall measure the
flows and concentrations necessary for use of the combined
waste stream formula to evaluate compliance with the CPS.
Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been
calculated, the adjusted limit and supporting data shall be
submitted. The Director may allow the submission of a baseline
report that utilizes only historical data if the data provides
sufficient information to determine the need for pretreatment
measures. The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and
place of sampling and the methods of analysis and shall certify
that the sampling and analysis is representative of normal
work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. A
description of all BMPs to which the user is subject shall be
included in the baseline report along with a summary of the
status of the user's compliance with such BMPs.
§ 1042.12 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1042.12
202:193
F. A statement, reviewed by the user and certified to by a
qualified professional, indicating whether CPS are being met
on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation
and maintenance or additional pretreatment is required to be
performed by the nondomestic user to meet the CPS.
G. If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance will
be required to meet the CPS, the shortest schedule by which
the nondomestic user will provide such additional
pretreatment or operation and maintenance. The completion
date in the schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable CPS. The schedule shall contain
increments of progress in the form of dates for the
commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment
required for the nondomestic user to meet the CPS. The events
may include the hiring of an engineer, completing preliminary
plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for major
components, commencing construction, completing
construction and other similar major events. An increment
shall not be more than nine months. Not later than 14 days
following each date in the schedule and the final date for
compliance, the nondomestic user shall submit a progress
report to the POTW, including, at a minimum, whether or not
the user complied with the increment of progress to be met on
a particular date and, if not, the date on which the user expects
to comply with the increment of progress, the reason for the
delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return the
construction to the schedule established. Not more than nine
months shall elapse between progress reports to the POTW.
H. Where the nondomestic user's CPS has been modified by a
removal credit, the combined waste stream formula or a
fundamentally different factors variance at the time the user
submits the baseline report, the information required by
Subsection (j)(1)F and G, above, shall pertain to the modified
limits.
I. Any changes to information under Subsection J(1)A through G
shall be submitted by the nondomestic user to the POTW
within 60 days after the change in the information.
(2) Final compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable CPS or, in the case of a new source,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into
the POTW, any nondomestic user subject to CPS shall submit to the
POTW a report containing the information in Subsection J(1)D
through F above. For nondomestic users subject to equivalent mass
or concentration limits, the report shall contain a reasonable
measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other
nondomestic users subject to CPS expressed in terms of allowable
§ 1042.12 COLDWATER CODE § 1042.12
202:194
pollutant discharge per unit of production, or other measures of
operation, the report shall include the user's actual production
during the appropriate sampling period.
(3) Periodic compliance reports for CPS.
A. Any nondomestic user subject to a CPS after the compliance
date of the CPS or, in the case of a new source, after
commencement of the discharge, shall submit to the POTW
semiannually, unless required more frequently in the CPS by
the POTW or the MDEQ, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the effluent that are limited by
the CPS. In addition, the report shall include a record of
measured or appropriately estimated average and maximum
daily flows for the reporting period for the discharge reported
in the baseline report, except that the Director may require
more detailed reporting of flows.
B. Where the POTW has imposed mass limitations on
nondomestic users, the report shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by CPS in the discharge from the user.
C. For nondomestic users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established by the POTW, the report shall
contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term
production rate. For all other nondomestic users subject to
CPS expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge
per unit of production, or other measures of operation, the
report shall include the user's actual average production rate
for the reporting period.
D. The report shall include a summary of the status of the user's
compliance with any BMPs to which the user is subject.
(k) Radioactive materials notice. Users whose discharge contains or could
contain radioactive materials shall notify the CBPU of that fact as soon
as possible after becoming aware of it.
(l) Reports by user of slug or problem discharges. A nondomestic user
shall immediately notify the CBPU after obtaining knowledge that such
user has discharged or will discharge wastewater which could cause
problems to the POTW or could cause interference or pass-through or
which is a slug discharge. Such notice shall be oral and shall be
followed by a written notice within five days. The written notice shall
describe measures which such user will take to prevent such
discharges.
(m) Periodic compliance reports by users not subject to CPS. Significant
nondomestic users that are not subject to CPS shall submit a written
periodic compliance report to the CBPU by January 31 and July 31 of
each year for the preceding six-month period. The periodic compliance
report shall contain a description of the nature and concentration of the
§ 1042.12 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1042.12
202:195
pollutants in the discharge and the volume of the discharge based
on sampling and analyses for pollutants performed at a frequency
specified by the CBPU. Sampling and analytical techniques shall be
those described in Michigan Rule R 323.2310(7). The CBPU may elect
to perform the sampling and analyses in lieu of the significant
nondomestic user, at the sole cost of the significant nondomestic user. If
the CBPU collects all of the information for the reports, the significant
nondomestic user shall not be required to prepare and submit the
report under this subsection. The report shall include a summary of the
status of the significant nondomestic user's compliance with any BMPs
to which that user is subject.
(n) Notice of changed discharge. A nondomestic user shall notify the CBPU
at least 180 days in advance of any anticipated substantial change in
the volume of or in the type or amount of pollutants in its discharge to
the POTW. Such notice shall be in writing. For purposes of this notice, a
substantial change in the discharge to the POTW includes, but is not
limited to:
(1) The initial discharge of any unpolluted water, noncontact cooling
water, stormwater, surface water, or groundwater, including any
groundwater purged for remedial action and groundwater that
infiltrates into the POTW;
(2) An increase or decrease in volume of 20% or more or as specified in
a user permit;
(3) The discharge of pollutants not previously disclosed to the CBPU;
(4) A change in the amount or type of listed or characteristic
hazardous waste discharged for which the nondomestic user has
submitted a notification to the CBPU under Subsection (h) of this
section;
(5) An increase in the amount of any pollutants discharged which may
result in a violation of § 1042.08 or of any order or use permit
applicable to the nondomestic user.
(o) Signature and certification for reports.
(1) The person signing the periodic compliance reports, baseline
report, final compliance report, notices, and registration in this
section shall make the following certification in the report:

information. The Director shall notify any user, who has requested
and is entitled to confidentiality, when the CBPU has sent such
confidential information to another governmental agency.
(4) Where a user has mass-based limits as allowed by certain CPS on a
production basis, the production data necessary to determine
compliance must also be provided by the user to the CBPU and be
available to the public. Where application of the combined waste
stream formula is necessary to apply categorical pretreatment
standards to a user, the flow measurements and other data used in
the calculation must be provided by the user to the Director and be
available to the public.
(5) Observations made by CBPU inspectors are subject to the
confidentiality provisions of this section, if the user specifies in
writing to the CBPU inspector the observations made by the CBPU
inspector for which the user seeks confidentiality.
(6) If a member of the public requests information which the user has
marked confidential and for which the user has submitted a written
explanation concerning its confidentiality, the Director shall notify
the user of the request and of the CBPU's intention to release or not
to release the information to the requestor.
(7) This § 1042.14 shall be interpreted in a manner which complies

the period specified in the order and before implementation of the plan.
The plan shall be prepared in accordance with good engineering
practices. It shall state whether construction is necessary and include
any measures that may be implemented without construction. The plan
shall also contain a schedule of compliance as described in this section.
(1) Schedule of compliance. The schedule of compliance shall consist
of one or more actions, including enforceable timetables for a
sequence of actions leading to compliance with a pretreatment
standard or other limitation, prohibition, or standard.
(2) Steps or phases. The following steps or phases shall be included in
the schedule of compliance, where applicable and appropriate:
A. Retention of a qualified engineer and/or consultant.
B. Completion of any engineering or scientific investigations or
surveys deemed necessary.
§ 1042.14 COLDWATER CODE § 1042.15
202:206
§ 1042.16. Spill prevention/remediation required.

construction.
F. Establishment of completion dates for any construction
necessary.
G. Establishment of a date to accomplish the pretreatment
pursuant to the final order.
H. Establishment of separate timetables for a phase or unit in the
event a phase or unit of construction or implementation may be
effected independently of another phase or unit.
(b) Amendment. The order shall be subject to amendment or revocation by
the CBPU, provided that notice of such action is served upon the user in
the same manner as in the original order and subject to the same
procedure for review and appeal.
(c) Categorical pretreatment standards (CPS).
(1) Inclusion in standard. If a CPS is promulgated for a subcategory
under which a user believes itself to be included, the user or the
CBPU may request from the MDEQ within 60 days after the
promulgation date a written determination of whether the user
does or does not fall within that particular subcategory. Such
request shall be made and reviewed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Michigan Rule R 323.2311, as amended. If
an existing user adds or changes a process or operation that may
be included in a subcategory, the user shall request the
certification before commencing to discharge from the added or
changed process or operation. A new source shall request the
determination before commencing to discharge. If the CBPU
requests the determination, then the CBPU shall notify the affected
user of the submission and the user may provide written comments
to the MDEQ within 30 days after notification is sent.
(2) Compliance date. A user to which a promulgated CPS applies shall
achieve compliance with such standard in accordance with and
within the time period provided for in Michigan Rule R 323.2311,
as amended.
(a) Each user or person that uses or stores liquid material at its facilities
shall, at its expense:
§ 1042.15 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1042.16
202:207
§ 1042.17. Compensatory Charges.
(1) Provide a storage or use area at its facilities which is capable of
containing the liquid material so that liquid material cannot escape
therefrom by gravity through private sewers, underground
percolation and infiltration, or otherwise into the POTW in an
amount which would result in a prohibited discharge to the POTW;
and
(2) Establish and follow procedures for preventing, managing, and
remediating accidental spills, leaks, or escapes of liquids.
(b) The Director may order the user or person to:
(1) Conduct an investigation to determine if any known or suspected
spill, leak, or escape of liquid materials is being discharged, or has
the potential for being discharged, to the POTW and to submit a
written report on the findings of the investigation to the Director,
including all analytical and hydrogeological data; and
(2) Take interim measures for immediate or emergency containment
and remediation, for preventing, reducing, abating, or mitigating
the effect(s) of a discharge of liquid material to the POTW.
(c) A significant nondomestic user shall submit to the CBPU a written
description of its containment facilities and procedures within 30 days
after being requested to do so by the Director.
(a) Compensatory charges. The CBPU may assess one or more
compensatory charges, which are separate from and in addition to any
fees, rates or surcharges due from a user, to recover any additional
expense to the CBPU resulting from providing service to any user
responsible for any of the following:
(1) Violating any limit or discharge prohibition established by this
chapter where no order or use permit has been issued to that user;
(2) Violating the limits or discharge prohibitions contained in an order,
SAL, or use permit applicable to that user.
(b) Applicability of compensatory charges. Any user shall be liable for one
or more compensatory charges to reimburse the POTW for any costs,
damages, expenses, fines or penalties (direct or indirect) that the CBPU
may incur or that may be imposed on the CBPU in handling, treating,
and responding to an unlawful discharge where the exceedance of the
limits contained in this chapter, an order, SAL, or user permit causes or
contributes to such costs, damages, expenses, fines or penalties.
(c) Amount of compensatory charges. The Director shall calculate the
amount of the compensatory charges to be assessed against such user.
§ 1042.16 COLDWATER CODE § 1042.17
202:208
§ 1042.18. Fees.
(d) Criteria for assessing compensatory charges. The amount of
compensatory charges shall be based upon the following minimum
criteria:
(1) The volume of the discharge;
(2) The length of time such discharge occurred;
(3) The composition of such discharge;
(4) The nature, extent, and degree of success the POTW may achieve in
minimizing or mitigating the effect of such discharge;
(5) The toxicity, degradability, treatability, and dispersal
characteristics of such discharges;
(6) Costs incurred by the CBPU to treat the discharges, including
operation and maintenance, capital costs, replacement costs,
sampling and analytical costs, sludge handling and disposal costs,
and administrative costs;
(7) Costs incurred by the CBPU in investigating the user's violation
and enforcing this chapter or an order or use permit applicable to
the user;
(8) Fines and penalties imposed on the CBPU. The compensatory
charges may also include the CBPU's costs of defense (including
actual attorney fees, consultant fees, and sampling and analytical
fees) of actions brought or threatened to be brought against the
CBPU by the state or federal government or third parties;
(9) Any damages to the POTW or damages imposed upon the CBPU by
the state or federal government or third parties;
(10) Such other factors as the Director deems appropriate under the
circumstances.
(a) users shall reimburse the CBPU for its costs arising from implementing,
administering, and enforcing this chapter, as follows:
(1) Use permit fees. Users shall pay a use permit application or
reapplication fee, a use permit renewal fee, and a use permit
transfer fee (in the event of a transfer of the use permit). Fees shall
be established from time to time by resolution of the CBPU and
kept on file by the CBPU. In addition to these fees, users shall
reimburse the CBPU for any and all other expenses the CBPU
incurs arising from:
A. Processing incomplete, incorrect, or otherwise unacceptable

and does not conform to the requirements of this section. Upon receipt
of a timely and conforming written request for appeal, the CBPU shall
set a time for the Director and the user to appear before the CBPU to
present evidence and arguments in support of their positions. The user
and the Director may present witnesses and documentary evidence to
the CBPU. Witnesses shall be sworn and shall be subject to crossexamination.
The proceedings of the CBPU shall be recorded. The rules
of evidence of the courts of the State of Michigan shall not be strictly
applied by the CBPU but shall be a guide for the CBPU in determining
which evidence to admit or exclude and what weight to give the
evidence admitted. On receipt of a request for an appeal, the CBPU
shall establish a timetable for the proceedings and shall promptly
render a written decision stating its findings of fact and conclusions
supporting its decision.

shall pay the cost of preparing the transcript and shall provide a copy to
the CBPU. The user and the CBPU shall pay their own costs of the CBPU
proceeding, including but not limited to attorney fees, expert witnesses,
other witnesses, documents, and tests. The user requesting the appeal
to the CBPU shall pay a fee as established from time to time by
resolution of the CBPU and kept on file by the CBPU. If the CBPU finds
that the user filed a frivolous appeal, or in bad faith, which has no
reasonable basis in fact or law, the CBPU may assess the user for all of
the costs of the CBPU in connection with the appeal and the user shall
pay the same within 30 days.

or permanent injunctive relief, damages, compensatory charges, civil
penalties under Subsection (b) of this section, costs under §§ 1042.17
through 1042.21, and such other relief as a court may order.
(b) Civil penalties. In an action brought by the CBPU against a user for
violation of this chapter, a use permit, or an order, a court may impose a
civil penalty of up to $1,000 per day per violation. In calculating the
amount of the penalty, the court shall consider the frequency of the
violation; the impact on the POTW, human health, and the environment;
the magnitude and duration of the violation; the economic benefit to the
user from the violation; the compliance history of the user; and other
factors deemed appropriate by the court.
(c) Municipal civil infraction; civil fine. The Director is authorized to issue a
municipal civil infraction citation ("citation") for any violation of this
chapter, a use permit, or an order, except for violations punishable
under §§ 1042.29 and 1042.31. The civil fine for any violation of this
chapter, a use permit, or an order shall be up to $1,000 per violation per
day. In calculating the amount of the civil fine, the Director or the court,

Any user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other document
filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or a use permit
or an order, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate
any monitoring device or method required under this chapter or a use
permit shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as
provided in § 202.99 of the City Code. Each day of violation is a separate
offense.
§ 1042.30. Affirmative defense.
A user shall have the affirmative defense in any action brought against it
alleging a violation of § 1042.08(b)(4), (b)(6), (b)(7)D, (b)(8) or (b)(15) if the
user can demonstrate both of the following:
as applicable, shall consider the frequency of violation by the user, the
impact on the POTW and human health and the environment of the
violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, the economic
benefit to the user gained by the violation, the compliance history of the
user, and other factors deemed appropriate by the court or the Director,
as applicable.
(d) Cumulative remedies. The imposition of a single civil penalty, civil fine,
criminal fine, order, damage, or compensatory charge upon a user for a
violation of this chapter, a use permit, or an order shall not preclude the
imposition by the Director or a court of additional sanctions and
remedies with respect to the same violation except that a user shall not
have both a civil penalty under Subsection (b) of this section and a civil
fine under Subsection (c) of this section imposed on it for the same
violation. Prosecution of a criminal action against a user shall not be
stayed pending the outcome of a civil action involving the same
violation.

collected in the same manner that other special assessments are collected
under the City Charter or by any other lawful means.
§ 1042.33. Publication of significant violators.
The Director shall publish, once per year in the largest daily newspaper in
the City, a public notice of users which, at any time during the previous
12 months, were in significant noncompliance of federal, state, or CBPU
pretreatment standards or requirements. For the purposes of this section, a
user is in significant noncompliance if its violation(s) meets one or more of
the following criteria:
(b) A local limit designed to prevent pass-through or interference was
developed for each Pollutant in the user's discharge that caused passthrough
or interference and the user was in compliance with each local
limit directly before and during the pass-through or interference, or if a
local limit designed to prevent pass-through or interference has not
been developed for the Pollutant that caused pass-through or
interference, the user's discharge directly before and during the passthrough
or interference did not change substantially in nature or
constituents from the user's prior discharge activity when the POTW
was regularly in compliance with its NDPES permit requirements and,
in the case of interference, applicable requirements for sewage sludge
use or disposal.
(a) Vandalism. No person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper with any structure,
appurtenance, or equipment which is a part of the POTW.
(b) Trespass. No person shall partially or fully enter or otherwise access
any structure, appurtenance, or equipment which is a part of the POTW,
except as specifically authorized by the Director.

66% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant
parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including the
instantaneous limits for that pollutant parameter;
§ 1042.30 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1042.33
202:217
§ 1042.34. Upsets.
(b) Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as results in
which 33% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement
including instantaneous limits multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC =
1.4 for BOD, TSS, and fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);
(c) Any other violation of a pretreatment discharge limit (daily maximum,
long-term average, instantaneous limit or narrative standard) or
requirement that the Director determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through
(including endangering the health of CBPU personnel or the general
public);
(d) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent danger to human
health, welfare, or to the environment, or has resulted in the Director's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such discharge;
(e) Failure to meet, by 90 days or more after the schedule date of a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a use permit or order, for
starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance with pretreatment standards;
(f) Failure to provide required reports such as baseline monitoring reports,
ninety-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and
reports on compliance with compliance schedules within 30 days after
the due date;
(g) Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(h) Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a violation
of best management practices, which the Director determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the CBPU's
pretreatment program.
(a) Upset liability. In the event of an upset, the upset shall be an affirmative
defense for the user to an action against that user for fines,
imprisonment, or civil penalties provided for in this chapter, but the
user shall not have an affirmative defense to an action for compensatory
charges and damages based on an upset. In any proceeding, the user
seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of
proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
(b) Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. A user who wishes
to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through
properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant
evidence, that all of the following apply:

received within 24 hours.
(d) Prohibition of bypass. Bypass is prohibited, and the CBPU may take
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(1) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage; and
(2) There were no feasible alternatives to bypass, such as the use of
auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should
have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering
judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal
periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(3) The user gave notice required under Subsection (a) of this section.
(e) POTW-approved bypass. The CBPU may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection (d) of this section.
(f) Essential maintenance bypass. A user may allow a bypass to occur if the
bypass does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be
violated, but only if the bypass is also for essential maintenance to
assure efficient operation. Such a bypass is not subject to the provisions
of Subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section.

(e) CBPU liability; customer responsibilities.
(1) Municipal utility services are subject to shutdowns, variations and
interruptions necessitated by improvements, repairs and/or
operation of the system. Whenever possible, notice of intent to
temporarily discontinue service will be given to the customer. The
CBPU shall not be liable for loss or damage because of temporary
interruption in service or because of inadequate or excessive
quantity or quality.
(2) The CBPU agrees to use reasonable diligence in providing a regular
and uninterrupted supply of power, but does not guarantee a
constant supply of power or the maintenance of unvaried frequency
or voltage, and will not be liable for damages to the customer by
reason of any failure in respect thereof.
(3) The customer shall take and use power in such a manner so as not
to cause a disturbance or voltage fluctuation on the utility supply
system or systems of any third party. The customer shall take

potential credit risk. [Added 1-25-2016 by Ord. No. 793]
A. ONLINE Utility Exchange returns service applicant's risk in
the following manner:
1. Green Light = no credit risk. Customer will not be charged
an upfront security deposit to start service.
2. Yellow Light = minimal credit risk. Customer will be
charged an upfront security deposit of $200 to start
service.
3. Red Light = substantial credit risk. Customer will be
charged an upfront security deposit of $400 to start
service.
B. Payment arrangements will not be accepted on security
deposits to establish service.
(2) Deposits may be returned to customers after one year if billings
have been paid by specified due dates or before penalties are
added, at the discretion of the CBPU. Such deposits will be
returned as an account credit. When service is discontinued,
deposits will be credited to the closing bill with any excess to be
refunded to the customer.
(3) Customers may request that security deposits be transferred when
changing service from one location to another. However, all
amounts in arrears on the original account (including the most
recent billing, if past the established due date) must be paid. This
payment takes effect at the time of a change of service. Failure to
pay all arrears may require deposits being applied to the original
account and a new security deposit for the new location.
[Amended 1-25-2016 by Ord. No. 793]
(4) The CBPU may, upon the request of the customer, transfer the

outstanding account balances as of the court file date. New
deposits may be required for post-petition balances according to

required to be changed to the name of the legal occupant of the
property. Any service not corrected, after notification by the CBPU,
may be subject to disconnection. In order for the service to be
reestablished, any amounts due after the date on which the original
party becomes deceased must be paid in full.
(8) Any service taken with the intent of evading past due amounts
owed to the CBPU, or to evade the posting of required service
deposits, may be subject to termination. Examples would be the use
of false names, false identification or requesting service without
actually occupying the property.
(9) (Reserved)52
(10) The CBPU's Winter Protection Plan protects senior, low income and
critical care customers from service shut off and high utility bill

the street right of way, or any other device that is in any way
connected with the Municipal utility system. Not allowing access
may subject the property concerned to disconnection of service.
(2) In cases of rental properties, it shall be the responsibility of the
property owner to effect proper entrance for CBPU personnel to
discontinue some services. Failure to provide access may result in
such services being continued with the property owner being liable
for payment from the date of the tenant's service being
discontinued.
(3) Meters not accessible to read will be estimated. See "Meter
Reading and Billing", Section 1044.02(v) for details.
(n) Selection of equipment. Before purchasing equipment for use in
connection with the Municipal utility service, the customer should
secure from the CBPU the characteristics of the service available (i.e.
service voltage, pressure, etc.) for such use and should acquaint himself
or herself with the rules and regulations governing the use and
installation of such equipment.
(o) Approval of equipment. The CBPU reserves the right to approve or
disapprove for use in connection with the Municipal utility system, any
wiring, equipment, appliances, fixtures, motors or any other devices
that are presently in use or that are offered for use in connection
therewith. Should any of the same be disapproved, their use shall be
disconnected at once, either permanently or until corrective measures
have been taken. Failure to comply with orders to discontinue the use of
or to apply corrective measures to disapproved equipment shall be
deemed just cause for the discontinuance of all service until compliance
is completed.
(p) Extra expense due to overtime and adverse conditions. A charge may be
made when extraordinary expense is incurred by the CBPU in
performing customer services on account of overtime rates for other
than regular working hours, or on account of unfavorable weather
conditions, snow and ice accumulations, curb boxes buried or filled
through no action of the CBPU, and for similar reasons.
(q) Credits to customer accounts.
(1) Whenever a credit is applied to any account it will be made on the
basis of the net billing. No refund will be made to any account after
one year following discontinuance of service. No credit or refund
will be made in a net amount of less than $5. No credit will be
allowed unless all CBPU requirements have been adhered to and
the propriety of such a credit or refund is supported by a clear
record.
(2) Any incorrect billing or collection that resulted in an overpayment
or underpayment will be credited or charged for up to a maximum
of six months.

equipment. The customer/property owner shall provide, as directed
by and free of expense to the CBPU, close to the point of the service
entrance, a suitable space for the installation of the CBPU's
metering equipment and shall, at all times, keep the area about,

registered but the owner has started procedures to have the unit(s)
registered and the registration is still incomplete.
(2) Owners of rental properties that do not want their property to be
left without utility services after the tenant vacates the property
may sign a "revert-to-landlord" agreement. By signing a "revert-tolandlord"
agreement, all utility services are automatically
transferred to the property owner until a new tenant sets service
and a service charge of $10 is billed to the property owner.
Property owners may revert properties year round or just during
winter months (November 1 through March 31). Exception to the
"revert-to-landlord" agreement would be (1) service to a residence
has been disconnected for nonpayment of bill; (2) violation of CBPU
rules, regulations and rates; or (3) changes are made to the
electrical wiring at the premises requiring inspection.

minimum term of 12 consecutive months in order to qualify the
customer for the above adjustment for off-peak operation during
the period of such guarantee.
(9) Adjustment for power factor. This rate requires a determination of
the average power factor maintained by the customer during the
billing period. Such average power factor will be determined
through the metering of lagging kilovar-hours and kilowatt-hours
during the billing period. The calculated ratio of lagging kilovarhours
to kilowatt-hours will then be converted to the average
power factor for the billing period by using the appropriate
conversion factor. Whenever the average power factor during the
billing period is above 0.899 or below 0.800, the capacity charge
will be adjusted as follows:
A. If the average power factor during the billing period is 0.900 or
higher, the capacity charge will be reduced by 2%. This credit
shall not in any case be used to reduce the prescribed
minimum charge or the capacity charge when based upon 60%
of the highest billing demand of the preceding 12 months.

F. On the streets where distribution mains have been installed or
where other extensions were installed at the expense of the
Water Department, the cost for service connections will be
based on the CBPU's cost to install a six-inch water main (in
dollars per foot), which is revised from time to time. The
connection fee to be collected is the revised cost at the time of
connection.
G. The connection fee is calculated from the width of the property
to be served, herein referred to as frontage. The connection fee
is based as determined by the CBPU. For a property on a
corner lot, the frontage will be for the shorter side.
(3) Enlarging or relocating water taps and services. The fee for
replacing a smaller water tap and service pipe with a larger one, or
for the purpose of relocating the water service, shall be the same as
the fee for a new tap and service, plus the cost of removing the tap
and service being replaced. No credit will be allowed for any
materials which may be recovered from the replaced service. This
fee shall be borne by the customer.
New construction water meter sets. When facilities are constructed
by a contractor, the electric service may not be transferred from
the contractor's name and the construction rate to the property
owner's name and a different rate until such time as a water
meter has been installed and the water turned on. In the case of
residences, if the homeowner is also the builder, no residential
electric service shall be established until such time as a water
meter has been installed.
(4) New residential water services.
A. All new construction of single or two-family residences, homes
built on lots which have or had water service and homes that
change from wells to the public water supply shall be required
to be metered. The CBPU will furnish a meter or setting device.
The setting device must to be installed by the owner and/or the
contractor to CBPU specifications. Water will not be turned on
until the meter is properly set and inspected by the CBPU.
B. Newly constructed duplex homes must have separate water
services to each dwelling unit from the primary water main at
the street.
C. Construction for water services to multi-customer buildings
must have sufficient plumbing to isolate, meter and shut off
each customer individually without interrupting service to the
other customers.

(6) Construction of water services and metering.
§ 1044.06 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1044.06
202:269
A. Per the fee schedule, the CBPU will install a suitable main
connection, a service pipe, and a curb stop or gate valve with
an access box located at a point which would normally be
placed between the sidewalk and the curb, shoulder, easement
or right of way. From this point the plumber/owner shall install
the house service pipe. Water service connections must be
made only to water mains maintained by the CBPU. Water
connection location must meet CBPU approval. Water
connections for domestic use are prohibited from private fire
protection systems. This requirement is necessary to provide
better quality water for domestic use.
B. The customer's service pipe shall be equal in size or not to
exceed one size larger than the pipe from the main and shall be
carefully installed in accordance with the best water works
practice, with not less than five feet of earth cover for its entire
buried length. If warranted, the customer's service pipe can be
smaller than the service from the main upon the approval of
the CBPU. All new water services shall be one inch or larger.
C. Water service pipes shall be terminated with an approved valve
in approved frostproof basements, cellars, pits or manholes,
into which they are to be carried continuously at a depth of not
less than five feet.
D. In houses and other buildings that are constructed without
basements or cellars and where adequate provision can be
made for protection against freezing, even should the building
be unheated for extended periods of time, the following
alternative method of terminating house water service pipes is
permissible: The house service pipe shall be run in under the
floor slab of the building at a depth of not less than five feet. It
shall then be brought up through the floor slab, with a long
bend, and terminated with an approved valve located not less
than six inches or more than 10 inches, above the floor. All
required frost protective measures shall be installed at the
time the service pipe is placed and before the work is finally
approved for use.
E. Each new or rebuilt water service shall be provided with
metering connections adjacent to the valve. Provision shall be
made for a meter placement for each unit of building
occupancy and each such meter placement shall be provided
with its own valve in addition to the main valve.
F. Meter bars or horns will be furnished by the CBPU for
installation with all new and rebuilt water services. Meter or
meter bar installations must have one valve before and one

valve after the meter or meter bar. Such services will not be
turned on until the meter bar is installed properly.
G. All entrance and meter piping shall be carefully installed in a
neat, workmanlike manner and shall be adequately supported
so that no undue strains may be placed upon the pipes, valves
and/or meters.
H. Minimum clearances must be maintained between the back
wall and wall side edge of the meter being installed. There
must also be a minimum clearance of six inches from the
bottom of each meter to the floor and a maximum height of 48
inches from the floor.
I. All water/wastewater meters are to be installed as close as is
practical to the main shut-off valve inside the building. The
main valve itself is to be located as close as practical to the
point of entry into the building.
J. The following clearances must be maintained for proper
installation of water/wastewater meters and meter bars:
Wall Clearance Floor Clearance
Meter Size
(inches)

K. All new water meter installations three inches and above shall
be furnished with a meter bypass. When a meter by-pass is
installed, the drawing below must be followed. There must also
be a sixteen-inch clearance maintained over the meter if a bypass
is installed above meter. No by-pass can be installed on
the front side of a meter. The area below or behind the meter is
the preferred location for a by-pass. Water/wastewater meter
installations three inches or larger in size may be furnished
with a screen. The meter bypass shall be locked or sealed by
the CBPU. If the seal is broken for emergency situations, the
CBPU must be notified immediately.
§ 1044.06 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1044.06
202:271
L. No water/wastewater meters shall be installed in basements,
cellars or pits that are not equipped with approved access
ladders or stairs, nor in any manner that the meter reader will
be required to lift excessively heavy manhole covers or other
equipment, or to climb into and out of difficult places, and the
area in front of meters must be kept clear at all times in order
to gain access to them.
All water/wastewater meters in pits or manholes must be
equipped with a remote reader.
M. Where a water service pipe enters through a basement, cellar,
pit or manhole wall, or through a masonry floor, it shall be
provided with an approved sleeve, properly joined and pointed
with the masonry and thoroughly caulked with a suitable
caulking mixture to form a good workmanlike protection for
the pipe. Where the pipe enters through the floor, the sleeve
shall extend above the finished surface of the floor for a
distance of not less than four inches.
N. The point of entrance of the water service pipe into the
basement, cellar, pit or manhole shall be carefully selected as
to suitability and shall at all times be kept free and clear of
objectionable storage materials such as coal, wood, oils, waste
materials and similar items detrimental to the water service
equipment and/or limiting access thereto.
O. Confined space water/wastewater meter locations. Water/
wastewater meter installations in crawl spaces or other
confined spaces must have CBPU location approval before
installation of the water/wastewater meter.
(7) Water supply service materials. Materials for the construction of
new and the replacement of old water supply services and private
water systems are limited to the following, with full preference
being given to a material selection harmonious with the CBPU's
material selection for such construction from the main to the curb
stop or gate:
§ 1044.06 COLDWATER CODE § 1044.06
202:272
A. Cold drawn, soft-annealed seamless copper service pipe, in 3/4
inch, one inch, 1 1/2 inch and two-inch sizes only, of proper

B. For two-inch size and larger, copper service pipe of the type
specified in paragraph (a)(7)A. hereof, or an American Water
Works Association specification bell and spigot, mechanical, or
push-on type joint ductile or cast iron water main, designed for
not less than 150 pounds water working pressure.
(8) Electric continuity. All water systems and services are required to
be electrically continuous. Each pipe or fitting shall be electrically
bonded to the adjacent pipe or fitting.
(9) Taps and services under paving.
A. Before any paving is laid or relaid in the City, the CBPU may, at
its option, extend a suitable water service pipe to the sidewalk
in front of each abutting property not then so provided, the
owner of the property being charged with the tap fee that is
applicable to such an installation in an unpaved street. If this
fee is not paid upon installation, the tap fee charge may be
increased to that fee applicable to a paved street. This
increased fee shall be paid in full before service may be taken
from the connection so provided.
B. The CBPU shall in no way be held liable for the failure to
extend any water supply service in this manner preceding
paving or repaving.
(10) Frozen water/wastewater meters. CBPU water customers may be
charged a service fee of $25 plus the cost of parts to repair frozen
water/wastewater meters.
(11) Private water wells. No person shall install, construct, develop,
maintain or use a water well within the City of Coldwater except as
provided by § 1040.05 of the Codified Ordinances. [Added
3-23-2015 by Ord. No. 784]
(b) Water leakage.
(1) No water customer shall permit his or her water supply pipes,
connections or fixtures to be out of repair so that water leakage can
occur. Failure to do so may result in discontinuance of service. The
CBPU may charge a customer an estimated amount for water
wasted because of a leak if not repaired in a reasonable time.
§ 1044.06 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1044.06
202:273
(2) The CBPU may, as its discretion, adjust a metered billing for water
and wastewater due to an unknown leak on the customer's
premises, after repairs have been made.
(3) No water supply pipes, connections or fixtures shall be installed
unprotected from frost, in unheated rooms or apartments, on
outside uninsulated walls or in any other manner so that water
must be left running to prevent freezing.
(4) Where water is used for filling tanks or other receptacles, an
automatic float valve shall be provided so that when the tank or
receptacle is full of water the supply shall positively be cut off.
(c) Cross connections.
(1) Act 399 of the Public Acts of 1976, the Michigan Safe Drinking
Water Act, prohibits cross connections with any public water
supply.
(2) (Reserved)82
(3) See Section 1040.04.
(d) Curb boxes. No unauthorized person shall open or attempt to open any
curb or gate box. No unauthorized person shall cover or conceal any
curb or gate box. At any time it is desired to change the surface grade
near any curb or gate box, the CBPU shall be given proper notice so
that the box grade may be changed to correspond.
(e) Operation of fire hydrants.
(1) Private hydrants.

Superintendent less than 12 hours prior to actual hydrant
operation.
3. Arrangements are made to have a CBPU representative
present during operation.
B. In all cases, a properly sized hydrant wrench must be used.
(2) CBPU hydrants.
82.Editor's Note: Former Subsection (c)(2) was repealed 5-13-1996 by Ord. No. 530.
§ 1044.06 COLDWATER CODE § 1044.06
202:274
A. CBPU fire hydrants shall be operated by authorized personnel
of the Fire Department, the Street Department and the CBPU,
and such others as may be authorized by the Director of the
CBPU from time to time.
B. When water is required for construction purposes, etc., and
other means of obtaining water are not readily available,
application may be made to the CBPU for use of water from an
existing fire hydrant. It will be the responsibility of CBPU
personnel to install a meter complete with a sill cock for the
attachment of a garden hose or fire hose, if applicable, on the
fire hydrant and to turn the hydrant on.
C. As soon as the use for which the meter was set is completed,
CBPU personnel will close the hydrant, check for proper "drain
back" and remove the meter.
D. It will be the responsibility of the person requesting the use of
temporary water to pay for the installing, removing and
turning on and off of the hydrant and the water used and any
damage, loss or theft which may result from such temporary
use of hydrants, as follows:
1. Installation, removal and operation of the fire hydrant: $40
labor during normal working hours.
2. Water will be charged at the standard rates as published.
E. If more than one location is required, the same meter will be
relocated and the above rate will apply to such location and
installation.
(f) Use of shut off keys. No unauthorized persons are permitted to use
operating wrenches, curb stop keys or gate keys on any curb stop, gate
valve or fire hydrant.
(g) Cleaning of service pipes. When water customers experience low
pressure or stoppage of flow, the CBPU shall take steps to restore
proper service. Under the direct supervision of the customer's master
plumber, the CBPU shall use the clean-out equipment necessary. The
CBPU shall not be liable for any damage resulting from such cleaning of
the water service. A homeowner may waive the requirement to have a
master plumber present by signing a "release of responsibility" form.
(h) Excess pressure. No person shall use any pump, ram or other device on
any piping system connected with the water piping system, which is
capable of producing a pressure in excess of the normal water pressure,
unless a representative of the CBPU is present and is in direct charge of
the work.
(i) Grounding of electrical circuits.
§ 1044.06 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1044.06
202:275
(1) Where electric light and power circuits, communication circuits
and radio systems are grounded to the water service pipes, such
connections shall be made mechanically and electrically secure and
shall be in accordance with the grounding provisions of the
National Electrical Code.
(2) All such ground connections shall be made to the service pipe
where it enters the building and on the street side of the first valve
or fitting.
(3) Any person who removes such ground connection for work in or
about the plumbing or electrical system of the building shall do so
only after taking proper safeguards against the hazards involved
and shall, upon completion of his or her work, re-establish such
connections in accordance with the provisions outlined above.
(j) Lawn sprinkling; emergency restrictions.
(1) Except by special permit to do so, no unmetered customer shall
operate or permit the operation of any lawn sprinkling device of
any nature whatsoever between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 4:00
a.m. or during such other hours as the CBPU may from time to time
direct.
(2) In the event of an emergency, the CBPU reserves the right to place
any restriction that it deems necessary on the use of City water so
that the health, safety and other interests of the water users and of
the water supply systems may be safeguarded.
(k) Prohibited uses. Water customers shall not use water for any other
purposes than that for which payment has been made, nor permit
others to do so.
(l) Disconnecting; sealing; reclassification of service.
(1) Unmetered water rates on two-family units are based upon the
number of living units connected for use. When it is desired to
avoid payment of the rate on any unit, it is necessary to have the
unit completely and effectively disconnected or, at the option of the
customer, a water meter may be installed.
(2) When, in the judgment of the CBPU, it is undesirable to require
such a disconnection, the CBPU may agree to seal or lock such
units where the customer makes satisfactory provisions for such
sealing or locking. Costs involved in such sealing or locking may be
chargeable to the customer.
(3) Any unauthorized breaking of any such seal or lock by or for the
customer shall constitute sufficient ground for denying him or her
further sealing and locking privileges and can subject the customer
to a charge for the back billing of up to six months.
§ 1044.06 COLDWATER CODE § 1044.06
202:276
(4) There may be situations where remodeling of the property is to
such an extent that the extra unit is eliminated, while retaining
some plumbing fixtures. When this has been accomplished, the
property may be reclassified by the CBPU as a single-family
residence after inspection by the CBPU and the approval of CBPU
management.
(m) Residential metered services.
(1) (Reserved)83
(2) If a meter horn or meter setting device is already present in the
proper location, the CBPU will install the meter and run meter wire
at no cost. Otherwise, the customer is responsible for installing a
meter horn or meter setting device.
(3) Any residential complex containing three units or more must be
metered either individually or centrally metered to register all
units.
(n) Water main extension policy.
(1) Subject to the CBPU's specific approval for each such extension,
water mains may be extended into areas not provided with water
mains for the purpose of supplying fire protection and normal
water service to the residents and property owners of such areas,
provided that:
A. The water production, treatment and/or pumping facilities are
ample and adequate to supply the additional quantity and
quality of water at pressures and rates of flow that are
anticipated as being required to properly supply the new area.
B. The transmission and distribution mains which will carry water
to the new area are sufficient in size and capacity to do so
without in any way deteriorating the water service to those
presently connected and served by such mains.
C. Such water main extensions will be made only in public streets
and/or right of ways provided for public utilities and after
acceptance by the CBPU, the water lines will become part of
the public municipal system.
(2) The CBPU may contract with subdividers to extend water mains in
privately owned streets where such streets are for common use
and/or may be destined at some future date to become public
streets. However, all water main construction must meet the
specifications of the utility. The subdivider may also be required to
pay the cost of CBPU inspection services or contracted inspection
services in order to assure compliance with CBPU specifications.

(3) It is the purpose of this subsection to prohibit the installation of
water mains on privately owned properties with any part of the cost
of such water mains being paid for by the Water Department.
Extensions to supply fire protection service in factory yards and to
supply water service to properties built in off-street areas with
private or semi-private entrance drives are included in this
category.
(4) This policy does not apply to water main extensions to be made
outside of the corporate limits of the City.
(5) Except that the CBPU may especially contract otherwise, all water
mains installed under this policy shall be the property of the CBPU,
even though the cost of such installation may be borne in part or in
total by others than the CBPU, and the CBPU shall be responsible
for their operation, repair and maintenance throughout their life.
(6) New residential subdivision developments may be charged the
eight-inch water main cost even though the CBPU may determine
that larger mains are required for the hydraulic or other needs of
the system.
(7) The full cost of water main extensions to other than new residential
subdivisions shall be paid by the benefiting adjacent property,
unless the utility's board of directors determines that the increase
in size is in the best interest of the utility and its customers.
(o) Watermain installation policy.
(1) Any contractor installing new water main extensions to the
Coldwater Board of Public Utilities' water system is prohibited from
operating any gate valves, fire hydrants or other equipment. All
requests for flushing of newly installed water mains, fire hydrants,
fittings or related equipment must be requested at least three days
in advance. Board employees shall perform all flushing of water
mains and will coordinate work with contractor before such work
will proceed. The Board reserves the right to restrict or reschedule
the timing of this work due to other activities (such as hydrant
flushing, freezing temperature, and the like) occurring
simultaneously.
(2) The Board shall witness all pressure testing of newly installed
water main in accordance with American Water Works Standard
C600-93. A copy of the successful test will be retained by the utility
and a copy will be provided to the contractor if requested.

(2) Municipal building use. The Coldwater Municipal Building, Public
Safety Building, Municipal Services Department Building and other
buildings of the City that are supplied water and wastewater
services will be billed at the regular schedules for metered service
as are other users of these services.
(3) Municipal use (non-BOD). The monthly rate for Municipal
wastewater use for environmental remediation purposes where the
disposal of virtually clean groundwater is required shall be as
follows:
A. Minimum charge: None.
B. Consumption charge. For all metered usage per 1,000 gallons:
$0.49.
(a) Sewer taps; construction of building sewers.
(1) In general. Historically, the sanitary sewers in the City were
generally constructed by the City and turned over to the CBPU for
operation and maintenance. Therefore, the original construction
quality, records and/or locations of sewers are in no way related to
the judgments of the CBPU. The CBPU assumes no liability for the
same.
(2) Sewer tap connection and inspection permits required; CBPU
liability.
A. Sewer tap connection and inspection permits may be obtained
by the property owner and placed in the hands of a licensed
master plumber by an owner acting under State/County permit
as his or her own plumber or by a licensed master plumber
acting as agent for a property owner, upon payment of the
proper fee.
B. Such information that the CBPU may have relative to sewer tap
locations, lateral locations, sewer sizes and grades is available
to the public. However, the CBPU will assume no liability for
the accuracy of such information.
(3) Inspection fees.
A. In addition to all regular and special assessments levied for
sewer construction purposes, an inspection fee of $35 shall be
paid by every person making application for a new sewer
§ 1044.07 COLDWATER CODE § 1044.08
202:284
tapping permit. This fee shall cover the expense incurred by
the CBPU in making the necessary inspection of the connection
to the wye, stub lateral, manhole or main. All sewer inspection
permits must be obtained prior to excavation or installation.
B. A similar fee shall be paid for similar inspections of sewers
being rebuilt or relaid involving reconnection to the Cityprovided
lateral, wye or manhole.
C. The applicant shall notify the CBPU immediately after
connection when the sewer is ready for inspection. Failure to
have the sewer inspected is a violation of Chapter 1042 and
subjects the applicant to civil penalties and fines. Such
violation will require the applicant to re-excavate the site of the
connection for inspection and may result in additional
inspection charges.
(4) Connection fees. Properties which are not located within the limits
of a special sewer assessment district and which have never been
assessed for or otherwise provided with a sewer connection may, by
prepayment to the City Clerk of a sum that the City Council may
set, be permitted such benefit, provided that all expenses of the
construction of such connection be borne by the owner of that
property. All details of such construction and connection shall be
subject to the approval of the CBPU.
(5) Stubbing laterals.
A. In connection with the construction of new sewers and with old
sewers, prior to the paving or repaving of any street, the City
Engineer or the CBPU, at their option, may extend such sewer
taps or laterals that in their judgment appear necessary from
the main sewer to the curb. The entire cost of such work shall
be charged to the owner of the benefiting property, and the
charges shall be collected by special assessment in the event
they remain unpaid for one year following their installation.
B. The CBPU shall in no way be held liable for failure to extend
any sewer tap or lateral as outlined above.
(6) Inspection of sewer connections.
A. In addition to assisting the property owner or his or her agent
in planning the layout of each proposed new sewer connection
the work will be given field inspections.
B. The inspection will be made at the time the connection is made
with the wye connection, riser or lateral at the street sewer.
C. The owner or licensed master plumber named in the tapping
permit shall notify the CBPU of the readiness of the work for
inspection and the CBPU will, within 24 hours, exclusive of
§ 1044.08 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1044.08
202:285
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, make such inspection as
required.
D. The CBPU may, from time to time, make such other inspections
of the work as are deemed necessary and, upon disapproval of
any part of the work by the inspector, all work on the sewer
shall be stopped until the proper correction has been made and
its approval obtained.
(7) Point of connections; locating wye or lateral connections.
A. Connections shall be made to the street sewer only at a wye or
lateral which has been provided for such purpose. In the event
that no such point of connection has been provided, or that the
connection cannot be found or is found to be inaccessible,
special permission may be issued by the CBPU to tap the main
sewer with a new connection, the work of making such a tap
shall be performed to the satisfaction of the CBPU's inspector.
(8) Tapping a standing or vertical riser. Where it becomes necessary to
tap a standing or vertical riser connecting with a deep sewer the
following method of construction shall be employed:
A. The stopper shall first be removed and the riser carefully
inspected by means of a light lowered through its entire length.
If it is found to be defective, the CBPU will repair or replace the
riser before further work is performed.
B. On the top of the riser, with its branch turned to properly face
the run of the house sewer, there shall be placed a wye-branch
with one opening looking up. Vertically from this top opening
there shall be installed a clean-out stack, the top of which,
properly stoppered, shall be brought to the surface of the
roadway.
C. It shall be the responsibility of the homeowner or contractor to
construct the riser connection; however, the CBPU will provide
the riser casting and cover. Maintenance of the riser will
become the CBPU's responsibility after construction which will
include normal repairs, root cutting and cleaning.
(9) Construction of sewers.
A. Building sewers shall be constructed of socket-type premium
joint vitrified clay tile, approved cast iron soil pipe or S-40 PVC
or PVC ASTM D3034 (SDR35) approved plastic pipe. The CBPU
will consider other plastic pipe specifications on an individual
basis. All installations shall be sized and constructed to meet
the Plumbing Code and the CBPU's Standard Rules and
Regulations. For all new construction, each individual
dwelling/business shall have its own independent sewer lateral
§ 1044.08 COLDWATER CODE § 1044.08
202:286
constructed from its own sewer wye connection at the main
sewer.
B. The building sewer shall begin at the main sewer in the street,
or at the end of the stubbed lateral provided for such purpose,
and extend as near as possible in a straight line from that point
to the point of connection with a clean-out opening, located
just within the wall of the building, from which point the
building sewer may be effectively rodded and cleaned for its
entire length. The CBPU also encourages the installation of a
clean-out just outside a building wall or foundation. Any pipe
bends greater than 45° shall require installation of a clean-out
extended to the finished grade and easily accessible for
maintenance purposes.
C. It is the owner's responsibility to insure the integrity of the
existing lateral before a connection is made.
(10) Cast iron piping. Sewers constructed of cast iron shall meet all of
the requirements of the Plumbing Code.
(11) Plastic piping. Sewers constructed of plastic must be S-40 PVC or
PVC ASTM D3034 (SDR35) and comply with commercial standards
to meet all requirements of the Plumbing Code. The CBPU will
consider other plastic pipe specifications on an individual basis.
(12) Concrete encasements and supports. Concrete for the encasement
and support of sewer pipes shall meet the requirements of the
Plumbing Code and CBPU approval.
(b) Septic and nonseptic waste disposal. Septic and non-septic wastes that
comply with the CBPU's septage receiving plan may be accepted for
disposal at the wastewater treatment plant at the following rates. A
deposit may be required at the time of dumping.
Septic and non-septic tank waste: $0.085 per gallon.
(c) Trucked waste.
(1) The CBPU may accept trucked waste at its wastewater treatment
plant, provided that the material is compatible with the removal
processes at the wastewater treatment plant.
(2) Charges for receiving and processing the waste material will be
based on the current wastewater rates and the strength and
amount of material delivered. The CBPU reserves the right to
require sample testing of the material.
(3) Prior approval and arrangements must be made before the
acceptance of any trucked material.
(d) Separation of storm and sanitary sewers. No roof water, surface
drainage or storm water drainage from any point shall be admitted to or
§ 1044.08 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1044.08
202:287
connected with any sanitary sewer. No sanitary sewer waste shall be
admitted to or connected with any storm water sewer. The two systems
must be kept entirely separate.
(e) Prohibited connections. No sewer connection shall be made to any
septic tank, privy vault, outhouse or cesspool, to any source of
prohibited waste or directly with any part of the City water supply
system.
(f) Connections and openings below ground level.
(1) Except as specified below, no sewer openings or connections shall
be installed below the overflow or relief point of any street sewer.
(2) By special permission, closets, urinals, floor drains, laundry tubs,
sinks and such other sewer connections as the CBPU may deem
permissible may be installed below the overflow or relief point of
any street sewer when each such connection is equipped with an
approved, readily accessible back-water valve, properly installed
and properly maintained, so as to prevent the backing up of sewage
in the event of stoppage, or when such fixtures are drained to an
approved sewage sump which is equipped with proper venting and
automatic sewage removal facilities.
(g) Stoppage of house sewers; CBPU liability.
(1) Removal of stoppages and repairs to house sewers is the
responsibility of the property owner. In the event that trouble is
found in the wye connection at the street sewer or in vertical risers
extending therefrom, the property owner shall establish that fact to
the satisfaction of the CBPU, which shall then cause proper repairs
to be made at the expense of the CBPU.
(2) The CBPU shall not be held liable for any expense incurred by the
property owner in repairing or removing stoppages in house
sewers or for any expense incurred by him or her in satisfying the
CBPU that such damage or stoppage lies within that portion of the
sewer system maintained by the CBPU.
(3) The CBPU is not responsible for plumber/sewer cleaning
contractor's expense incurred by property owner/renter for a
sewer backup on the main sewer if the CBPU is not contacted prior
to the plumber/contractor being called.
(4) Plumber/contractors are required to contact the CBPU whenever a
customer's sanitary sewer lateral is being replaced within two feet
of the mainline sanitary sewer. The CBPU will then have a
representative present until all work within the concerned area is
completed satisfactorily.

shall adequately safeguard all CBPU property upon the customer's
premises from alteration and abuse by others, and that he will not
hire or permit anyone other than authorized CBPU personnel to
perform any work on CBPU property, equipment and facilities.
(9) Penalties for unauthorized service. CBPU has sophisticated
monitoring equipment that allows detection of illegal reception of
signals. This illegal reception often causes signal quality problems
for paying customers. To minimize potential problems, the CBPU
regularly audits the system to detect such reception. If
unauthorized service is discovered by the CBPU, the cost will be
billed to the customer including an estimated cost of the services
illegally delivered, and including the cost of inspection,
investigation, reconnection and cost of repair to CBPU facilities, all
of which must be paid in full before service can be reestablished or
restored.

(13) Interruption or discontinuance of service due to use of non-CBPU
facilities. In order to provide service, the CBPU shall occasionally
make use of poles owned in whole or in part by others. The
continued availability of such poles and infrastructure is not
guaranteed. In the event the continued use of such poles is denied
for any reason, the CBPU will make every reasonable effort to
provide service over alternate routes and facilities. The CBPU shall
not be liable if the service provided to the customer is interrupted
or discontinued for this reason.
(14) Approval of equipment. The CBPU reserves the right to approve or
disapprove for use in connection with the municipal utility system,
any wiring, equipment, appliances, fixtures, motors or any other
devices that are presently in use or that are offered for use in
connection therewith. Should any of the same be disapproved, their
use shall be disconnected at once, either permanently or until

access to the Internet, through its interactive system, to a personal
computer or network of computers of a customer equipped with
a broadband network interface device. The CBPU assumes no
responsibility for installation or assistance with regard to any
software currently owned by customer or purchased by customer
after installation. Additionally, service may be temporarily refused,
limited, interrupted, or curtailed due to government regulations
or orders, system capacity limitations, limitations imposed by an
underlying communications carrier, or because equipment
modifications, upgrades, repairs or reallocations or other similar
activities necessary or proper for the operation or improvement of
the CBPU system. Service and equipment are furnished for use by
customer for any lawful purpose. [Amended 11-12-2018 by Ord.
No. 816]
(2) Installation and access. [Amended 3-23-2015 by Ord. No. 784;
11-12-2018 by Ord. No. 816]
A. In the event a CBPU modem is damaged by lightning, stray
voltage, voltage fluctuations or any other type of electrical
defect, the customer will be billed for the repair or
replacement of the modem.
B. The initial routing on customer's premises necessary for the
provision of modem service shall be in a location agreed to
between the CBPU and customer. Any relocation of facilities
solely for the convenience or at the request of customer shall
be paid for by customer.
C. The customer agrees to furnish necessary right-of-way upon its
premises for the installation of any facilities that may be
required to provide modem service to the customer and to
confer upon the CBPU the right to enter upon the premises, for
the purpose of installation, maintenance and repair of said
facilities and equipment, and that upon termination of the
agreement, to permit CBPU to enter the premises for the
purpose of removing any additional facilities or lines that may
have been required for the original installation.
(3) Termination of service. Services to a customer may be discontinued
at any time by the CBPU upon failure of the customer to pay any
charges due for these services, or immediately, whenever, in the
sole discretion and determination of the CBPU, such
discontinuance is in the best interest of other CBPU customers,
such as (but not by way of limitation) interference with the system
of the CBPU caused by the condition or operation of customer's
facilities or system. Upon termination of services hereunder, for
whatever reason, and by whomever, the customer shall promptly
deliver all CBPU equipment back to the CBPU. [Amended
11-12-2018 by Ord. No. 816]
§ 1044.09 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1044.09
202:293
(4) Limitation of CBPU's liability.
A. The customer understands that alternative and competing
internet communications carriers are available to the
customer; occasional interruptions or irregularities in the
service may occur; any potential harm from interruptions or
irregularities in the service is speculative in nature; the CBPU
cannot offer the service at rates which reflect its value to each
customer; and the CBPU assumes no responsibility other than
that contained in these rules and regulations. Accordingly, the
customer agrees that, except as limited by law, the CBPU's sole
liability for loss or damage arising out of mistakes, omissions,
interruptions, delays, errors, or defects in the service or
transmission of service provided by the CBPU or any
underlying communications carrier, or for losses or damages
arising out of the failure of the CBPU or any underlying
communications carrier to maintain proper standards of
maintenance and operations, shall be as follows:
1. A credit allowance as described in paragraph (i)(4)A.3.
below, will be made at the customer's request in the form
of a pro-rata adjustment of the fixed monthly charges
billed to the customer. Fixed monthly charges are the
monthly charges for access and optional features per
access account I.D., all as described in the schedule of
rates and charges in effect at the time of interruption.
2. Such credit allowance will be based upon the period of
time during which such mistakes, omissions, delays, errors
or defects in the service or its transmission caused
interruptions in the rendering of the service. Any such
period of time an interruption occurs will be measured
from the time it is reported to the CBPU. In the event a
customer is affected by such interruption for a period of
less than 24 hours, no such adjustment shall be made.
When an interruption exceeds 24 hours, the length of the
interruption will be measured in twenty-four-hour days. A
fraction of a day consisting of less than 12 hours will not be
credited but a period of 12 hours or more will be
considered an additional day.
3. The credit allowance will be computed by dividing the
length of the service interruption by a standard thirty-day
month and then multiplying the result by CBPU's fixed
monthly charges for each interrupted access account I.D.
In no case will the credit exceed the fixed monthly
charges.
4. A credit allowance will not be given for mistakes,
omissions, interruptions, delays, errors or defects, or
curtailments in the service caused by the negligence or
§ 1044.09 COLDWATER CODE § 1044.09
202:294
willful act of customers, subscribers, or other parties, or
mistakes, omissions, interruptions, delays, errors, or
defects caused by the failure of equipment or a service not
provided by the CBPU.
5. The service furnished by the CBPU, in addition to the
limitations set forth above, is also subject to the following
limitations: The liability of the CBPU for loss or damages
arising out of mistakes, omissions, interruptions, delays,
errors, or defects in the service, its transmission, or
failures or defects in facilities of the underlying
communications carrier, occurring in the course of
furnishing service and not caused by the negligence of the
authorized user, or the underlying communications carrier
in failing to maintain proper standards of maintenance and
operation and to exercise reasonable supervision, shall in
no event exceed an amount equivalent to the
proportionate fixed monthly charge to the authorized user
for service during the period of time in which such
mistakes, omissions, interruptions, delays, errors, or
defects in service, its transmission, or failures or defects in
facilities furnished by the CBPU or the underlying
communications carrier occurred.
B. The CBPU shall in no event be liable for service or equipment
interruptions or delays in transmission, errors or defects in
service or equipment, when caused by acts of God, fire, war,
riots, government authorities, default of supplier, or other
causes beyond the CBPU's or any underlying communications
carrier's control.
C. The customer acknowledges that internet systems use public
access facilities to transmit voice and data communications
and that the service may not be completely private. The CBPU
is not liable to the customer for any claims, loss, damages or
costs which may result from lack of privacy on the system.
D. The customer acknowledges that internet systems may carry
material which may be considered abusive, profane or sexually
offensive and that the CBPU is not liable to the customer for
any claims, loss, damages or costs which may result from such
material.
E. The customer hereby agrees to indemnify and save the CBPU
harmless against claims for libel, slander, or infringement of
copyright from the material carried in any form over its
facilities by a customer or those using a customer's equipment;
against claims for infringement of patents arising from
combining or using apparatus or systems of a customer with
the facilities of the CBPU or any communications carrier; and
against all other claims arising out of any act or omission of a
§ 1044.09 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1044.09
202:295
customer in connection with the facilities or service provided
by the CBPU.
(5) Disclaimer of warranties and limitation of remedies. The customer
acknowledges and agrees that the CBPU is not the manufacturer of
equipment and internet package software, and the CBPU hereby
disclaims all representations and warranties, direct or indirect,
express or implied, written or oral, in connection with the
equipment or service or internet package software (whether
purchased or leased by the customer from the CBPU or another),
including, but not limited to, any and all express and implied
warranties of suitability, durability, merchantability, and fitness for
a particular purpose. The CBPU, to the extent permitted by law,
assigns to the customer any and all manufacturers' warranties
relating to equipment or internet package software purchased by
the customer, and the customer acknowledges receipt of any and
all such manufacturers' warranties.
The customer acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive
remedy in connection with any defects in the equipment or
software, including manufacture or design, shall be against the
manufacturer of the equipment or software under the
manufacturer's warranties and that the CBPU shall have no liability
to the customer in any event for any loss, damage, injury, or
expense of any kind or nature related directly or indirectly to
any equipment, software or service provided hereunder. Without
limiting the above, the CBPU shall have no liability or obligation
to the customer, in either contract or tort, for special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any kind incurred by the customer,
such as, but not limited to, claims or damages for personal injury,
wrongful death, loss of use, loss of anticipated profits, or other
incidental or consequential damages or economic losses of any
kind incurred by the customer directly or indirectly resulting from
or related to any equipment or service or software described
hereunder, whether or not caused by the company's negligence, to
the full extent the same may be disclaimed by law. Any references
to equipment or software in this paragraph shall be deemed to
apply to all equipment or software purchased by the customer or
leased by the customer from the CBPU or another lessor.
(6) Indemnification and release. The customer agrees to release,
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the CBPU, its officers, board
members, and employees, to the full extent permitted by law, from
and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities and expenses,
including legal and attorney fees, of any nature arising directly or
indirectly out of these rules and regulations, including, without
limitation, claims for personal injury or wrongful death to a
customer or users of the equipment, products or services provided
by the CBPU or used in conjunction with such equipment, products
or services provided by the CBPU and arising out of the

(7) Operating rules. The customer agrees not to publish on or over the
internet content which violates or infringes upon the rights of any
other. If the CBPU is challenged by any third party regarding the
suitability of a customer's content, the CBPU may, at the CBPU's
sole discretion, delete a customer's content from the internet
service. The customer agrees not to send unsolicited electronic

connection therewith. Should any of the same be disapproved, their
use shall be disconnected at once, either permanently, or until

notice to include a true copy of the lease of the affected premises
executed by the owner or his/her designated agent and the tenant. then
the charges for utility services provided to such leased premises for
which the tenant is responsible under the lease shall not become a lien
against the premises after the date such notice is received by the CBPU.
Immediately after the iling of such notice, the CBPU shall render no
further service to the premises until it receives from the tenant, or an
individual or entity acting on behalf of the tenant, an adequate security
deposit as security for the payment of the utility charges for which the
tenant is responsible under the lease.

items must be ones which are generally accepted by the recycling
industry for remanufacture and reuse, which can be cleaned, prepared

the environment, and which can be collected and recycled without
threatening the economic viability of a recycling program. Copies of
this list shall be on file with the City Clerk after two weeks' published
notice in the official newspaper. The City Manager may modify the
items on this list as circumstances warrant by following the procedure
specified for the original designation.

public.

investigation and shall go through two phases: preliminary plat (stages one
and two) and final plat, all in accordance with the procedure as provided in
this chapter.
§ 1244.02. Initial plat investigation. [Ord. No. 339, passed
7-25-1977]
Prior to the preparation of a preliminary plat, it is suggested that the
proprietor meet informally with the City departments concerned to
investigate the procedures and standards of the City with reference to these
Regulations and to the proposals of the Master Plan as they affect the
area in which the proposed subdivision is located. The proprietor should be
concerned with the following factors:
§ 1244.03. Preliminary plat preparation and submittal (stage one).
[Ord. No. 339, passed 7-25-1977]
The procedure, under this stage one, for the preparation and submittal of a
preliminary plat of the land area to be subdivided, shall be as follows:
(a) The proprietor should secure a copy of the Zoning Code, these
Regulations, engineering specifications and other similar ordinances or
controls relative to the subdivision and improvement of land, so as to
make himself or herself aware of the requirements of the City.
(b) The area for the proposed subdivision should be properly zoned for the
intended use.
(c) An investigation of the adequacy of existing schools and of public open
spaces, including parks and playgrounds, to serve the proposed
subdivision, should be made by the proprietor.

meeting shall be considered as the date of filing), at which the
proprietor will be scheduled to appear. Should any of the data
required in this section be omitted, the Clerk for the Planning
Commission shall notify the proprietor of the additional data
required, and Commission action shall be delayed until the
required data are received. The Commission shall act on the
preliminary plat (stage one) within 30 days after the date of filing,

include:
(1) The proposed name of the subdivision.
(2) The location thereof by section, town and range, or by other legal
description.

acceptable scale.
(5) The date and north point.
(c) Preparation. The preliminary plat (stage one) should be drawn to scale
and should show the arrangement of lots, blocks and streets.
Dimensions of all lots shall be shown, but may be approximated. It is the
intent of these Regulations that the preliminary plat (stage one) need
not be done in precisely engineered plans, but be only in sufficient
detail to permit planning review. At this stage, the proprietor should
expect that the Commission may require major alterations to be made
in the plat if it is found necessary.
It is not necessary that the preliminary plat (stage one) be prepared

aside for public use or for the use of property owners in the
subdivision.
(4) An indication of the ownership, and the existing and proposed use,
of any parcels identified as "excepted" on the preliminary plat. If
the proprietor has an interest or owns any parcel so identified as
"excepted," the preliminary plat shall indicate how this property
could be developed in accordance with the requirements of the
existing zoning district in which it is located, and with an
acceptable relationship to the layout of the proposed preliminary
plat.

clearly the method of development which the proprietor intends to
follow. Each subsequent plat shall follow the same procedure until
the entire area controlled by the proprietor is subdivided.
(f) Review by Planning Commission.
(1) The Clerk for the Planning Commission shall receive and check for
completeness the preliminary plat as required by subsections (a)
through (e) hereof. If the preliminary plat is complete and basically
in conformance with applicable Municipal requirements, the Clerk

lot, outlot or parcel is to be divided meets the minimum requirements of
the Zoning Code, including requirements as to width, area and open spaces.
In those cases where water, sewer or other services have been installed
within the plat by special assessment, and the lot proposed to be divided has
been assessed therefor, no division shall be permitted unless the applicant
agrees, in writing, to pay into the special assessment district an additional
amount, to be determined by the Clerk/Assessor, representing the increased
share of the cost of the special assessment district which should be borne

and other dangers, and to avoid undue concentration of population by
regulating and limiting the height and bulk of buildings wherever

202:356
§ 1260.02. Changes and amendments. [Ord. No. 738, passed
2-22-2010]
Council may, from time to time, in accordance with State law, on its own
motion or on petition, after a public hearing held by the Planning
Commission in the manner described in Section 1262.08, amend,

§ 1260.03. Conditional rezoning of land. [Ord. No. 738, passed
2-22-2010]
As an alternative to a rezoning amendment as described in Section 1260.02,
the City of Coldwater may allow conditional rezoning to help ensure the
proper use of land and natural resources and to allow for a more flexible
approach to the rezoning process in accordance with Act No. 110 of 2006
as amended. It is recognized that, in certain instances, it would be an
advantage to both the City and petitioners seeking rezoning of land, if a
site plan, along with conditions and limitations that may be relied upon by
the City, could be proposed as part of a petition for rezoning. Conditional
rezoning of land must follow the standards and procedures as noted below.
(c) Scope. It is not intended by this Zoning Code to repeal, abrogate, annul
or in any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws
or ordinances, except those specifically repealed by this Zoning Code or
of any private restrictions placed upon property by covenant, deed or
other private agreement. Where this Zoning Code imposes a greater
restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the height of
buildings or lot coverage, or requires greater lot areas, or larger yards,
courts or other open spaces than are imposed or required by such
existing provisions of law or Zoning Code or by such rules, regulations,
or permits or by such private restrictions, the provisions of this Zoning
Code shall control.
(a) The amendment procedure for a conditional rezoning shall follow the
same procedure as a traditional rezoning amendment pursuant to P.A.
110 of 2006, Michigan Zoning Enabling Act.
(b) In addition to the procedures pursuant to P.A. 110 of 2006 in regard to
the amendment of the Zoning Code, the following specific procedures,
standards, and requirements apply to all proposed conditional rezoning
requests.
(1) A conditional rezoning request must be voluntarily offered by an
owner of land within the City. All offers must be made in writing
and must provide the specific conditions to be considered by the
City as a part of the rezoning request. All offers shall be in the form
of a written agreement approvable by the City and property owner,
incorporating the conditional rezoning site plan and setting forth
§ 1260.01 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1260.03
202:357
any conditions and terms mutually agreed upon by the parties
relative to the land for which the conditional rezoning is sought.
(2) Conditional rezoning shall not allow a use or activity that would not
otherwise be allowed in the proposed zoning district.
(3) Conditional rezoning shall not alter any of the various zoning
requirements for the use(s) in question, i.e. parking, landscaping,
lot area, lot width, building height, setbacks, lot area coverage, etc.
Conditional rezonings shall not grant zoning variances of any kind.
Any zoning variance must follow the provisions of Chapter 1264 of
this Zoning Code.
(4) Conditional rezoning shall not grant conditional or special land use
approval. The process for review and approval of conditional land
uses must follow the provisions of Chapter 1295 of this Zoning
Code.
(5) All conditions offered by a land owner in relation to a rezoning
request must have a direct relationship to the rezoning itself.
(6) The applicant must provide a conditional rezoning site plan
prepared by a licensed professional allowed to prepare such plans
under this Zoning Code, that may show the location, size, height or
other measures for and/or of buildings, structures, improvements
and features on, and in some cases adjacent to, the property that is
the subject of the conditional rezoning of land. The details to be
offered for inclusion in the conditional rezoning site plan shall be
determined by the applicant, subject to approval of the City. A
conditional rezoning site plan shall not replace the requirement
under this Zoning Code for site plan review and approval, or
subdivision or site condominium approval, as the case may be.
(c) Time limits and reversion of land to previous district.
(1) If the proposed conditions of rezoning are acceptable to the City,
the City may establish a time period during which the conditions
apply to the property and must be met. If the conditions are not
satisfied within the time specified under this section, the property
shall revert to its former zoning classification unless an extension is
granted as noted below. Reversion of a property back to its former
classification shall be initiated by the City Council requesting that
the Planning Commission proceed with consideration of rezoning of
the land to its former zoning classification.
(2) Unless a reversion of the zoning takes place as described in the
section above, the approved conditional rezoning shall be binding
upon the subject property owner, their heirs, successors, assigns,
and transferees.
(3) Upon approval of a conditional zoning, a copy of the written
agreement between the property owner and City shall be filed with

invalid.

(b) Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties
in the same zoning district and in the vicinity. The possibility of
increased financial return shall not of itself be deemed sufficient to

granting of the variance and the variance is the minimum variance that
will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure
in the zoning district in which it is located.
(a) An appeal for variance from any ruling of the Zoning Administrator or
other administrative officer administering any portion of this Zoning

the terms and conditions of the same in the event a building permit is
required by the Building Inspector. A decision of the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall not become final until the expiration of five days from the date

opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings

cause shown, be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals or by the Circuit
Court on application, after notice to the Zoning Administrator.

(a) It shall be the policy of the City of Coldwater to promote the progressive
development of land and construction thereon by encouraging planned
unit developments to achieve:
(1) A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and permitting an increased density per
acre and a reduction in lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks
and area requirements.
(2) A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of a project, more convenience in the location of
accessory commercial uses and services.
(3) A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural
topography and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other
vegetation, and which prevents the disruption of natural drainage
patterns.
(4) A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through
shorter utilities and streets.
(5) A development pattern in harmony with land use density,
transportation facilities and community facilities objectives of the
City's Master Plan.
(b) The City is also prepared to accept a greater population density in
undeveloped areas than that reflected by present zoning, provided that

SPECIAL LAND USES
§ 1295.01. Purpose. [Ord. No. 738, passed 2-22-2010]
Special land uses are those uses of land which are essentially compatible

locational qualities which require individual review and discretion in order
to avoid incompatibility with the character of the surrounding area, public
services and facilities, and adjacent uses of land. The purpose of this
chapter is to establish equitable procedures and criteria, which shall be
applied in the determination of requests to establish special uses. The
criteria for decision and requirements provided for under the provisions of
this chapter shall be in addition to those required elsewhere in this Zoning
Code which are applicable to the special use under consideration.
(c) Prior to the issuance of a sign erectors license, the permit, firm or
corporation desiring such license shall file with the City Building
Inspector a good and sufficient bond, running to the City in the penal
sum of $5,000, to indemnify, save and keep harmless the City from any
and all costs, damages or expenses of any kind whatsoever which may
accrue against it by reason of the City's granting permission to erect a
sign, or by reason of any acts or things done under or by authority or
permission granted by an employee of the City to erect a sign in the
City, or by reason of the negligence, failure or refusal of any person,
firm or corporation to comply with all the provisions of this chapter
applicable to signs. In lieu of said bond, said applicant may file with the
Building Inspector a certificate of insurance showing public liability and
property damage insurance in force and showing the expiration date
thereof, in an amount of not less than $10,000 to $50,000 public liability
insurance, and not less than $5,000 property damage insurance. Said
sign erector and his or her insurer shall notify the City in the event of
cancellation or change in terms of said policy.
(d) At any time the bond or insurance policy of a sign erector is permitted
to lapse, his or her license shall automatically be revoked.

§ 1295.04. Basis of determination. [Ord. No. 738, passed 2-22-2010]
Prior to approval of a special use application, the Planning Commission shall
ensure that the standards specified in this section, as well as applicable
standards established elsewhere in this Zoning Code, shall be satisfied by
the completion and operation of the special use under consideration.
specifies the basis for the decision and any conditions recommended.
Upon the approval or approval with conditions by the Planning
Commission, the applicant may apply for a building permit.
(a) General standards. The Planning Commission shall review the
particular circumstances of the special use application under
consideration in terms of the following standards and shall approve a
special use only upon a finding of compliance with each of the following
standards, as well as applicable standards established elsewhere in this
Zoning Code:
(1) The special land use shall be harmonious with and in accordance
with the general objectives, intent and purposes of this Code.
(2) The special land use shall be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained in a manner harmonious with the character of existing
and future land uses on adjacent property and the surrounding
area.
(3) The special land use shall not change the essential character of the
surrounding area.
(4) The special land use shall not be hazardous to adjacent property or
involve uses, activities, materials or equipment which, will be
detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of persons or property
through the excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes or
glare.
(5) The special use shall be required to be served by public sanitary
sewer and water supply systems when available or other systems
approved by the Health Department, and served adequately by
other essential public facilities and services; such as highways,
streets, drives, sidewalks, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed special use shall
be able to provide adequately all such services. Further the special
use shall not place demands on public services and facilities in
excess of current capacity.
(b) Conditions. The Planning Commission may impose conditions with the
approval of a special use, which conditions are necessary to insure
compliance with the standards for approval stated in this section and
any other applicable standards contained in this Zoning Code. Such
conditions shall be considered an integral part of the special use
application and shall be enforced by the Zoning Administrator.
§ 1295.03 COLDWATER CODE § 1295.04
202:480
§ 1295.05. Specific requirements. [Ord. No. 738, passed 2-22-2010;
Ord. No. 763, passed 12-26-2012; Ord. No. 767, passed 2-11-2013]
The general standards and requirements of Section 1295.04 are basic to all
uses authorized by special use approval. The following subsections identify
specific requirements, which shall be complied with by individual uses, in
addition to the general standards and requirements of Section 1295.04(a):
(c) Time limitations. Any property which is the subject of a special use
permit which has not been used for a period of 12 months (without just
cause being shown which is beyond the control of the owner and which
is acceptable to the Planning Commission for the purposes for which
such special use was granted) shall thereafter be required to be used
for only permissible uses set forth in the particular zoning classification
and the permit for such special use shall thereupon terminate. This time
limitation shall not apply to second and subsequent phases of a
development, which is part of a comprehensive plan, as provided for in
subsection (d) hereof.
(d) Project Review. An applicant for a special use approval may include a
comprehensive plan and specifications for a development, which is to
be accomplished in phases over a specified period of months or years,
and secure a review of the entire project, thereby avoiding the need for
multiple special use hearings, unless modifications in any approved
special use plan are subsequently necessary, wherein a special use
hearing on the modification would be required.
(a) Car wash establishments.
(1) For stacking capacity see Section 1296.06 Off-street Stacking
Space for Drive-through Facilities.
(2) Vacuuming activities, if outdoors, shall be at least 100 feet from any
Residential District lot line or residential use. Wash bays for selfservice
washes shall be located at least 50 feet from any
Residential District lot line or residential use.
(3) Should self-service wash bays be located with openings parallel to
an adjacent street, they shall be screened or buffered as required
by the Planning Commission.
(b) Gasoline service stations and minor repair.
(1) All equipment and activities associated with vehicle repair
operations, except those in incidental use, such as air hoses, shall
be kept within an enclosed building.
(2) Inoperative vehicles left on the site shall be stored overnight within
an enclosed building or in an area screened by an opaque fence not
less than six feet in height.
§ 1295.04 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1295.05
202:481
(3) There shall be no storage of loose body parts, trash, tires, supplies
or equipment outside of an enclosed building.
(4) If retail sales of convenience goods are conducted on the premises,
parking for such uses shall be computed and provided separately
for that use.
(5) Canopy roofs shall be permitted to encroach into any required
yard, provided that a minimum setback of five feet is maintained,
and provided, further, that the fascia of such canopy is a minimum
of 10 feet above grade.
(6) Outdoor storage or display of merchandise is not allowed unless
approved as part of the special use permit and site plan review.
(c) One-family clustering option. The intent of this division is to permit the
development of one-family residential patterns, which, through design
innovation, will introduce flexibility so as to provide for the sound
physical handling of site planning in situations where the conventional
subdivision of land would be otherwise unreasonable. To accomplish
this, it is the intent of this option that development of this nature be
done through site planning and not by subdividing the land in the
conventional manner. The subdividing of land to contain single dwelling
units on individual lots shall not be permitted under this option. The
following modifications to the one-family residential standards shall be
permitted subject to the conditions herein imposed.
(1) In those single-family Residential Districts permitted in this
section, the site planning of one-family clustering may be permitted
in those areas possessing at least one of the following
characteristics:
A. An unsubdivided area which the Planning Commission finds to
be of such unusual shape, or which is found to contain
unsuitable or generally unbuildable soil conditions over a
significant portion of the site, or which has unusually severe
topographic conditions, or which is characterized by some
other unusual physical or developmental factor, extending over
a significant portion of the site, as would make sound physical
development under the normal subdivision approach
impractical.
B. An unsubdivided area which the Planning Commission finds to
be characterized by major stands of trees or streams or other
watercourses which extend across a significant portion of the
site, and which, as significant natural assets, ought to be
preserved, such conditions making sound development of the
site under normal subdivision approaches impractical, or
where the Planning Commission finds it desirable to preserve
open space.
§ 1295.05 COLDWATER CODE § 1295.05
202:482
(2) The area in open space (meaning the site's recreation areas and
open spaces, including usable on-site water impoundments)
accomplished through the use of one-family clusters shall
represent at least 15% of the horizontal development area of a onefamily
cluster development. This entire area may be used in
computing density when preserved as open space.
(3) The overall permitted dwelling unit density within those parcels
which qualify for cluster development shall not exceed the
following number of dwelling units per acre by zoning district
(including all residential streets):
Zoning District
Number of Dwelling Units
Per Acre
A-1 5.6
A-A 1.2
(4) Under this section, the attaching of one-family homes in clusters
shall be permitted when said homes are attached either through a
common party wall or garage wall which does not have over 50% of
an individual wall or more than 25% of the total exterior walls of a
home in common with the wall or walls of the adjoining home, or by
means of an architectural detail which does not form interior room
space, or through a common party wall in only the garage portion
of adjacent structures, there being no common party wall
relationship permitted through any other portion of the residential
unit.
(5) Under this section, the detaching of one-family homes in clusters
shall be permitted, provided the space between individual
structures within a cluster of detached homes shall be no less than
six feet apart and no greater than 10 feet apart, except that where
an opposing wall between two dwelling structures within a cluster
contains openings, that wall shall be separated from any other
opposing wall by 10 feet.
(6) The maximum number of homes in a cluster shall be subject to
review by the Planning Commission, but in no case shall a cluster
contain less than two dwelling units, nor more than four dwelling
units.
(7) No structure shall be located closer to a street right-of-way or
service drive than 20 feet.
(8) Each cluster of one-family homes shall be separated from any other
cluster of one-family homes by a minimum distance determined by
the number of homes in opposing clusters as regulated in the
following scale. However, when it can be shown that compliance
with the scale would create an adverse relationship between
clusters or force the destruction of a natural amenity, the Planning
§ 1295.05 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1295.05
202:483
Commission, after review, may modify the minimum distance
between clusters to better fit the characteristics of the site.
Total homes in two opposing clusters-minimum distance (in feet):
eight homes with 50 feet minimum, seven homes with 45 feet
minimum, six homes with 40 feet minimum, five homes with 35 feet
minimum, and four homes with 30 feet minimum.
(9) In reviewing the plans and approving the application of this section
to a particular site, the Planning Commission shall require the
following:
A. All clusters that abut major thoroughfares shall have a rear
yard or side yard relationship to said thoroughfares.
B. A landscaped berm, at least five feet high, shall be provided
along the entire property line abutting the major
thoroughfares. This berm may be included within a required
side or rear yard. The Planning Commission shall find that the
slopes on said berms are gentle enough so as not to erode
when planted in grass, and it shall review the design of the
berm as it relates to street intersections, finding that the
horizontal view of oncoming traffic is not obscured.
The Planning Commission may permit an optional landscape
treatment in lieu of a landscaped berm when a landscaped
berm is not practical due to site conditions.
C. Street ingress and egress to the major thoroughfares shall be
kept to a minimum.
D. Any area to be used for private park recreation or open space
purposes as a result of the application of this section shall be
subject to review and approval of the Planning Commission for
minimum size, shape, location, access, the character of any
improvements and assurance of the permanence of the open
space and its continued maintenance.
(10) In submitting a proposed site plan layout under this section, the
sponsor of the development shall include, along with the site plan,
the proposed building elevations and typical floor plans, an
indication of existing and proposed public easements, topography
drawn at a two-foot contour interval, all computations relative to
acreage and density, details relative to the proposed berm, and any
other details which will assist in reviewing the proposed plan.
(11) Approval of a site plan under this section shall be effective for a
period of one year. Development not started in this period shall be
considered as abandoned and authorization shall expire, requiring
that any proposed development thereafter shall be reviewed and
approved by the Planning Commission. Any proposed change in the
site plan or building plans, after approval has been received, shall
§ 1295.05 COLDWATER CODE § 1295.05
202:484
require review and approval by the Planning Commission prior to
effecting said change.
(12) The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing for the
purpose of reviewing the plans and approving an application for a
one-family clustering option in accordance with M.C.L.A. 125.3502.
(d) Adult and child group day care homes (those caring for seven or more
individuals), subject to the following provisions:
(1) Fencing shall be required and have a minimum height of five feet
around all outdoor areas accessible to the day user.
(2) The property shall be maintained in a manner, which maintains
compatibility with the existing character of the neighborhood.
(3) If a day care operation, the hours of operation of the use shall be
limited to 16 hours per twenty-four-hour day.
(4) If applicable, the use shall be licensed by the Department of Human
Services, State of Michigan.
(5) If a day care center, as defined, the minimum lot area shall be
20,000 square feet. See definition (28), 1260.07, Definitions.
(6) If a day care center, as defined, a drop-off/pick-up area shall be
provided for motorists off the public street.
(7) For each operation, there shall be a contiguous open space of a
minimum of 5,000 square feet provided on the subject parcel. Said
open space shall not be located within a required front setback
area. This requirement may be waived if public open space is
available within 500 feet of the subject parcel.
(e) Campgrounds.
(1) Campgrounds, including recreational areas incidental thereto,
must contain at least five acres in area. Said five acres are not to
include environmentally sensitive land such as wetland, floodplain,
and/or forest.
(2) Campgrounds shall be located at least 300 feet from the following
Residential Districts: R-2 One Family, R-3 One Family, A-1 One
Family, A-2 One and Two Family, and A-3 Multi Family.
(3) The present and future ability of the City and County to provide
adequate vehicular access, public safety and other necessary
public services to the proposed campground should be considered.
(4) When the site is wooded or has other natural or historical features,
which in the opinion of the Planning Commission, should be
preserved or protected, restrictions on the alteration of these
natural features may be required as a condition of approval.
§ 1295.05 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1295.05
202:485
(5) Any sale of foodstuff or merchandise shall be clearly incidental to
the needs of the occupants and users of the campground and
recreation areas while therein and shall consist of packaged
merchandise only.
(6) Activities shall be adequately screened from adjoining residentially
developed or residentially zoned property by an evergreen planting
of at least five feet in height at the time of planting. In addition, the
area must.
(7) Campgrounds shall comply with all applicable State licensing
standards and state regulations.
(f) Mining and extraction operations. These regulations are designed to
provide for the regulation of earth removal, quarrying, gravel
processing, mining, and related mineral extraction activities and to
specify the conditions and circumstances under which such a use may
be developed in order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare
of Coldwater residents, preserve ecologically important features, and to
prohibit development which, unregulated, may have an adverse impact
upon the safety, health, and welfare of the City. Prior to Planning
Commission approval of a special use for earth removal, quarrying,
gravel processing, mining, and related mineral extraction activities, the
Planning Commission shall be satisfied that the following conditions
and limitations are, or shall be strictly complied with, in addition to any
other requirements contained in the Zoning Code or in any other City
ordinance controlling such operations:
(1) Location.
A. All such operations shall be located on a primary road, as
defined by the County, for ingress and egress there to or on a
road which does not create traffic through an area developed
primarily for residential purposes. Where necessary, the
applicant may be required to construct and/or improve a road
to accommodate the truck travel necessitated by the
operations as a condition to such operation and for the purpose
of routing traffic around residential areas and preventing the
breaking up of existing road which are not "All Weather
Roads".
B. Sufficient setback shall be provided from all property lines and
public highways to assure adequate lateral support for
adjacent public and private property. No such excavation
operations shall be permitted closer than 100 feet to interior
boundary lines of the property, or such larger setback as may
be required by the Planning Commission to adequately protect
adjoining properties. However, if the adjoining property is also
used for such mining and excavation operations then the
Planning Commission may reduce, or eliminate the required
setback or temporarily reduced to 50 feet if reclamation of the
§ 1295.05 COLDWATER CODE § 1295.05
202:486
land is promptly affected to increase to at least 100 feet in
accordance with the reclamation plan approved by the
Planning Commission, and adequate lateral support as set
forth is at all times maintained.
C. No such excavation operation shall be permitted within 50 feet
of adjoining public right-of-way except for the lowering of land
adjoining said rights-of-way to the grade level of said rights-ofway.
Such excavation businesses shall at no time be permitted
where adequate lateral support for the maintenance of
adjoining lands is not maintained.
D. The permanent processing plant and its accessory structure
shall not be located closer than 150 feet from the interior
property lines and adjoining public rights-of-way and shall,
where practicable, be located at a lower level than the
surrounding terrain to lessen visual and noise impact. In
addition, the foregoing shall apply to the digging or excavating
apparatus and to the stockpiling or loading or materials and to
the location of transportation equipment.
E. No such excavation operation shall be located within 100 feet
of the banks of any stream or waterway unless previously
approved, in writing, by the Michigan Water Resources
Commission of such state commission having jurisdiction
thereof. No such mining operations shall interfere with the
natural established flow of surface waters to the detriment or
damage of adjoining public or private properties.
(2) Sight barriers. Sight barriers shall be provided along all boundaries
of the site, which lack natural screening conditions through
existing contours or evergreen growth. Such barriers shall consist
of one or more of the following:
A. Earth berms constructed to a height of six feet above the mean
elevation of the centerline of the adjacent public highway or six
feet above the general level of terrain along interior property
lines, as the case may be. Such berms shall have slopes that
are not in excess of one foot vertical to three feet horizontal
and shall be planted with grass, trees, or shrubs.
B. Plantings or evergreen trees or shrubbery in row parallel to the
boundaries, of the property not less than four feet in height at
the time of planting and which grow to not less than eight feet
in height at maturity and sufficiently spaced to provide
effective sight barriers within six feet in height.
C. Masonry walls or attractive solid fences made of uniform new
materials constructed to a height or not less than six feet and
maintained in good repair.
(3) Nuisance abatement.
§ 1295.05 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1295.05
202:487
A. Noise and vibration shall be minimized in their effect upon
adjacent properties by the utilization of modern equipment
designed to accomplish such minimization and by the proper
use of berms, walls, and natural planting screens. All
equipment shall be maintained and operated in such a manner
so as to eliminate, as far as practicable, excessive noise and
vibrations which are not necessary in the operation of such
equipment.
B. Air pollution in the form of dust and dirt shall also be kept a
minimum by the use of modern equipment and methods of
operation designed to avoid any excessive dust or dirt or other
air pollution injurious or substantially annoying to adjoining
property owners. Interior and adjoining roads used in the
operations shall have their surface treated to minimize any
such nuisance.
C. Hours. The operation shall be restricted to the hours of 7:00
a.m. until 7:00 p.m. and no operations shall be allowed on
Sundays.
D. Fencing. All dangerous excavations, pits, pond areas, bands of
slopes shall be fenced and posted with signs around the
perimeter thereof and maintained to prevent injury to children
or others, and shall be eliminated as expeditiously as possible.
(4) Reclamation of mined areas.
A. Reclamation and rehabilitation of mined areas shall be
accomplished as soon as practicable following the mining or
excavation of an area. Rehabilitation and reclamation shall be
commenced immediately upon the termination of the mining or
excavation operations in any area consisting of one acre or
more. Substantial completion of reclamation and rehabilitation
shall be effective within one year after termination of mining or
excavation activity. In activity for a twelve-month consecutive
period shall constitute, for this purpose, termination of mining
activity.
B. The following standards shall control reclamation and
rehabilitation.
1. All excavation shall be either to a water-producing depth
of not less than five below the average summer level of
water in the excavation, or shall be graded or back-filled
with non combustible solids to ensure:
a. That the excavated area shall not collect stagnant
water and not permit the same to remain therein; or
b. That the surface of such area which is not
permanently submerged is graded or back-filled as
§ 1295.05 COLDWATER CODE § 1295.05
202:488
necessary to produce a gently rolling surface that will
minimize wind and water erosion and which will be
generally compatible with the adjoining land area.
2. The banks of all excavations shall be sloped to the
waterline in a water-producing excavation and to the pit
floor in a dry operation, at a slope which shall not be
steeper than one foot vertical to three feet horizontal.
3. Top soil of a quality equal to that occurring naturally in the
area shall be replaced on excavated areas not covered by
water except where streets, beaches, or other planned
improvements area to be completed within a one-year
period. Where used, topsoil shall be applied to a minimum
depth of four inches sufficient to support vegetation.
4. Vegetation shall be restored by the appropriate seeding of
grasses or the planting of trees and shrubs to establish a
permanent vegetation cover on the land surface and to
minimize erosion.
5. Upon cessation of mining operations by abandonment or
otherwise, the operating company, within a reasonable
period of time not to exceed 12 months thereafter, shall
remove all plant structures, foundations, building(s),
stockpiles and equipment, provided that building and
structures which have a function under the reclamation
plan and which can be lawfully used under the
requirements of the zoning district in which they will be
located under such plan, may be retained.
C. A performance bond or cash shall be furnished the Clerk
insuring the proper rehabilitation and reclamation of the
mined and excavated areas prior to start of any such mining or
excavating operations. The amount of the guarantee shall be
not less than $5,000 per acre proposed to be mined or
excavated in the following twelve-month period and which has
previously been mined or excavated during any preceding
period and not reclaimed and rehabilitated in accordance with
this Zoning Code and the applicant's filed plan. Mined areas
resulting in a water depth of five feet or more shall be deemed
to be reclaimed areas to within 15 feet of any vertical shoreline
thereof and to the extent of the shoreline where the same has
been sloped to a grade of not more than one vertical to three
horizontal for the purpose of this financial guarantee. The
Zoning Administrator shall review such financial guarantee
annually, on or about the anniversary date of the excavation
permit, for adjustment and compliance with the foregoing
requirements. In no event shall such financial guarantee be
less than $5,000 in amount.
§ 1295.05 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1295.05
202:489
(5) Submission of operational and reclamation plans.
A. No earth removal, quarrying, gravel processing, mining and
related mineral extraction businesses shall be allowed or
commenced until a plan has been submitted to the Planning
Commission disclosing compliance with all of the provisions of
the within Zoning Code or the manner in compliance will be
secured by the applicants. Such plans shall include, among
other things, the following:
1. A contour map of the tract of land involved in the
operations, including dimensions of the same, and "all
weather" roads, additional road, if any, to be constructed
and the location and nature of abutting improvements on
adjoining property.
2. The number of acres and the location of the same
proposed to be operated upon within the following twelvemonth
period after commencement of operations.
3. The type of mining, extraction, or related activity proposed
to be conducted and the nature of the equipment to be
used.
4. The location of the principal processing plant and the
distance of any proposed excavation or mining from the
boundaries of the site.
5. Soil boring test shall be made around the perimeter of the
excavation site in the event excavation or activities are to
be conducted closer than 150 feet from the boundaries of
the site. Said soil boring tests shall disclose conditions
satisfactory for lateral support of adjacent premises as
determined by the City Engineer. The written consent the
owners of adjoining premises and of the Planning
Commission shall be required if mining operations shall be
closer than specified in the within Zoning Code to the
boundaries of the site.
6. A map or plan disclosing the final grades and elevations to
be established following the completion of the mining
operations including the proposed uses then contemplated
for the land, future lakes, and roads and such other
matters as may evidence the bona fide nature of the
reclamation and rehabilitation plans devastated and the
fact that the land will not be devastated and rendered
unusable by the proposed mining activities.
(6) Hearing.
A. After receiving the Special Use application for an earth
removal, quarrying, gravel processing, mining and related
§ 1295.05 COLDWATER CODE § 1295.05
202:490
mineral extraction operation accompanied by the required
plans and specifications and permit fee, the Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing upon such application.
B. Opportunity shall be given to all present to be heard at such
hearing.
C. Following such hearing, said Planning Commission shall grant
or deny the application and set forth its reasons for its
decision. Such decision shall be based upon the criteria set
forth in the within Zoning Code and shall be based, in addition,
on a consideration of the following:
1. The most advantageous use of the land, resources and
property.
2. The character of the area in question and its peculiar
suitability, if any, for particular uses.
3. Conservation of property, as well as natural resources and
the general and appropriate trend and character of
development in the subject area.
4. The protection and preservation of the general health and
safety and welfare of the City.
5. The scarcity or value of the minerals sought to be mined as
compared with the effect upon the adjacent community of
the proposed operations.
6. Whether or not the operations were previously in
existence prior to the adoption of the text provision
concerning the same and the extent and character of such
pervious operations.
7. In making any decisions, the Planning Commission shall
have the right and authority to impose such additional
conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary for the
protection of the health, safety and general welfare of the
neighborhood and of the adjoining residents and property
owners.
8. The Planning Commission may also limit the length of
times its special use permit is to be effective and may
provide for a periodic review of the proposed operations to
ascertain compliance with the conditions and limitations
imposed upon the same. It shall be empowered to renew or
extend a special use permit where all standards and
conditions are compiled with and may revoke or refuse to
renew the same where non-compliance exists. No
revocation or failure to renew or extend a permit shall
release the applicant from the duty of rehabilitation and

(5) A wooden fence must be constructed so that the exposed framing of
the fence faces the principal structure. The exposed framing of the
fence may face an adjacent side yard or rear yard when either (a)
there is an existing fence located on the adjacent property and that
fence is of a construction or location such that it is physically
impractical to install a wood fence with the exposed framing facing
the principal structure, or (b) all owners of property adjacent to the
proposed fence declare in writing that they have no objection to the
exposed framing facing their properties.
(6) The owner of any fence shall maintain the fence by painting,
treating, trimming, repairing or removal, as necessary to maintain
the fence in a safe and reasonably attractive condition. A fence that
is dangerous to public safety, health or general welfare is a public
nuisance and the City may commence proceedings for the
abatement thereof.
(7) It is recommended that an applicant for a fence permit inform the
adjoining property owner(s) of the intention to construct a fence,
and have a surveyor locate the property lines involved. Fences shall
be constructed inside the property line or on the property line
between adjoining neighbors. Utility providers should be contacted
prior to any fence installation regarding meter access
requirements and location of utility lines.
(f) General regulations.
(1) Location. No fence shall be located closer than one foot to a street
right-of-way. No fence shall obstruct a vision clearance triangle as
set forth in Section 1299.05.
(2) Method of measurement. Where a fence is located at a common
property line with varying elevations, the height of the fence shall
be measured and averaged at regular intervals on both sides of the
property line. The final height shall be determined by averaging the
dimensions obtained from the measured interval averages. The
measured interval distances shall typically be eight feet.
(3) Decorative architectural features on fences shall not be included in
the height of a fence so long as they do not extend more than nine
inches above the maximum height and shall have minimum five-foot
spacing between them.
(4) Any fence must allow access to the rear yard, and the access must
be at least four feet wide. All gates are required to swing inward,
away from adjacent property, and toward the property owner's
yard.
(5) Legally existing, nonconforming fences will be required to comply
with this section when any change is made to the fence, except for
painting, and repair(s) not affecting more than 25% of the fence
surface within a one-year period.

statute or regulation regarding fences around swimming pools
shall be controlled by that ordinance, statute or regulation
regarding swimming pools.
(g) Prohibited fencing.
(1) No fence erected within the City limits shall be electrically charged
in any manner.
(2) A fence may not be constructed of plywood, scrap lumber, exposed
concrete, cinder block, or other non-customary materials.
(3) No fence shall be constructed of barbed wire, razor wire,
concertina strands or similar materials; provided however that a
fence which includes barbed wire strands may be used to enclose
hazardous materials or land uses, or where such additional security
is appropriate for land used for industrial purposes, in the
discretion of the Zoning Administrator, provided that only three
strands are used, not more than a total of nine inches in height.
(4) A fence is not permitted on a vacant lot having no principal use.
(5) A fence may not interrupt traffic patterns, parking spaces,
maneuvering lanes, or drainage areas.
(a) Residential Districts are reserved for the housing and noncommercial
needs of the community.
(b) The installation of oil or fuel storage tanks in a conspicuous exposed
fashion is prohibited.
(c) All uses not specifically permitted within a Residential District by the
provisions of this Zoning Code are prohibited.
(d) Garage sales occurring on the same lot in excess of three per calendar
year, or any sale lasting longer than three consecutive days, is
considered a commercial use and is therefore prohibited. Only the
property owners of a specific property can operate a garage sale on
their property.

shall be located on the front facade of the building, that which faces the
public street. The compatibility of design and appearance shall be
determined in the first instance by the Zoning Administrator upon
review of the plans submitted for a particular dwelling. An appeal by an
aggrieved party may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals. Any
determination of compatibility shall be based upon the standards set
forth in this section as well as the character, design and appearance of
residential dwellings located outside of mobile home parks within 750
feet of the subject dwelling. The foregoing shall not be construed to
prohibit innovative design concepts involving such matters as solar
energy, view, unique land contour or relief from the common or
standard designed home.

§ 1299.15. Home occupations. [Ord. No. 738, passed 2-22-2010]
Accessory uses are permitted when located on the same lot with the
principal use, including customary home occupations as defined and further
regulated in Chapter 1260, if the dwelling conforms to all of its zoning
district requirements, provided that no more than one person, not a resident
in said dwelling, is employed in said dwelling, that no more than 1/2 of the
floor area of one story of the dwelling or an accessory building or garage is
devoted to such use, that no stock in trade is kept or commodities sold, that
no mechanical or electrical equipment which will create a nuisance to the
adjacent neighborhood is used, and that adequate parking in accordance
with Chapter 1296 is provided.
§ 1299.16. Conversion of dwellings. [Ord. No. 738, passed
2-22-2010]
The conversion of any existing building into a dwelling or the conversion of
an existing dwelling so as to accommodate an increased number of dwelling
units or families, shall be permitted only as specified in its zone district
requirements irrespective of the area requirements for new buildings.
(a) No accessory building shall be located within a required front yard or
closer to a side street than the minimum setback allowed for a principal
building situated on an adjacent lot which faces the same side street,
and no accessory building shall occupy more than 10% of the lot area on
which it is situated.
(b) No residential accessory building shall exceed 12 feet in height.
(c) All detached accessory buildings shall be located at least 10 feet from a
principal building or dwelling and six feet from any other detached or
attached accessory building.
(d) In all zoning districts, detached accessory buildings may be located
within three feet of a side or rear lot line, except where the side lot line
abuts a public street, in which case the minimum setback requirements
for principal buildings within the district shall apply.
(e) In all zoning districts, attached accessory buildings shall observe the
minimum yard setback requirements of the district.
(f) Where a corner lot adjoins in the rear, the rear of another corner lot and
accessory building, whether attached or detached, may be erected
three feet from such common rear lot line if all portions of such building
are located within the furthest quarter of the lot from the street line and
no part of such building projects beyond the side street line of the
principal building.
(g) Swimming pools shall not be governed by the side and rear yard
requirements of this Zoning Code but shall conform to the yard
restrictions of the City's Building Code.

202:522
§ 1299.17. Rear dwellings. [Ord. No. 738, passed 2-22-2010]
No building in the rear of a main building of the same lot shall be used for
residential purposes.
§ 1299.18. Unclassified uses. [Ord. No. 738, passed 2-22-2010]
Where a proposed use of land or use of a building is not contemplated
or specified by this Zoning Code or where the Zoning Administrator has
a question as to the appropriateness of a use which, although basically
permitted, involves other features which were not contemplated or
specified by this Zoning Code, the Zoning Administrator shall request a
determination by the Planning Commission. If the Planning Commission
determines that such use is not contemplated or specified by this Zoning
Code, or that it involves features which were not contemplated or specified
herein, then the Planning Commission may permit such use as a special use,
but only after it determines that it will have no adverse effect upon adjacent
property, that the use is similar to other uses in the district in which it is
proposed to be placed, and the spirit, purpose and intent of this Zoning
Code and the Master Plan are not impaired by permitting such use at the
proposed location.
§ 1299.19. Special controlled adult uses. [Ord. No. 738, passed
2-22-2010]
(a) Adult uses.
(1) Intent. In the development and execution of these zoning
regulations, it is recognized that there are some uses that, because
of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable
operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are
concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby causing a
deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. The proximity of adult uses
to certain uses considered particularly susceptible to the negative
impacts or the concentration of adult uses tends to erode the
quality of life, adversely affect property values, disrupt business
investment, encourage residents and businesses to move from or to
avoid the community, increase crime and contribute a blighting
effect on the surrounding area. This section describes the uses
regulated and the specific standards needed to ensure that the
adverse effects of these uses will not contribute to the deterioration
of the surrounding neighborhood, to prevent undesirable
concentration of these uses and to require sufficient spacing from
uses considered most susceptible to negative impacts.
(2) Applicability. The uses defined in Section 1260.07 as "adult
regulated uses" shall be permitted only in zoning districts zoned
C-4 and only by special use permit, subject to the generally
applicable provisions and procedures set forth in these Codified
Ordinances for obtaining such special use permits, and subject to
the licensing and other requirements of the Part 8 of the Codified
§ 1299.17 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1299.19
202:523
Ordinances, and subject to the following location requirements and
specific design standards:
A. Required spacing. Adult regulated uses shall be located no less
than 500 feet from the boundary of a residential district and
500 feet from a residential use, regardless of whether the
residential district or use is located in or outside of the City.
Adult regulated uses shall be spaced at least 1,000 feet from
the following uses: any other adult regulated use; child day
care homes; nurseries; primary or secondary schools;
churches; convents; temples and similar religious institutions;
and public parks, community centers, movie theaters, ice or
roller skating rinks and other places of public assembly
frequented by children and teenagers, regardless of whether
such use is located in or outside of the City. The distance shall
be measured horizontally between the nearest point of each
property line. Upon denial of any application for a special use
permit under this section, the applicant may appeal for a
waiver of the above location requirements to the Zoning Board
of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals may waive the
location requirements set forth in this section following a
public hearing provided in the manner described in Section
1262.08 of this Zoning Code, upon a finding that the proposed
use will not be contrary to any other provision of this Zoning
Code or injurious to nearby properties and will not enlarge or
encourage the development of a "skid row" or "strip."
B. Special site design standards.
1. The building and site shall be designed, constructed and
maintained so that material such as a display, decoration
or sign depicting, describing or relating to specified sexual
activities or specified anatomical areas (as defined in this
Zoning Code) cannot be observed by pedestrians and
motorists on a public right-of-way or from an adjacent land
use.
2. The site shall have access only onto an arterial street.
C. Conditions of approval. A Special Use Permit, approved
hereunder, shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining
and maintaining a license under the Chapter 804 of these
Codified Ordinances.
D. Minors on premises. No person operating, assisting in the
operation of, or an employee of, an adult regulated use, shall
permit any person under the age of 18 years of age to be on the
premises of such business, either as an employee or customer.
(b) Application of section. The provisions of this section shall be applicable
to all zoning districts unless otherwise specified in this section.
§ 1299.19 COLDWATER CODE § 1299.19
202:524
(c) Procedure for processing applications. All applications to establish an
adult regulated use shall be processed as a special use in accordance
with the provisions and procedures set forth in this Zoning Code
including but not limited to Chapter 1295. In addition, the Planning
Commission shall adhere to the following procedures when reviewing a
special use application for an adult regulated use:
(1) If the Planning Commission determines that a special use
application for an adult regulated use is not complete when it is
first presented to the Commission, it shall provide written notice by
first class mail within five business days of such determination
detailing the items required to complete the application.
(2) If the Planning Commission determines that the application is
complete, it shall, within 90 days of such determination, make and
adopt specific findings with respect to whether the adult regulated
use is in compliance with the approval standards for special use
permits and the design standards set forth in this chapter. If the
Planning Commission has not made and adopted findings of fact
with respect to a proposed adult regulated use and either approved
or denied the issuance of a special use permit for the same within
90 days of its determination that a completed application has been
filed, then the special use permit shall be deemed to have been
approved.
(d) Limit on reapplication. No application for such use which has been
denied wholly or in part shall be resubmitted for a period of one year
from the date of the order of denial, except on the grounds of new
evidence not previously available or proof of changed conditions.
(e) Appeal from adverse decision.
(1) In the event that an application is denied, the applicant shall be
entitled to prompt review by the Zoning Board of Appeals as a
means to exhaust local remedies and to be consistent with the
intent of Paragon Properties Co. v. Novi, 206 Mich. App. 74; 520
N.W.2d 344 (1994). The applicant shall file an appeal with the City
Clerk within five business days of the denial of the special use
permit application by the Planning Commission. The review shall,
upon the applicant's request, be conducted at a special Zoning
Board of Appeals meeting convened for such purposes within 15
business days of receipt of such a request. The Zoning Board of
Appeals shall review the record of proceedings conducted before
the Planning Commission and determine whether the Commission's
decision was based upon competent material and substantial
evidence and otherwise review the determination to ensure that it
complies with all requirements of both the Michigan and United
States Constitutions.
(2) If the Zoning Board of Appeals affirms denial of the special use
permit, then the applicant shall be entitled to prompt judicial
§ 1299.19 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1299.19
202:525
§ 1299.20. Wireless communication facilities and services. [Ord.
No. 738, passed 2-22-2010]
review by submitting a written request to the City Clerk. Such
written request must be received by the City Clerk within 30
business days of the date of the decision of the Zoning Board of
Appeals. The City shall, within five business days of receipt of such
written request do the following:
A. File a petition in the Circuit Court for the County of Branch
seeking a judicial determination with respect to the validity of
such denial, and in conjunction therewith, apply for a
preliminary and permanent injunction restraining the
applicant from operating the adult regulated use in violation of
this section.
B. Request that the application for issuance of a preliminary
injunction be set for a show-cause hearing within five business
days or as soon as thereafter possible. In the event that the
applicant appears at or before the time of such show cause
hearing, waives the notice otherwise provided by Michigan
Court Rule and requests that at the time set for such hearing
the court proceed to hear the case under applicable rules of
civil procedure for the issuance of such permanent injunction
on its merits, the City shall be required to waive its application
for preliminary injunction and shall join such request. In the
event that the applicant does not waive notice and/or does not
request an early hearing on the City's application for
permanent injunction, it shall nevertheless be the duty of the
City to seek the earliest possible hearing date under Michigan
law and the Michigan Court Rules.
C. The filing of written notice of intent to contest the City's denial
of a special use permit shall not in any way affect the validity of
such denial, but such denial shall be deemed invalid and the
permit automatically approved if, within 15 days of the filing of
the petition, a show-cause hearing has not been scheduled.
(a) Permitted as principal uses. In the following circumstances, a new
wireless communication facility shall be a principal permitted use, or a
permitted accessory use, subject to site plan approval as provided in
Chapter 1265, Site Plan Review, and also subject to the conditions set
forth in division (d) of this section:
(1) Attached wireless communication facilities within all districts
where the existing structure is not, in the discretion of the Planning
Commission, proposed to be either materially altered or materially
changed;
§ 1299.19 COLDWATER CODE § 1299.20
202:526
(2) Collocation of an attached wireless communication facility, which
has been previously approved for collocation by the Planning
Commission;
(3) Wireless communication facilities attached to a utility pole located
within a right-of-way, where the existing pole is not modified to
materially alter the structure and or result in an impairment of
sight lines or other safety interests; or
(4) Wireless communication facilities with monopole support
structures of no more than 150 feet in height within the AA, D-1,
and D-2 Zoning Districts.
(b) Permitted as special land uses. Wireless communication facilities with
monopole or lattice tower support structures with a height of greater
than 150 feet shall be permitted as special land uses or special
accessory uses only in the AA, D-1, or D-2 Zoning District, subject to the
standards of Chapter 1295, Special Land Uses, except that they shall
not be located within 500 feet of any A-1 or A-2 Zoning District, or
within a distance equal to the height of the support structure from the
right-of-way line of any interstate or limited-access highway or other
major thoroughfare. If located on the same parcel with another
permitted use, such facilities and any other structures connected
therewith shall not be located in a front yard.
(c) Permitted as special land uses in other districts. If an applicant can
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that a
location permitted in divisions (a) and (b) above cannot reasonably
meet the coverage and/or capacity needs of the applicant, and the
applicant can demonstrate that it has reasonably exhausted all efforts
to locate its facility in accordance with divisions (a) or (b) above, a
wireless communication facility with a monopole support structure may
be permitted as a special land use or a special accessory use within all
other zoning districts, subject to the standards of Chapter 1295, Special
Land Uses, and further subject to the following conditions:
(1) Such wireless communication facilities shall be located on a
priority basis only on the following sites:
A. Governmentally owned sites;

communication facility. If the location cannot be used, a
disclosure of the technological considerations involved
shall be provided, with specific reference to how use of the
location would prohibit the applicant/provider from
providing services.
F. Fall zone certification. To determine the required setbacks, a
Michigan registered engineer shall submit a determination and
certification regarding the manner in which the proposed
structure will fall.
The fall zone or collapse distance as cited in the certification
shall therefore be the minimum setback required. However,
in the absence of an engineer's certification, the minimum
setback shall be equal to the total height of the tower.
Furthermore, in no case shall the minimum setback from a
property line be less than 75 feet.
G. Description of security for removal. A financial security
(performance guarantee) may be required for the wireless

height of six feet and a maximum height of nine feet. All
support structures, wires, and accessory buildings shall be
located within the fenced area.
(2) Compatibility of support structures. Wireless communication
support structures shall not be injurious to the neighborhood or
detrimental to the public safety and welfare. Support structures
shall be harmonious with the surrounding areas, and aesthetically
and architecturally compatible with the natural environment. In
addition, all structures shall be equipped with an anti-climbing
device to prevent unauthorized access.
(3) Maximum height. The maximum height of wireless communication
support structures shall be: (a) 250 feet; or (b) the minimum height
demonstrated to be necessary by the applicant; or (c) such lower
heights as required and approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA). The applicant shall demonstrate a
justification for the height and provide an evaluation of alternative
designs, which might result in lower heights. Accessory buildings
shall be limited to the maximum height for accessory structures
within respective zoning districts.
(4) Setbacks from nonresidential districts. Wireless communication
support structures abutting any lot zoned for other than residential
purposes shall have a minimum setback in accordance with the
required setbacks for the principal buildings for the zoning district
in which the support structure is located.
(5) Variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant variances for
the setback of a wireless communication support structure to
accommodate a change that would reduce its visual impact or to
meet the required standards of paragraph (d)(10) hereof. The
Zoning Board of Appeals may also grant variances for the height of
a support structure of up to 50 feet only in cases where a variance
would permit additional collocations.
§ 1299.20 COLDWATER CODE § 1299.20
202:530
(6) Compatibility of accessory structures. Wireless communication
facilities proposed on the roof of a building with an equipment
enclosure shall be architecturally compatible with the principal
building upon which it is located. The equipment enclosure may be
located within the principal building or may be an accessory
building, provided the accessory building conforms to all district
requirements for accessory buildings and is constructed of the
same or compatible building material as the principal building.
(7) Appearance of support structures. The color of wireless
communication support structures and all accessory buildings shall
minimize distraction, reduce visibility, maximize aesthetics, and
ensure compatibility with its surroundings. The applicant shall be
responsible for the maintenance of the wireless communication
facility in a neat and orderly condition, as well as maintaining the
safety of the site and structural integrity of any structures.
(8) Federal and state requirements. The requirements of the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Communication
Commission (FCC) and the Michigan Aeronautics Commission shall
be noted on the site plan. Structures shall be subject to any State
and Federal regulations concerning non-ionizing electromagnetic
radiation. Furthermore, if more restrictive State or Federal
standards are adopted in the future, the antenna shall be made to
conform to the extent required by such standard or the approval
and permit for the structure shall be subject to revocation by the
City. The cost for testing and verification of compliance shall be
borne by the operator of the antenna.
(9) Lighting. Lighting on a wireless communication facility shall be
prohibited unless otherwise required by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA). The applicant shall propose a height
reduction to eliminate the need for lighting, or shall submit
detailed technical data demonstrating the need for the requested
height, including an analysis demonstrating that other sites are
unavailable or inadequate for the applicant's purposes.
(10) Collocation. All wireless communication support structures shall
accommodate no more than six attached wireless communication
facilities. Support structures shall allow for future rearrangement
of attached wireless communication facilities to accept other
attached facilities mounted at varying heights.
A. When collocation is not feasible. Wireless communication
support structures shall not be approved unless the applicant
documents that its attached wireless communication facilities
cannot be feasibly collocated or accommodated on an existing
support structure or other existing structure due to one or
more of the following reasons:
§ 1299.20 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1299.20
202:531
1. The planned equipment would exceed the structural
capacity of the existing support structure or other
structure, as documented by a licensed engineer, and the
existing support structure or other structure cannot be
reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned
or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.
2. The planned equipment would cause interference affecting
the function of other equipment on the existing support
structure or other structure as documented by a licensed
engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented at a
reasonable cost.
3. Support structures and other structures within the search
radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a
height necessary for the coverage area and capacity needs
to reasonably function as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer.
4. Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate
the planned communication equipment upon an existing
support structure or other structure.
B. Determining feasibility of collocation. Collocation shall be
deemed to be feasible when all of the following are met:
1. The applicant/provider will pay market rent or other
market compensation for collocation.
2. The site is able to provide structural support, considering
reasonable modification or replacement of a facility.
3. The collocation being considered is technically reasonable
and will not result in unreasonable interference, given
appropriate physical adjustments.
4. The height of the structure necessary for collocation will
not be increased beyond maximum height limits.
C. Refusal to permit collocation. If a party who owns or otherwise
controls a wireless communication support structure shall fail
or refuse to alter a structure to accommodate a feasible
collocation, such facility shall thereafter be a nonconforming
structure and use, and shall not be altered, expanded or
extended in any respect.
D. Refusal of collocation constitutes violation. If a party who owns
or otherwise controls a facility shall fail or refuse to permit a
feasible collocation, and this requires the construction and/or
use of a new wireless communication support structure, the
party failing or refusing to permit a feasible collocation shall be
§ 1299.20 COLDWATER CODE § 1299.20
202:532
deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy,
intent and purpose of this section of the Zoning Code.
E. Violation resulting in prohibition of new structures.
Consequently, such party shall take responsibility for the
violation, and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a
new support structure within the City for a period of five years
from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the collocation.
F. Appeal of prohibition: variance. Such a party may seek and
obtain a variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals if and to
the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to
variance relief which, in this context, shall mean a
demonstration that enforcement of the five-year prohibition
would unreasonably discriminate among providers of
functionally equivalent wireless communication services, or
that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the
provision of personal wireless communication service.
G. Offer of collocation required. An application for a new wireless
communication support structure shall include a letter from
the applicant to all potential users offering an opportunity for
collocation. The list of potential users shall be provided by the
City based on those entities who or which have requested
approval of a wireless communication facility, current FCC
license holders, and other entities requesting to be on the list.
If, during a period of 30 days after the notice letters are sent to
potential users, a user requests, in writing, to collocate on the
new support structure, the applicant shall accommodate the
request(s), unless collocation is not feasible based on the
criteria of this section.
(11) Removal. When a wireless communication facility has not been
used for 90 days, or 90 days after new technology is available
which permits the operation of a facility without the requirement of
a wireless communication support structure, all or parts of the
wireless communication facility shall be removed by the users and
owners of the facility and owners of the property.
The removal of antennas or other equipment from the facility, or
the cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of radio
signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse.
The situation(s) in which removal of a wireless communication
facility is required may be applied and limited to a portion of the
facility.
A. Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring
removal, the property owner or persons who had used the
wireless communication facility shall immediately apply for
and secure the application for any required demolition or
removal permits, and immediately proceed with and complete
§ 1299.20 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1299.20
202:533
§ 1299.21. Ingress and egress. [Ord. No. 738, passed 2-22-2010]
The purpose of this section is to establish guidelines for the location and
design of driveways that can be used for new construction in undeveloped
areas and for redevelopment of existing developed areas within the office
(OS), commercial (C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4) and industrial (D-1 and D-2)
districts. The objectives of these requirements are to reduce the frequency
of conflicts between vehicular movements and to increase the spacing
between conflict points, thereby providing motorists with increased
decision process time, which will increase safety and assure smoother
traffic flow.
The Planning Commission shall review site plans for development within
this District in light of the following standards:
the demolition or removal, restoring the condition which
existed prior to the construction of the facility.
B. If the required removal of the wireless communication facility
or a portion thereof has not been lawfully completed within 60
days of the applicable deadline, and after at least 30 days
written notice, the City may remove or secure the removal of
the facility or required portions thereof, with its actual costs
and reasonable administrative charges to be drawn or
collected from the security posted at the time application was
made for establishing the facility or, if necessary, through
appropriate judicial remedies.
(12)Radio frequency emission standards. Wireless communication
facilities shall comply with applicable Federal and State standards
relative to electromagnetic fields and the environmental effects of
radio frequency emissions.
(13) Effect of approval.
A. Subject to division (d)(13)B. below, final approval for a wireless
communication support structure shall be effective for a period
of six months.
B. If construction of a wireless communication support structure
is commenced within two miles of the land upon which a
facility has been approved, but upon which construction has
not been commenced during the six-month period of
effectiveness, the approval for the support structure that has
not been commenced shall be void 30 days following written
notice from the City of the commencement of the other support
structure. Such voiding shall apply unless the applicant
granted approval for the support structure, which has not been
commenced, demonstrates that it would not be feasible to
collocate on the support structure that has been newly
commenced.
§ 1299.20 COLDWATER CODE § 1299.21
202:534
(a) Lanes per driveway. The number of driveway lanes shall be based on
analysis of expected trip generation and peak turning volumes. (See
division (h) of this section.)
(b) Turn prohibitions. Left turns may be prohibited to and/or from
driveways under the following conditions:
(1) Inadequate corner clearance;
(2) Inadequate sight distance; or
(3) Inadequate driveway spacing.
(c) Relationship to opposing driveways. To the extent reasonably possible,
driveways shall be aligned with driveways on the opposite side of the
street.
(d) Sight distance. Adequate sight distance shall be ensured for all vehicles
exiting from a proposed development. If certain movements cannot be
made safely, then they shall be prohibited.
(e) Driveway permits. Prior to the granting of a building permit for any
construction involving a new or expanded driveway opening to a public
street, a permit for such driveway from the appropriate governmental
entity having jurisdiction over the roadway shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator.
(f) Driveway spacing. The minimum spacing allowed between a proposed
driveway and all other driveways or streets located on the same side of
the street shall be as follows:
Minimum Driveway Spacing Requirements
Legal Driving Speed Limit on
the Street Which Adjoins or
Abuts the Proposed Driveway
(miles per hour)
Minimum Spacing*
(feet)
30 or less 125
35 175
40 225
45 275
50 300
NOTE:
* The above spacings are based on average vehicle acceleration and
deceleration rates (Federal Highway Administration, FHWAH1-
91-0212). The spacing is measured from centerline to centerline
of the driveways.
§ 1299.21 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1299.21
202:535
In the event that a particular parcel or parcels lack sufficient road
frontage to maintain adequate spacing, the landowner(s) have one
of two options:
(1) They may seek a variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals for
minimum spacing unless denial of the variance would prohibit
access to the site. In no case shall the variance be greater than the
next lowest classification. For example, on a 40 mph road requiring
two-hundred-twenty-five-foot spacing, the distance may be reduced
to no less than 175 feet, which is the standard for a 35 mph road
facility; or
(2) They may cooperate with an adjacent landowner to establish a
common driveway serving the subject property and an adjacent
property.
(g) Number of driveways per parcel.
(1) Under normal circumstances a maximum of one driveway opening
shall be permitted to a particular parcel from any abutting street.
(2) The Planning Commission may permit one additional driveway
entrance along a continuous site with frontage in excess of 330 feet
and two additional driveway entrances along a continuous site if
driveway access volumes exceed 5,000 vehicles per day and
frontage exceeds 600 feet.
(3) A dual-service (median-divided) driveway is considered to be one
direct-access driveway.
(4) Only one pair of one-way drives may be used per 250 feet of street
frontage.
(h) Driveway design.
(1) Driveway width shall be sufficient for the particular use and
anticipated traffic flows. One-way drives shall be a minimum of 16
feet and a maximum of 19 feet in width. Two-way drives shall be at
least 25 feet wide, but no greater than 16 feet per lane.
(2) For uses which generate exit volumes in excess of 100 vehicles per
hour or more than 5,000 vehicles per day, two exit lanes shall be
provided and clearly marked for left and right turns. Driveways
shall be designed with a minimum twenty-five-foot radius for inbound
curbs and a minimum 20 feet for out-bound curbs.
(3) Unless written permission is obtained from adjacent property
owners, no portion of the driveway shall extend beyond the
adjacent property lines extended to the edge of the street.
(i) Corner clearance. The minimum corner clearance distance between the
centerline of a proposed driveway and the edge of the right-of-way of a
nearby cross street shall be 100 feet. Traffic movements into and out of
§ 1299.21 COLDWATER CODE § 1299.21
202:536
a driveway with a centerline located less than 150 feet from the edge
of the right-of-way of a signalized intersection may be limited to right
turns into the driveway and right turns out of the driveway.
(j) Shared driveways, frontage roads, parking lot connections and rear
service drives. Alternative access shall be encouraged. One or more of
the following may apply:
(1) Shared driveways. Sharing or joint use of a driveway by two or
more property owners shall be encouraged. In cases where access
is restricted by the driveway spacing requirements of this section, a
shared driveway may be the only practical access design. The
shared driveway shall be constructed along the midpoint between
the two properties unless a written easement is provided which
allows traffic to travel across one parcel to access another and/or to
access the public street.
(2) Frontage roads. In cases where a frontage road exists, is
recommended either in the City's Comprehensive Plan or in an
adopted corridor study, and/or is proposed in an approved site plan
for an adjoining lot or parcel, access shall be provided by such
frontage road, rather than by direct connection to the arterial
street.
(3) Parking lot connections. Where a proposed parking lot is adjacent
to an existing parking lot of a similar use, there shall be a vehicular
connection between the two parking lots where possible, as
determined by the Planning Commission. For developments
adjacent to vacant properties, the site shall be designed to provide
for a future connection.
(4) Rear service drives. Rear service drives shall be encouraged,
especially for locations where connection to a side street is
available. In addition to access along the rear service drive, direct
connections to the arterial street may be allowed, provided that the
driveways meet the requirements of this section in terms of spacing
and location.
Frontage roads, parking lot connections and rear service drives
shall be constructed according to the standards set forth in division
(k) of this section.
In areas where frontage roads or service drives are recommended,
but adjacent properties have not yet developed, the site shall be
designed to accommodate a future road/facility designed according
to the standards set forth in division (k) of this section. In such
instances, the Planning Commission may temporarily grant
individual parcels a direct connection to the adjacent arterial. This
access point shall be closed at such time as the frontage road or
service drive is constructed.
(k) Design of frontage roads or service drives.
§ 1299.21 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1299.21
202:537
(1) Frontage roads and rear service drives shall have a width of 30 feet
to 36 feet, measured from edge to edge of the driving surface, with
an approach width of 39 feet at internal intersections. Curbs may
be required by the Planning Commission based upon the
recommendation of City staff.
(2) Frontage road and rear service drive entrances and exits to the
public street shall be designed according to the same minimum
standards as required for driveways in this chapter.
(3) Frontage roads shall have a minimum setback of 30 feet from the
right-of-way. However, a minimum of 60 feet of vehicle storage shall
be provided at the frontage road intersection with a public street.
Where it can be demonstrated that traffic exit volumes will exceed
1,000 vehicles per day, a minimum of 80 feet of stacking space shall
be required. Stacking room shall be measured from the pavement
edge of the public street (end of curb radius).
(4) The frontage road's intersection with a public road shall be located
at least 100 feet from the edge of the right-of-way of any nearby
cross street. Traffic movements into and out of a frontage road
entrance or exit that is located less than 150 feet from a signalized
cross street intersection may be limited to right turns in and right
turns out.
(5) Intersections for rear access service drives should be located at
least 300 feet from the street that the adjacent buildings have
frontage on.
(6) Parking shall be prohibited along two-way frontage roads and
service drives that are constructed at the minimum thirty-foot
width. One-way roads or two-way roads designed with additional
width for parallel parking may be allowed if it can be demonstrated
through traffic studies that on-street parking will not significantly
affect the capacity, safety or operation of the frontage road or
service drive. Perpendicular or angle parking along either side of a
designated frontage road or service drive shall be prohibited.
(7) In the case of expansion, alteration or redesign of existing
development, where it can be demonstrated that pre-existing
conditions prohibit installation of a frontage road or service drive in
accordance with the aforementioned standards, the Planning
Commission shall have the authority to allow alternative cross
access between adjacent parking areas through the
interconnection of main circulation aisles. Under these conditions,
the aisles servicing the parking stalls shall be aligned
perpendicularly to the access aisle, with islands, curbing and/or
signage to further delineate the edges of the route to be used by
through traffic.

202:538
§ 1299.22. Small wind turbine regulations. [Ord. No. 740, passed
5-10-2010]
(a) Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to establish zoning
guidelines for small wind energy turbines in the City that:
(1) Promotes the development of a clean renewable energy resource;
(2) Establishes safe, effective, and efficient use of small wind energy
turbines;
(3) Minimizes potential adverse impacts between land uses; and
(4) Establishes standards and procedures for the site placement,
design, engineering, installation, operation, maintenance, and
decommissioning of small wind energy turbines.
(b) Permitted uses.
(1) A building-mounted wind turbine (building mounted) and a small
tower wind turbine (small tower) shall be considered a permitted
use in all zoning districts and shall not be erected, constructed,
installed, or modified as provided in this section unless a building
permit has been issued to the owner(s) or operator(s).
(2) All building-mounted and small tower turbines are subject to the
following minimum requirements:
A. Site placement and design requirements.
1. Visual appearance.
a. A building-mounted or small tower turbine, including
accessory buildings and related structures, shall be a
non-reflective, non-obtrusive color (e.g. white, gray,
black). The Zoning Administrator may require a photo
of a small wind energy system of the same model that
is the subject of the landowner's application adjacent
to a building or some other objects illustrating scale
(e.g. manufacturer's photo). The appearance of the
turbine, tower, and any ancillary facility shall be
maintained throughout the life of the building
mounted or small tower turbine.
b. A building-mounted or small tower turbine shall not be
artificially lighted, except to the extent required by
the FAA or other applicable authority, or otherwise
necessary for the reasonable safety and security
thereof.
c. Building-mounted or small tower turbine shall not be
used for displaying any advertising (including flags,
§ 1299.22 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1299.22
202:539
streamers, or decorative items), except for
identification of the turbine manufacturer.
d. The visual impact of all electrical and mounting
components of the wind energy turbine shall be kept
to an absolute minimum at all times.

other exposed moving component of a building-mounted or
small tower turbine shall be at least 20 feet above the
ground (at the highest point of the natural grade within 30
feet of the base of the tower) and, in addition, at least 20
feet above any outdoor surfaces intended for human use,
such as balconies or roof gardens, that are located directly
below the building-mounted or small tower turbine.
3. Noise. Audible sound due to small wind turbine operations
shall not exceed 55 decibels for any sustained period of
time, when measured at the property line. The only times
this level may be exceeded are during short-term events
such as utility outages and/or severe windstorms.
4. Vibration. Vibrations shall not be produced which are
humanly perceptible beyond the property on which a
building-mounted or small tower turbine is located.
5. Guy wires. Guy wires shall not be permitted as part of the
building-mounted or small tower turbine.
6. Shadow flicker. Small wind energy systems shall be sited
in a manner that does not result in significant shadow
flicker impacts. The applicant has the burden of proving
that the shadow flicker will not have significant adverse
impact on neighboring or adjacent uses.
7. Building-mounted turbines. In addition to the site
placement and design requirements listed previously, the
building-mounted turbine shall also be subject to the
following:
a. Height: The height of a building-mounted turbine shall
not exceed 15 feet as measured from the highest point
of the roof, excluding chimneys, antennae, and other
similar protuberances.
b. Setback: The setback of the building-mounted turbine
shall be a minimum of 40 feet from the property line,
public right-of-way, public easement, or overhead
utility lines if mounted directly on a roof or other
elevated surface of a structure. If the buildingmounted
turbine is affixed by any extension to the
side, roof, or other elevated surface, then the setback
§ 1299.22 COLDWATER CODE § 1299.22
202:540
from the property line or public right-of-way shall be
a minimum of 40 feet. The setback shall be measured
from the furthest outward extension of all moving
parts.
c. Location: The building-mounted turbine shall not be
affixed to the wall of a structure facing a road.
d. Quantity:
i. For one-family homes, two-family homes, and
multiple-family dwellings in any zoning district,
no more than one building-mounted turbine shall
be installed on any parcel of property.
ii. In all other zoning districts, no more than two
building-mounted turbines shall be installed on
any parcel of property.
e. Separation: If more than one building-mounted
turbine is installed, a distance equal to the height of
the highest building-mounted turbine must be
maintained between the base of each buildingmounted
turbine.
8. Small tower turbines. In addition to the site placement and
design requirements listed previously, the small tower
turbine shall also be subject to the following:
a. Height: The maximum total height of a small tower
turbine shall be equal to the distance from the location
of the small tower turbine to the nearest property line,
or up to 100 feet, whichever is smaller. Any small
tower turbine shall be in compliance with the
Michigan Tall Structures Act (P.A. 259 of 1959, as
amended), FAA guidelines, and Michigan Aeronautics
Commission guidelines.
b. Location: Small tower turbines shall only be located in
a rear yard of a property that has an occupied
building.
c. Occupied building setback: The setback from all
occupied buildings on the applicant's parcel shall be a
minimum of 1.1 times the total height of the turbine,
as measured from the base of the tower.
d. Other setbacks. The setback shall be equal to the total
height of the small tower turbine, as measured from
the base of the tower, from the property line, public
right-of-way, public easement, or overhead public
utility lines.
§ 1299.22 CODIFIED ORDINANCES § 1299.22
202:541
e. Quantity:
i. For one-family homes, two-family homes, and
multiple-family dwellings in any zoning district,
no more than one small tower turbine shall be
installed on any parcel of property.
ii. In all other zoning districts, no more than three
small tower turbines shall be installed on any
parcel of property.
f. Separation: If more than one small tower turbine is
installed on a parcel of property, a distance equal to
the height of the highest small tower turbine is the
minimum distance permitted between the bases of
each small tower turbine.
g. Electrical system: All electrical controls, control
wiring, grounding wires, power lines, and system
components shall be placed underground within the
boundary of each parcel at a depth designed to
accommodate the existing land use to the maximum
extent practicable. Wires necessary to connect the
wind generator to the tower wiring are exempt from
this requirement.
h. Rotor diameter: A small tower turbine may have a
rotor diameter that does not exceed 15 feet.
(c) Anemometers. The following is permitted in all zoning districts as a
temporary use, in compliance with the provisions contained herein, and
the applicable small wind turbine regulations.
(1) The construction, installation, or modification of an anemometer
tower shall require a building permit and shall conform to all
applicable local, State, and Federal applicable safety, construction,
environmental, electrical, communications, and FAA requirements.
(2) An anemometer shall be subject to the minimum requirements for
height, setback, separation, location, safety requirements, and

A. Decommissioning shall include the removal of each small
tower turbine, buildings, electrical components, and any other
associated facilities. Any foundation shall be removed to a
minimum depth of 60 inches below grade, or to the level of the
bedrock if less than 60 inches below grade.
B. The site and any disturbed earth shall be stabilized, graded,
and cleared of any debris by the owner(s) of the facility or its
assigns. If the site is not to be used for agricultural practices
following removal, the site shall be seeded to prevent soil
erosion, unless the property owner(s) requests in writing that
the land surface areas not be restored.

changes in them.

violation has been complied with. The owner of a rental unit which has
received a compliance order or upon whom a notice of violation has

ownership of, the rental unit, provided that the grantee or vendee
furnishes to the Building Commissioner a signed and notarized
statement acknowledging receipt of a copy of the compliance order or

the specific rental unit. A separate certificate shall be issued for
each rental unit contained in a rental building.
(2) Not required. Any rental unit which is required to be inspected by
or for the government of the State of Michigan or the government
of the United States of America shall be permitted to submit the
inspection certificate, indicating compliance with the requirements
of the governmental unit involved, in order to comply with
requirements to obtain a valid certificate of compliance from the
Building Commissioner. Only those units which are required to be

exempt under this paragraph. Owners of rental units exempt from
inspection shall still be required to register under the provisions of
Section 1482.03 and to furnish their certificate of inspection to the
Rental Housing Registration Department. Failure to provide a
certificate of inspection, within 10 days of registration of the rental

202:576
allow occupation of a rental unit pending the issuance of the
certificate or formal denial following inspection.
(4) Prerequisites for issuance. The Building Commissioner shall not
issue a certificate of compliance unless a current housing
registration is in effect, the responsible local agent is properly
designated, any fees for registration plus penalties are paid in full,
and an inspection of each unit has determined that compliance has
been secured with all City ordinances and State laws. Such
ordinances shall include, but not be limited to, Section 690.12 and
Chapters 1060 and 1480 of these Codified Ordinances and all
relevant building codes and ordinances.

of any rental unit has failed to comply with a notice of violation or
compliance order issued pursuant to City ordinances, the certificate of
compliance may be revoked. Failure to comply with any provision of any
relevant City ordinance or State law shall be grounds for the issuance of
a notice of violation or compliance order.
(c) Appeal or denial of registration or revocation of certificates. An appeal
through the Housing Board of Appeals must be filed within 60 days of
the date of mailing of the notice of denial or revocation, or before 5:00
p.m. on the day of the reinspection, in order to stay legal action. Should
the owner fail to appeal within this time period, the City shall proceed
with judicial action to enforce compliance with this chapter. However,
in the event that the appeal is timely filed, within 60 days of the date of
mailing of the notice of denial or revocation, or before 5:00 p.m. on the
day of the reinspection, the City shall suspend court action for any
violations, other than those violations which are deemed health or
safety dangers, pending the determination of the Housing Board of
Appeals.
(d) Vacation of units. Upon revocation of a certificate of compliance and/or
determination by the Housing Board of Appeals that the rental unit is
unfit for human habitation, the owner or operator of said unit or units
shall immediately vacate said unit or units and no person shall
thereafter occupy for sleeping or living purposes the unit or units
therein until said unit or units are in compliance with Chapter 1480 or
any subsequent minimum housing standards ordinance.
(e) Multiple unit dwellings. The Building Commissioner may, after
inspection, issue a certificate of compliance for all units in a multiple
unit dwelling. The Building Commissioner may also, after inspection,
issue a certificate of compliance for a portion, but not all, of the units in
a multiple unit dwelling. If the certificate of compliance is not issued for
all units in a multiple unit dwelling, it shall be a partial certificate of
compliance, and noncomplying units may not be operated, leased,
rented or allowed to be occupied. Owners of noncomplying units and
multiple unit dwellings may appeal the decision of the Building
Commissioner through the procedures listed below. For the purposes of

financing, and environmental clearances.
(c) Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the owner
when a governmental action, an act of God, or other events beyond the
owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to
eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the
resource for sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a
vacant site within the historic district, have been attempted and
exhausted by the owner.

modification requirement within a reasonable time, the Commission may
seek an order from the circuit court to require the owner to restore the
resource to its former condition or to modify the work so that it qualifies
for a certificate of appropriateness. If the owner does not comply or cannot
comply with the order of the court, the Commission or its agents may enter
the property and conduct work necessary to restore the resource to its
former condition or modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate
of appropriateness, in accordance with the court's order. The costs of the
work done shall be charged to the owner, and may be levied by the City
of Coldwater as a special assessment against the property. When acting
pursuant to an order of the circuit court, the Commission or its agents may

resolution requiring that all applications for permits within the proposed
historic district be referred to the Historic District Commission as
prescribed in Section 1490.16. The Historic District Commission shall
review permit applications with the same powers that would apply if the
proposed historic district was an established historic district. The review
may continue in the proposed historic district for not more than one year, or
until such time as the City Council approves or rejects the establishment of
the historic district by ordinance, whichever occurs first.
(a) Require the owner of the resource to repair all conditions contributing
to demolition by neglect.
(b) If the owner does not make repairs within a reasonable time, the
Commission or its agents may enter the property and make such repairs
as necessary to prevent demolition by neglect. The costs of the work
shall be charged to the owner, and may be levied by the City of
Coldwater as a special assessment against the property. The
Commission or its agents may enter the property for purposes of this
section upon obtaining an order from the circuit court.

harm to resources located within an established or proposed historic
district, the City Council may by resolution declare an emergency
moratorium on all such work for a period not to exceed six months. The

historic preservation, and may accept public or private gifts for historic
preservation purposes. The City Council may appoint the Historic District
Commission to accept and administer grants, gifts, and program
responsibilities.
§ 1490.19. Acquisition of historic resources. [Ord. No. 749, passed
11-22-2010]
If all efforts by the Commission to preserve a resource fail, or if it is
determined by the City Council that public ownership is most suitable,
the City Council, if considered to be the public interest, may acquire the
resource using public funds, public or private gifts, grants or proceeds
from the issuance of revenue bonds. The acquisition shall be based upon
the recommendation of the Commission. The Commission is responsible for
maintaining publicly owned resources using its own funds, if not specifically
designated for other purposes, or public funds committed for that use by the
