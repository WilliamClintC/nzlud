deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would
exercise in the situation.
E. A person "acts with criminal negligence" or is criminally negligent
when he/she fails to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
circumstances exist or a result will follow, and such failure constitutes a
gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person
would exercise in the situation.
A. If the definition of an "offense" prescribes a culpable mental state but
does not specify the conduct, attendant circumstances, or result to
which it applies, the prescribed culpable mental state applies to each
such material element.
B. If the definition of an offense prescribes criminal negligence as the
culpable mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely or
knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish a
culpable mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely or
knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish a culpable
mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely.
C. Knowledge that conduct constitutes an offense, or knowledge of the
existence, meaning or application of the ordinance defining an offense
is not an element of an offense unless the ordinance clearly so provides.
A. A culpable mental state is not required:
1. If no culpable mental state is prescribed by the ordinance defining
the offense; or
2. If the ordinance defining the offense clearly indicates a purpose to
dispense with the requirement of any culpable mental state as to a
specific element of the offense.
A. A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he/she
engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief of fact or law unless
such mistake negatives the existence of the mental state required by
the offense.
B. A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he/she
believes his/her conduct does not constitute an offense unless his/her
belief is reasonable and

§16-244, 2-8-1993]
A person with the required culpable mental state is guilty of an offense if it
is committed by his/her own conduct or by the conduct of another person
for which he/she is responsible as set out in Section 215.610, or both.
Section 215.630. Responsibility for the Conduct of Another. [Ord.
No. 836 §16-245, 2-8-1993]
1. The offense is defined by an administrative regulation or order
which is not known to him/her and has not been published or
otherwise made reasonably available to him/her, and he/she could
not have acquired such knowledge by the exercise of due diligence
pursuant to facts known to him/her; or
2. He/she acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of the
law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous, contained in
a. A statute;
b. An opinion or order of an appellate court;
c. An official interpretation of the statute, regulation or order
defining the offense made by a public official or agency legally
authorized to interpret such statute, regulation or order.
3. The burden of injecting the issue of reasonable belief that conduct
does not constitute an offense under Subdivisions (1) and (2) of
Subsection (B) is on the defendant.
A. A person is reasonable for the conduct of another when:
1. The ordinance defining the offense makes him/her so responsible;
or
2. Either before or during the commission of an offense with the
purpose of promoting the commission of an offense, he/she aids or
agrees to aid or attempts to aid such other person in planning,
committing, or attempting to commit the offense.
B. However, a person is not so responsible if:
1. He/she is the victim of the offense committed or attempted;
2. The offense is so defined that his/her conduct was necessarily
incident to the commission or attempt to commit the offense. If his/
her conduct constitutes a related but separate offense he/she is
responsible for that offense but not or the conduct of offense
committed or attempted by the other person;
3. Before the commission of the offense he/she abandons his/her
purpose and gives timely warning to law enforcement authorities

offense.
C. The defense provided by Subdivision (3) of Subsection (B) is an
affirmative defense.
A. It is no defense to any prosecution for an offense in which the
responsibility of the defendant is based upon the conduct of another
that:
1. Such other person has been acquitted or has not been convicted or
has been convicted of some other offense or degree of offense or
lacked criminal capacity or was unaware of the defendant's
criminal purpose or is immune from prosecution or is not amenable
to justice; or
2. The defendant does not belong to that class of persons who was
legally capable of committing the offense in an individual capacity.
A. A Law Enforcement Officer need not retreat or desist from efforts to
effect the arrest, or from efforts to prevent the escape from custody, of a
person he/she reasonably believes to have committed an offense
because of resistance or threatened resistance of the arrestee. In
addition to the use of physical force authorized under other statutes or
ordinances, he/she is, subject to provisions of Subsections (B) and (C)
below, justified in the use of such physical force as he/she reasonably
believes is immediately necessary to effect the arrest or to prevent the
escape from custody.
B. The use of any physical force in making an arrest is not justified under
this Section unless the arrest is lawful or the Law Enforcement Officer
reasonably believes the arrest is lawful.
C. A Law Enforcement Officer in effecting an arrest or preventing an
escape from custody is justified in using deadly force:
1. When such is authorized under other ordinances or statutes; or
2. When he/she reasonably believes that such use of deadly force is
immediately necessary to effect the arrest and also reasonably
believes that the person to be arrested:
a. Has committed or attempted to commit a dangerous violent
felony; or
b. Is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon; or

A. A person is guilty of attempt to commit an offense, when with the
purpose of committing the offense, he/she does any act which is a
substantial step towards the commission of the offense. A "substantial
step" is conduct which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the

attempted was, under the actual attendant circumstances, factually or
legally impossible of commission, if such offense could have been
committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed
them to be.
C. Unless otherwise provided, a person who has been convicted of an
attempt to commit an offense may be sentenced to pay a fine which
does not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), or serve a period of
imprisonment which shall not exceed ninety (90) days, or by both such
fine and imprisonment.
A. A person is guilty of conspiracy with another person or persons to
commit an offense if, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating its
commission he/she agrees with such other person or persons that they
or one (1) or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes
such offense.
B. If a person guilty of conspiracy knows that a person with whom he/she
conspires to commit an offense has conspired with another person or
persons to commit the same offense, he/she is guilty of conspiring with
such other person or persons to commit such offense, whether or not
he/she knows their identity.
C. If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he/she is guilty of
only one (1) conspiracy so long as such multiple offenses are the object
of the same agreement.
D. No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit an offense unless
an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to
have been done by him/her or by a person with whom he/she conspired.
E. No one shall be convicted of conspiracy if, after conspiring to commit
the offense, he/she prevented the accomplishment of the objectives of
the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his/
her criminal purpose. The defendant shall have the burden of injecting
the issue of renunciation of criminal purpose under this Subsection.

the agreement that they be committed is abandoned by the
defendant and by those with whom he/she conspired.
2. If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is
terminated as to him/her only if he/she advises those with whom he/
she has conspired of his/her abandonment or he/she informs the
law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and
of his/her participation in it.

involved. Such exposures are defined and classified as follows:
(1) Class "A" — Portions of walls containing principal living
room exposure to outdoor living area through major
windows and/or glassed doors. Prime consideration here is
direct view of and convenient access to outdoor livability
space. In cases where two (2) walls provide this type of
exposure from a living room, either may be selected as the
"Class A" exposure and the other shall be considered
"Class C".
(2) Class "B" — Portions of walls containing the only windows
for bedrooms or principal windows and/or glassed doors
for bedrooms where privacy, moderate outlook and light
and air are principal considerations.
(3) Class "C" — Portions of walls containing secondary
windows for bedrooms, windows for kitchens, bathrooms,
utility rooms and the like, secondary windows for living
rooms or exterior doors other than entries with Class "A"
orientation, where such windows do not involve privacy or
are so located, shielded or are of such a nature that
necessary privacy is assured and where light, air and fire
protection are principal considerations.
(4) Class "D" — Portions of walls containing no windows,
doors or other openings, but not so constructed or
safeguarded as to be suitable for attachment to other
Section
400.100
GRAIN VALLEY CITY CODE Section
400.100
AO:412
dwelling units or principal buildings. Principal concern in
such cases is with fire protection.
(5) Class "E" — Portions of walls containing no windows, doors
or other openings and so constructed or safeguarded as to
provide at least one (1) hour fire protection when attached
to other dwelling units or other principal buildings and to
meet the acoustic controls and living unit to living unit
sound transmission limitations of Minimum Property
Standards for Multi-Family Housing, U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development.

is the minimum open space distance on the lot (except as
otherwise provided) perpendicular to the wall of the dwelling
at any point or to any addition of the dwelling which is enclosed
for more than sixty percent (60%) of its perimeter. Except as
provided in Section 400.090, yard depth and character shall be
as follows:
(1) Distance to common areas. Distance from any Class "B"
through Class "E" exposure of a dwelling to a street
pavement or to the edge of a common driveway, a parking
area, a walk or other common area shall be at least eight
(8) feet. In the case of Class "A" exposures, this distance
shall be fifteen (15) feet. Carports open in a manner that
assures visibility may extend to within four (4) feet of a
sidewalk adjacent to a street or to a parking area or to
within four (4) feet of the street pavement or parking area
if no such sidewalk is involved.

open space depth requirements shall be by exposure:
Class "A" fifteen (15) feet; Class "B" ten (10) feet; Class "C"
eight (8) feet; Class "D" five (5) feet; Class "E" none.
Dwellings on lots adjoining non-residential buildings shall
be separated from such buildings by at least ten (10) feet
more than the above requirements.
7. Parking regulations. A minimum of two (2) parking spaces shall be
provided for each manufactured home lot. These spaces may be
located on the lot or in parking areas located not more than sixty
(60) feet from the manufactured home. Parking spaces shall be
located off the public street or private drive; and in no case shall
parking spaces or areas cross manufactured home lot lines. Parking
spaces and areas shall be built and surfaced according to Section
400.290, "Off-Street Parking and Loading Regulations".

A. Purpose.
1. The "R-P" District is intended to provide a special district for
research services. An industrial designation would be
inappropriate because the principal focus of research and
development activity should not include fabrication, processing,
manufacturing, refining or resource extraction. Site development
regulations require approval of a site plan which demonstrates a
campus-like environment. Conditions, covenants and restrictions
are required.

Fire and explosive hazards. Activities involving the storage and
utilization of materials or products which decompose by detonation
are permitted only after issuance of a conditional use permit by
the Board of Aldermen (see Section 400.240) and approval by
the Fire Department. Such materials shall include but are not
limited to all primary explosives such as lead oxide, lead styphnate,
fulminates and tetracent; all high explosives such as TNT, HMX,
PETN and picrid acid; propellants and boron hydrides, hydrazine
and its derivatives; pyrotechnics and fireworks such as magnesium

A. Statement Of Intent.
1. The designation Planned Unit Development is a zoning district to
be used in conjunction with other zoning districts as an overlay
district. It is the intent of this Section to provide for integrated
developments having harmony of design and variety of function. A
Planned Unit Development (PUD) shall be a well-planned
community utilizing a creative approach to develop an
environmentally sound neighborhood which may contain varied
uses and which does contain open space developed according to
the needs of the residents. PUDs are given a flexibility in the design
of buildings, yards and circulation patterns in order to produce:
a. A maximum choice in the type of environment and living units
available to the public. Residential areas must be welldesigned
and may contain a variety of residential structures
and building arrangements such as single-family, duplexes,
patio homes, zero lot line houses and town houses.
b. Open space and recreational amenities developed according to
the needs of the residents and the capacity of the land for such
development.
c. A pattern of development which conserves the natural
amenities and environmental assets of the land. Such a
development must be environmentally and ecologically sound.
It must take into account the limitations of the land under
development and work within the framework of those
limitations to prevent soil erosion by either wind or water.
Section
400.200
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
400.210
AO:445
d. A creative and innovative approach to site planning which
utilizes the land efficiently, resulting in smaller networks of
utilities and streets and thereby lowers housing cost.
e. An environment of stable character compatible with and
complimentary to diverse surrounding development. Such
development may include commercial or industrial, provided
that land use limitations and socio-economic factors are
weighed properly in the decision-making process.
f. (1) A more desirable environment than would be possible
through the strict application of other Sections of the
ordinance.
(2) The Planned Unit Development is designed to meet the
needs of small- and large-scale developments
incorporating a single type or a variety of residential and
related uses which are planned and developed as a unit.
Such development may consist of individual lots or
common building sites, but the planned unit concept is not
intended to permit a greater density or uses different from
those set forth in the regulations of the zoning district in
which the development is located. Common land must be
an essential and major element of the plan which is related
to and affects the long-term value of the homes and other
development. A planned unit shall be a separate entity
with a distinct character in harmony with surrounding
development.
B. Design Criteria.
1. These design criteria, together with other administrative rules and
regulations, are the basic criteria for all PUDs. These design
criteria shall be used in designing the preliminary and final plans
and plats.
a. Location. The designation Planned Unit Development (PUD) is
a zoning district to be used in conjunction with other zoning
districts as an overlay district. A planned unit development
shall be permitted in any district except "P" (Planned District).
b. Minimum site size. The minimum size of the site upon which a
planned unit development shall be located shall be not less
than three (3) acres for commercial developments, not less
than five (5) acres for residential development, and not less
than twenty (20) acres for industrial, educational, medical and
other types of institutional development.
c. Permitted uses. The following uses shall be permitted in a
planned unit development; however, commercial or industrial
development shall not be permitted in an area zoned for
residential use only.
Section
400.210
GRAIN VALLEY CITY CODE Section
400.210
AO:446
(1) Dwelling units (attached, detached, semi-attached or
groups or attached or clustered or multi-storied structures
or any combination thereof); and non-residential uses
which are designed or intended to serve the residents of
the planned unit development.
(2) Commercial uses having a major impact upon the
municipality as a whole or major sub-elements thereof,
such as shopping centers, office complexes, major
recreational and entertainment facilities, together with
such other uses that are designed or intended to serve
such activities and uses.
(3) Industrial parks, including other supporting uses
necessary for and designed or intended to serve such
activities or uses.
d. Permitted densities.
(1) It is the intent of this Section that the gross density within
a PUD not exceed the gross density of the zoning district in
which the PUD is located. For the purpose of computation,
the following are recommended densities. Higher
densities are possible based on the development plan
being presented.
"R-1", "R-1A", "R-1B", "R-1C" PUD — 4.25 units per acre
"R-2" PUD — 5.95 units per acre
"R-3" PUD — 19.6 units per acre
(2) The preceding densities are gross densities and refer to
the number of family living units provided by the total area
of the site including streets, park areas and all other land.
The maximum number of permitted family units may be
calculated by multiplying the gross area by the maximum
permitted density. In cases where more than one (1)
district is included, the number of permitted family units
must be calculated for each district independently.
e. Land use planning. Land use planning for all development shall
relate appropriately to all site conditions and to the existing or
permissible development of adjoining properties.
f. General site design. A site design shall be provided which
includes an arrangement of all site facilities necessary to
create a safe, functional, convenient, healthful, durable and
attractive living environment for residents.
g. Design quality. All elements of the site design shall be
organized in an orderly and efficient manner. The site design
shall provide an environmentally beneficial development.
Section
400.210
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
400.210
AO:447
Outdoor accommodations presented in these standards for
basic and necessary resident activities shall be provided where
and as appropriate.
h. Carrying capacity of the land. Development shall not be
permitted which exceeds the carrying ability of the land, as
related to the following:
(1) Topography of the site and the associated problems of
building on steep slopes.
(2) Drainage of areas especially as a result of storm runoff.
(3) Permeability of the soil especially as it relates to the
dispersion of waste from septic tanks.
(4) Subsurface geology as it relates to the ability to support
structures. This is of particular concern in those areas
which have undergone subsurface rock quarrying activity.
i. Site surroundings. The site design shall be coordinated with all
existing and proposed plans for the surrounding community.
The site design shall be arranged when practical and possible
to harmonize with and complement functions and appearance
of site surroundings which have a significant bearing on the
site. Where the surroundings of a site have incongruous
functions or undesirable visual conditions, buffers or screen
devices sufficient to separate or modify these unpleasant
conditions shall be provided (and as required in Section
400.280, Landscaping and Screening).
j. Site utilization. The site design shall be arranged to utilize and
preserve the favorable features and characteristics of the site
and to avoid or minimize the potential harmful effect of
unfavorable features. Parcels containing inter-related
functional uses within the planned unit development, which
have been separately identified by a metes and bounds
description on the preliminary plan, may be amended
separately from the entire planned unit development if
requested by the applicant and determined by the Board of
Aldermen as not seriously affecting the overall planned unit
development.
k. Topography.
(1) In the design of a site, the effect of topographic conditions
on the costs of development and operations shall be
considered when locating various uses on the land. No site
design shall have land uses combined with site conditions
in a manner which prevents a functional development or in
a manner which prevents correction of a potential hazard.
Section
400.210
GRAIN VALLEY CITY CODE Section
400.210
AO:448
(2) Grading design shall use natural drainage ways for
drainage where possible and shall not cause or increase
erosion conditions within or adjoining the site.
(3) Grades should be designed to retain original ground
surface levels to the limits of the branch spread of trees
and around other natural vegetation to be preserved in
place.
(4) All elements of the site design shall be designed to fit the
natural contour of the land as closely as possible and
practicable.
l. Surface drainage.
(1) Buildings, structures, streets, paved areas and utilities
shall be located on the site in areas of the least potential
ground water hazard.
(2) Grades should not be designed which direct a
concentrated flow of surface drainage over existing or
proposed slopes.
(3) Where storm drainage flow is concentrated, permanently
maintainable facilities which can include vegetation shall
be provided to prevent significant erosion and other
damage or flooding on site or on adjacent properties.
(4) Drainage shall be designed using either surface or
subsurface drainage or both to accommodate storm runoff
without adversely affecting structures calculated on the
basis of ultimate foreseeable developed conditions of
contributory site and off-site drainage areas for 25-year
frequency floods.
m. Slopes. All earth slopes with grades of thirty percent (30%) or
steeper shall be planted with appropriate vegetative cover to
minimize erosion.
n. Vegetation.
(1) Existing healthy trees, shrubs and natural cover of good
quality which will contribute to the living environment and
which can be saved shall be preserved to the fullest extent
practical.
(2) Fences or other equally effective barriers should be
provided during construction which will protect the
ground area beneath the branches of trees and other areas
of natural vegetation to be preserved from vehicular
intrusion, materials storage or other construction
activities.
Section
400.210
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
400.210
AO:449
(3) Walls, tree wells and/or other devices of appropriate
design should be provided to preserve the life of trees
which would otherwise be adversely affected by nearby
grade changes.
o. Usable open space. A minimum of sixty percent (60%) of a
residential project should be "usable open space" which is
defined as land which is free of buildings, structures and other
substantial improvements. The following examples are listed
by way of illustration to indicate what may be counted as
usable open space within this definition:
(1) Outdoor swimming pools, swimming pool areas, hard
surface recreational areas and other recreational areas,
provided these areas are unenclosed except for fences,
canopies, bathhouses or other minor structures.
(2) Customary driveways for one- and two-family dwellings.
(3) Flat roofs with improved recreational and open space
facilities with ready access.
(4) A maximum of one-half (½) of the usable open space
requirements may be satisfied by that portion of public or
private rights-of-way adjacent to the site and which at the
ultimate expected pavement width for that classification of
street will remain unpaved.
(5) Enclosed open space areas in shopping malls, including
walkways.
(6) The following examples are listed by way of illustration to
indicate what may not be counted as usable open space
within this definition:
(a) Roofs.
(b) Open parking areas.
(c) Parking structures.
(d) Slopes in excess of twenty-five percent (25%).
(e) Streets, public or private.
(7) Phase or identifiable segment of a residential project shall
contain less than fifty percent (50%) usable open space.
p. Local open space. A minimum of three percent (3%) of all
residential areas shall be developed as "local open space"
which is defined as usable open space which is designed to be
available to the residents of the project in general, is developed
to meet their recreational needs, and would not normally be
considered as the yard of a particular building. Land which is
Section
400.210
GRAIN VALLEY CITY CODE Section
400.210
AO:450
within twenty-five (25) feet behind or twenty-five (25) feet in
front or ten (10) feet to either side of a building shall not be
included in this definition. The following standards shall apply:
(1) Local open space, regardless of size, which is to be
dedicated to the City must be approved by the Park Board
and accepted by the Board of Aldermen.
(2) No local open space area may be less than twenty
thousand (20,000) square feet except in PUDs of less than
fifteen and three-tenths (15.3) acres, nor larger than three
(3) acres (except when stream valley parks, storm
drainage, utility easements or green buffers are included
with the written permission of the Planning and Zoning
Commission).
(3) Any area or segment of an open space less than one
hundred (100) feet in width cannot be calculated as local
open space unless it is clearly part of an overall open space
system. For example, a linear pedestrian system linking
larger open spaces could be included in the calculation.
(4) A local open space area smaller than twenty thousand
(20,000) square feet or larger than three (3) acres may be
authorized, particularly if practical difficulties or unusual
hardship would be caused by the application of the
required standards.
(5) When open space land is stream valley or floodplain or
without sufficient adequately-sized and reasonably level
areas for selected active recreational use, the City may
require that additional land of a suitable nature be
provided even though the total required is more than the
regularly required amount.
(6) In meeting the local open space requirement, not more
than half the required local open space may consist of the
storm drainage reservation land and the other half must be
supplied from other land. In all cases where storm
drainage area is counted toward meeting local open space
requirements, preservation of the natural assets of the
land, including its vegetation, must be provided for in
graphic and/or written form, subject to approval by the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
(7) Required local open space must meet the definition of
usable open space. Land in public utility easements may be
included in the local open space provision to the full extent
that the use of the land is not restricted for recreational
purposes. To the extent that it is restricted, additional land
must be designated by the developer.
Section
400.210
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
400.210
AO:451
(8) A developer may choose to mix his types of housing, i.e.,
single-family, row houses, apartments, etc., or to cluster
homes and reduce private yard size. This will, in many
cases, result in a substantially larger open space area than
the legal minimum. For example, a site in an "R-1", "R-1A",
"R-1B", "R-1C" zone developed entirely with single-family
homes would provide only the required three percent (3%)
of the site for local open space. If, however, some
apartments and row houses were mixed with the singlefamily
homes in an "R-1", "R-1A", "R-1B", "R-1C" zone to
achieve the same overall density, the lesser physical space
required for the row houses and apartments per dwelling
unit would obviously leave considerably more actual open
space.
(9) Local open space in addition to the three percent (3%)
minimum requirement shall be distributed reasonably
throughout the subdivision. That is, within any portion of a
development tract (a portion being an area separated by
roads, by topographic natural or manmade barriers), the
area of local open space should be in proportion to the
percentage of living units within that portion of the tract.
Deviations from this principle will be permitted where:
(a) Severe topographic or other site conditions restrict
the area in which development is feasible or
outstanding natural features worthy of preservation
are present (such as a grove of pine trees) and should
be included in the open space area.
(b) Transition area requirements are satisfied in terms of
open space.
(c) A buffer zone of open space would protect homes,
such as along their perimeter of a major highway or an
industrial site.
(d) Utilities such as sewer and water cannot be brought to
a portion of the site.
(e) The developer can demonstrate that the layout will
result in a clear improvement to the general amenity
and greater specific recreational advantages to the
residents of the proposed subdivisions. Such uses and
advantages shall be specified in the restrictive
covenants and provision for the maintenance of such
spaces shall be clearly indicated. Examples are golf
courses or systems of horseback trails.
(10) The distance between clusters of structures should be
considerable less compact than that provided by minimum
dimensions. Local open space areas should be more
Section
400.210
GRAIN VALLEY CITY CODE Section
400.210
AO:452
numerous with shorter service depth. More space should
be provided for amenities, including landscaping,
screening, greater distance between buildings, buffer
zones, etc. Center-focus sites may be more pleasingly
connected with each other and homes by linear spaces.
q. Development of local open space. Improved local open space
for both active and passive recreation shall be provided as
appropriate where permanent maintenance can be assured.
The improvement shall be consistent with the size of the
development, age levels and needs of intended users and shall
consider operation and maintenance costs.
(1) Adequate recreation space appropriately equipped shall
be provided consisting of open areas for active recreation
such as playgrounds or major sports and places for passive
recreation such as parks and sitting areas.
(2) Publicly owned and maintained parks, playgrounds and
school grounds, which are convenient to a development
and readily available for use by the residents, should be
considered in the design of the site. Adjoining public
facilities shall not be considered in meeting the three
percent (3%) minimum local open space requirement, in
total or in part.
r. Local open space distribution.
(1) The distance between local open space areas is almost as
important in their design as is their size; the distance
determines the density of distribution throughout the
subdivision, the maximum walking distance from the
home, and the number of people conveniently served by
each local open space. In subdivision design planning,
"service depth" is a more convenient term of measure than
"distance between local open space areas".
(2) Service depth is the distance between the boundary of a
local open space and the boundary of its surrounding
service area and is roughly one-half (½) the distance
between two (2) local open spaces. Service depths should
be kept as constant as possible in order to maintain
equitable relationships with homes served. Where depths
vary, however, local open spaces should desirably be
scaled to the size of the population served.
(3) All homes should be within five hundred (500) feet of a
local open space or other public park or recreational area
accessible to the residents.
(4) At densities of up to five and five-tenths (5.5) living units
per acre, where the developer provides only the minimum
Section
400.210
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
400.210
AO:453
percentage of local open space required, the private yard
spaces of the individual homes will be large enough to
provide for some recreational needs. The local open space
acreage, therefore, should be distributed in local open
spaces of at least one (1) acre in size in order to satisfy
those needs requiring larger areas than provided in
individual yards. In these cases, the service depths will
necessarily be larger than the maximum five hundred
(500) feet. Local open spaces should be compact in shape
and evenly distributed or combined with additional space
provided through floodplain reservations.
(5) Groups of residential units may be distributed throughout
developable area in clusters or groups of clusters (houses
or apartment buildings arranged about common parking
courts or service streets). These clusters are planned to be
small enough to afford ready pedestrian access from all
homes to the continuous open space in which they are
placed.
s. Access to local open space.
(1) At least one (1) unencumbered access easement with
minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be required for
each local open space from public streets for maintenance
purposes. An access easement at least ten (10) feet wide
shall be required for all sidewalks or pathways. The
sidewalk easement may, with the approval of the Planning
and Zoning Commission, be included within the twenty
(20) foot access easement for maintenance purposes.
Street frontage may be included within the definition of
access easements.
(2) Where the pathway system serving a residential
neighborhood passes through an individual local open
space to be retained by the developer or homes
association, public right-of-way or easement shall be
secured.
(3) Opportunities should be seized to join separate local open
spaces into a network of local open spaces, community
parks, school-recreation centers, reservoirs, lakes and the
major parks of an area. The total acreage is not as
significant as the establishment of a completely interlinked
system. Each development, where possible, should
contribute to the eventual whole.
(4) Where the developer of a single-family house subdivision
elects to reduce lot size to afford an area of common open
space, the space should be distributed so that it clearly
relates to as many of the smaller lots as is practicable.

major attractions of potential pedestrian movement. These
include vehicles and vehicular areas, schools, shopping
and local parks. They will include sidewalks, crosswalkways
and interior pathways. They should be designed
and located so as to avoid conflict and danger from
vehicles, particularly at intersections with local or
collector streets.
(2) The initial sidewalk and pathway policy is: To review each
subdivision individually to determine whether the walkway
system will be related (1) exclusively to the streets, (2)
exclusively to interior open space systems, or (3) some
combination of both.

approval.
D. Conditions.
1. The construction of streets of Phase I of the planned unit
development shall be completed within twenty-four (24) months of
the effective date of approval of the preliminary plan by the Board
of Aldermen. If this is not done, the City shall notify the developer
in writing by certified mail that a public hearing will be scheduled
before the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of
Aldermen at the end of the twenty-four (24) month period and
Section
400.210
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
400.210
AO:465
specifying the date of such hearing. The developer may appear
before the Board of Aldermen at the hearing, as specified, and,
upon reasonable grounds being shown therefore, the Board of
Aldermen may extend the twenty-four (24) month period for such
an additional period not to exceed one (1) year as the Board of
Aldermen may deem proper under the circumstances. If the
developer does not appear before the Board of Aldermen or does
not show reasonable grounds for extension, in the judgment of
the Board of Aldermen, the Board of Aldermen may void the
preliminary and final plans together with any conditional zoning
which was granted in conjunction with said plan. A hearing may
be held to vacate any final plats which have been filed and such
hearing may be initiated by the City.
2. Homes association. A homes association or other permanent
organization shall be created if other approved arrangements have
not been made for improving, operating and maintaining common
facilities including streets, drives, service and parking areas and
recreational areas.
3. Conditional rezoning. A rezoning granted in conjunction with a
PUD may be a rezoning conditioned upon development of the PUD
as herein set forth. Such conditional rezoning shall be designated
as conditional at the time it is granted and, in addition to other
requirements, is conditioned upon compliance with the provisions
of Subsection (D)(1).
4. Legal protest. Property owners within one hundred eighty-five
(185) feet of a proposed PUD area may submit a legal protest of the
rezoning or the preliminary plat and plan in the same fashion as
provided by law for other rezoning.
5. Abandonment. Where a PUD has been processed pursuant to the
supplemental designation of PUD, its abandonment by the
developer shall require the approval of the Board of Aldermen,
after recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission, of
an application for amendment to the Zoning Map repealing the
designation of PUD. (Where a PUD has been processed so that the
final plat is approved, its abandonment shall require the approval
of the Planning and Zoning Commission and vacation of the plat.) A
request by the developer to abandon a PUD shall also include a
simultaneous request to terminate any conditional rezoning
granted in connection with the PUD zoning. If the PUD is
abandoned by the applicant (developer) or any successor in
interest to the applicant, whether voluntarily, failure to proceed or
otherwise and the applicant (developer) fails or neglects to pursue
the abandonment procedures herein set forth, such procedures
may be initiated by the Planning and Zoning Commission or the
Board of Aldermen. The applicant shall deposit with the City at the
time of filing the application for PUD a sum sufficient to cover the

costs or processing the abandonment of the PUD. Upon completion
of the PUD, such sum shall be returned to the applicant.
6. Variations from the requirements of Section 400.210, other than
density and the use or uses permitted in the zoning district on
which the PUD is imposed, may be granted by the Board of
Aldermen if such variation retains the spirit of this Section, is
reasonable in nature, and prevents undue hardship to the
applicant. Any variance granted hereunder must be a part of the
PUD ordinance. The Planning and Zoning Commission is
encouraged to recommend to the Board of Aldermen any suggested
variances.
7. Appeals from any determination by any administrative officer of the
City shall be heard by the Board of Adjustments.
A. Uses permitted in any zoning district shall be subject to such controls
as may be imposed by the Board of Aldermen if such uses are or become
noxious or offensive by reason of vibration, noise, odor, dust, smoke,
gas, glare or heat, perceptible at the property lines, if such uses
generate an amount of traffic so as to cause traffic congestion in the
streets or if covered by Subsection (B)(2)(c). With the exception of

the zoning district where they are situated.
(8) Nonconforming uses. In accordance with Section 400.270,
any short-term loan establishment or title loan
establishment that lawfully exists on the date this

permitted under this Subsection, may be continued as a
legal nonconforming use in the same manner as existed
before the effective date of this Subsection.

2. Any use or operation permitted within this Section and operating at
the time of the passage of this Chapter shall be deemed zoned
under conditional uses, with permissive use granted until such time
as the then existing special use permit expires. As of the effective
date of this Chapter, existing permits shall be subject to the
provisions for transferability as expressed in this Chapter.
3. Vesting of rights.
a. The mere issuance of a conditional use permit gives no vested
rights to the permit holder.

4. Transferability of permits.
a. A conditional use permit may be conveyed with the land only if
a right to continue the use has vested under the terms of
Section 400.240(A)(3). The transfer of a permit in which no
right has vested shall be invalid. Nothing in this Section shall
be construed to alter the expiration date of permits or the
authority of the Board of Aldermen to revoke a permit.
b. A permit cannot be assigned or transferred to a different
parcel of land.
c. A permit holder may apply to the Planning Officer for a
determination of whether a right to continue the use has

Chapter. Such application shall be made in accordance with
procedures established by the Planning Officer.
d. Every entity attempting to convey a conditional use permit
shall give notice in writing to the Planning Officer within
seventy-two (72) hours after having sold, transferred, given
away or otherwise disposed of an interest in or control of a
parcel of land for which a conditional use permit has been
issued. Such notice shall include the name and address of the
successor in interest or control of the parcel. Receipt of such
notice shall not constitute acceptance of a invalid transfer.
5. Lapse of permits. A conditional use permit in which no vested right
has been established shall lapse and become void unless the
applicant applies for any building permit incident to the proposed
use within two (2) years of the date of approval by the Board of
Aldermen. Upon the written request of the property owner and for
good cause shown, the Planning Officer may grant one (1)
extension of not more than one (1) year. An application for
extension will be considered only if it is submitted, in writing, prior
to the expiration of the initial period.
6. Expiration of permits. A conditional use permit shall be valid for a
limited period of time to be specified in the terms of the permit. A
permit may be renewed upon application to the Board of Aldermen,
subject to the same procedures, standards and conditions as an
original application.
7. Revocation of permits.
a. Any conditional use permit granted under the authority of this
Section is subject to revocation for any or all of the following
reasons:

premises by the permit holder, agents of the permit holder
or tenants.
(4) Violation of any other applicable provisions of the Code of
Ordinances or any State or Federal law or regulation by
the permit holder, agents of the permit holder or tenants,
provided that such violations relate to the conduct or
activity authorized by the conditional use permit or the
qualifications such persons to engage in the permitted use.
(5) Attempted transfer of a permit in violation of Section
400.240(A)(4) of this Chapter.
(6) Revocation is necessary to preserve the public health,
safety and welfare.
b. Procedure for revocation.
(1) Revocation proceedings may be initiated by the Board of
Aldermen.
(2) Unless the permit holder and the landowner agree in
writing that the permit may be revoked, the Board of
Aldermen shall hold a public hearing to consider the
revocation of the conditional use permit.
(3) The City shall give the permit holder and landowner notice
of the scheduled revocation hearing at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the date scheduled for such hearing by
certified mail, return receipt requested. If such notice
cannot be delivered or is not accepted, notice may be
given by publishing a notice of hearing in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City or by posting a notice of

preponderance of the evidence that grounds for revocation
exist. Any motion for the revocation of a conditional use
permit shall clearly state the grounds for revocation.

Section
400.260
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
400.270
AO:501
A. Purpose. Within the zoning districts established by this Municipal Code
or previously existing regulation, there are lots, structures, uses and
characteristics of uses that lawfully came into being prior to the
effective date of this Municipal Code that would now be prohibited,
regulated or restricted under the provisions of this Municipal Code and
any subsequent amendment. It is the intent of this Section to recognize
the legitimate interest of owners of lawful non-conformities by allowing
these instances to continue, subject to any provisions contained herein.
It is also recognized that non-conformities may adversely and
substantially affect the development, maintenance, use and taxable
value of other properties subject to the regulations of this Municipal
Code. Therefore, it is necessary to provide regulations for the
continuance of non-conformities, but to prohibit the re-establishment of
certain non-conformities that have been discontinued.
1. Non-conforming uses. Uses legally established prior to October 10,
2007 that do not conform to the use regulations of the district in
which the use is located shall be referred to as "non-conforming
uses".
2. Non-conforming structures. Buildings and structures, excluding
signs, legally established prior to October 10, 2007 that do not
conform with the property development standards of the zoning
district in which the use is located shall be referred to as "nonconforming
structures".
3. Non-conforming signs. Signs legally established prior to October
10, 2007 that do not conform to the sign regulations of Section
400.300 shall be referred to as "non-conforming signs".
B. Policy. It is the general policy of the City to allow uses, structures or
signs that lawfully came into existence and conform to then-applicable
requirements but that do not conform to all of the requirements of this
Municipal Code to continue to exist and be put to productive use, but to
bring as many aspects of such use into conformance with the current
Municipal Code as is reasonably practicable, all subject to the
limitations of this Section are intended to recognize the interests of the
property owner in continuing to use the property but to control the
expansion of the non-conformity and to control re-establishment of
abandoned uses and limit re-establishment of buildings and structures
that have been substantially destroyed.
C. Authority To Continue. Non-conformities shall be allowed to continue in
accordance with the regulations of this Section.
D. Determination Of Non-Conformity Status. The burden of establishing
that non-conformity lawfully exists is the burden of the City.
E. Repairs And Maintenance. Repairs and maintenance required to keep
non-conforming uses, non-conforming structures and signs in a safe
condition shall be permitted, provided that no alterations shall be made
except those allowed by this Section or required by law or ordinance.

400.270
AO:502
Section 400.271. Non-Conforming Uses. [Ord. No. 1918 §1,
9-10-2007]
F. Change Of Tenancy Or Ownership. A change in tenancy, ownership or
management of an existing non-conformity shall be permitted, provided
there is no change in the character or nature, extent or intensity of the
non-conformity currently existing.
A. Non-conforming uses shall be subject to the following standards.
1. Enlargement. No non-conforming use shall be enlarged, expanded
or extended so that it occupies a greater area of land or floor area
than that which was occupied on October 10, 2007, and no
additional accessory use, building or structure shall be established
on the side of a non-conforming use. This provision
notwithstanding, uses may be extended throughout any part of the
building or accessory structure that was lawfully and manifestly
designed or arranged for such use on October 10, 2007.
2. Relocation. No non-conforming use shall be relocated in whole or in
part to any other portion of such lot or to another lot unless the use
will be in conformance with the use regulations of the district into
which it is relocated.
3. Discontinuance and abandonment. If a non-conforming use is
discontinued or its normal operation is terminated for a period of
twelve (12) months or more, the use of the building or premises
shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the district in which it
is located.
4. Damage or destruction. In the event that any structure that is
devoted in whole or in part to a non-conforming use is damaged or
destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than fifty percent
(50%) of its structural value prior to such destruction, such
structure shall not be restored unless such structure and the use
thereof conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it
is located. The determination of such reduced structural valuation
shall be made by the City and appealed to the Board of Adjustment
with no appeal fees. When damage or destruction of a structure is
fifty percent (50%) or less, no repair or restoration shall be made
unless a building permit is obtained within nine (9) months and
restoration is actually begun within twelve (12) months after the
date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to
completion.
5. Change in use. A non-conforming use may only be changed to a new
use, provided that the new use shall be of the same general
character or of a character less intensive (and thus more closely
conforming) than the existing, non-conforming use, if the Board of
Zoning Adjustment makes the decision that the change would
benefit the City as a whole. Once a non-conforming use is changed

Section 400.273. Non-Conforming Signs. [Ord. No. 1918 §1,
9-10-2007]
to a conforming use or a less intensive non-conforming use, it may
not thereafter be changed back to a less conforming use than that
to which it was changed.
6. Accessory uses. No use which is accessory to a principal nonconforming
use shall continue to exist after such principal use
ceases to exist.
A. All non-conforming structures shall be subject to the following
standards.
1. Enlargement. Any expansion of a non-conforming structure that
increases the degree of non-conformance shall be prohibited. Other
expansions of the structure shall be permitted and shall not require
a variance. The determination of whether a proposed expansion
will increase the degree of non-conformity shall be made by City
staff and appealed to the Board of Zoning Adjustment.
2. Damage or destruction. In the event that any non-conforming
structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of
more than fifty percent (50%) of its structural value prior to such
destruction, such structure shall not be restored except in full
conformance with the regulations for the zoning district in which is
located. In the event that any non-conforming structure is damaged
to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or less, no repairs or restoration
shall be made unless a building permit is obtained with nine (9)
months, and restoration is begun within twelve (12) months after
the date of such partial destruction and completion is diligently
pursued. The determination of the reduced structural valuation
shall be made by the City.
3. Relocation. Non-conforming structures shall not be moved unless
the movement will bring the structure into compliance with all
applicable zoning district regulations.
A. Policy. It is the policy of the City to encourage and, to the maximum
extent practicable, require that all signs within the City be brought into
compliance with the requirements of Section 400.300.
B. Non-Conforming Signs Protected. A sign which was lawfully in place
prior to October 10, 2007, but does not comply with one (1) or more
requirements of Section 400.300 may remain in use, subject to all other
applicable requirements of this Municipal Code.
C. Signs Offered Additional Protection. Existing institutional bulletin
boards and signs, building markers, directional signs, subdivision

entrance signs and incidental signs shall not be affected by the other
parts of this Section, except when said signs are removed, replaced
or substantially altered, at which time they shall be brought into
conformity with Section 400.300.
D. Limitations On Non-Conforming Signs.
1. Change of copy or the substitution of panels or faces to reflect a
new use on non-conforming signs shall not be permitted. Repairs
and maintenance of non-conforming signs, such as repainting,
electrical repairs and neon tubing, shall be permitted.
2. It shall be unlawful to enlarge, structurally alter or move off
premises any existing sign, except in accordance with the
provisions of Section 400.300.
3. Any non-conforming sign that ceases being used or leased for a
continuous period of six (6) months shall not be reused for sign
purposes until it is brought into full compliance with the standards
of Section 400.300.
4. Any non-conforming sign pertaining to a business or institution that
ceases operation for a period of six (6) months or more shall not be
reused for sign purposes until it is brought into full compliance
with the standards of Section 400.300.
5. When a building permit is issued for work on a building on a lot
where such work enlarges the building floor area by more than
twenty percent (20%) or involves work with a permitted value
equal to one-half (½) or more of the taxable value of the building or
structure located on the lot, any non-conforming signs on the
property shall be brought into compliance with the provisions of
Section 400.300 as part of the construction project with such work
to be completed before permanent occupancy of the new or
remodeled premises.
6. Any addition of new signage to a property should be offset by a
proportionate reduction in the amount of non-conforming signage
on the property. That is, if a new sign will account for ten percent
(10%) of the permitted signage on the property, then the nonconforming
signage on the property should be reduced by no less
than ten percent (10%) at the time the new signage is installed.
A. Applicability. The types of other non-conformities to which this Section
applies include, but are not necessarily limited to: fence height or
location; lack of or inadequate landscape buffers; lack of or inadequate
landscaping; lack of or inadequate off-street parking; and other nonconformities
not involving zoning district use or property development
standards.

When lot area or setbacks are reduced as a result of conveyance to a
Federal, State or local government for a public purpose and the remaining
area is at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the required minimum
standard for the district in which it is located, then that lot shall be deemed
to be in compliance with the minimum lot size and setback standards of this
Municipal Code without appeal to the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

(20%) of the floor area of the existing buildings or structures, the entire
lot shall be brought into conformance with presently existing
requirements of this Municipal Code as to landscaping, buffering, offstreet
parking and other non-use and non-property development
regulations of this Municipal Code.

those uses, the number of parking spaces provided shall be
not less than the sum of the separate requirements for
each use.
(6) When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces required by the formulas result in the requirement
of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half (½) or less
may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half
(½) shall be counted as one (1) parking space.
(7) Member of a fraternity or sorority shall include pledges,

A. Purpose.
1. The purpose of this Section is to provide minimum standards to
safeguard life, health, property, property values and public welfare
by regulating and controlling the quality of materials, construction,

rights-of-way and other public property is necessary to protect the
safety of workmen who must scale utility poles, to eliminate traffic
hazards, and to preserve the aesthetic appeal of the City by
eliminating clutter and visual blight.

further, that the development of the lots comply with all other
provisions of the present zoning classification.
A. The regulations, restrictions and boundaries contained in this Chapter
may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, modified
or repealed by the Board of Aldermen, either on its own motion or on
application or petition therefore by the owner, in writing, filed with said
Board of Aldermen. The application shall be signed by the landowner or
an authorized representative of the landowner. A signature by a
representative must be accompanied by a notarized statement verifying
the authority of the representative to sign for the owner. Said
application or petition shall be accompanied by a plat or map drawn to a
scale of not less than two hundred (200) feet to the inch showing the
land in question, its location, the length and location of each boundary
thereof, the location of property within three hundred (300) feet of such
land, and a filing fee payable to the City. The amount of such filing fee
shall be determined in accordance with a schedule of fees and charges
adopted by the Board of Aldermen. No portion of the filing fee shall be
refunded to the applicant. Any expenditures in excess of the filing fee,
incurred by the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Board of
Aldermen, that are necessary and incident to the processing of the
application shall be billed to the applicant or petitioner. Before taking
any action upon any proposed amendment, supplementation, change,
modification or repeal, the same shall be referred by the Board of
Aldermen to the Planning and Zoning Commission for report and
recommendation. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall then hold
public hearing upon said application or petition, after public notice
thereof, duly published according to law as provided in Chapter 89,
RSMo. After public hearing is held, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall thereupon make its final report to the Board of
Aldermen of this City, either favorably or unfavorably recommending
said application or petition, which recommendation shall be filed with
the City Clerk. Thereupon the Board of Aldermen shall hold public
hearing thereon, after public notice thereof, duly published according
to law as provided in Chapter 89, Revised Statutes of the State of
Missouri, and at or after such public hearing, said Board of Aldermen
may then approve any such application or petition by ordinance
amending, supplementing, changing, modifying or repealing, as may be
required in the premises. In case, however, of a protest against such
change, including a change in land use, duly signed and acknowledged
by owners of thirty percent (30%) or more, either of the areas of land
included in such proposed change or within an area determined by lines
drawn parallel to and one hundred eighty-five (185) feet distant from
the boundaries of the district proposed to be changed, such amendment
shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of two-thirds (2/
3) by all the members of the Board of Aldermen of the City.

B. The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and/or the
Board of Aldermen may adopt a change in zoning which is a lesser
change than the one requested, provided that the more restrictive
district is in the same residential, commercial or industrial grouping as
the district for which the change was requested. In no case may a
change to a residential district be approved if the application is for a
commercial or industrial district, and in no case may a commercial
district be approved if application is for an industrial district.
Applications for District "A" may not be changed to another category
unless a new application is filed. A planned district shall be equally
restrictive as its equivalent district. Provided, the Board of Aldermen
may refer any such application back to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for further consideration if, in its judgment, it deems such
referral advisable and in the best interest of the public and the
applicant.

Zoning Commission or Board of Aldermen, a "Letter of Intended Use"
must be provided by the applicant. The letter of intended use shall
describe the use the applicant plans for the parcel after an approved
zoning change and shall be considered binding.

C. Review.
1. Public hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a public
hearing to consider changes to the Future Land Use Map.
2. Criteria for review. In determining whether the proposed
amendment shall be approved, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following factors:
a. Whether events subsequent to the Comprehensive Plan
adoption have changed the character and/or condition of the
area so as to make the application acceptable;
b. Whether the change is consistent with the goals and policies of
the plan;
c. Whether public and community facilities, such as utilities,
sanitary and storm sewers, water, Police and fire protection,
parks and recreation facilities and roads, are adequate to serve
development for the type and scope suggested by the proposed
land use. If services and utilities are not available, whether
they can be reasonably extended, the cost of extension, and
who will bear those costs; and
d. The impacts of the potential costs and benefits derived by the
community or area by the proposed change.

or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality affected by
any decision of the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within
a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with the

complained of will constitute unnecessary hardship to the
applicant.

to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed
with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his
opinion, cause immediate peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court of record on application
or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause
shown. The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
of the appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties

the Board of Adjustment or any officer, department, board or bureau of the
municipality, may present to the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri,
a petition duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision
in the office of the City Clerk. Upon presentation of such petition, the court
may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the Board of Adjustment to review
such decision of the Board of Adjustment and shall prescribe therein the
time within which a return thereto must be made and served upon the
realtor's attorney, which shall not be less than ten (10) days and may be
extended by the court. The allowance of the writ shall not stay proceedings
upon the decision appealed from, but the court may, on application, on
notice to the Board and on due cause shown, grant a restraining order.
The Board of Adjustment shall not be required to return the original papers
acted upon, but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies
thereof or of such portions thereof as may be called for by such writ. The
return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be pertinent and
material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be
verified. If, upon the hearings, it shall appear to the court that testimony
is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take additional
evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and
report the same to the court with his findings of fact and conclusions of law,
which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which a determination

A. Purpose. The Downtown Overlay District seeks to maintain the Main
Street corridor as a thoroughfare, while promoting economic
development and compatible land uses that foster Grain Valley's sense
of a central downtown and encourages the area to serve as the social
and cultural center of Grain Valley.
The overlay district (also known as the Downtown Overlay District) is
composed of a transition zone serving more auto-orientated uses, and
the downtown area serving pedestrian-orientated uses. The standards
set forth shall apply for the entire overlay district, unless expressly
referring to the transition zone.
The requirements of the overlay district are in addition to any zoning
regulations for current and future non-residential uses existing in the
geographically defined area of downtown Grain Valley.
B. Review Process. Site plan review by the Planning Commission shall be
required prior to approval of a building permit.
C. Geographical Area. The Downtown Overlay District is defined in green
and red by the following Main Street corridor map. The northern
portion of the transition zone extends from Woodbury to the north to
Yennie/James Rollo to the south and the southern portion generally
extends from SW Eagles Parkway to the north to SW Rock Creek Lane
to the south. The downtown district extends generally along Main
Street from Yennie/James Rollo to SW Eagles Parkway to the south,
between Gregg Street to the west and Cypress Street to the East.
D. Effective Date. The standards outlined in Grain Valley's Downtown
Overlay District will apply to all newly constructed commercial or
mixed-use buildings or all new or reconstructed parking areas with five
(5) or more spaces.
In accordance with Section 400.270, any building, parking area or sign
that lawfully exists on the date this overlay district is enacted, which
would not otherwise be permitted under this overlay district, may
be continued as legal non-conforming in the same manner as existed
before the effective date of the overlay district.

Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purposes
Section 415.010. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and
Purposes. [Ord. No. 2393 §1, 11-28-2016]
A. Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the State of Missouri has in
Section 79.110, RSMo., as amended, delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations
designed to protect the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore,
the Board of Aldermen of Grain Valley, Missouri, ordains as follows.
B. Findings Of Fact.
1. Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood
hazard areas of Grain Valley, Missouri, are subject to inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment
of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
2. General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused
by:
a. The cumulative effect of development in any delineated
floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities;
and
b. The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
3. Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) that is the basis of this Chapter uses a standard engineering
method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of
interrelated steps.
a. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering
calculations, which permit a consideration of such flood factors
as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated
and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this
Chapter is representative of large floods which are
characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the
particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the general
order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent
(1%) chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as delineated on
the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS for Jackson County,
Missouri, dated January 20, 2017, as amended, and illustrative
materials dated January 20, 2017, as amended, and any future
revisions thereto.

ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
415.010
AO:623
b. Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard
hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream
channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
c. Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood
without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any
point.
d. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
development is permitted that would cause any increase in
flood height.
e. Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base
flood.
C. Statement Of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize those losses
described in Subsection (B)(1) above; to establish or maintain the
community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by
applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood
heights or velocities.
2. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that
serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of
initial construction.
3. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the
intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

lateral movement.
D. Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
Article II, Section 415.030, Subsection (A) are areas designated as
floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of flood waters that carry debris and potential projectiles,
the following provisions shall apply:
Section
415.050
GRAIN VALLEY CITY CODE Section
415.050
AO:640
1. The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based
on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway
must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without
increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one
(1) foot at any point.
2. The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial-improvements, and other
development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
3. If Article IV, Section 415.050, Subsection (D)(2), is satisfied, all
new construction and substantial-improvements shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article IV.
4. In unnumbered A Zones, the community shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data
currently available from Federal, State, or other sources as set
forth in Article IV, Section 415.050, Subsection (A)(2).

[Ord. No. 2393 §1, 11-28-2016]
A. Establishment Of Appeal Board. The Zoning Board of Adjustment as
established by the City of Grain Valley shall hear and decide appeals
and requests for variances from the floodplain management
requirements of this Chapter.
B. Responsibility Of Appeal Board. Where an application for a floodplain
development permit or request for a variance from the floodplain
management regulations is denied by the Floodplain Manager, the
applicant may apply for such floodplain development permit or variance
directly to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, as defined in Article V,
Section 415.060, Subsection (A).
The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when
it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Floodplain Manager in the enforcement or
administration of this Chapter.
C. Further Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning
Board of Adjustment or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the
Jackson County Circuit Court as provided in Section 89.110, RSMo.
D. Floodplain Management Variance Criteria. In passing upon such
applications for variances, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall
consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other Sections of this Chapter, and the following
criteria:
1. The danger to life and property due to flood damage;
2. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
6. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood
damage, for the proposed use;
7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
Section
415.060
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
415.060
AO:643
8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and
11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets;
and bridges.
E. Conditions For Approving Floodplain Management Variances.
1. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial-improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2)
acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level,
providing items (E) (2 through 6) below have been fully considered.
As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
2. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of
historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity
will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
3. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
5. Variances shall only be issued upon: (a) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
(c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
6. A community shall notify the applicant, in writing, over the
signature of a community official that: (1) the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result
in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as
high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars

have the meanings ascribed to them in this Section, except where the
context clearly indicates a different meaning:
PEDDLER — One who, for profit to himself/herself or his/her principal, sells
any good or service, or seeks a donation for any cause of a profit-making or
commercial character.

well as the right of City residents to be secure in their homes.

by this Chapter.
Section 635.040. Presumption as to Status. [Code 1985, §56.020;
CC 1990 §12-219]
It shall be presumed that an individual is a peddler rather than a solicitor.
This presumption may be overcome by a showing that donations to the
organization for which one wishes to solicit is exempt from Federal income
taxation under Section 503 of the Internal Revenue Code. This may be
shown by a copy of a Missouri sales tax exemption letter or Internal
Revenue Service ruling, or by affidavit from an officer of such organization.
Some organizations can be organizations which are not both "tax exempt" in
the sense that if you make a donation to it you cannot take it off your taxes,
but these organizations may none-the-less have a political purpose. These
organizations are entitled to solicit for funds even though persons giving
the money may not take the donation off of their taxes as a "charitable gift."
For example, a contribution or donation to the Democratic party is not a
charitable gift.

1. If water service is desired by an owner of a multiple-unit residence,
such multiple-unit residence being herein defined as a dwelling
unit housing more than one (1) family, and such definition shall
include duplexes, triplexes, four-plexes, apartments and all similar
structures and residences, then the owner shall be required to
acquire a water meter for each unit, or in the alternative, to enter
into a special written agreement with the City whereby all units of
such residence are served by one (1) water meter and providing
that the total gallons used during each billing period, as
determined by the rate schedule of the City, by such multiple-unit
residence shall be divided by the number of units in residence and
the water user shall be charged for each individual unit within the
multiple-unit residence on a pro rata basis, as though such amount
of water was used for such billing period by an individual user and
each water user in such unit shall pay the water rates as set forth in
the rate schedule, including the minimum charge of the City for
such water user's proportionate share of the water as though such
water user were an individual user in a one-family residence;
provided, further, that, the owner of the property shall be
responsible for payment of all such bills of all units contained
within any multiple-unit residence. The Superintendent of the
City's Waterworks, or anyone so designated by the Board of
Aldermen, shall be the sole judge and shall have full authority to
determine how many units are contained in a residence and such
determination shall be final and binding upon the owner of any
such residence and upon any water user therein, subject only to
review by the Board of Aldermen upon request duly filed.
2. If a trailer court (also known as a mobile home court) desires
service, then the owner shall be required to acquire a water meter
for each trailer space, or in the alternative, to enter into a special
agreement with the City whereby all units of such trailer courts are
served by one (1) water meter, but the total gallons used during
each billing period by the trailer court shall be divided by the
number of units using water during such billing. The water used
shall be charged to each individual unit on a pro rata basis, as
though such amount of water was used for such billing period by an
individual user, in a one-family residence including minimum
charges per unit, and the owner of the trailer court shall pay as a
bill for such billing period the total of such bills computed as above
set forth. The number of trailers using water during each billing
period shall be the number of trailer locations actually served
during such time and the Superintendent of the City's Waterworks,
or anyone so designated by the Board of Aldermen, shall determine
how many such units are served, and such determination shall be
final and binding upon the owner of the trailer court, subject only to
review by the Board of Aldermen upon request duly filed.

b. Minimum where it is anticipated monthly bill for water and
sewer service will be between $50.00 and $100.00: $100.00.
The water use deposits shall be returnable to the
depositee upon discontinuance of the use of City water,
or upon sale or lease of the multiple-unit dwelling,
business or trailer deposit. Return of the deposit shall
be made upon application to the Utility Clerk for same
and from the amount on deposit there shall be deducted
any unpaid charges for water service provided by the
City.
5. The owners or general holders of interest of any such multiple-unit
residences, mobile home courts or business buildings as set out in
Subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this Section, where there are not
individual water meters for such user, shall receive each month
water bills figured on a pro rata basis with a minimum rate, for all
water users in their buildings or mobile home courts. The owners
or general interest holders of the property are responsible for the
payment of each and all such bills subject to their having their
water service discontinued as set out in Section 700.070 of this
Chapter for the non-payment of all or any one bill. The City shall
not be responsible for any damages to the owners, interest holders,
tenants or lessees caused by the disconnection of any water service
under the provisions of this Chapter.

be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors
shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
10. Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that
the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements
of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the
receiving waters.
A. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances
or possess the characteristics enumerated in Sections 705.210 through
705.240 of this Chapter and which in the judgment of the

processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
1. Reject the wastes;
2. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
3. Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
4. Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the
provisions of Subsection (B) of this Section;
5. Terminate all utility services as provided in Section 700.070.
B. If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent, and subject
to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.

Section 705.270. Maintenance Requirements for Preliminary
Treatment Facilities. [Code 1985, §110.490; CC 1990 §20-93]
Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for
any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his/her expense.
Section 705.280. Control Manhole. [Code 1985, §110.500; CC 1990
§20-94]
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in
the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of
the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his/her
expense and shall be maintained by him/her so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
Section 705.290. Standards for Analyses — Sampling Techniques.
[Code 1985, §110.510; CC 1990 §20-95]
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water and
wastes to which reference is made in this Article shall be determined
in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater" published by the American Public
Health Association and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. If no
special manhole has been required, the control shall be considered to be the
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage
works and to determine the existence of hazards of life, limb and property.
The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24)
hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a
grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD
and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour
composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab
samples.
