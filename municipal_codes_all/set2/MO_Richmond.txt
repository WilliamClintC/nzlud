Section 135.160. Definitions.
[CC 1974 §2-301; Ord. No. 1209 §2, 3-21-1984]
The term "professional services" shall mean those services within scope of practice of
architecture, engineering or land surveying, as defined by the laws of the State of Missouri, or
those performed by any architect, professional engineer or registered land surveyor in connection
with this professional employment or practice. The term "professional services" may also
encompass the services provided by planning consultants and other persons or firms providing
consulting services.
The term "firm" shall mean any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association or other legal
entity permitted by law to practice architecture, engineering or land surveying in the State of
Missouri or to provide professional services as described herein.
Section 135.170. Classes of Services.
[CC 1974 §2-303; Ord. No. 1209 §2, 3-21-1984]
Projects will normally be divided into two (2) classes as follows:
Class A. Services for projects where fees will exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). Two
(2) members of the City Council appointed by the Mayor, the City Administrator and the
department head having responsibility for the project will act as the screening and selection
committee.
Class B. Services for projects where fees will not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00).
The firm will be selected by a staff committee who will recommend the firm and appropriate
contract to the City Council for their approval.
It may be necessary on some projects to appoint persons to the selection committee
from outside City Government who are experts in a particular field and who are
disinterested parties in the project at hand. If a project involves a department advised
by a citizen commission, it may be desirable to include a representative from that
commission on the selection committee. The Mayor may appoint these persons to
either class of committee at the request of the City Administrator.
Section 135.180. General Procedures and Responsibilities.
[CC 1974 §2-304; Ord. No. 1209 §2, 3-21-1984]
Project Initiation. When a department of the City identifies a project for which professional services
will be necessary, the department will draft a scope of services for the specific project. This scope
of services will be submitted to the City Administrator for authorization to initiate the project and a
determination as to which type of screening and selection committee will be required. The scope
of services should include the following:
A description of the work required and its objectives;
The nature of the specific tasks and services to be accomplished;
The type and amount of assistance to be given by the City department involved;
Required time frame; and

Expressions Of Interest. After authorization by the City Council, the administering departments will
contact those firms on the roster and those firms responding to advertisements for a written
expression of interest in the specific project. The request should invite comment as to the special
experience in the project being considered, describe previous experience with similar projects,
and the availability of the firm to provide required service within any time limitations.
Initial Screening And Requests For Proposals. The expressions of interest will then be presented
to the appropriate screening and selection committee for initial screening. Factors to be
determined in the initial screening will include:
Specialized experience in the type of work required;
Record of the firm in accomplishing work on other projects in the required time;
Quality of work previously performed by the firm for the City;
Recent experience showing accuracy of cost estimates;
Community relations including evidence of sensitivity to citizen concerns; and
Geographic location of the office of the firm which would serve the project.
The screening committee will designate at least three (3) firms who will be requested to
present detailed proposals on the project.
Detailed Proposals. Firms submitting detailed proposals will be asked to provide the following:
A resume of the firm principal who will be responsible for the project;
A resume of the proposed project supervisor;
Resumes of key project personnel;
A statement of the ability of the firm to meet required time schedules;
A description of how the project would be conducted;
A schedule of hourly rates for various services offered and a proposed project fee range;
A list of municipal references for similar types of projects; and
Any other pertinent information the firm wishes to present.
Interview And Selection. Upon receipt of the detailed proposals, the selection and screening
committee will be convened to review the proposals, interview the prospective firms, and make the
final selections as to the firm for the project. Written interview and selection criteria utilizing a point
system that has been agreed upon by the committee shall be established prior to receiving
detailed proposals on a project. The prime factors to be rated in the final screening are the firm's:
Management capabilities;
Technical capabilities;
Approach to the project;
Understanding of City's objectives;

Proposed work schedule;

Knowledge of local situation;
Ability to communicate;
Presentation and attitude; and
Confidence factor.
Contract Negotiation. The selected firm will then be requested to come in for a final conference
with the screening and selection committee to define precisely the scope of service to be provided
and to finalize the compensation requirements for the work. A contract is prepared and submitted
to the City Counselor for review and then submitted to the City Administrator for presentation to
the Mayor and City Council for approval.
If, after reasonable effort, a contract cannot be negotiated, the negotiations with the designated
firm shall be terminated and negotiations shall be started with the next firm recommended.
Exceptions:
In view of the fact that special conditions will occasionally arise that make use of this policy
impractical, there can be exceptions made. Reasons for exceptions may include an
emergency situation which precludes a selection time frame of at least two (2) months or an
extremely specialized need in which there is only one (1) feasible source of expertise. If it
appears there is a need for an exception to the policy, the City Administrator will inform the
Mayor and City Council to allow them the opportunity to deny the exception.
If the number of firms willing and available to perform a specific task is small, the step
involving initial screening may be skipped and the selection process will go directly to detailed
proposals.
Section 135.190. Compensation or Fee.
[CC 1974 §2-305; Ord. No. 1209 §2, 3-21-1984]
This amount will include all services to be rendered to the City by the firm, with the exception of
certain pass through expenses that will be identified by contract, if applicable, and it will be
calculated by one (1) of the following methods, at the preference of the City:
Lump sum or fixed fee;
Cost per unit; or
Hourly basis with total not to exceed a fixed amount.
Section 135.200. Prohibition Against Contingent Fees.
[CC 1974 §2-306; Ord. No. 1209 §2, 3-21-1984]
Each contract entered into by the City Council for professional services shall contain a prohibition
against contingent fees as follows:

Chapter to provide for the perpetual care of the City of Richmond Memory Gardens Cemetery and
to provide security to the residents of Richmond and to the families of the person who have
already been interred upon the real estate recently purchased by the City of Richmond relating to
such cemetery. The City Council hereby deems such purposes to be a general public purpose and
further desires to provide for the security of the City of Richmond Endowed/Perpetual Care Fund
and finds that the restrictions imposed by the ordinances are reasonable, necessary, and will
serve the best interest and general welfare of all the citizens of the City of Richmond in particular,
the welfare of all residents of the area together with the families of those interred at the cemetery

lands after the period of redemption and referred to in this Article.

the City, City records containing information or entries of a personal, confidential, private or
proprietary nature, including, but not limited to, income, sales data, financial circumstances,
household and family relationships, social security numbers, dates of birth, insurance information

complying with regulations requiring the disclosure of such information, shall be excised from
copies of City records disclosed or provided to members of the public other than those persons to
whom the information of entries pertain. Persons desiring access to information or entries excised
from such records may file a supplementary written request with the City Clerk for disclosure of
material to be specified in the request, which request should state:

pertains, a reasonable time within which to comment on the requested disclosure prior to acting
further on the request. If an interested person objects to the disclosure of the requested
information, the City Clerk may conduct a hearing at which all interested parties may be heard. At
such hearing the Clerk shall consider, among such other factors as may be reasonable and
relevant:

voluntarily provided by the persons objecting to the disclosure; and
The public purposes to be served by disclosure of the requested information.
If the City Clerk determines that disclosure is legally required or would otherwise serve

publicly at an open meeting of the governmental body and entered into the minutes.
Any meeting or vote closed pursuant to Section 610.021, RSMo., shall be closed only to the extent

exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make
the non-exempt material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies provided
herein. When designating a public record the custodian shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a
separation of exempt from non-exempt information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person
requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe the material
exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat
the purpose of the exemption.

of the custodian of records without written permission of the custodian. No public governmental
body shall grant to any person or entity, whether by contract, license or otherwise, the exclusive
right to access and disseminate any public record unless the granting of such right is necessary to
facilitate coordination, with or uniformity among, industry regulators having similar authority.
The custodian of records may require persons seeking access to public records to submit such
request in writing and/or on a form designated by the custodian for such purpose. Such written
request shall be sufficiently particular to reasonably apprize the custodian of the records sought.
Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon as possible, but in no
event later than the end of the third (3rd) business day following the date the request is received
by the custodian of records. If records are requested in a certain format, the public body shall
provide the records in the requested format, if such format is available. If access to the public
record is not granted immediately, the custodian shall give a detailed explanation of the cause for
further delay and the place and earliest time and date that the record will be available for
inspection. This period for document production may exceed three (3) days for reasonable cause.
If a request for access is denied, the custodian of records shall provide, upon request, a written
statement of the grounds for such denial. Such statement shall cite the specific provision of law
under which access is denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of the
third (3rd) business day following the date that the requester for the statement is received.
Any member of a public governmental body who transmits any message relating to public
business by electronic means shall also concurrently transmit the message to either the member's
public office computer or the custodian of records in the same format. The provisions of this
Subsection shall only apply to messages sent to other members of that body so that, when
counting the sender, a majority of the body's members are copied.
Any such message received by the custodian or at the member's office computer shall be a public
record, subject, however, to the exceptions for closed records as provided by law.

be.
Section 215.030. Conspiracy.
Guilt for an offense may be based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense when a person, with
the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of an offense, agrees with another person
or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such offense.
It is no defense to a prosecution for conspiring to commit an offense that a person, who knows
that a person with whom he or she conspires to commit an offense has conspired with another
person or persons to commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other person or
persons.
If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he or she can be found guilty of only one
offense so long as such multiple offenses are the object of the same agreement.
No person may be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense unless
an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or
her or by a person with whom he or she conspired.
Exceptions.
No person shall be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy to commit an offense if,
after conspiring to commit the offense, he/she prevented the accomplishment of the
objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his/her
criminal purpose.
The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of renunciation of criminal purpose
under Subsection (E)(1).
For the purpose of time limitations on prosecutions:
A conspiracy to commit an offense is a continuing course of conduct which terminates when
the offense or offenses which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be
committed is abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he or she conspired;
If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him/her only if
he/she advises those with whom he/she has conspired of his/her abandonment or he/she
informs the law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his/her
participation in it.
A person shall not be charged, convicted or sentenced on the basis of the same course of conduct
of both the actual commission of an offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense.
Note: Under certain circumstances this offense can be a felony under state law.

procured its abandonment. The registered owner of the abandoned vehicle, vessel, or trailer shall
not be subject to the penalties provided by this Section if the vehicle, vessel, or trailer was in the
care, custody, or control of another person at the time of the violation. In such instance, the owner
shall submit such evidence in an affidavit permitted by the court setting forth the name, address,
and other pertinent information of the person who leased, rented, or otherwise had care, custody,
or control of the vehicle, vessel, or trailer at the time of the alleged violation. The affidavit
submitted pursuant to this Subsection shall be admissible in a court proceeding adjudicating the
alleged violation and shall raise a rebuttable presumption that the person identified in the affidavit
was in actual control of the vehicle, vessel, or trailer. In such case, the court has the authority to
terminate the prosecution of the summons issued to the owner and issue a summons to the
person identified in the affidavit as the operator. If the vehicle, vessel, or trailer is alleged to have
been stolen, the owner of the vehicle, vessel, or trailer shall submit proof that a police report was
filed in a timely manner indicating that the vehicle or vessel was stolen at the time of the alleged
violation.
The offense of abandoning a vehicle, vessel, or trailer is an ordinance violation.
Any person convicted pursuant to this Section shall be civilly liable for all reasonable towing,
storage, and administrative costs associated with the abandonment of the vehicle, vessel, or
trailer. Any reasonable towing, storage, and administrative costs in excess of the value of the
abandoned vehicle, vessel, or trailer that exist at the time the property is transferred pursuant to
Section 304.156, RSMo., shall remain the liability of the person convicted pursuant to this Section
so long as the towing company, as defined in Chapter 304, RSMo., provided the title owner and
lienholders, as ascertained by the Department of Revenue records, a notice within the time frame
and in the form as described in Subsection 1 of Section 304.156, RSMo.

Section 315.060. Traffic Control Signal Legend — Right Turn on
Red Light — When.
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored
lighted arrows, successively one (1) at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and
yellow shall be used except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights
shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
Green indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the
same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow,
may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
Steady yellow indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in Section 315.070, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian
shall then start to cross the roadway.
Steady red indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except as provided in paragraph
(b) of this Subsection.
The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the
intersection in obedience to a red signal, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a
right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as
directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the State Highways and
Transportation Commission with reference to an intersection involving a State highway,
and local authorities with reference to an intersection involving other highways under
their jurisdiction, may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any intersection
where safety conditions so require, said prohibition shall be effective when a sign is
erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.

the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
"WAIT" or "DON'T WALK": No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of
such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his/her crossing on the walk
signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone while the wait signal is showing.
Section 315.080. Flashing Signals.
Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal it shall
require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
Flashing red (stop signal), when a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes,
drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a
limit line when marked, or if none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to
proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
Flashing yellow (caution signal), when a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent
flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with
caution.
This Section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles
approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules as set forth in Section
335.090 of this Title.
Section 315.090. Lane Direction Control Signals.

Whenever any roadway has been divided into three (3) or more clearly marked lanes for traffic,
the following rules in addition to all other consistent herewith shall apply:
A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane and shall not be
removed from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be
made with safety.
Upon a roadway which is divided into three (3) lanes a vehicle shall not be driven in the
center lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway ahead is
clearly visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in preparation
for a left turn or where such center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to traffic moving in
the direction the vehicle is proceeding and is sign-posted to give notice of such allocation.
Upon all highways any vehicle proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic thereon
shall be driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as practicable to the right-hand
edge or curb, except as otherwise provided in Sections 304.014 to 304.026, RSMo.
Official signs may be erected by the highways and transportation commission or the highway
patrol may place temporary signs directing slow moving traffic to use a designated lane or

except when a roadway has been divided into traffic lanes, each driver shall give to the other
at least one-half (½) of the main traveled portion of the roadway whenever possible.
All vehicles in motion upon a highway having two (2) or more lanes of traffic proceeding in the
same direction shall be driven in the right-hand lane except when overtaking and passing another
vehicle or when preparing to make a proper left turn or when otherwise directed by traffic
markings, signs or signals.

Upon a one-way street.
The driver of a motor vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle upon the right only
under the foregoing conditions when such movement may be made in safety. In no
event shall such movement be made by driving off the paved or main traveled portion of
the roadway. The provisions of this Subsection shall not relieve the driver of a slowmoving
vehicle from the duty to drive as closely as practicable to the right-hand edge of
the roadway.
Except when a roadway has been divided into three (3) traffic lanes, no vehicle shall be driven to
the left side of the centerline of a highway or public road in overtaking and passing another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction unless such left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming
traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction
or any vehicle overtaken.
No vehicle shall at any time be driven to the left side of the roadway under the following
conditions:
When approaching the crest of a grade or upon a curve of the highway where the driver's
view is obstructed within such distance as to create a hazard in the event another vehicle
might approach from the opposite direction.

viaduct, tunnel or when approaching within one hundred (100) feet of or at any intersection or
railroad grade crossing.
Section 340.200. Hand and Mechanical Signals.
No person shall stop or suddenly decrease the speed of or turn a vehicle from a direct course or
move right or left upon a roadway unless and until such movement can be made with reasonable
safety and then only after the giving of an appropriate signal in the manner provided herein.
An operator or driver when stopping, or when checking the speed of the operator's vehicle, if
the movement of other vehicles may reasonably be affected by such checking of speed, shall
extend such operator's arm at an angle below horizontal so that the same may be seen in the
rear of the vehicle.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the right shall extend such operator's arm
at an angle above horizontal so that the same may be seen in front of and in the rear of the
vehicle and shall slow down and approach the intersecting highway as near as practicable to
the right side of the highway along which such operator is proceeding before turning.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the left shall extend such operator's arm
in a horizontal position so that the same may be seen in the rear of the vehicle and shall slow
down and approach the intersecting highway so that the left side of the vehicle shall be as
near as practicable to the centerline of the highway along which the operator is proceeding
before turning.
The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by a signal
light or signal device in good mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would
not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle then such signals shall be given by
such light or device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand
and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds
twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to

the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen
(14) feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles. The provisions of this
Subsection shall not apply to any trailer which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand
signals of the operator or of the signalling device upon the vehicle pulling such trailer;
provided further that the provisions of this Section as far as mechanical devices on vehicles
so constructed that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of
such vehicle as above provided shall only be applicable to new vehicles registered within this
State after the first (1st) day of January, 1954.
Section 340.210. Stopping for School Bus.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway upon meeting or overtaking from either direction any
school bus which has stopped on the highway for the purpose of receiving or discharging any
school children and whose driver has in the manner prescribed by law given the signal to stop
shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus
resumes motion, or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State Law:
Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading". Each school bus subject to the provisions of Sections
304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device
approved by the State Board of Education, which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.
Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school system which has a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted
entirely in front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels, and which is used
for the transportation of school children shall be equipped with a crossing control arm. The
crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from
the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right side of the
front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri schoolchildren
who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading
or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to
drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district has the
authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or
more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to
stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a
stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers
should proceed with caution, and in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the
school bus with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at
any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided
by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2)
lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the
road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred
(500) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder
and a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in

each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such
time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or
overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite
direction on a highway containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading
zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or controlled access highway at a point where
pedestrians are not permitted to cross the roadway.
Section 340.220. Right-of-Way at Intersection — Signs at
Intersections.
The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to a vehicle which
has entered the intersection from a different highway, provided however, there is no form of traffic
control at such intersection.
When two (2) vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on
the right. This Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from opposite
directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is attempting to or is making a left turn.
The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close
thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
The driver of a vehicle intending to make a left turn into an alley, private road or driveway shall
yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction when the making of
such left turn would create a traffic hazard.
The City may, on any section of road where construction or major maintenance operations are
being effected, fix a speed limit in such areas by posting of appropriate signs, and the operation of
a motor vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so posted shall be deemed prima facie
evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a violation of Section 340.170.
Section 340.230. Distance at Which Vehicle Must Follow.
The driver of a vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonably safe and
prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the
roadway. Vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or residence district in a
caravan or motorcade, whether or not towing other vehicles, shall be so operated, except in a funeral
procession or in a duly authorized parade, so as to allow sufficient space between each such vehicle
or combination of vehicles as to enable any other vehicle to overtake or pass such vehicles in safety.
This Section shall in no manner affect Section 304.044, RSMo., relating to distance between trucks
traveling on the highway.

of this State. Furthermore, no person shall operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the
knowledge that the owner has not maintained financial responsibility unless such person has
financial responsibility which covers the person's operation of the other's vehicle. However, no
owner shall be in violation of this Subsection if he or she fails to maintain financial responsibility on
a motor vehicle which is inoperable or being stored and not in operation.
For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall mean the financial
responsibility as required by the State of Missouri to respond in damages for liability on account of
accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said financial responsibility, arising out of
the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, in the amount of twenty-five thousand
dollars ($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1) person in any one (1) accident,
and, subject to said limit for one (1) person, in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00)
because of bodily injury to or death of two (2) or more persons in any one (1) accident, and in the
amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) because of injury to or destruction of property of
others in any one (1) accident.
Proof of financial responsibility may be shown by any of the following:
An insurance identification card issued by a motor vehicle insurer or by the Director of
Revenue of the State of Missouri for self-insurance. A motor vehicle liability insurance policy,
a motor vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the name and address of
the insurer, the name and address of the named insured, the policy number, the effective
dates of the policy and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five (5) digits
of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if the insurance policy covers five (5) or
more motor vehicles shall be satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance
identification card.
A certificate of the State Treasurer of a cash or security deposit according to Section 303.240,
RSMo.
A surety bond according to Section 303.230, RSMo.
Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the insured motor vehicle or by the
operator of the motor vehicle if the proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator
rather than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall exhibit the insurance
identification card on the demand of any Peace Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or
commercial vehicle inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident while
that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the officer's or inspector's duties.
However, no person shall be found guilty of violating this Section if the operator demonstrates to
the court that he or she met the financial responsibility requirements of Section 303.025, RSMo.,
at the time the peace officer wrote the citation.
Any person who violates any provisions of this Section shall be guilty of an ordinance violation and
shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more
than three hundred dollars ($300.00) for each and every violation.
Section 390.150. Conviction for Failure to Maintain Financial
Responsibility or Court-Ordered Supervision, Court to Forward —
Failure to Appear in Court — Procedure.
Whenever a court convicts a person of a violation of Section 303.025, RSMo., or enters an order
of court-ordered supervision, the Clerk of the court shall within ten (10) days forward a report of
the conviction or order of supervision to the Director of Revenue in a form prescribed by the
Department of Revenue. In any case where the person charged with the violation fails to appear in
court, the procedures provided in Section 302.341, RSMo., shall apply. For the purposes of this

Section, the term "court-ordered supervision" is used to indicate where a court of record may,
upon a plea or finding of guilt, defer further proceedings of a sentence, and enter an order for
supervision of the defendant, if the defendant is charged with a violation, in which case no points
shall be assessed.
The Department of Revenue shall keep records of such reports. However, reports of court-ordered
supervision shall not be released to any outside source, except the affected operator and those
entities provided for in Subsection 4 of Section 32.091, RSMo., and shall be used only to inform
the director and the courts that such operator has previously been assigned court supervision.
Section 390.160. Display of False Evidence of Insurance,
Penalty, Confiscation of False Evidence.
No person shall display evidence of insurance to a Law Enforcement Officer knowing there is no valid
liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle as required pursuant to this Article, or knowing the
evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance. If
the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator for displaying invalid
evidence of insurance, the officer shall confiscate the evidence for presentation in court. Any person
convicted of violating this Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.
Section 390.170. Alteration, Production or Sale of Invalid
Insurance Card.
No person shall alter an invalid insurance card to make it appear valid. No person knowingly shall
make, sell or otherwise make available an invalid or counterfeit insurance card. Any person who
violates this Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.

Section 400.340. Conditional Use Permits.
[Ord. No. 2470, 11-13-2018]
Purpose. The development and administration of the Zoning Regulations is based on the division
of the City into districts, within any one (1) of which the use of land and buildings and the bulk and
location of buildings or structures, as related to land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized,
however, that there are special uses which, because of unique character, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case of the impact of
those uses upon neighboring lands and upon the public need for the particular use or the
particular location.
Procedure. The consideration of a conditional use permit application shall be handled in the same
manner as a zoning amendment regarding the requirement for public hearing, notices, protests
and action by the Planning Commission and City Council.
Authorization. Conditional use may be authorized only by the City Council, provided that no
application for a conditional use shall be acted upon by the City Council until after a public
hearing is scheduled and notice posted and thereafter held by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, and its finding and recommendations are reported to the City Council.
Application. An application for conditional use shall be filed with the Community Development
Director. Such application shall proceed in the manner prescribed herein for amendments to
this Chapter.
On receipt of an application for a conditional use, the Community Development Director shall
forward copies of the application and accompanying information to affected public or
governmental agencies and the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall
request and consider reports from such public or governmental agencies before

determination. Within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the application, the Planning
Commission shall submit a report and determination to the Community Development Director,
which shall include a finding that the use will or will not be based on the following conditions
where applicable:
Minimum Requirements. A conditional use permit shall not be granted unless specific written
findings of fact directly upon the particular evidence presented support the following conclusions:
The proposed conditional use complies with all applicable provisions of these regulations,
including intensity of use regulations, yard regulations and use limitations.
The proposed conditional use at the specified location will not be detrimental to, and may
contribute to the welfare or convenience of the public.
The proposed conditional use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in
the neighborhood in which it is to be located.
The location and size of the conditional use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved
in or conducted in connection with it and the location of the site with respect to streets giving
access to it are such that the conditional use will not dominate the immediate neighborhood
so as to prevent development and use of neighboring property in accordance with the
applicable zoning district regulations. In determining whether the conditional use will so
dominate the immediate neighborhood, consideration shall be given to:
The location, nature and height of buildings, structures, walls and fences on the site, and
The nature and extent of landscaping and screening on the site.
Off-street parking and loading areas will be provided in accordance with the standards set
forth in these regulations and such areas will be screened from adjoining residential uses and
located so as to protect such residential uses from any injurious effect.
Adequate utility, drainage and other such necessary facilities have been or will be provided.
Adequate access roads or entrance and exit drives will be provided and shall be so designed
to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic congestion in public streets and alleys.
Conditions. The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the City Council may
provide such conditions and restrictions upon the construction, location, and operation of a
conditional use including time limit, provision for off-street parking and loading and other
conditions as may be deemed necessary to promote the general objectives of this Chapter and to
minimize any injury to the value of property in the neighborhood. Failure to maintain such
conditions or restrictions as may have been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of the
permit for such Conditional Use.

In exercising the above-mentioned powers, such Board may, in conformity with the provisions of
this Article, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision or

ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is
taken, in considering all appeals under this Article, the Board shall, before making any findings in
a specific case, first determine that the proposed change will not constitute a change in the District

congestion in public streets, or increase the public danger of fire and safety, or materially diminish
or impair established property values within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair
the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the City. Every change granted or denied

denying the variation.

neighborhood organization as defined in Section 32.105, RSMo., representing such person or
persons, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the City may present to the Circuit Court a
petition, duly verified setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the
grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after
the filing of the decision in the office of the Board.
Upon the presentation of such petition, the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the Board
to review such decision of the Board and shall prescribe therein the time within which a return
thereto must be made and served upon the relator's attorney, which shall not be less than ten (10)
days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of the writ shall not stay proceedings upon
the decision appealed from, but the court may, on application, on notice to the Board and on due
cause shown, grant a restraining order.
The Board shall not be required to return the original papers acted upon by it, but it shall be
sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may be called for
by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth other facts as may be pertinent and material to
show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be verified.
If, upon the hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper
disposition of the matter, it may take additional evidence or appoint a referee to take such
evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court with the findings of fact and conclusions

"R-A" Agricultural District.
Purpose. District "R-A" is intended primarily for use in areas of the City on the outer edge of
the urbanized development. More intense urban usage is usually premature in this district due
to lack of adequate utility services or transportation systems. It is likely that this district will be
changed to more intense urban zoning districts as utility services can be feasibly extended
and the undeveloped areas within existing service limits are used up or become in short
supply. Uses within this district are mostly related to farming or semi-urban functions and are
not necessarily compatible with higher density residential development.
Permitted Uses. The following uses shall be permitted in "R-A" Districts.
Pastures for grassland and livestock grazing.
Single-family dwellings.
Animal husbandry in conjunction with a single-family dwelling as per Section 405.200:
Minimum Required Acreage: thirty thousand (30,000) square feet.
The slaughter of animals, such as poultry, rabbits, or beef cattle is permitted only
where intended for consumption by the resident family or to be gifted.
Animals other than household pets shall not be kept within a residence, or within one
hundred (100) feet of a residence or within sixty (60) feet of the front property line of
the building site.
Housing or caging of animals shall be adequate and sanitary, and subject to all State
health requirements for health and sanitation. All animal food except for hay and
straw shall be stored in rodent-proof containers. Should any "R-A" property rezoned

Section 405.150. Communications Antennas And Support
Structures.
[Ord. No. 2470, 11-13-2018]
Purpose And Preemption.
Purpose. The general purpose of this Article is to regulate the placement, construction, and
modification of wireless facilities in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the
competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace within the corporate boundaries of the
City of Richmond. Specifically, this Section is intended to:
Provide for the appropriate location and development of wireless facilities to serve the
citizens and business of the City of Richmond;
Minimize adverse visual impacts of wireless facilities through the use of careful design,
siting, landscape screening, and innovating camouflaging technique that provide
predictability for nearby property owners, and others that future uses will not materially
alter such approved aesthetic protections without zoning hearing procedures and input
from interested parties;
Ensure that any new wireless facilities are located in an area compatible with the
neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible;
Ensure that regulation of wireless facilities does not have the effect of prohibiting the
provision of personal wireless services, and does not unreasonably discriminate among
functionally equivalent providers of such service; and
Enhance the ability of providers of communication services to provide such services to
the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.
Preemption. Notwithstanding any ordinance to the contrary, the procedures set forth in this
Section shall be applicable to all wireless facilities existing or installed, built or modified after
the effective date of this Section to the fullest extent permitted by law. No provision of this
Section shall apply to any circumstances in which such application shall be unlawful under
superseding Federal or State law. Furthermore, if any Section, Subsection, sentence, clause,
phrase of portion of this Article is now or in the future superseded or preempted by State or
Federal law or found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unauthorized, such provision
shall be automatically interpreted and applied as required by law.
Definitions. As used in this Section, the following terms shall have the meaning and usages
indicated:
ACCESSORY EQUIPMENT
Any equipment serving or being used in conjunction with a wireless facility.
AGL
Above ground level. Ground level shall be determined by the average elevation of the natural
ground level with a radius of fifty (50) feet from the center location of measurement.

ANTENNA
Any device used in the provision of wireless communication services that transmits and/or
receives radio waves for voice, data or video communications purposes, including, but not
limited to, television, AM/FM radio, microwave, cellular telephone and similar forms of
communications. The term shall exclude satellite earth station antennas less than (2) meters
in diameter (mounted with twelve (12) feet of the ground or building-mounted) and any
receive-only home television antennas.
CABINET
A structure for the protection and security of communications equipment associated with one
(1) or more antennas where direct access to equipment is provided from the exterior and that
has horizontal dimensions that do not exceed four (4) feet by six (6) feet, and vertical height
that does not exceed six (6) feet.
DIRECTOR
The Director of Community Development of the City or his/her designee.
DISGUISED SUPPORT STRUCTURE
Any free-standing, man-made structure designed for the support of antennae, the presence of
which is camouflaged or concealed as an appropriately-placed and designed architectural or
natural feature. Depending on the location and type of disguise used, such concealment may
require placement underground of the utilities leading to the structure. Such structures may
include but are not limited to clock towers, campaniles, observation towers, light standards,
flag poles and artificial trees. For purposes of this definition, a structure "camouflaged or
concealed as an appropriately-placed and designed architectural or natural feature" shall
meet the following additional criteria: (1) it is consistent with, contributes to, and does not
detract from the character and property values and use of the area and neighborhood in
which it is located, (2) it does not contain distorted proportions, size, or other features not
typically found on the type of structure or feature to which it is designed to replicate, (3) it
cannot be identified as an antenna support structure by a person with reasonable sensibilities
and knowledge, (4) its equipment, accessory buildings, or other aspects or attachments
relating to the disguised support structure are wholly concealed using a manner consistent
with and typically associated with the architectural or natural structure or feature being
replicated, and (5) it is of a height, design and type that would ordinarily occur at the location
and neighborhood selected. Any disguised support structure shall have as a condition of
approval, unless expressly exempted in the approval, an obligation and corresponding
covenant recorded on the property that runs with the land to the benefit of the City on behalf
of the public, prohibiting modification of the disguised support structure that eliminate or are
materially detrimental to the disguise, unless such approved by a duly authorized zoning or
conditional use approval approved in the same manner as required for an original
construction of such disguised support structure with the proposed modification. If the
applicant does not wish to have such covenant, the structure shall not qualify as a disguised
support structure, unless another mechanism is proposed and approved to ensure that the
disguise is not subsequently eliminated or materially, determinately altered.
EXISTING STRUCTURE
Any structure capable of supporting wireless facilities (other than a support structure) in full
conformance with the design and other requirements of this Article and is: (1) existing prior to
the date of all applicable permit applications seeking City authorization for installation of such
facilities thereon, and (2) not built or installed in anticipation of such specific installation or
erected as a means to evade approvals applicable to a non-existing structure.

than the lot owner may be approved for a Tower only if the leasehold area separately
meets all requirements for a separate subdivided lot, including dedicated access,
parking, setbacks, and lot size, applicable to a primary use in the district in which the use
is proposed as if it was a separate subdivided lot. No other district shall allow Towers
unless required by law. All other wireless facilities other than Towers, may be a principal
or incidental use in all districts subject to the requirements herein.
Building Codes, Safety Standards, And Zoning Compliance. To ensure the structural

additional antenna meets or exceeds all applicable structural requirements.
Maintenance. All wireless facilities and appurtenances shall be adequately
maintained and in compliance with all applicable building codes and standards. If
upon inspection it is determined that any wireless facility fails to comply with
applicable codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property,
then upon notice being provided to the owner of the wireless facility, the owner shall
have thirty (30) days to remedy any defects and bring the wireless facility into
compliance with applicable codes and standards. Failure by the owner to bring a
deficient wireless facility into compliance with applicable codes and standards shall
be cause for removal of the deficient wireless facility by the City with all cost of
removal being the owner's responsibility (and the City shall be authorized to use the
abandonment bond, if any, that may have been required pursuant to the City Code
or other authority).
Regulatory Compliance. All wireless facilities shall meet current standards and
regulations of the FAA, FCC, and any other State or Federal agency with the authority to
regulate wireless facilities. Should such standards or regulations be amended, then the
owner shall bring such devices and structure into compliance with the revised standards
or regulations within the time period mandated by the controlling agency. No approval for
any placement, construction, or modification of any wireless facility permitted by this
Section shall be granted for any applicant having an uncured violation of this Section, any

hearing by the applicant or others. The commission's written recommendations, together
with the application, staff report, any exhibits or evidence made part of the record at the
hearing, and a transcript or recording of the public hearing shall constitute the "official
record" which shall be forwarded to the City Council for its decision.

Council that is consistent with the notice given, including approval of the application,
conditional approval of the application or denial of the application. The Planning
Commission may allow amendments or recommend conditions to the application if the
effect is to allow a lesser change than that requested on the original application or to
reduce the impact of the application or to reduce the amount of land involved from that
indicated in the notices of the hearing. The Planning Commission may not, in any case,
recommend a greater amount of development, or a use failing in a different general use
category, or a larger land area than indicated in the original application and notice.
Review Criteria. In determining whether any proposed conditional use permit shall be
approved, the Planning Commission and the City Council shall consider the following
factors:
Whether the proposed use at the specified location is consistent with the policies
embodied in the adopted comprehensive plan;
Whether the proposed use is consistent with the general purpose and intent of the
applicable zoning district regulations and complies with the requirements of the
zoning ordinance;
Whether the proposed conditional use, may be materially detrimental to the public
health, safety, convenience, and welfare, or may result in the material damage or
prejudice to other property in the vicinity; and
Whether the proposed use is compatible with and preservers the character and
integrity of adjacent development and neighborhoods and includes improvements or
modifications either on-site or within the public rights-of-way to mitigate any adverse
impacts which may result from the development, such as traffic, noise, odors, visual
nuisances, or other similar adverse effects.
Decision By The City Council. Following the commission's public hearing and receipt of
the Planning Commission's official record, the City Council shall consider only the official
record and decide whether to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the conditional use
permit application. The City Council may hold its own hearing to take additional evidence
or hear additional public comment if it reasonably determines additional evidence or
comment is necessary or appropriate and shall supplement the official record accordingly
and make its decision thereon.
Additional Minimum Requirements. No conditional use permit shall be issued unless the
applicant has clearly demonstrated by substantial evidence that placement of an antenna
or support structure pursuant to permitted uses or administrative permits is not
technologically or economically feasible. The City may consider current or emerging
industry standards and practices, among other information, in determining feasibility.

In any fill areas where a parking lot is constructed, the sub-grade shall be compacted to
ninety-five percent (95%) Maximum Standard Density and compaction test shall be
submitted to the Community Development Department for verification. In parking lot
areas where fire access lanes are needed, the pavement must be constructed to support
the imposed loads of fire apparatus weighing at least seventy-five thousand (75,000)
pounds. All drives and parking areas shall have curbs (except those serving singlethrough
four-family dwellings) and all curbing shall meet the City's construction standards
(KC-APWA). All spaces shall be marked, with disabled spaces having special pavement
marking in each space per ADA guidelines. Directional entrances, loading zones, and
exit aisles shall be signed and marked on pavement.
Alternate Permanent Paving Standards.
The Community Development Department and Public Works may approve alternatives to
AC or PCC paving on private property. Alternative paving materials, when installed
according to manufacturer's specifications, shall provide a suitable, all weather, loadbearing
surface to support passenger cars and light duty trucks. Alternative paving
materials for driveways or parking lots serving large commercial vehicles or fire trucks
must be designed to accommodate a maximum vehicle weight of seventy-five thousand
(75,000) pounds. Alternative paving materials over City utility easements will not be
repaired or maintained by the City.
The City may approve such alternative paving to achieve aesthetic and environmental
objectives, such as improved appearance, increased water percolation, reduced erosion
and runoff, increased aeration and water for tree roots, and increased area available for
landscaping, upon finding that the alternative paving will provide public aesthetics or
environmental benefits, and is equal to or better than ACC or PCC paving in terms of
public safety, performance, strength, quality and durability. Examples of permanent
alternative paving surfaces, include, but are not limited to: interlocking pavers, porous AC
and PCC paving, cobblestone, or other material judged by the City to be of equivalent
performance, strength, quality and durability.
Geometries. The minimum allowable inside vehicle turning radius in parking and driveway
areas shall be twenty (20) feet unless fire apparatus access is necessary, in which case all
dimensions will follow the International Fire Code or as required by the Fire Department.
Turning radii are not necessarily the radii of curbs around all islands and other improvements.
Parking spaces which back directly onto the public street shall be set back a minimum of
twenty (20) feet from the back of the right-of-way, regardless of the zoning of the property to
prevent vehicles from parking on the right-of-way. No portion of any parking space, except
driveways for ingress and egress, shall be permitted on the right-of-way.
Walls, Walkways, Entrances And Wheel Stops. A parking space facing a wall containing
entrances and abutting a walkway to those entrances must be at least four (4) feet clear of
such a wall. A parking space facing a building wall containing entrances and abutting a
walkway to those entrances must be at least four (4) feet clear of the wall and must have
bollards no less than five (5) feet apart or other barrier approved by the Community
Development Department sufficient to prevent vehicle incursion into the walkway by a vehicle
weighing up to four thousand five hundred (4,500) pounds and traveling up to thirty (30) miles
per hour. Wheel stops or bollards may be required if the space is headed into a wall, fence,
landscaped area, building, or side of another auto in addition to curbing.
Overhangs And Encroachments. All parking spaces must be clear of overhangs and
encroachments which might interfere with vehicular access.

Maneuvering. Parking lots with more than six (6) spaces shall be designed so that vehicles
will exit onto a public street in a forward direction and with no more than two (2) maneuvers. A
maneuver is defined as each motion in either a forward or backward direction. No space will
be allowed that requires a vehicle to maneuver onto the public sidewalk in order to exit. All
spaces must be designed to enter in one (1) maneuver. A turnaround may be required if it is
considered unsafe for a vehicle to back into the street. Commercial and industrial parking lots
serving loading zones shall be designed to accommodate access and circulation movements
for on-site truck circulation. The City may require wider driveways and aisles as determined
and warranted.

than five percent (5%) in the direction of drainage. A maximum of ten percent (10%) slope in
aisles and turning areas may be allowed. Any drainage swale of less than one percent (1%)
slope shall be concrete.
Loading Zones. Off-street loading zones shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet wide and
twenty-five (25) feet long. Loading zones shall be designed so that trucks parking in them will
not encroach onto the public right-of-way or required parking spaces or driveways. Loading
spaces designed for large trucks shall have appropriately larger access to allow for
maneuvering without encroaching into landscape areas. Loading zones or areas shall not
encroach into fire lanes.

the same property shall be removed, landscaped and the curb, gutter and sidewalk properly
restored.
Improved parking areas and drives shall be designed with approved drainage facilities
according to City construction standards (KC-APWA).
Parking Lot Maintenance. It shall be the duty of the property owner to maintain and repair the
parking lot and driveway improvements in accordance with the standards to which they were
designed. Such parking areas shall be replaced or resurfaced should they become cracked,
broken, or deteriorated to the extent it creates a nuisance.
Common Access Driveways. Common access driveways may be permitted in new
subdivisions where a common driveway is proposed as part of the subdivision approval. The
driveway must meet all applicable codes for the location of the drive and it must be
determined that there is no significant potential for conflict between the parties sharing the
driveway because of its location, length, grade, usage, or other characteristics.
For Residential Use. Before granting any permit authorizing the construction of a common
access driveway or structures to be served by said driveway, the City shall require an
easement to be filed with the County recorder setting forth driveway usage rights and
responsibilities for each parcel served. At minimum, the required easement shall include the
following statements:
All affected property owners will be jointly responsible for the improvement and
maintenance of all parts of the common access driveway.
All parking on the commonly used portions of the driveway is prohibited.
If the easement is abandoned or dissolved, each lot previously served by the common
access driveway shall be provided with standard access as required by these
regulations.

Section 410.010. Scope And Purpose.
[Ord. No. 2470, 11-13-2018[1]]
Scope Of Ordinance. This Chapter prescribes the procedures for the subdivision of land within the
corporate area of Richmond and any other area of Ray County made subject thereto under the
provisions of Sections 64.510 through 64.690, RSMo., and comprises the requirements, standards
and specifications with respect to:
The proper location and width of streets, building lines, open spaces, recreational areas and
public lands.
The avoidance of conditions which would lead to the creation of blighted areas.
The avoidance of overcrowding of population and congestion of vehicular traffic.
The manner and extent to which streets are to be graded and improved, and the extent to
which water, sewer, storm, water and other utility services are to be provided.
The provision of adequate open space for traffic movement, utility facilities, access of
emergency apparatus, for the control of the number, spacing, type and design of access
points to existing or future streets for minimum width and area of lots for light and air, and for
a proper distribution of population.
Interpretation. This Chapter is intended to set minimum requirements to provide for the
coordinated, efficient and economic development of the City, to insure the adequacy of street and
utility facilities, and to promote the public health, safety and welfare. If any other provision of law
relates to any matter covered herein, the regulation providing the higher standard shall apply.
Application Of Regulations. No lot in a subdivision, as defined herein, may be conveyed unless a
final plat of the property has been approved according to the requirements and provisions of this
Chapter. This is supplemental to and not in derogation of the Revised Statutes of Missouri. Any
plat of a subdivision of land in the corporate areas of the City which has not been recorded in the
office of the Recorder of Deeds and which has not been accepted and approved, as herein
provided, shall not be considered as a plat of any lawful subdivision. All plats shall be recorded in
the plat book of Ray County, Missouri, according to requirements contained in Section 89.440,
RSMo.
Suitability Of Land For Subdivision Development. Land unsuitable for subdivision development
due to poor drainage, flooding, steep slope, extensive rock formation, lack of sanitary facilities or
any other conditions and prima facie constituting a danger to health, life or property shall not be
approved for subdivision development unless the subdivider presents evidence or data
satisfactory to the Commission establishing that the methods proposed to meet any such condition
are adequate to avoid any danger to health, life or property.

Section 410.040. Minimum Standards Of Design.
[Ord. No. 2470, 11-13-2018]
No preliminary subdivision plat shall be approved unless it conforms to the following minimum
standards of design:
Streets.
Relation To Adjoining Streets. The arrangement of rights-of-way in a subdivision shall
provide for the continuation of the existing streets or rights-of-way in adjoining areas,
unless the Commission deems such continuation undesirable for reasons of topography
or design. Where subdivision streets or rights-of-way are continuations or extensions of
existing streets or rights-of-way, the width thereof, where practical, shall be at the same
or greater width or width sufficient to adequately serve the subdivision of the existing
street or right-of-way, except that in no case shall the street or right-of-way in the
subdivision be of less width than hereinafter provided in Subsection (A)(1)(c).
Projection Of Streets. Where, in the opinion of the Commission, it is desirable to provide
future street access to adjoining areas, the streets and rights-of-way in the subdivision
shall be extended by the provision of a right-of-way for street purposes from the end of
the pavement to the property line of the subdivision. If deemed necessary by the
Commission, any such dead-end street shall be provided with a temporary turnaround or
"Y" intersection. The street arrangements shall not be such as to cause hardship to
owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing convenient access to
it. However, except to avoid land locking property, nothing herein shall be construed to
require that private streets in one (1) subdivision shall provide access to adjacent lands.
Classification Of Streets And Widths Of Rights-Of-Way.

All streets shall be classified as either highway, thoroughfare, collector, minor,
parkway or marginal access (service) in accordance with their use and function, the
standards of public safety, and topographic conditions. The classification of each
street designated on a plat shall be reviewed by the Commission and revised as
necessary to conform to the standards of these regulations.
Streets shall have the following rights-of-way:
Street Type and Purpose Right-of-Way Minimum Width
Major, primary street 100 feet
Major, secondary street 80 feet

Minor streets 50 feet
Parkways Variable — 120 feet upwards
Marginal access streets (service roads) 50 feet
Alleys 20 feet
Pedestrian Way (sidewalks) 10 feet
Subdivision adjacent to existing deficient streets or roads shall provide additional
right-of-way to meet the minimum width requirements set forth.
A subdivision located on only one (1) side of an existing street or County road shall
provide one-half (1/2) of the required right-of-way width, measured from the
centerline of the existing roadway.
Intersections.
Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles.
Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least twenty-five (25) feet.
When the smallest angle of street intersections is less than sixty degrees (60°), the
Commission shall require curb radii of greater length.
Curves And Grade Changes In Streets — Horizontal.
A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be introduced between
reversed curves on major and collector streets.
Where there is a deflection angle of more than ten degrees (10°) in the alignment of
a street, not including intersection with any street, a curve with a radius adequate to
insure safe sight distance shall be made. The minimum radii of curves shall be:
Street Types Minimum Curve Radius
Major and parks 350 feet
Collector 250 feet
Minor 100 feet
Street Grades And Elevations.
No street grade shall be in excess of:
Major and parkways, seven percent (7%);
Collector, ten percent (10%);

conditions.
All curbing (or street ditching where permitted) shall be designed to provide for
surface water drainage from the surrounding area, buildings and pavement. The
minimum grade shall be not less than one-half of one percent (0.5%).
The Commission shall not approve streets which will be subject to frequent or
repeated inundation or flooding.
Marginal Access Streets (Service Roads). Where the subdivision abuts on or contains an
existing or proposed major street, the Commission may require marginal access streets
to be provided to avoid lot frontage on major streets.
Street Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred (100) feet are
prohibited.
Cul-De-Sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall be no longer than six hundred (600) feet (unless
topography indicates a need for a greater length) and shall terminate in a circular open
space having a radius at the outside of the pavement of at least fifty (50) feet and a
diameter at the outside of the right-of-way of at least one hundred ten (110) feet.
Street Names.
Proposed streets which are continuations of, or in alignment with, existing named
streets shall bear the names of such existing streets, unless otherwise approved by
the Commission.
The name of a proposed street which is not in alignment with an existing street shall
not duplicate the name of any existing or platted street.
All names of streets proposed by the subdivider shall be approved or disapproved by
the Commission in accordance with this Chapter.
Alleys. Alleys may be provided to give access to the rear of all lots used for commercial
and industrial purposes. Alleys shall not be provided in residential subdivisions.
Streets in relation to railroads, expressways, freeways and parkways. When the area to be
subdivided adjoins or contains, for a considerable distance, a railroad right-of-way, an
expressway or freeway, a street shall be provided approximately parallel to the side of such
right-of-way. In determining the distance of such parallel street from the right-of-way,
consideration shall be given to the distance required for approach grades to future grade
separations.
Blocks.
Length. Blocks lengths may not exceed one thousand four hundred (1,400) feet nor less
than four hundred (400) feet unless topographic conditions justify a departure from this
maximum.
Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two (2) tiers of lots of minimum lot depth.
The Commission may approve double frontage lots which would otherwise front on a
major street or where topographic or other tract conditions prevent single frontage
design. Where double frontage lots are permitted, a twenty-foot landscaped buffer shall
be provided and access from the rear street prohibited.

Pedestrian Way. Pedestrian ways may be required across blocks which exceed nine
hundred (900) feet in length, to connect dead-end streets, or to provide access to parks,
schools, shopping areas or similar facilities. If a pedestrian way is required, a ten-foot
right-of-way shall be set aside with a four-foot pavement, and at a grade no steeper than
fifteen percent (15%) or as required by current A.D.A. regulations, unless steps of
adequate design are provided.
Lots.
Frontage — Minimum Width. Shall be as set out in the zoning ordinance. (Said width
shall be measured at the building setback, and must be adjacent to a dedicated public
street.)
Minimum Lot Depth. As set out by Zoning. (Said measurement shall be made through the
center of the lot and shall be perpendicular to the property line or radial to the property
line on curved streets.)
Front Building On Setback Lines. Shall be shown on the final plat for all lots in the
subdivision and shall not be less than the setbacks required by the zoning regulations or
any other regulations adopted by the governing body.
Lot Access. Every lot shall abut on a street other than an alley.
Arrangement. Each lot shall be free from flooding. No lot shall be impractical of
improvement due to steepness of terrain, dangerous soil conditions or other adverse
natural physical conditions. Side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and radial
to curved street lines, unless deemed impracticable.
Dimensions.
The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be designed to provide desirable
building sites, properly related to topography, natural features, streets and land uses.
Residential lots not served by a sewage disposal system shall have a lot area of not
less than that required by the Ray County Health Department and shall comply with
all State of Missouri regulations with regard to private sewage disposal systems.
Residential lots served by a sewage disposal system shall have a lot area of not less
than eight thousand (8,000) square feet and a minimum depth of one hundred ten
(110) feet.
Remnants of land, containing less area than herein required and not designated and
accepted for utility or public purposes, shall not be permitted.
Where property is proposed for development for commercial uses, the subdivider
should design a layout providing for an overall or unified development and, wherever
possible, avoid the platting of individual lots for each business establishment.
When property is to be developed for industrial uses, consideration will be given to a
flexible lot, street and utility arrangement in order to allow for the needs of particular
industries.
Utility And Drainage Easements.
Except where alleys are permitted, there shall be utility easements at least twelve (12)
feet in width along rear lot lines. Where deemed appropriate, utility easements shall be
provided along the side lot line or across lots.

Drainage Easements. If a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way or
channel, then a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way shall be provided. Such
easement or right-of-way shall conform substantially to the lines of such watercourse and
shall be of such width or construction, or both, as may be necessary to provide adequate
storm water drainage and for access for maintenance thereof. The minimum width for
drainage easements shall be not less than fifteen (15) feet for closed conduits and twenty
(20) feet for open channels and shall in any case provide for conveyance of a fifty-year
storm flow with additional width of not less than ten (10) feet for construction and
maintenance. No other utilities shall be placed within six (6) feet of either side of the
centerline of the pipe in a drainage easement that contains an enclosed conduit. No
additional amount of overburden may be placed on a drainage easement which would
increase the depth of the storm pipe from the originally approved design elevations

developed land within the City. Proper management of storm water runoff will minimize damage to
public and private property, ensure a functional drainage system, reduce the effects of
development on land and stream channel erosion, assist on the attainment and maintenance of
water quality standards, enhance the local government associated with the drainage system,
reduce local flooding, maintain as nearly as possible the pre-developed runoff characteristics of
the area and facilitate economic development while mitigating associated flooding and drainage
impacts.
The application of this Chapter and the provisions expressed herein shall be the minimum storm
water management requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other
powers granted by State Statute. In addition, if site characteristics indicate that complying with
these minimum requirements will not provide adequate designs or protection for local property or
residents, it is the designer's responsibility to exceed the minimum requirements as necessary.
Should the requirement contained in this Chapter and guide not be followed, then APWA
(American Public Works Association) Section 5600 Development Criteria for storm drainage
systems and facilities shall apply. The Community Development Director shall be responsible for
the coordination and enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter.
If at some time in the future NPDES storm water regulations are applied to Richmond, then future
development will be required to meet the criteria required by NPDES storm water regulations and
those requirements shall be incorporated into this Chapter.

Install storm water management facilities to limit the two-year and ten-year developed
peak discharge rates. The design of these facilities shall be based on procedures
contained in the Storm Water Management Design Guide or procedures approved by the
Director of Public Works. At a minimum, enclosed systems must incorporate the APWA
5,600 requirement to convey the ten-year event (larger as appropriate for street/roadway
crossings) and all new drainage systems must prove either in-pipe, in-channel, or at least
an adequate overload flow patch for the one-hundred-year event that does not encroach
on existing structures or must be at least fifty (50) feet setback from any proposed
structures. The two-year and ten-year design storms cover the range of normal flooding.
Structures must be analyzed for both. The twenty-five-, fifty- or one-hundred-year storm
events shall be used for structures under local, State and Federal roadways respectively.
There shall be a minimum setback of fifty (50) feet from the defined one-hundred-year
flow-path for all new construction.
The requirements or portions thereof of Subsections (A)(1)(a) and (b) above may be
waived by the City Council if it can be shown by the detailed engineering calculations and
analysis which are acceptable to the City that one (1) of the following exists:
The installation of storm water management facilities would have insignificant effects
on reducing downstream flood peaks;
Storm water management facilities are not needed to protect downstream
developments and the downstream drainage system has sufficient capacity to
receive any increase in runoff for the design storm;
It is not necessary to install storm water management facilities to control developed
peak discharge rates at the exit to a proposed development and installing such
facilities would increase flood peaks at some downstream locations; or
The Community Development Department determines that storm water management
facilities are not needed to control developed peak discharge rates and installing
such facilities would not be in the best interest of the City.
The requirements or portions thereof of Subsection (A)(1)(a) above may not be waived if
the City determines that not controlling downstream flood peaks would increase known
flooding problems or exceed the capacity of the downstream drainage system.
A waiver shall only be granted after a written request is submitted to the City
Administrator through the Community Development Department by the applicant
containing descriptions, drawings and any other information that is necessary to evaluate
the proposed land disturbing activity. A separate written waiver request shall be required
if there are subsequent additions, extensions or modifications which would alter the
approved storm water runoff characteristics to a land disturbing activity receiving a
waiver. The City will conduct a review of the request for a waiver.
Discharge velocities shall be reduced to provide a non-erosive velocity flow from a
structure, channel or other control measure or the velocity of the ten-year design storm
runoff in the receiving waterway prior to the land disturbing activity, whichever is greater.
For all storm water management facilities, a hydrologic-hydraulic study shall be done showing
how the drainage system will function with and without the proposed facilities. For such
studies, the following land use conditions shall be used. Existing land use data shall be taken

Section 412.110. Storm Water Management Facilities.
[Ord. No. 2470, 11-13-2018]
Storm water management facilities may include both structural and non-structural elements.
Natural swales and other natural runoff conduits shall be retained where practicable.
When additional storm water management facilities are required to satisfy the minimum control
requirements, the following measures are examples of what may be used:
Storm water detention structures (dry basins);
Storm water retention structures (wet ponds, minimum depth six (6) feet);
Facilities designed to encourage overland flow, slow velocities of flow and flow through buffer
zones; and
Infiltration practices.
Where detention and retention structures are used, designs which consolidate these facilities into
a limited number of large structures will be preferred over designs which utilize a large number of
small structures.
Storm water management plans may be rejected by the City if they incorporate structures and
facilities that will demand considerable maintenance will be difficult to maintain or utilize numerous
small structures if other alternatives are physically possible.
The drainage system and all storm water management structures within the City (including both
public and private portions) will be designed to the same engineering and technical criteria and
standards. The City's review will be the same whether the portion of the drainage system will be
under public or private control or ownership.
All storm water management measures shall be designed in accordance with the design criteria
contained in the Storm Water Management Design Guide using procedures contained in this
manual or procedures approved by the City.

where the proposed development represents less than ten percent (10%) of the total
watershed.
All storm water management facilities and all major potions of the conveyance system
through the proposed development (i.e., channels, culverts) shall be analyzed using the
design and one-hundred-year storms for design conditions and operating conditions which
can reasonably be expected during the life of the facility. The results of the analysis shall be
included in the hydrologic-hydraulic study.
If the storm water management plan and/or design report indicates that there may be a
drainage or flooding problem at the exit to the proposed development or at any location
between the exit point and the ten percent (10%) downstream point, the Director of
Community Development may require:
Water surface profiles plotted for the conditions of pre- and post-development for the
one-hundred-year design storm; and
Elevations of all structures potentially damaged by the ten-year and/or one-hundred-year
flows.
All storm water management plans submitted for approval shall contain certification by the

Section 412.130. Plan Hydrologic Criteria.
[Ord. No. 2470, 11-13-2018]
The hydrologic criteria to be used for the storm water concept and storm water management plans
shall be as follows:
Twenty-five-year design storm for all cross-drain culverts and drainage designs.
Ten-year design storm for all interior culverts and drainage designs.
Two-year and ten-year design storms for all detention and retention basins using procedures
contained in the Storm Water Management Design Guide or approved by the Community
Development Director.
All drainage designs and systems shall be checked using the one-hundred-year storm for
analysis of local flooding and possible flood hazards to adjacent structures and/or property.
This check shall include completion of flow calculations for the one-hundred-year extent for all
drainage systems. The plan shall include a narrative description of how the one-hundred-year
flows are to be conveyed. If not included, then the one-hundred-year overflow amount, depth
velocity and flow width must be calculated and shown on the plans.
All hydrologic analysis will be based on land use conditions specified in Section 412.100.
For the design of storage facilities, a secondary outlet device or emergency spillway shall be
provided to discharge the excess runoff in such a way that no danger of loss of life or facility
failure is created. The size of the outlet device or emergency spillway shall be designed to
pass the one-hundred-year storm as a minimum requirement.
Section 412.140. Plan Water Quality Criteria.
[Ord. No. 2470, 11-13-2018]
Following are the criteria related to using storm water management facilities for water quality
purposes:
Ponds, Lakes And Reservoirs.
When the land disturbing activity consists of the construction of a pond, lake or reservoir
which is singly built and not part of a permitted land disturbing activity, the following
procedures will apply:
A storm water management plan will not be required if the pond, lake or reservoir is
permitted under the State Dams and Reservoirs Safety Act or has received a
Certificate of Exemption from the State Dams and Reservoirs Safety Act. Best
management practices should be used to minimize the impact of erosion and
sediment.

A storm water management plan will be required for the construction of all ponds,
lakes or reservoir not meeting the conditions in Subsection (A)(1)(a)(1) above that
otherwise meet the size requirement for storm water management plan approval.
When ponds are used for water quality protection, the ponds shall be designed as both
quantity and quality control structures. Sediment storage volume shall be calculated
considering the clean out and maintenance schedules specified by the designer during
the land disturbing activity. Sediment storage volumes may be predicted by the Universal
Soil Loss Equation or other methods acceptable to the Community Development Director.
Storm water runoff and drainage to a single outlet from land disturbing activities which
disturb ten (10) acres or more shall be controlled during the land disturbing activity by a
sediment basin where sufficient space and other factors allow these controls to be used
until inspection. The sediment basin shall be designed and constructed to accommodate
the anticipated sediment loading from the land disturbing activity and meet a removal
efficiency of eighty percent (80%) suspended solids or five-tenths (0.5) ML/L peak set
table solids concentration, whichever is less. The outfall device or system design shall
take into account the total drainage area flowing through the disturbed area draining to
the basin.
Other practices may be acceptable to the City if they achieve an equivalent removal
efficiency of eighty percent (80%) for suspended solids or five-tenths (0.5) ML/L peak set
table solids concentration, whichever is less. The efficiency shall be calculated for
disturbed conditions for the ten-year twenty-four-hour design storm event.
Permanent water quality ponds having a permanent pool shall be designed to store and
release the first one-half (1/2) inch of runoff from the site over a twenty-four-hour period.
The storage volume shall be designed to accommodate at least one-half (1/2) inch of
runoff from the entire site.
Permanent water quality ponds, not having a permanent pool, shall be designed to
release the first inch of runoff from the site over a twenty-four-hour period.
The use of measures other than ponds to achieve water quality improvement are
recommended on sites containing less than ten (10) disturbed acres.
Infiltration Practices.
Permanent infiltration practices, when used, shall be designed to accept, at a minimum,
the first inch of runoff from all impervious areas.
Area drainage to infiltration practices must be established and vegetative filters
established prior to runoff entering the system. Infiltration practices shall not be used if a
suspended solids filter system does not accompany the practice. If vegetation is the
intended filter, there shall be at least a twenty (20) feet width of vegetative filter prior to
storm water runoff entering the infiltration practice.
The bottom of the infiltration practice shall be at least two (2) feet above the seasonal
high water table, whether perched or regional, determined by direct piezometer
measurements which can be demonstrated to be representative of the maximum height
of the water table on an annual basis during years of normal precipitation or by the depth
in the soil at which mottling first occurs.
The infiltration practice shall be designed to completely drain off water within seventy-two
(72) hours.
Soils must have adequate permeability to allow water to infiltrate. Infiltration practices are
limited to soils having an infiltration rate of at least thirty-hundredths (0.30) inches per

hour. Initial consideration will be based on a review of the appropriate soil survey, and the
survey may serve as a basis for rejection. On-site soil borings and textural classifications
must be accomplished to verify the actual site and seals on high water table conditions
when infiltration is to be utilized.
Infiltration practice greater than three (3) feet deep shall be located at least ten (10) feet
from basement walls.
Infiltration practices designed to handle runoff from impervious parking areas shall be a
minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet from any public or private water supply wall.
The design of infiltration practice shall provide an overflow system with measures to
provide a non-erosive velocity of flow along its length and at the outfall.
The slope of the bottom of the infiltration practice shall not exceed five percent (5%).
Also, the practice shall not be installed in fill material, as piping along the fill/natural
ground interface may cause slope failure.
An infiltration practice shall not be installed on or atop a slope whose natural angle of
incline exceeds twenty percent (20%).
Clean outs will be provided, at a minimum, every one hundred (100) feet along the
infiltration practice to allow for access and maintenance.
Section 412.150. Professional Registration Requirements.

Purposes.
[Ord. No. 1654 Art. 1, 3-10-1999; Ord. No. 2249 §I, 5-8-2012]
Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section 77.260, RSMo.,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to protect
the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City Council of the City of
Richmond, Missouri, ordains as follows:
Findings Of Fact.
Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of Richmond,
Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public

expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
General causes of flood losses. These flood losses are caused by:
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in
flood heights and velocities; and
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others,
inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of
this Chapter uses a standards engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist
of a series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur
on the particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which
could be expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one (1) year
as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for
Ray County dated June 19, 2012, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering
analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the
regulatory flood.
Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights
more than one (1) foot at any point.
Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted
that would cause any increase in flood height.
Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but
still subject to inundation by the base flood.
Statement Of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section 415.010(B)(1); to establish or
maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the
requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding or
cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.

promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and
as specifically noted in Section 415.040.
Compliance. No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall
be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this Chapter and other applicable regulations.
Abrogation And Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate or
impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this Chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this Chapter are hereby repealed to the extent to the inconsistency only.
Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to
be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body, and shall
not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State Statutes.
Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside unnumbered A Zones or land uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This Chapter shall not
create a liability on the part of the City of Richmond, any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damage that may result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
Severability. If any Section, clause, provision or portion of this Chapter is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter shall
not be affected thereby.

General Standards.
No permit for floodplain development shall be granted for new construction, substantial
improvements and other improvements, including the placement of manufactured homes,
within any numbered or unnumbered A Zones and AE Zones, unless the conditions of this
Section are satisfied.
All areas identified as unnumbered A Zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation of the 100-
year flood; however, the base flood elevation is not provided. Development within
unnumbered A Zones is subject to all provisions of this Chapter. If Flood Insurance Study
data is not available, the community shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State or other sources.
Until a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, including fill, shall be permitted within any numbered A Zone or AE Zone on the
FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the
community.
All new construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvements, prefabricated
buildings, placement of manufactured homes, and other developments shall require:
Design of adequate anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy;
Construction with materials resistant to flood damage;
Utilization of methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning equipment and other service
facilities be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding;

The storage or processing of materials within the special flood hazard area that are in
time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive or could be injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by
floods, if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if readily removable from the area within
the time available after a flood warning.
Accessory structures. Structures used solely for parking and limited storage purposes, not
attached to any other structure on the site, of limited investment value and not larger than four
hundred (400) square feet may be constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed provided there
is no human habitation or occupancy of the structure; the structure is of single-wall design; a
variance has been granted from the standard floodplain management requirements of this
Chapter; and a floodplain development permit has been issued.
Specific Standards. In all areas as numbered and unnumbered A Zones and AE Zones, where
base flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in Subsection (A)(2) above, the
following provisions are required:
Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential
structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to one (1) foot above base flood level. [In all unnumbered and numbered A Zones
and AE Zones, the FEMA, Region VII office recommends elevating to one (1) foot above the
base flood elevation to accommodate floodway conditions when the floodplain is fully
developed.]
Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial or other non-residential structure, including manufactured homes, shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood level
or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base
flood level the structure is water-tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall certify that the standards of this Subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in Section 415.030(C)(7). [The FEMA,
Region VII office recommends elevating to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation to
qualify for flood insurance rates based upon floodproofing.]
Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas
below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area
other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings
may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided
that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
Manufactured Homes.
All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and numbered A Zones and AE
Zones on the community's FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices
that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must
be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of

anchors.
Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered or
numbered A Zones and AE Zones on the community's FIRM on sites:
Outside of manufactured home park or subdivision;
In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home
has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood,
be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured
home is elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation and be securely
attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement
Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A
Zones and AE Zones on the community's FIRM, that are not subject to the provisions of
Section 415.040(C)(2) of this Chapter, be elevated so that either:
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at one (1) foot above the base flood level;
or
The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation
elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in
height above grade and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
[In all unnumbered and numbered A Zones and AE Zones, the FEMA, Region
VII office recommends elevating to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation
to accommodate floodway conditions when the floodplain is fully developed.]
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 415.020(A) are
areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall
apply:
The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the
area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base
flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any
point.
The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
If Section 415.040(D)(2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall

applicant may apply for such floodplain development permit or variance directly to the Board
of Zoning Adjustment as defined in Subsection (A) above.
The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is
an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Community Development
Director in the enforcement or administration of this Chapter.
Further Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Zoning Adjustment or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court as provided in Section 89.110, RSMo.
Floodplain Management Variance Criteria. In passing upon such application for variances, the
Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other Sections of this Chapter, and the following criteria:
The danger to life and property due to flood damage;
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems; streets; and bridges.
Conditions For Approving Floodplain Management Variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing Subparagraphs (2)
through (6) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half
(½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or
Local Inventory of Historic Places upon determination, provided the proposed activity will not
preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
The City of Richmond shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a City Official
that:
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such
notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this
Chapter.
Conditions For Approving Variances For Accessory Structures. Any variance granted for an
accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case-by-case analysis of the
building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions, as well as
those criteria and conditions set forth in Subsections (D) and (E) of this Section. In order to
minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the

following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures that are
constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.
Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in
Zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building
components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes,
flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation must be built with flood-resistant materials in
accordance with Section 415.040(A)(4)(b) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure in accordance with Section 415.040 (A)(4)(a) of this Chapter.
Any mechanical, electrical or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood
elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a water-tight, floodproofed
enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with
Section 415.040(A)(4)(d) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening
requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year
flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in
accordance with Section 415.040(B)(3) of this Chapter.
The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway
encroachment provisions of Section 415.040(D)(2) of this Chapter. No variances may be
issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
would result during the 100-year flood.
Equipment, machinery or other contents must be protected from any flood damage.
No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be
paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures.
The City of Richmond, Missouri shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a City
Official that:
The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and
Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as
required by this Chapter.
Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community
and registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain
development permit for construction.

Any party may be represented by counsel and all parties shall have an opportunity to be
heard.
Make written findings of fact from the evidence offered at said hearing as to whether or not
the building in question is a dangerous building within the terms of Section 505.020.
If the evidence supports a finding based upon competent and substantial evidence that the
building or structure is a dangerous building, the Building Commissioner shall issue an order
based upon its findings of fact commanding the owner, occupant, mortgagee, lessee, agent or
other person(s) have an interest in said building as shown by the land records of the County
wherein the land is located to repair, vacate or demolish any building found to be a dangerous
building and to clean up the property, provided that any person so notified shall have the
privilege of either repairing or vacating and repairing said building, if such repair will comply
with the ordinances of this City or the owner or any person having an interest in said building
as shown by the land records of Ray County wherein the land is located may vacate and
demolish said dangerous building at his/her own risk to prevent the acquiring by the City of
the lien against the land where the dangerous building stands. If the evidence does not
support a finding that a building or structure is a dangerous building, no order shall be issued.
If the owner, occupant, mortgagee or lessee fails to comply with the order within thirty (30)
days, the Building Commissioner may cause such building or structure to be repaired,
vacated or demolished and the property cleaned up as the facts may warrant; and the
Building Commissioner shall certify the cost of the work borne by the City for such repair,

City's legal representation; title search fees; and all other similar or related expenses to the
City Clerk as a special assessment represented by a special tax bill against the real property
affected; said tax bill shall be a lien upon said property and shall be deemed a personal debt
against the property owner(s) unless the building or structure is demolished, secured or
repaired by a contractor pursuant to an order issued by the City and such contractor files a
mechanic's lien against the property where the dangerous building is located. The contractor
may enforce this lien as provided in Sections 429.010 to 429.360, RSMo. Except as provided
in Subsection (6) of this Section, at the requested period of not more than ten (10) years, said
assessment shall bear at the lawful rate of interest authorized to be collected by municipalities
by State Statute until fully paid.
As to damage or loss to a building or other structure caused by or arising out of any fire,
explosion or other casualty loss, if an order is issued by the Building Commissioner as
provided in Subsection (5) of this Section, and a special tax bill or assessment is issued
against the property, proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a covered claim payment
made for damage or loss to a building or other structure caused by or arising out of any fire,
explosion or other casualty loss, the following procedure is established for the repayment of
up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the insurance proceeds, as set forth in subdivisions (a) and

excess of fifty percent (50%) of the face value of the policy covering a building or other
structure:
The insurer shall withhold from the covered claim payment up to twenty-five percent
(25%) of the covered claim payment and shall pay such monies to the City to deposit into

maintain priority over any obligation under the Chapter.
The City shall release the proceeds and any interest that has accrued on such proceeds
received under subdivision (a) of this Subsection to the insured or as the terms of the
policy and endorsements thereto provide within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such
insurance monies, unless the City has instituted legal proceedings under the provisions
of Subsection (5) of this Section. If the City has proceeded under the provisions of
Subsection (5) of this Section, all monies in excess of that necessary to comply with the

of the building or structure and the lot on which it is located, less salvage value, shall be
paid to the insured.
If there are no proceeds of any insurance policy as set forth in Subsection (6) of this Section,
at the request of the taxpayer, the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not
more than ten (10) years. The tax bill from date of its issuance shall be a lien on the property
and a personal debt against the property owner(s) until paid. The same shall bear interest at
the lawful rate as provided by law as to each such installment as the same comes due.
Subsection (6) of this Section shall apply to fire, explosion or other casualty loss claims
arising on all buildings and structures.
Subsection (6) of this Section does not make the City a party to any insurance contract, and
insurer is not liable to any party for any amount in excess of the proceeds otherwise payable
under its insurance policy.
The Building Commissioner may certify in lieu of payment of all or part of the covered claim
under Subsection (6) that is has obtained satisfactory proof that the insured has removed or
will remove the debris and repair, rebuild or otherwise make the premises safe and secure. In
this event, the Building Commissioner shall issue a certificate within thirty (30) days after
receipt of proof to permit covered claim payment to the insured without the deduction
pursuant to Subsection (6) of this Section. It shall be the obligation of the insured or other
person making the claim to provide the insurance company with the written certification
provided from this Subsection.

A residential sewer customer living in an individually metered dwelling unit may, at his or her
option, during the period from September fifteenth (15th) through September thirtieth (30th) of

June, July and August based on the average amount of water used by such customer during the
preceding months of October, November, December, January and February.
Commercial businesses (for watering purposes only) may also be included in this adjustment
process.
Such averaging is unavailable to residents who were not water customers of the City during the
preceding period of October through February.

placed on such meter, valve or connection by a representative of the City is damaged or broken,
such turning on of the water or breakage or damage to such lock or device shall constitute prima
facie evidence of knowledge and intent to divert, use and receive on the part of the persons
having control of said water meter and/or possession of the premises and shall constitute prima
facie evidence of the intention on the part of such person or persons in possession of the
premises and/or in control of the water meter valve to tamper with said water meter, valve or
connection and shall bring such person prima facie within the prohibition of this Section and in

bring such owner and/or person in possession of the premises prima facie within the prohibitions
of this Section and in violation thereof.

No private fire connections shall be made on water mains of less than six (6) inches in diameter.
The City Water Department does not assume liability as an insurer of property or persons and the

The cost for water lost on any private fire connection line or any appurtenant fixtures due to leaks,
tampering, or unauthorized usage shall be the responsibility of and billed to the owner of the
premises in accordance with the City's adopted water rates based on the amount of water lost.
The amount of water lost on any private fire connection line that is unmetered where connected to
the City's water main shall be determined by the Water Department based on the number of
excess gallons pumped from the City's water plant for the time period of the leak or water loss.
The number of excess gallons shall be calculated by subtracting the total gallons of water pumped
from the City's water plant for said time period minus the historic average gallons pumped for the
time period in question that the leak or water loss was ongoing from the time detected until repairs
are completed.

control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect
the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life,
limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be
taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four
(24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.

The user charge system shall generate adequate annual revenues to pay the costs of annual
operation and maintenance including replacement and cost associated with debt retirement of
bonded capital associated with financing the water system which the City may by ordinance
designate to be paid by the user charge system. That portion of the total user charge which is
designated for operation and maintenance including replacement of the water system shall be
established by this ordinance.
That portion of the total user charge collected which is designated for the operation and
maintenance including replacement purposes as established in Article IV, shall be deposited in a
separate non-lapsing fund known as the Operation, Maintenance, and Replacement Fund and will
be kept in two (2) primary accounts as follows:
The Operation and Maintenance Account shall be an account designated for the specific
purpose of defraying operation and maintenance costs (excluding replacement) of the water
system. Deposits in the Operation and Maintenance Account shall be made daily from the
operation and maintenance revenue accumulating to an estimated eight hundred thirty-two
thousand five hundred thirty-two dollars ($832,532.00) or more annually.
The Replacement Account shall be an account designated for the purpose of ensuring
replacement needs over the useful life of the water system. Deposits in the Replacement
Account shall be made monthly from the replacement revenue in the amount of two thousand
one hundred twenty-nine dollars seventy-eight cents ($2,129.78) monthly.
Fiscal year-end balances in the Operation and Maintenance Account and the Replacement
Account shall be carried over to the same accounts in each subsequent fiscal year, and shall be
used for no other purposes than those designated for these accounts. Monies which have been
transferred from other sources to meet temporary shortages in the Operation, Maintenance, and
Replacement Fund shall be returned to their respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of
the user charge rates for operation, maintenance, and replacement. The user charge rate(s) shall
be adjusted such that the transferred monies will be returned to their respective accounts within
the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the monies were borrowed.
