PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete compilation of the ordinances of the City of Mount Clemens, Michigan of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were ordinances adopted by the Common Council or Board of Trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the disposition tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the City Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Laslie, Vice President-Supplements, and Mary Grace Tavel, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The amount of emergency loans which may be made under the provisions of Section 139(3) may not exceed the maximum amount permitted by statute, and such a loan may be made even if it causes the indebtedness of the City to exceed the limit of net bonded indebtedness fixed in this Charter. 
    The total amount of such special assessment bonds issued under Section 139(4) which are a general obligation of the City shall by reason of future issues other than issues of refunding bonds, exceed the maximum amount permitted by statute, nor shall such bonds be issued in any calendar year in excess of the maximum amount so permitted to be issued by statute unless authorized by a majority vote of the electors in the manner required by statute.

    The said pension reserves shall be financed by annual appropriations, to be made by the Commission, determined according to paragraphs A, B and C of this section. 
A.  The appropriation for members' current service shall be a per cent of their annual compensations which will produce an amount which if paid annually by the City during their future service will be sufficient to provide the reserves, at the time of their retirements, for the portions of the pensions to be paid them based upon the future service; and 
B.  The appropriation for members' accrued service shall be a per cent of their annual compensations which will produce an amount which if paid annually by the City over a period of years, to be determined by the Board, will amortize, at regular interest, the unfunded pension reserves for the accrued service portions of the pensions to which they may be entitled; and 
C.  The appropriation for pensions being paid retirants and beneficiaries shall be a per cent of the annual compensations of members which will produce an amount which if paid annually by the City over a period of years, to be determined by the Board, will amortize, at regular interest, the unfunded pension reserves for pensions being paid retirants and beneficiaries. 
D.  In the event the amounts appropriated in the budget in any year be insufficient to pay in full the amounts due in said year to all retirants and beneficiaries of the Retirement System, the amounts of such insufficiency shall thereupon be provided by the appropriating authorities of the City.

(code eff. Oct., 1958; amend. Jan., 1978) 
14.058 - Sec. 8. 
HOUSING CONDITIONS IN PROJECT AREA. 
    The project area comprises that portion of Census block 101 (Census tract 2044) in which most, if not all, of the block's housing units existed in 1970. The 1970 U.S. Census of Housing and Population reported the following characteristics in block 101: 
total population 67  percent of total population  Negro  3% percent under eighteen years  of age  2% percent sixty-two years and  over 27%  
    The 1970 Census reported the following housing characteristics in this block: 
Housing units lacking some  or all plumbing facilities 26 Other housing units 28 Total housing units 54 Renter occupied units 46 Average number of rooms/ unit 1.9 Average contract rent/month $94.00 One persons households 31  
    The Census classifies rooms in hotels and similar places as housing units only when they are occupied by permanent residents. A substantial number of rooms in the project area were therefore not covered by the Housing Census. Nevertheless, the above Census data indicates that about half of the counted housing units had inadequate plumbing, a key index to housing quality. 
    Counting all accommodations, there are now about 84 housing units in the project area, of which 59 are rooming units and 25 are dwelling units. A dwelling unit is defined as a housing unit with its own kitchen and bathroom. 
    The 84 housing units are in 3 buildings: 
John R. Murphy Hotel Parcel CD-2A 55 12 - 14 S. Gratiot Parcel CD-3  4 40 - 42 S. Gratiot 25  Total 84  
(code eff. Oct., 1958; amend. Jan., 1978) 
14.059 - Sec. 9. 
RELOCATION. 
    The relocation caseload is estimated at 6 families (2 or more persons), 68 individuals, and 13 businesses. (This caseload excludes 6 prison parolees to be relocated by the State.) 
    Characteristics of residents are as follows: 
Persons in 
Household Number of 
Households Total 
Persons 1 62 62 2  4  8 3  1  3 4  1  4 _____   Total 68 77  
    The typical current rents range from $100 to $150 per month. Eleven households are headed by females, 3 by blacks, 1 by a Mexican-American, and 10 by persons 65 years of age and over. The typical household monthly income is between $300 and $500. The majority of the households have been residents for less than 1 year, indicating a high turnover rate. Before relocation, all resident household and businesses will be individually interviewed to ascertain relocation needs. The Community Development Department is in administrative charge of relocation, including provision of information concerning private and public housing available to displaced families and individuals, and advice and assistance in their relocation. 
    Relocation payments and assistance to households and businesses will be provided and replacement dwellings will be made available to displaced persons in accordance with "relocation payments and assistance and real property acquisition under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970," Title 24, Part 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, February 20, 1975, as such regulations may be amended from time to time. Those regulations shall be maintained available for reference and inspection at the office of the Community Development Director. 
    Relocation preferences by displaced households are expected to almost entirely constitute rental housing. Housing resources for the relocation of households in the project area include 255 units of low-rent, public housing of which 147 units are for the elderly, and 108 units are for families. Additional housing resources include twenty units of existing rental housing planned to be available for Section 8 housing assistance payments. 
    There are 3,094 rental housing units in standard condition in Mount Clemens of which approximately 4% or 120 are currently vacant. This housing inventory is expected to be adequate to accommodate relocatees not otherwise accommodated in public housing.

B.  Construction of water and sewer service lines and taps; 
C.  Construction and reconstruction of walkways, curb cuts, and driveways in the public rights-of-way;

FINDINGS OF FACT. 
    The City of Mount Clemens has since 1960, been carrying out the redevelopment and revitalization of its Central Business District in accordance with the general features of the 1958 General Development Plan, the 1970 General Development Plan and the 1974 West Side Downtown Plan all prepared and adopted by the City Planning Commission pursuant to Act 285, P.A. 1931. The 1979 Mount Clemens Urban Design Phase I has been approved by the City Planning Commission as a particular project to carry out general goals and objectives of the aforementioned plans. Said Mount Clemens Urban Design Phase I, supported by detailed plans and specifications, proposes the construction of a pedestrian mall on Macomb Street and surrounding areas. Taking into account all of these reports and its own observations, the City Commission finds that: 
1)  The Macomb Street area between South Walnut Street and Pine Street; Cherry Street from New Street south through Macomb Street; and the alley lying between Walnut Street and Cherry Street from Macomb Street to New Street is a principal commercial area in the Central Business District and has significant problems of deterioration and obsolescence; 
2)  That such deterioration, if permitted to continue, will adversely affect the tax structure, health, law abiding conduct, morals and general welfare of this community and its citizens; and that it is a reasonable and proper exercise of its police powers of this city to take measures designed to correct this trend, by maintaining and improving such Central Business District so that it may retain its position as a mercantile and service center for Macomb County, and as the core of business, professional, social, religious and cultural life for this community; 
3)  The construction of the Macomb Place Mall will significantly improve the physical environment and provide strong incentives for the rehabilitation and redevelopment of private properties, in accordance with the city's powers under Act 120, P.A. 1961, and under Chapter 2 of the City Charter.

Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major thoroughfare, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets or reverse frontage with an approved screen planting contained in a private non-access easement having a minimum width of 20 feet along the rear and/or side property line; or, such other treatment as may be desirable for protection of residential properties and reduction of traffic hazards. 
D.  Where a subdivision abuts or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access thoroughfare right-of-way, the Planning Commission may recommend the location of a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the abutting land, as for park purposes in residential districts or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances should also be determined with due regard to approach grades, drainage and future grade separations. 
E.  Certain proposed streets, as indicated by the Planning Commission, shall be extended to the boundary line of the tract to provide for satisfactory future circulation within the neighborhood. In general, these extensions should not be more than 1300 feet apart. The purpose of this provision is to intercept streets approaching the tracts at right angles, and to avoid permanent dead-ends. 
F.  Proposed streets shall be arranged in relation to the existing topography so as to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient. 
G.  Except where justified by extreme topographic or other conditions, alleys will not be approved in those parts of the proposed subdivision located in single- or two-family residential districts.

B.  CURB AND GUTTER. Permanent concrete curb (integral if pavement is concrete) or separate curb and gutter (for asphalt paving) shall be installed on all streets in accordance with the adopted local standards. 
C.  SIDEWALKS. Sidewalks shall normally be required on both sides of streets for the safety of pedestrians and children at play, and shall be constructed to a width, line and grade as determined by the City engineer and in accordance with adopted local standards. Where for a considerable distance, one side abuts on a railroad, park, golf course, cemetery, or other type of use not requiring a walk and where continuity is not essential, the Planning Commission may recommend that the requirement of a walk on that side be waived. The Planning Commission shall likewise recommend the requirement for sidewalks along streets from which access to abutting property is eliminated by a non-access easement as referred to in section 3.2. 
D.  CROSSWALKS. Where recommended by the Planning Commission, crosswalks through blocks shall be constructed to a line and grade as determined by the City Engineer and in accordance with adopted local standards. Such a crosswalk shall be surfaced to its entire width and fenced on both sides with 4-foot high permanent materials. Street lights shall be located at each end for protection.

[REGULATIONS.] 
1.  PROHIBITING POLLUTANTS: It shall be unlawful for any person to cause or allow to be discharged sewage or waste of any kind directly or indirectly into the Wastewater System which does not conform to the criteria or effluent standards set forth in Appendix A. The user shall be permitted to demonstrate to the City that the effluent being received by the user contains pollutants and upon such demonstration, the user shall be accountable only for the net pollutants added to the effluent and not for the total gross pollutants contained in the effluent. The user shall not be liable for noncompliance due to an upset condition. 
The City may develop BMPs to implement pollution prohibitions and specific pollutant limitations. Local limits, specific prohibitions, and BMPs developed by the City shall be considered pretreatment standards for purposes of this Ordinance. 
2.  MEASURING METHODS: In order to ascertain whether or not the sewage or waste of any kind discharged by any person into the public sewers or Wastewater System conforms to the criteria or effluent standards established and adopted by this Ordinance the City may use any appropriate method or device which will lead to such a determination. 
All measurements, tests and analyses of wastewater, sewage and wastes of any kind shall be determined in accordance with "Standard Methods." 
3.  SAMPLING: When required by the City each person covered by this Ordinance shall provide a control manhole or any other device or facility suitable and appropriate to enable the City to conduct gauging and sampling operations to determine conformance with the criteria and effluent standards established and adopted by this Ordinance. The gauging and sampling facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area; and it shall be the responsibility of the user to obtain any necessary approvals for the location of the gauging and sampling facility from appropriate governmental agencies. The City shall have the right, during reasonable hours and, at the option of the user, accompanied by a representative of the user, to enter upon the premises of each person for the purpose of setting up measurement or sampling operations. 
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for claiming that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
For composite samples, the user shall use a flow-proportional sampling technique unless an alternative time-based or grab-based sampling technique is authorized by the City. A user seeking an alternative sampling technique shall submit a written request, and shall have the burden of demonstrating that the alternative sampling technique will be representative of the discharge. The decision whether to allow an alternative sampling technique will be at the City's discretion, and the basis for the decision will be documented in the City's file for that user. 
Grab samples shall be used for assessing compliance of oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds. For compliance reports, the user shall collect the number of grab samples necessary to properly assess its compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements except as follows: for sampling associated with a 90-day compliance report or baseline monitoring report, a minimum of four (4) daily grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds where historical sampling data do not exist. Where historical sampling data do exist, the City may authorize a lower number of samples. The user may use multiple grab samples for sampling associated with a baseline monitoring report or a 90-day compliance report provided they are collected during a 24-hour period and composited prior to analysis according to the following basis: 
(a)  Composited in the field or the laboratory for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides; 
(b)  Composited only in the laboratory for volatile organics and oil and grease; and 
(c)  Composited as authorized by the City for other parameters. 
The duly authorized employees of the Board, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter all properties accompanied by a representative of the user, at the user's option, for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with the provisions of this Article. Duly authorized employees shall have no authority to inquire into any process, including metallurgical, chemical, oil, refining, ceramic, paper or other industries, beyond that point having a direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the sewers or waterways or facilities for waste treatment. 
While performing the necessary work on private properties, authorized employees of the Board shall observe all safety, security and other company rules applicable to the premises established by the property owner or his agent, [and] such persons shall leave a portion of any sample taken from any sampling point on or adjacent to the premises with such property owner or agent. In cases of disputes arising over shared samples, the portion taken and analyzed by the representatives of the Board shall be presumed to be the valid sample. 
4.  FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS: Existing Sources subject to new Categorical Standards shall achieve compliance within three (3) years of the date the standard is promulgated, unless a shorter compliance schedule is specified in the standard. New Sources subject to Categorical Standards shall install, have in operating condition, and have started-up all pretreatment equipment required to achieve compliance before beginning to discharge; and shall meet all applicable Pretreatment Standards within the shortest feasible time, but not to exceed ninety (90) days. Where necessary and/or appropriate, the City may convert production-based National Categorical Pretreatment Standards to equivalent mass per day or concentration limits in accordance with 40 CFR, Section 403.6(c). Equivalent limits shall be deemed Pretreatment Standards with which Industrial Users will be required to comply in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards. 
5.  MODIFICATION: The Board may modify the effluent limitations applicable to indirect discharges as specified in the Federal Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled concerning consistent removal of pollutants by the Board's wastewater plant and prior approval from the Approval Authority (MDNRE or EPA) is obtained. 
6.  STATE REQUIREMENTS: State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than Federal requirements and limitations or those imposed under the Ordinance effective upon the dates compliance is required. 
7.  DILUTION PROHIBITED: Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, dilution of a waste discharge introduced into the Wastewater System by an increase in the use of process water as a continuing practice in partial or complete substitution for adequate treatment is not acceptable as a method for achieving the criteria set forth in this Ordinance or the limitations contained in the Federal Pretreatment Standards. The City may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
    Any introduction of any wastewater or industrial waste which originates outside the service area of the Board is expressly prohibited unless permission for such introduction is obtained from the City in advance.

SLUG LOADS; ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES; UPSETS; BYPASSES. 
1.  SLUG LOADS AND ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES: Each user shall provide protection from slug loads or accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances established by this Ordinance. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited material shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the City for review and shall be approved by the City before construction of the facility. Each existing user shall complete its plan and submit same to the City by a definite date, as set by the City. No user who discharges to the POTW after the aforesaid date shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge protection procedures have been approved by the City. 
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the City shall not relieve the discharger from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this Ordinance. 
Each significant industrial user will be evaluated by the City whether a plan, or other action, to control slug discharges is needed. For newly designated significant industrial users, this evaluation will be performed within one (1) year of being so designated. Each significant industrial user shall notify the City immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for slug discharges. 
Users shall notify the City immediately upon the occurrence of a "Slugload" or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by this Ordinance. Slug load notification requirements are specified in 25.092EE Sec. 6 herein. 
Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on user's premises, advising employees when to call in the event of a slug or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedure. 
2.  UPSET CONDITIONS: Industrial users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards and requirements upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until such facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards and requirements only if a user is able to demonstrate through operating logs or other relevant evidence that: an upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s); the facility was at the time of the upset being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner, and was in compliance with applicable operating and maintenance procedures; and the user provided the required notification to the City. Upset notification requirements are specified in 25.092EE Sec. 6 herein. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
3.  BYPASS: Bypass violating applicable pretreatment standards and requirements is prohibited, and the City may take enforcement action against a user for such bypass, unless: The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime (except where adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to operate during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance); and the user submitted required notices. Bypass notification requirements are specified in 25.092EE Sec. 6 herein.

APPENDIX A 
25.096 - Sec. 16. 
GENERAL. 
    No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to such users of a POTW whether or not the user is subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or any other National, State, or Local Pretreatment Standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances to any POTW: 
A.  Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flash point of less than 140°F. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than five percent (5%) nor any single reading over ten percent (10%) of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Materials which may involve a risk of a fire or explosion include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides and sulfides [and] any other substances which the Board, the State or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system. 
B.  Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities. 
C.  Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 11.0. 
D.  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard, 40 CFR 403. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(A) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 1317, and the Michigan Critical Materials Register. 
E.  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or which are otherwise sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for their maintenance and repair. This includes pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
F.  Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation process where the POTW is pursuing a reuse and reclamation program. In no case, shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guideline, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or State Criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used. 
G.  Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate the consent judgment, NPDES or State disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards. 
H.  Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
I.  Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the collection system which exceeds 65 degrees C (149 degrees F) or at a temperature which causes the influent wastewater at the POTW treatment plant to exceed 40 degrees C (104 degrees F). 
J.  Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released at a flow and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. 
K.  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established in compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations. 
L.  Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance. 
M.  Any trucked or hauled waste water except as allowed by Section 25.092NN herein.

CROSS CONNECTIONS. 
A.  CONNECTIONS. A connection with a public water supply system shall comply with all state laws, local ordinances and state and local rules, including R 325.11401 to R 325.11407 of the Michigan Administrative Code. A cross connection shall not be made, or be permitted to remain, to a public water supply system. 
B.  INSPECTIONS. The City shall develop a program for the elimination and prevention of cross connections. As part of this program, the City shall cause inspections and reinspections to be made for cross connections to the public water supply. The frequency of inspections and reinspections shall be based on potential health hazards as determined by the City, or its designated agent, to the public water supply through possible cross connections. 
C.  PROTECTIVE DEVICES. A consumer shall obtain written approval by the City of any proposed backflow prevention corrective action or protective device before use or installation. The City may require the filing of a backflow device test report, on a periodic basis established by the City, for any backflow prevention devices used by a consumer. All testing and maintenance of consumer's backflow prevention devices shall be at the consumer's own expense and be performed by a person approved by the City. That individual testing the device shall certify the results of his or her testing. Such certification may be required to be part of the backflow prevention device test reports which may be required to be filed with the City, The City shall review backflow device test reports filed with the City but may refuse to review any backflow device test report until the review fee required by the City of Mount Clemens, if any, has been paid. Reports for which a required review fee, if any, has not been paid and which have not been reviewed will be treated for purposes of this Ordinance in the same manner as a failure to file a report. Failure to file a report required by the City may be deemed evidence of a cross connection. 
D.  CROSS CONNECTION PROGRAM FEES. The City of Mount Clemens may by resolution establish fees to be charged consumers that are reasonably related to the services provided the consumer by the City of Mount Clemens in the operation of the program for the elimination and prevention of cross connections. Any such fees may be added to, and for purposes of discontinuance of service, shall be considered part of a consumer's water bill. 
E.  PROTECTION OF POTABLE WATER AND WARNING REQUIREMENTS. Any water outlet which could be used for potable or domestic purposes and which is not supplied by a public water supply system must be labeled in a conspicuous manner as "water unsafe for drinking." 
F.  PIPING IDENTIFICATION. When a secondary water source is used in addition to a public water supply system, exposed public water piping shall be identified by a blue color or tags and all other exposed piping shall be distinguished from the public water piping by a different contrasting color or tags and so maintained that the public water supply and secondary water supply pipes can be traced readily in their entirety. If such piping is so installed than it is impossible to trace it in its entirety, it will be necessary to protect the public water supply at the service connection in a manner acceptable to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.

Section 76.502 (with the exception of those transactions exempted in 47 U.S.C. 537(c)(3), as implemented by 47 C.F.R. Section 76.502(f)(3)). 
(B)  120-DAY PETITION. At least one hundred twenty (120) days before such a proposed assignment of Grantee's Franchise is scheduled to become effective, Grantee shall submit a written petition.

At the time Grantee submits the Petition for Consent, Grantee (or Grantee's proposed assignee) shall also file with the City a substantially complete (as defined below) FCC Form 394 (or successor form). As used in this subsection, the term "substantially complete" means that the City has been supplied with all information required by the request that is necessary to make a determination on the transfer request. 
(C)  CONSENT NOT UNREASONABLY WITHHELD. The City shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to such an assignment. However, in evaluating the Petition for Consent, the City may undertake, at the sole expense of Grantee's proposed assignee, a technical inspection and audit of the system to determine whether the Cable System complies with all applicable technical codes, as well as complies with, and operates within, the construction and construction-related practices set forth in this ordinance. Furthermore, the Petition for Consent shall include such financial information as the City may require in order for the City to determine whether the potential assignee has the financial ability to assume the obligations of the Grantee. The City shall determine whether the potential assignee has the ability to assume the obligations of Grantee.

Should the City undertake a technical inspection pursuant to Subparagraph C. of this section, the City shall conduct such inspection no sooner than fifteen (15) days after receiving the Petition for Consent, and the City shall receive the technical inspection and audit report at least thirty (30) days before the proposed Cable System assignment, transfer or sale is to occur. 
(E)  SUBMISSION OF SALE AGREEMENT OR SUMMARY OF OBLIGATIONS. At the time that Grantee submits its written petition, it shall also submit a copy of the completed sales agreement, or a functionally equivalent instrument, between Grantee and the proposed assignee, so that the City may discover the assumption of obligations by Grantee and the proposed assignee with respect to the Cable System. The City may request, and Grantee shall provide, additional relevant information, so long as neither the request nor the submission of such information would be expressly prohibited by law. 
(F)  AFFIDAVIT OF PROPOSED ASSIGNEE. Before an assignment is approved by the City, the proposed assignee shall execute an affidavit stating that it has read, understood and will abide by both applicable law and this ordinance. 
(G)  ASSUMPTION OF OBLIGATIONS BY NEW GRANTEE. In the event of any approved assignment, the new Grantee will assume all obligation and liabilities of the former Grantee. 
(H)  DISPOSITION OF PETITION FOR CONSENT. Consistent with both the Federal Cable Act and FCC implementing rules, the City shall have one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of a substantially complete filing of the FCC Form 394, together with all required exhibits, data and reports, to act upon Grantee's Petition for Consent. The City may either approve the Petition for Consent or, for cause, not approve the Petition for Consent. 
(I)  FAILURE TO ACT IN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY (120) DAYS. Consistent with both the Federal Cable Act and the FCC implementing rules, should the City fail to act upon Grantee's Petition for Consent within the one hundred twenty (120) day time-frame, Grantee's Petition for Consent shall be deemed granted unless the City and Grantee otherwise agree to an extension of time in order to review the data submitted on behalf of the Petition for Consent. 
(J)  RESUBMISSION OF PETITION. Should the City, for cause, not approve a Petition for Consent, then Grantee may immediately submit another Petition for Consent. In such a situation, then the one hundred twenty (120) day time-frame runs anew. In such a situation, the procedural and substantive provisions of both federal and state law must be met. 
(K)  EXCEPTION. This Section 25.407 [25.408] shall not apply to any sale, assignment or transfer to one or more purchasers, assignees or transferees controlled by, controlling or under common control with, Grantee, and Grantee shall be permitted to effect any such sale, assignment or transfer without obtaining the prior approval of the City. 
(L)  The consent on approval of the Commission to any transfer of the franchise shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the franchise. 
(M)  In an absence of extraordinary circumstances, the City will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to substantial completion of construction of proposed system. 
(N)  In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement assuming all of Grantee's responsibilities.

PAYMENT OF FRANCHISE FEE. 
(A)  For the reason that the streets to be used by the Grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the City are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the City at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to the Grantee to utilize said streets is a valuable right without which the Grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and because the City will incur costs in administering the franchise, and at the option of the Commission, the City may make available a portion of the franchise fee to further the development of public and community uses of cable TV, the Grantee shall pay to the City an amount equal to 5 percent (5%) of the Grantee's annual gross revenues. 
(B)  The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties assessed shall be paid quarterly to the City Treasurer. The Grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross revenue within the City during the period for which said quarterly payment is made, and said payment shall be made to the City not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter. 
(C)  The City shall have the right to inspect the Grantee's income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this Ordinance; provided, however, that such audit shall take place thirty-six (36) months following the close of each of the Grantee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due to the City as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following a written notice to the Grantee by the City, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. 
(D)  In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount, cost or penalty is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be charged daily from such date at the annual rate of either twelve percent (12%) or the current prime interest rate, whichever is greater.

    The City of Mount Clemens Commission has determined that the parking of motor vehicles in the front setback area of residential lots and the parking of certain types of vehicles and equipment on residential streets is detrimental to the character of residential areas in that it causes blight and the deterioration of such areas, which impairs the value of the adjoining property and is detrimental and inimical to the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the residents of the City, and to the economic welfare of the City.

Driveways up to twenty (20) feet in width are permitted on residential lots where the entire driveway continues at the same width from the street to a garage constructed to hold two or more cars. For purposes of this section, the term "improved" shall mean constructed in such a fashion that will not cause dirt or other debris to be deposited on any public way, for example, but not by way of limitation, with gravel or cinder. Grass or dirt driveways shall be totally prohibited. All driveways constructed in the areas described above shall conform to the requirements of this Section as to width, location and composition.

c.  Whether or not the proposed parking area will have an excessively adverse effect on open front space requirements.

e.  Whether the reason for the requested exception outweighs the City Commission's intent set forth in Section 1 hereof.

DECLARATION OF PURPOSE. 
    The use of controlled substances is a significant problem not only in the City of Mount Clemens, but also in American society.

As these devices, printed matter, instructions, and so on are commonly known as and promoted as drug paraphernalia, the City Commission finds and declares that by controlling the sale and use of these items, the abuse of controlled substances can be alleviated.

(ord. eff. June 20, 1994)

FUNDS AND ACCOUNTS; FLOW OF FUNDS. 
    Commencing on August 1, 1994, all funds belonging to the System shall be transferred as herein indicated and all Revenues of the System shall be set aside as collected and credited to a fund to be designated WATER SYSTEM RECEIVING FUND (the "Receiving Fund"). In addition, on August 1, 1994, all Revenues in any accounts of the System shall be transferred to the Receiving Fund and credited to the funds and accounts as provided in this section. The Revenues credited to the Receiving Fund are pledged for the purpose of the following funds and shall be transferred or debited from the Receiving Fund periodically in the manner and at the times and in the order of priority hereinafter specified: 
A.  OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FUND: Out of the Revenues credited to the Receiving Fund there shall be first set aside in, or credited to, a fund designated OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FUND (the "Operation and Maintenance Fund"), monthly a sum sufficient to provide for the payment of the next month's expenses of administration and operation of the System and such current expenses for the maintenance thereof as may be necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order. 
A budget, showing in detail the estimated costs of administration, operation and maintenance of the System for the next ensuing operating year, shall be prepared by the Issuer at least 30 days prior to the commencement of each ensuing operating year. No payments shall be made to the Issuer from moneys credited to the Operation and Maintenance Fund except for services directly rendered to the System by the Issuer or its personnel. 
B.  BOND AND INTEREST REDEMPTION FUND: There shall be established and maintained a separate depositary fund designated BOND AND INTEREST REDEMPTION FUND (the "Redemption Fund"), the moneys on deposit therein from time to time to be used solely for the purpose of paying the principal of, redemption premiums (if any) and interest on the Bonds. The moneys in the Redemption Fund (including the Bond Reserve Account) shall be kept on deposit with the bank or trust company where the principal of and interest on the Bonds, or any series thereof, are payable. 
Out of the Revenues remaining in the Receiving Fund, after provision for the Operation and Maintenance Fund, there shall be set aside each month commencing August 1, 1994, in the Redemption Fund a sum proportionately sufficient to provide for the payment when due of the current principal of and interest on the Bonds, less any amount in the Redemption Fund representing accrued interest on the Bonds or investment income on amounts on deposit in the Redemption Fund, (including investment income on amounts held as part of the Bond Reserve Account). Commencing August 1, 1994, the amount set aside each month for interest on the Bonds shall be one-third of the total amount of interest on the Bonds coming due on November 1, 1994. Commencing November 1, 1994, the amount set aside each month for interest on the Bonds shall be 1/6 of the total amount of interest on the Bonds next coming due. The amount set aside each month for principal, commencing August 1, 1994, shall be one-third of the amount of principal coming due by maturity on November 1, 1994, and the amount set aside each month for principal payment commencing November 1, 1994, shall be 1/12 of the amount of principal next coming due by maturity. If there is any deficiency in the amount previously set aside, that deficiency shall be added to the next succeeding monthly requirements. The amount to be set aside for the payment of principal and interest on any date shall not exceed the amount which, when added to the money on deposit in the Redemption Fund, including investment income thereon and on the Bond Reserve Account, is necessary to pay principal and interest due on the Bonds on the next succeeding November 1. 
There is established a separate account in the Redemption Fund to be known as the BOND RESERVE ACCOUNT (the "Bond Reserve Account"). There shall be deposited in the Bond Reserve Account an amount which is the lesser of (1) the maximum annual debt service due in the current or any future year, (2) 125% of the average annual debt service or (3) 10% of the principal amount of the Bonds (the "Reserve Amount"). Interest on the Bond Reserve Account shall remain therein until the total amount in the Bond Reserve Account shall equal the Reserve Amount, and thereafter shall be transferred into the Redemption Fund. 
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the moneys credited to the Bond Reserve Account shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of, redemption premiums (if any) and interest on the Bonds as to which there would otherwise be a default. If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys credited to the Bond Reserve Account for such payment, then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the Net Revenues first received thereafter which are not required for current principal and interest requirements until the amount on deposit equals the Reserve Amount. If additional Bonds are issued, each Ordinance authorizing the additional Bonds shall provide for additional deposits to the Bond Reserve Account to be made from the proceeds of the additional Bonds or Issuer funds on hand and legally available for such use in an amount that will result in the Bond Reserve Account being equal to the Reserve Amount adjusted to take into account the issuance of the additional Bonds, or such lesser amount as may be necessary to maintain the tax-exempt status of the Bonds. If on any November 1 the amount in the Bond Reserve Account exceeds the Reserve Amount, the excess shall be transferred to the Redemption Fund for payment of principal and interest on the Bonds due on that date. The Bond Reserve Account initially may be funded alternatively from the proceeds of the Series 1994 Bonds, from other available funds of the Issuer, or from monthly deposits from Net Revenues over not more than a five-year period commencing August 1, 1994, as determined by the Director of Finance. In the alternative, if upon the advice of the Issuer's financial advisor it shall be determined that the Bond Reserve Account is not necessary, the Director of Finance may elect to forego any funding of the Bond Reserve Account. 
C.  REPLACEMENT FUND: There shall next be established and maintained a fund, separate depositary account, designated REPLACEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT FUND (the "Replacement Fund"), the money credited thereto to be used for the purpose of making repairs and replacements to the System and for additions, improvements, enlargements or extensions to the System, including the planning thereof. Out of the Revenues and moneys of the System remaining in the Receiving Fund each month after provision has been made for the deposit of moneys in the Operation and Maintenance Fund and the Redemption Fund (including the Bond Reserve Account), there may be deposited in the Replacement Fund such additional funds as the Issuer may deem advisable. If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys in the Replacement Fund for the purpose for which the Replacement Fund was established, the moneys so used shall be replaced from any moneys in the Receiving Fund which are not required by this Ordinance to be used for the Operation and Maintenance Fund or the Redemption Fund (including the Bond Reserve Account). 
D.  SURPLUS MONEYS: Thereafter, any Revenues in the Receiving Fund after satisfying all the foregoing requirements of this Section may, at the discretion of the Issuer, be used for any of the following purposes: 
1.  Transferred to the Replacement Fund. 
2.  Transferred to the Redemption Fund and used for the purchase of Bonds on the open market at not more than the fair market value thereof or used to redeem Bonds prior to maturity if then permitted under this Ordinance or any subsequent ordinance authorizing the issuance of additional Bonds. 
3.  Any other use permitted by law. 
(ord. eff. June 20, 1994) 
47.014 - Sec. 14. 
PRIORITY OF FUNDS. 
    In the event the moneys in the Receiving Fund are insufficient to provide for the current requirements of the Operation and Maintenance Fund or the Redemption Fund, any moneys or securities in other funds of the System, except the proceeds of sale of the Bonds, shall be credited or transferred, first, to the Operation and Maintenance Fund, and second to the Redemption Fund. 
(ord. eff. June 20, 1994) 
47.015 - Sec. 15.

Investment of moneys in the Redemption Fund being accumulated for payment of the next maturing principal or interest payment of the Bonds shall be limited to obligations bearing maturity dates prior to the date of the next maturing principal or interest payment on the Bonds. Investment of moneys in the Bond Reserve Account shall be limited to obligations bearing maturity dates or subject to redemption, at the option of the holder thereof, not later than five years from the date of the investment. In the event investments are made, any securities representing the same shall be kept on deposit with the bank or trust company having on deposit the fund or funds or account from which the purchase was made. Profit realized or interest income earned on investment of funds in the Receiving Fund, Operation and Maintenance Fund and Replacement Fund shall be deposited in or credited to the Receiving Fund at the end of each fiscal year. Profit realized on interest income earned on investment of moneys in the Redemption Fund (including income derived from the Bond Reserve Account) shall be credited as received to the Redemption Fund.

47.017 - Sec. 17. 
BOND PROCEEDS. 
    From the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds there shall be immediately deposited in the Redemption Fund an amount equal to the accrued interest and premium, if any, received on the delivery of the Bonds. To the extent determined appropriate by the Director of Finance, based upon the advice of the Issuer's financial advisor, there shall be deposited in the Bond Reserve Account an amount equal to all or a part of the Reserve Amount. The balance of the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds shall be deposited in a bank or banks, designated by the Issuer, qualified to act as depository of the proceeds of sale under the provisions of Section 15 of Act 94, in an account designated CONSTRUCTION FUND (the "Construction Fund"). Moneys in the Construction Fund shall be applied solely in payment of the cost of the Project, including any engineering, legal and other expenses incident thereto and to the financing thereof. Payments for construction, either on account or otherwise, shall not be made unless the registered engineer in charge of such work shall file with the Issuer a signed statement to the effect that the work has been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor; that it was done pursuant to and in accordance with the contract therefor (including properly authorized change orders), that such work is satisfactory and that such work has not been previously paid for. Any unexpended balance of the proceeds of sale of the Bonds remaining after completion of the Project in the Construction Fund may, at the discretion of the Issuer, be used for further improvements, enlargements and extension to the System, if, at the time of such expenditures, such use is approved by the Michigan Department of Treasury, if such permission is then required by law. Any remaining balance after such expenditure shall be paid to the Redemption Fund and may be used for the purpose of purchasing Bonds on the open market at not more than the fair market value thereof, but not more than the price at which the Bonds may next be called for redemption, or used for the purpose of paying principal of the Bonds upon maturity or calling Bonds for redemption.

GENERAL COVENANTS. 
    The Issuer covenants and agrees with the holders of the Bonds that so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding and unpaid as to either principal or interest: 
(a)  The Issuer will maintain the System in good repair and working order and will operate the same efficiently and will faithfully and punctually perform all duties with reference to the System required by the Constitution and laws of the State of Michigan, the Issuer's Charter and this Ordinance. 
(b)  The Issuer will keep proper books of record and account separate from all other records and accounts of the Issuer, in which shall be made full and correct entries of all transactions relating to the System. The Issuer shall have an annual audit of the books of record and account of the System for the preceding operating year made each year by an independent certified public accountant, and a copy of the audit shall be mailed to the manager of each syndicate or account originally purchasing any issue of the Bonds. The auditor shall comment on the manner in which the Issuer is complying with the requirements of the Ordinance with respect to setting aside and investing moneys and meeting the requirements for acquiring and maintaining insurance. The audit shall be completed and so made available not later than four (4) months after the close of each operating year, unless the Issuer obtains a filing extension from the Michigan Department of Treasury, Local Audit Division. 
(c)  The Issuer will maintain and carry, for the benefit of the holders of the Bonds, insurance on all physical properties of the System and liability insurance, of the kinds and in the amounts normally carried by municipalities engaged in the operation of water supply systems, including self-insurance. All moneys received for losses under any such insurance policies shall be applied solely to the replacement and restoration of the property damaged or destroyed, and to the extent not so used, shall be used for the purpose of redeeming or purchasing Bonds.

47.020 - Sec. 20. 
ADDITIONAL BONDS. 
    Except as hereinafter provided, the Issuer shall not issue additional Bonds of equal or prior standing with the Series 1994 Bonds. 
    The right is reserved in accordance with the provisions of Act 94, to issue additional Bonds payable from the Revenues of the System which shall be of equal standing and priority of lien on the Net Revenues of the System with the Bonds but only for the following purposes and under the following terms and conditions: 
(a)  To complete the Project in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor. Such bonds shall not be authorized unless the engineers in charge of construction shall execute a certificate evidencing the fact that additional funds are needed to complete the Project in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor and stating the amount that will be required to complete the Project. If such certificate shall be so executed and filed with the Issuer, it shall be the duty of the Issuer to provide for and issue additional revenue bonds in the amount stated in said certificate to be necessary to complete the Project in accordance with the plans and specifications plus an amount necessary to issue such bonds or to provide for part or all of such amount from other sources. 
(b)  For subsequent repairs, extensions, enlargements and improvements to the System or for the purpose of refunding part of any Bonds then outstanding and paying costs of issuing such additional Bonds including deposits which may be required to be made to the Bond Reserve Account. Bonds for such purposes shall not be issued pursuant to this subparagraph (b) unless the Adjusted Net Revenues of the System for the then last two (2) preceding twelve-month operating years or the Adjusted Net Revenues for the last preceding twelve-month operating year, if the same shall be lower than the average, shall be equal to at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the maximum amount of principal and interest thereafter maturing in any operating year on the then outstanding Bonds and on the additional Bonds then being issued. If the additional Bonds are to be issued in whole or in part for refunding outstanding Bonds, the annual principal and interest requirements shall be determined by deducting from the principal and interest requirements for each operating year the annual principal and interest requirements of any Bonds to be refunded from the proceeds of the additional Bonds. For purposes of this subparagraph (b) the Issuer may elect to use as the last preceding operating year any operating year ending not more than sixteen months prior to the date of delivery of the additional Bonds and as the next to the last preceding operating year, any operating year ending not more than twenty-eight months prior to the date of delivery of the additional Bonds. Determination by the Issuer as to existence of conditions permitting the issuance of additional Bonds shall be conclusive. No additional Bonds of equal standing as to the Net Revenues of the System shall be issued pursuant to the authorization contained in this subparagraph if the Issuer shall then be in default in making its required payments to the Operation and Maintenance Fund or the Redemption Fund. 
(c)  For refunding a part of the outstanding Bonds and paying costs of issuing such additional Bonds including deposits which may be required to be made to the Bond Reserve Account. No additional Bonds shall be issued pursuant to this subsection unless the maximum amount of principal and interest maturing in any operating year after giving effect to the refunding shall be less than the maximum amount of principal and interest maturing in any operating year prior to giving effect to the refunding.

Any such permit for a use which would be nonconforming under this Ordinance, or any amendment hereto, shall not be renewed in the event construction pursuant to such permit is not commenced within one (1) year from the date of issuance of the permit. 
15.030 - ARTICLE 3: SITE PLAN REVIEW AND APPROVAL 

15.031 - Sec. 3.1 
INTENT. 
    Site plan review provides the City with an opportunity to review the proposed use of a site in relation to all applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and City planning policy. Site plan review also provides the City with an opportunity to review the relationship of the plan to surrounding uses, accessibility, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, off-street parking, public utilities, drainage, natural features, screening, and other relevant factors which may have an impact on the public health, safety and general welfare. 
15.032 - Sec. 3.2 
PLANNING STANDARDS. 
    In reviewing all applications for site plan approval, the Planning Commission shall consider the plan in relation to the following standards: 
A.  RELATIONSHIP TO SURROUNDING PROPERTY. All site development features shall be arranged to minimize the potential for negatively impacting surrounding property or may have an effect upon the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare and its relationship and harmony with the adopted City Ordinance and Plans. In making this determination, the Planning Commission shall review the plan for negative conditions such as, but not limited to: 
1.  Location of the principle building or buildings and any accessory buildings or uses. 
2.  Channeling excessive traffic onto local residential streets. 
3.  The lack of adequate screening of parking or service areas. 
4.  The impediments to the access of emergency vehicles. 
5.  Site drainage characteristics 
6.  The accumulation of litter, production of noise, light, smoke, fumes, or the piling of snow. 
B.  VEHICULAR ACCESS AND CIRCULATION. The location and design of driveways providing vehicular access to the site shall be arranged to promote the safety and convenience of vehicles and pedestrians and to provide access in a manner that promotes proper internal circulation. The Planning Commission shall require public streets adjacent or through a proposed development, when it is necessary for the public health, safety and welfare, and/or provide continuity to the public road system. In those instances where the Planning Commission determines that there are an excessive number of curb-cuts in relation to abutting public roads, thereby diminishing the capacity of the road or creating excessive points of conflict, a reduction in the number of driveways shall be required. For a narrow frontage which will require a single outlet, the Planning Commission may require that money be placed in escrow with the City so as to provide for a marginal service drive equal in length to the frontage of the property involved. Occupancy permits shall not be issued until the improvement is physically provided or monies have been deposited with the City. 
C.  RELATIONSHIP TO NATURAL FEATURES. All buildings, driveways, parking lots and site improvements shall be designed to be compatible with the physical characteristics of the site, including, but not limited to, woodlands, wetlands, slopes, floodplains and soil suitability. The proposed development shall not needlessly have an adverse impact on the natural environment of the site or the surrounding area. 
D.  INFRASTRUCTURE. The Planning Commission shall consider the City Engineer's evaluation of the adequacy of public or private utilities proposed to serve the site, including water, sanitary sewers and stormwater retention. 
E.  LANDSCAPING. The Planning Commission may require further landscaping, fences, walls and berms pursuant to the objectives of this Ordinance, and such improvements shall be provided and maintained as a condition of the establishment and the continued maintenance of any use to which they are appurtenant. 
F.  RECREATION AREAS AND FACILITIES. Recreation areas and facilities, such as playgrounds, swimming pools and community buildings, shall be provided to the extent necessary to meet the anticipated needs of the residents of the project it is designed to serve. Provision of separate adult and tot-lot recreation areas adequately landscaped is encouraged. Recreation facilities generally should be provided in a central location and should be convenient to the project community center. In larger development, however, recreation facilities can be decentralized, if more than one or if made part of an open space area. 
G.  SITE DEVELOPMENT. During development, building, renovating or razing operations, the developer shall erect and maintain suitable protective barriers around all trees specified to be maintained so as to prevent damage to said trees and shall not allow storage of equipment, materials, debris or fill to be placed in this preservation area. 
15.033 - Sec. 3.3 
SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS. 
A.  A site plan shall be submitted for review and approval by the Planning Commission whenever one or more of the following conditions apply: 
1.  Whenever a building permit is required for the erection or structural alteration of a building (other than accessory structures to single-family residential uses). 
a.  Single-family residential homes shall require site plan review for the new construction of a home. Submission requirements for single-family residential site plans shall be based upon policy set forth by the Planning Commission. Additions to existing single-family homes shall be subject to site plan review if any of the following circumstances apply: 
(1)  The square footage of the addition exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the square footage of the existing home. 
(2)  The addition is located in the side yard or front yard of the property, unless exempt as provided below: 
a.  The construction of a new porch that is less than twenty-five (25) square feet in size shall be exempt from site plan review, or;

2.  For the construction or establishment of a new or additional parking or storage area, or for the use or reuse of an existing parking lot or storage area in a character or fashion that differs from its approved use. Such use or reuse shall not be approved unless the parking and/or storage area meets the standards of this Ordinance and the City Engineering Standards. 
3.  For all special land uses. 
4.  For any substantial change in use or class of use when referred by the Community Development Director. 
5.  The erection of, or addition to, any major utility service facilities, including towers, substations, pump stations and similar facilities. 
B.  The Site Plan Review Application shall be furnished in the number of copies required by the City, together with the same number of site plans, building drawings and required review fees.

15.066 - Sec. 6.6 
GRATIOT AVENUE CORRIDOR OVERLAY ZONE. 
A.  INTENT. The intent of the Gratiot Avenue Corridor Overlay Zone is to improve traffic operations; reduce potential for crashes; improve pedestrian and transit environments; and preserve the vehicular carrying capacity of Gratiot Avenue through regulations on the number, spacing, placement and design of access points (driveways and intersections). Published reports and recommendations by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) show a relationship between the number of access points and the number of crashes. 
    Recognizing the existing built character and downtown land use characteristics in Mount Clemens relative to those of other communities along the Gratiot Avenue Corridor, this ordinance intends to apply the MDOT access management standards where practical, but to allow flexibility in their application, given the unique needs of this more urbanized area. The segment of Gratiot Avenue within Mount Clemens splits into north bound and south bound components referred to as "one-way pairs" which present unique traffic operations; therefore, this ordinance places less emphasis on the spacing and offsets of access from other driveways and greater emphasis on the design and placement of driveways relative to other nearby access and intersections, especially signalized intersections. 
B.  APPLICABILITY. This overlay zone shall apply to all land with frontage along Gratiot Avenue, except for single-family homes, duplexes or essential service facility structures. The following applications must comply with the standards in this section. 
1.  New or Enlarged Building or Structure. Any new principal building or structure, or the enlargement of any principal building or structure by more than 25%. 
2.  Land Division, Subdivision or Site Condominium. Any land division or subdivision or site condominium development, including residential developments. 
3.  Change in Use or Intensity of Use. Any intensity of use as defined in Section 13.1.C. (15.0130.C.), or any increase in vehicle trips generated. 
C.  ACCESS MANAGEMENT STANDARDS. The following regulations of this Section shall be considered by the Planning Commission: 

1.  Compliance with Corridor Plan. Access shall generally be provided as shown in the Gratiot Avenue Corridor Improvement Plan. 
2.  Number of Driveways. The number of resulting driveways shall be the fewest necessary to provide reasonable access to the site. Each lot shall be permitted one driveway, which may consist of an individual driveway, a shared access with an adjacent use, or access via a service drive. 
3.  Offsets and Spacing from Intersections. Driveways shall be either directly aligned or spaced/offset as far from intersections as practical, especially signalized intersections. A minimum spacing or offset of 150 feet is preferred. 

4.  Spacing from Other Driveways on the Same Side of Gratiot. Driveways shall be spaced/offset as far as practical from other driveways along Gratiot. A minimum spacing of 150 feet is preferred. 
5.  Offsets from Driveways on the Opposite Side of Gratiot. Driveways shall be either aligned with driveways on the opposite side of Gratiot or offset to the greatest distance practical. Consideration for weaving across travel lanes shall be given, especially where signalized intersections are present. 
6.  Consideration of Adjacent Sites. Where the subject site adjoins land that may be developed or redeveloped in the future, the access shall be located to ensure the adjacent site(s) can also meet the access location standards in the future. 
7.  Shared Driveways. Where direct access consistent with the above regulations cannot be achieved, access should be provided via a shared driveway or service drive. 
8.  Access Design. Where practical given right-of-way constraints, driveways shall be designed with radii, tapers and other geometrics as determined by MDOT that are required to minimize the impacts of inbound right turns on traffic flow. 
D.  REVIEW PROCEDURE. It is recognized that certain existing site conditions may prohibit full compliance with this Section. Modifications to the standards herein may be permitted by the Planning Commission according to the following procedure: 
1.  Submittal Information. Along with any other required information, developments subject to review according to this Section shall submit: 
a.  Detailed information showing nearby intersections; existing driveways on adjacent sites; proposed driveways; changes to existing access; and any information requested by the City necessary to review site access. 
b.  The Planning Commission may require submittal of a traffic impact report, prepared by a qualified traffic engineer, to verify the need for additional driveways or to justify a modification. 
2.  Allowed Modifications. The Planning Commission may, after considering the criteria in #3 below, modify the standards of this Section in the following situations: 
a.  The modification will allow an existing driveway to remain that does not meet the standards of this Section but that has, or is expected to have very low traffic volumes (less than 50 in- and out-bound trips per day) and is not expected to significantly impact safe traffic operations. 
b.  The use is expected to generate a relatively high number of trips and an additional driveway will improve overall traffic operations. 
c.  Practical difficulties exist on the site that make compliance unreasonable (sight distance limitations, existing development, topography, unique site configuration or shape), or existing off-site driveways make it impractical to fully comply with the standards. 
d.  Because of restricted turning movements or presence of a median that restricts turning movements, the driveway does not contribute to congestion or an unsafe situation. 
3.  Modification Criteria. The Planning Commission may waive certain requirements of this Section upon consideration of the following: 
a.  The proposed modification is consistent with the general intent of the standards of this overlay zone, the recommendations of the Gratiot Avenue Corridor Improvement Plan, and published MDOT guidelines. 
b.  MDOT staff endorse the proposed access design. 
c.  Driveway geometrics have been improved to the extent practical to reduce impacts on traffic flow. 
d.  Shared access has been provided, or the applicant has demonstrated it is not practical. 
e.  Such modification is the minimum necessary to provide reasonable access, will not impair public safety or prevent the logical development or redevelopment of adjacent sites and is not simply for convenience of the development.

B.  DESIGN STANDARDS. In any single-family residential district, there shall be variation in the appearance of dwelling units using the following as minimum standards. The foregoing standards shall not apply to a manufactured home located in a licensed manufactured housing community, except to the extent required by State or Federal law or otherwise specifically required in the Zoning Ordinance of the City pertaining to such parks. 
1.  The front elevation of single-family detached dwelling units shall not recur in the same or a substantially similar structural form on another dwelling within the same block frontage, without there being at least three (3) other dwellings with a different building elevation between the dwellings that repeat the front elevation. Different colors alone will not constitute different front elevations. 
2.  Plans for modulars, prefabricated units and similarly constructed units shall be approved by the State of Michigan Construction Code Commission as meeting the State Construction Code (Public Act 230 of 1972 and Public Act 371 of 1980, as amended) prior to the issuance of a building or occupancy permit. Manufactured/mobile homes or trailers shall meet or exceed the requirements imposed by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards (24 CFR 3280 and as, from time-to-time, such standards may be amended). The Planning Commission shall be furnished a certificate stating that such dwelling meets the minimum building code requirements applicable to such structure or shall include a seal attached to the unit. Any addition to such manufactured home must be designed and constructed by the manufacturer of such home or must be based upon an architectural plan deemed compatible with the overall design of the manufactured home and approved by the Planning Commission. 
3.  All one-family dwelling units shall have a minimum width across any front, side or rear elevation of twenty-four (24') feet. 
4.  All dwelling units shall be attached to a permanent foundation constructed on the site in accordance with the building code and shall have a wall of the same perimeter dimensions of the dwelling and additions thereto and constructed of such materials and type as required in the building code. In the event that the dwelling is a manufactured home, as defined herein, such dwelling shall also be installed pursuant to the manufacturer's set-up instructions and shall be secured to the premises by an anchoring system or device complying with the rules and regulations of the Michigan Mobile Home Commission and shall have a continuous perimeter wall, as required above. 
5.  Single-family dwellings shall be aesthetically compatible in design and appearance with other residences in the vicinity. In making such determination of compatibility, the Planning Commission, while taking into consideration comments made by the Community Development Director and/or the Mount Clemens Historic Commission, may consider the following factors: total square footage; length-to-depth proportions; value and quality of construction; exterior building materials; architectural style and design and roof line; as well as the character, design and appearance of a majority of the residential dwellings (excluding manufactured housing communities) within two thousand (2,000) feet of the subject dwelling. The foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit innovative design concepts involving such matters as solar energy, view, unique land contour, or relief from the common or standard designed home. 
C.  DWELLINGS PER LOT OR PARCEL. No more than one (1) single-family residential dwelling shall be permitted per lot or parcel, except as provided in subsection H. below. 
D.  DWELLINGS WITHOUT BASEMENTS. Each one-family and two-family dwelling unit without a basement shall provide not less than an additional one hundred (100) square feet of floor area for utility rooms and/or storage space greater than the minimum floor area per dwelling unit. 
E.  FENCES, WALLS, HEDGES AND PROTECTIVE BARRIERS. 
1.  The erection, construction or alteration of any fence, wall, hedge or other type of protective barrier in a single-family district shall be reviewed by the Community Development Director. The Community Development Director shall approve all fences that conform to the requirements of the zoning district wherein they are proposed and meet the requirements of this Section. 
2.  In any residential district, fences and walls are permitted along any lot line. 
3.  Unless otherwise stated, fences shall be a maximum of six (6) feet in height. 
a.  A residential property line abutting a railroad right-of-way shall be permitted to maintain a fence with a maximum permitted height of nine (9) feet. 
4.  No fence located in the front yard shall be greater than forty-two (42) inches in height. Fences located in the front yard shall be decorative in nature. Chain link fencing shall not be considered decorative. 
5.  In any yard, no fence within fifteen (15) feet of the intersection of a driveway and the property line shall be constructed of view-obscuring materials to ensure adequate clear vision for vehicular traffic. No fence located within this area shall exceed thirty-six (36) inches in height. 
6.  No fencing shall have sharp design features and shall not contain barbed wire or razor wire. 
7.  All fences in multiple-family residential districts shall be subject to site plan review procedures. 
8.  For all fences hereinafter erected, the finished side of the fence shall face the property adjacent to the property where the proposed fence is installed. 
F.  MEASURING MINIMUM FLOOR SPACE REQUIREMENTS. Minimum floor space requirements as established by the various provisions of this Ordinance for residential dwelling shall be measured from the exterior surface of enclosing walls and the centerline of common partition walls for each dwelling unit. Minimum floor area shall not include cellars or basements, attached garages or attics, unheated breezeways, porches or decks. 
G.  RESIDENTIAL ENTRANCEWAY. In all residential districts, so-called entranceway structures, including, but not limited to, walls, columns and gates, marking entrances to single-family subdivisions may be permitted and may be located in a required setback, provided that such entranceway structures shall comply with all codes and ordinances of the City and be approved by the Planning Commission. 
H.  SITE CONDOMINIUM SUBDIVISION. The intent of these requirements is to ensure that all site condominium subdivisions are developed in compliance with accepted planning and engineering standards applicable to similar forms of development, as reflected in the City's ordinances and requirements. 
    One-family detached condominiums may be allowed as a permitted use in any single-family zoning district, subject to site plan review by the Planning Commission. Commercial and industrial condominiums that result in condominium unit(s) shall also be regulated by this Section and the district in which they are located. 
1.  Submission Requirements. All site condominium subdivision plans shall be submitted for review, as required by Article 3 of this Ordinance and Section 66 of the Condominium Act, and include the following additional information: 
a.  A boundary survey of the site condominium subdivision site.

2.  Review Procedures. Pursuant to authority conferred by Section 141 of the Condominium Act, all site condominium subdivision plans shall require approval by the Planning Commission before units may be sold or site improvement initiated. In determining whether to approve a site condominium subdivision plan, the Planning Commission shall consult with the City Attorney, Planner and Engineer regarding the adequacy of the submission as it relates to the City of Mount Clemens Zoning Ordinance and requirements of the Condominium Act. The review process shall consist of the following two steps: 
a.  Preliminary Plan Review. In the preliminary review phase, the Planning Commission shall review the overall plan for the site, including basic road and unit configurations and the consistency of the plans, with all applicable provisions of the City of Mount Clemens Zoning Ordinance. Plans submitted for preliminary review shall include information specified in items a. to c. of the Submission Requirements in subsection 1. above. 
b.  Final Plan Review. Upon receipt of Preliminary Plan Approval, the applicant shall prepare the appropriate engineering plans and apply for Final Review by the Planning Commission.

Further, such plans shall be submitted for review and comment to all applicable local, County and State agencies. Final approval shall not be granted until such time as all applicable review agencies have had an opportunity to comment on said plans. 
3.  District Requirements. The development of all site condominium subdivisions shall observe the applicable yard setback and minimum floor area requirements of the zoning district within which the project is located. The density of development of the project shall be no greater and spacing no less than would be permitted if the property were a platted subdivision. 
4.  Design Standards. All development in a site condominium subdivision shall conform to the design and improvement standards of the City of Mount Clemens Subdivision Regulations. All streets and roads shall be dedicated to the public, unless otherwise permitted by the Planning Commission as essential to the preservation of the overall character of the proposal. Street and road connections and/or stubs shall be required, where necessary to provide continuity to the public road system. 
In any of the foregoing referenced sections, the term "plat" shall be substituted with the term "site condominium subdivision plan"; the term "tentative preliminary plat approval" shall be substituted with the term "preliminary plan review"; the term "final preliminary plat approval" shall be substituted with the term "final plan review"; and the term "proprietor" shall be deemed to refer to the applicant pursuant to this Ordinance. Any applications, fees, procedures for review or hearing, as set forth in these ordinances and their other provisions, shall be fully complied with, except as provided herein. 
5.  Utility Easements. The site condominium subdivision plan shall include all necessary easements granted to appropriate authority for the purpose of constructing, operating, inspecting, maintaining, repairing, altering, replacing and/or removing pipelines, mains, conduits and other installations of a similar character for the purpose of providing public utilities, including, but not limited to, the conveyance of sewage, water and stormwater run-off across, through and under the property, subject to said easement. 
6.  Final Acceptance. The City shall also require all the appropriate inspections. After construction of the site condominium subdivision, an as-built reproducible mylar of the completed site improvements (excluding dwelling units) is to be submitted to the City for review by the City Engineer. A final certificate of occupancy and any construction bonds or letter of credit will not be released to the developer/owner until said as-built mylar has been reviewed and accepted by the City.

15.077 - Sec. 7.7 
RESIDENTIAL RENTAL RESTRICTION OVERLAY DISTRICTS. 
    Residential rental restriction overlay districts "RO-1" are hereby established. 
A.  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES. 
1.  The residential rental restriction overlay district "RO-1" is a zoning classification which permits owners of property within R1-A and R1-B residential zoning districts to petition the City Commission to establish an overlay district, and district use regulations in their residential neighborhood, which would prohibit or restrict the rental uses of single- family dwellings within the neighborhood. These districts establish restrictions which operate to preserve the attractiveness, desirability and privacy of residential neighborhoods by precluding all or certain types of rental properties and thereby preclude the deleterious effects rental properties can have on a neighborhood with regard to property deterioration, increased density, congestion, crime, noise and traffic levels and reduction of property values. The goal of the overlay district is to allow owners of property within residential neighborhoods to control the types of rental properties, if any, that are permitted in one-family dwellings within their neighborhood. 
2.  It is also the purpose of the districts to achieve the following objectives: 
a.  To protect the privacy of residents and to minimize noise, congestion and nuisance impacts by regulating the types of rental properties; 
b.  To maintain an attractive community appearance and to provide a desirable living environment for residents by preserving the owner-occupied character of the neighborhood; and 
c.  To prevent excessive traffic and parking problems in the neighborhoods. 
B.  PERMITTED USES. Uses permitted in the Residential Rental Restriction Overlay District RO-1 are as follows: 
1.  In a Residential Rental Restriction Overlay District RO-1 that overlaps a portion of a district zoned as an R1-A or R1-B district, permitted uses are all uses permitted in the underlying zoning district except the use or occupancy of a single-family dwelling unit as a rental unit within the meaning of Section 16.202, Sec. 2 et seq. of the city code is prohibited and a single-family dwelling converted into a two-family dwelling unit after the introduction of an ordinance to create said overlay district, may not be used or occupied as a rental unit within the meaning of Section 16.202, Sec. 2 et seq. 
2.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the overlay restriction does not impact properties that already have a valid rental certificate of compliance, or have begun the rental certificate of compliance process, as such will be considered a pre-existing non-conforming use and will be "grandfathered". However, if a property owner allows a rental certificate of compliance to remain expired more than 12 months, then the property would lose any prior legal, non-conforming grandfathering and the property will be subject to the restrictions set forth in 15.077 Sec. 7.7(B)(1) and/or 15.077 Sec. 7.7(B)(2). 
C.  PROCEDURES TO ESTABLISH A RESIDENTIAL RENTAL RESTRICTION OVERLAY DISTRICT RO-1. The following procedures must be complied with in order to establish a Residential Rental Restriction Overlay District: 
1.  A petition requesting an overlay district must be submitted to the City Clerk on forms provided by the City Clerk. The petition requirements are as follows: 
a.  The proposed boundaries of the overlay district must be entirely within an R1-A or R1-B zoning district and the parcels within the proposed district must be contiguous. 
b.  There must be at least 40 separate lots or parcels within the proposed district as described in the petition or the proposed district must constitute a discrete neighborhood geographic area. 
c.  The proposed boundaries may not overlap a boundary of existing overlay districts or the boundary of an overlay district that is already the subject of an introduced ordinance pursuant to this section. 
d.  The proposed district boundaries must be approved by the Community Development Department in conjunction with the petitioner prior to the petition being circulated for signatures. Once approved by the Community Development Department and the petitioner, the proposed district boundaries may not be changed. 
e.  The petition must identify the specific overlay district that is sought by specifying the proposed boundary of the overlay district. The proposed boundaries of the overlay district must be described in the petition and the boundaries must, if practicable, consist of streets, alleys, platted subdivision boundaries or existing zoning district lines which totally enclose the proposed district. 
f.  The petition must accurately advise the signer of the rental restriction that would be imposed on the property if the overlay district is established. 
g.  Each petition must be circulated by a person who owns property within the proposed district and be signed by the circulator. 
h.  The petition must contain the signature and address of two-thirds of the parcel owners within the proposed boundary of the overlay district, exclusive of public property. Jointly owned parcels will be considered owned by a single person for purpose of petitioning and any co-owner may sign a petition for such parcel. Only one owner of each parcel will count towards the two-thirds requirement. If a person owns more than one parcel of property within the proposed district, they may sign the petition for each parcel they own. 
i.  Each person signing the petition must also enter on the petition, adjacent to their signature, the date that the person signed the petition and the address of the parcel they own. 
j.  When submitted, no signature dated earlier than six months prior to the time the petition is filed with the City Clerk shall be counted in determining the validity of the petition. 
2.  Upon presentation to the City Clerk for review, the Clerk shall verify the signatures and property ownership and dates on the petitions. If insufficient signatures are presented, the Clerk shall return the petitions to the person filing the petitions and identify the valid and invalid signatures. If sufficient valid signatures are presented, the Clerk shall refer the petitions to the Community Development Department which shall then, within 30 days, determine whether the petitions are in conformity with the remaining conditions of this section. 
a.  If the petition is determined to be in conformity with the requirements of this section, the Community Development Director shall draft an appropriate ordinance in accordance with the petition procedures set forth in 15.0157 Sec. 15.7. All procedures set forth in 15.0157 Sec. 15.7 for zoning changes by petition shall thereafter be followed. 
b.  If the petition is not in conformity with the requirements of this section, the Community Development Director shall reject the petition and return it to the Clerk with a written explanation as to why the petition does not meet the requirements of this section. The Clerk shall then forward the petitions, and the explanation, to the person who filed the petitions. 
c.  If the petition is rejected for failure to comply with the boundary requirements, it may be resubmitted with the proper boundary lines if it is accompanied by certification that a copy of the petition and written notice was mailed to each property affected by the change, notifying them that their property was either added to or deleted from the petition and if by the correction of the boundary line the petition still meets all other requirements of the code. 
d.  If the petition is rejected for an insufficient number of valid signatures, it may be resubmitted with the additional signatures necessary to have it comply as long as the other signatures remain valid. 
3.  No earlier than one year after the adoption of an ordinance establishing an overlay district, a petition for a change or removal of the overlay district may be submitted by following the procedures for establishing an initial overlay district. 
D.  EFFECT OF OVERLAY DISTRICT ORDINANCE. 
1.  Upon introduction of an ordinance to create an overlay district and at all times while the ordinance is pending final decision there shall be a moratorium on the issuance of initial rental unit certifications to the extent that no initial rental housing certification shall be issued within the proposed overlay district to the owner of a single-family dwelling unit that would be precluded if the overlay district was adopted, or a single-family dwelling converted into a two-family dwelling unit after the introduction of an ordinance to create said overlay district, regardless of whether the license was applied for prior to or subsequent to the ordinance's introduction. 
2.  Upon passage of an ordinance by the City Commission establishing an overlay district, no initial rental unit certification shall be issued to an owner of property in the overlay district inconsistent with the restrictions of the overlay district and it shall be unlawful to use or allow any property to be used except in conformity with the requirements of the underlying zoning district and overlay district. Any property in the overlay district that has an existing rental housing certification, or has had a rental certification within one year of adoption of the overlay district, shall be allowed to continue its use and occupancy in accordance with the law existing prior to the date of the adoption of the overlay district. No existing rental housing use or occupancy in an overlay district shall be considered to be a nonconforming use as the result of adoption of an overlay district unless the rental license expires for more than one year. If an owner surrenders an existing certification or allows, either intentionally or unintentionally, a license to remain expired for more than one year, any subsequent use of the property shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by the overlay district. 
3.  If an ordinance introduced pursuant to this section is denied, a subsequent ordinance for an overlay district that includes the same parcels may not be introduced for one year following introduction of the previous ordinance. 
4.  Any ordinance which is not adopted within six months of its introduction shall be deemed denied. 
E.  RENTAL CERTIFICATION HARDSHIP EXCEPTION. In zoning districts RO-1, Residential Rental Restriction Overlay Districts, where new residential rental certifications are prohibited, no new rental certifications shall be issued except a rental certification obtained through the following procedure established for a hardship exception: 
1.  Any property owner desiring a "hardship exception" must submit their request for a hardship exception in writing to the Zoning Board of Appeals, which shall make a determination of whether a hardship exists as defined by this article. 
2.  A "hardship" for purposes of this article shall be defined as the inability of the owner to purchase or pay for one or more of the following without the ability to obtain rents on the subject property: 
a.  Medical care or a medical device for the owner or the owner's dependents; 
b.  Debts of the owner resulting from a mortgage, land contract or other loan used to purchase the subject property where there is no other available source to pay such debts; or 
c.  Debts of the owner due to child support, alimony, a tax lien, funeral expenses, or a judgment. 
3.  A "hardship" shall also include the following circumstances: Where a homeowner owns property that is occupied by the owner and a change in the owner's personal circumstances require a rental to preserve the financial stability of the owner. For example, this section would apply to a person who is required to temporarily relocate their residence for a period of time and needs to rent their home in their absence. 
4.  The hardship exception allows the issuance of a rental certification for a period of 12 months or less and only one appeal per property is permitted per year. 
5.  Any owner who has already been renting property without having obtained the required rental certification is disqualified from seeking a hardship exception. 
6.  It shall be the burden of the person seeking the hardship exception to provide proof of the hardship, including submission of financial documentation necessary for the Zoning Board of Appeals to make a reasoned decision on the request. 
7.  Any person requesting a hardship exception shall have a right to a hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals within 30 days of the initiation of the request, and the Zoning Board of Appeals shall issue a final and binding written decision within 14 days of the hearing.

15.0101 - Sec. 10.1 
INTENT. 
    The off-street parking and loading requirements of this Ordinance are established to prevent congestion on public streets by providing clearly defined parking areas that are separated from roadways; to remove the hazard to pedestrians of emerging between parked vehicles onto a public street; to facilitate proper storm-water runoff; to prevent the generation of dust; and to ensure safe, on-site circulation for pedestrians and automobiles. 
15.0102 - Sec. 10.2 
GENERAL PARKING REQUIREMENTS. 
    It shall be the duty of both the owner and occupant of any premises to provide off-street parking areas as required in this Article. Such off-street parking areas shall be laid out, constructed and maintained in accordance with the following standards and regulations: 
1.  Whenever a use or an activity requiring off-street parking is created, enlarged or increased in activity or intensity, off-street parking spaces shall be provided on site and maintained as required by this Ordinance. 
2  The amount of required off-street parking for new uses of buildings, additions to existing buildings, new uses of land and accessory buildings shall be determined in accordance with the regulations in effect at the time the new use or addition is proposed, and the space so required shall be shown on the site plan and shall be irrevocably reserved for such use. 
3.  Off-street parking existing at the effective date of this Ordinance in conjunction with the operation of an existing building or use shall not be reduced to an amount less than hereinafter required for a similar new building or new use. 
4.  Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent the collective provisions of off-street parking areas for two or more buildings or uses. Such collective parking may be reduced by up to fifteen (15) percent of the required minimum number of spaces for the various uses computed separately, provided that a parking study is presented to the Planning Commission which substantiates the requested reduction. 
5.  Where the owners of two (2) buildings, whose peak operating hours do not overlap, desire to utilize common off-street parking areas, the Planning Commission may permit such dual function provided that the following conditions have been met: 
a.  The peak business hours of the two (2) buildings or uses do not overlap.

15.0104 - Sec. 10.4 
PARKING STANDARDS IN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS ZONING DISTRICT. 
    It is the intent of this Section of the Ordinance to minimize the amount of privately owned surface parking areas in the Central Business Zoning District. The City of Mount Clemens shall provide primary parking areas to service the Central Business District, concentrated in publicly owned lots and/or structures. By limiting on-site surface parking the City aims to achieve the following goals: 
1.  Preserve an environment that is unique to the City of Mount Clemens and Macomb County by preventing the future development of scattered, random areas of surface parking that break up the continuity of the built environment in the Central Business District. 
2.  Preserve the high density character that defines downtown Mount Clemens by minimizing the space reserved for parking, thus allowing sites to be developed at a greater intensity. 
3.  Preserve the aesthetic and environmental appeal of downtown Mount Clemens by limiting the amount of impervious surface dedicated to surface parking. 
4.  Create a downtown environment that minimizes pedestrian conflicts with the automobile. By regulating the location and number of off-street parking areas, the potential for conflict is greatly reduced. 
5.  Enhance the visual quality of downtown, while preserving and/or enhancing each individual property's economic value. 
6.  Maintain the character of the downtown district by allowing structures, not pavement, to define its space. 
A.  CENTRAL BUSINESS PARKING STANDARDS. 
1.  Property zoned CB, Central Business, shall not be required to provide an off-street parking area, with the exception of residential uses, which shall meet the requirements of Section 10.3A2.

15.0112 - Sec. 11.2 
SCREENING REQUIREMENTS. 
    Screening shall be required between different zoning districts and uses according to the requirements of this Section of the Zoning Ordinance. The type of screening required in different situations is based on one of two impact rankings; 1) minor or 2) major. 
    Where screening is required, only one adjoining use shall be responsible for its installation, except as noted herein. This use shall be referred to as the "use providing screening." The other less intense use shall be the "protected use." [In instances where a "protected use" is developed adjacent to and after the use which is intended to provide the screening, the "protected use" shall provide the required screening.] 
    To determine the appropriate level of impact, refer to the adjoining zoning districts on the following Schedule of Screening Requirements. The level of impact is indicated where both uses interface. Specific requirements for screening improvements are described in the following subsection. If the Planning Commission determines that more intense and/or compatible screening is necessary due to the nature of the proposed use and/or the nature of the "protected use," it may require additional and/or alternative screening methods. These requirements are in addition to specific screening requirements set forth elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance. The Planning Commission may waive the following screening requirements for a portion of the site where the building setback does not provide adequate space to install a required greenbelt. 
A.  SCREENING REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH INTENSITY/IMPACT CLASSIFICATION. 
1.  Minor. The purpose of screening in this situation is to soften the impact of one land use on another. This creates an impression of space separation without necessarily eliminating visual contact. Screening intended to satisfy these objectives shall conform to the following standards: 
a.  Seven (7') foot wide greenbelt. 
b.  Eight (8') foot high evergreens and/or three (3") inch caliper deciduous trees planted at intervals not exceeding thirty (30') feet on center. 
c.  A minimum of five (5) shrubs per thirty (30') feet which have an average height of three (3') feet. If evergreens are utilized as the primary screening device, deciduous shrubs shall be utilized. If deciduous trees are utilized as the primary screening device, evergreen shrubs shall be utilized. 
2.  Major (1 and 2). In instances where major impacts occur, the required screening is intended to block the view of obtrusive or undesirable visual elements, exclude all contact between such uses, provide protection from noise and blowing debris, and create a strong impression of spatial separation. Screening in these situations shall conform to at least one of the two minimum standards listed below: 
Major 1 - A minimum buffer zone of ten (10') feet shall be maintained between the protected use and the more intense use. The buffer zone shall be developed with a six (6') foot high continuous, decorative masonry wall. 
- One (1) deciduous tree, not less than three (3") inches in caliper, shall be planted within the greenbelt for every twenty (20') lineal feet. 
- Additional low-level plant material shall be required along the entire length of the wall to provide continuous coverage. All such plantings shall meet the height and spacing requirements specified herein. 
Major 2 - A minimum buffer zone of fifteen (15') feet shall be maintained between the protected use and the more intense use. In addition, provide two (2) continuous rows of evergreens (spruce or pine), measuring at least eight (8') feet in height, evenly staggered, with each row planted at intervals not exceeding twenty (20') feet on center. 
B.  OTHER SCREENING SPECIFICATIONS. 
1.  Walls. Whenever a wall is used in conjunction with the previously mentioned screening requirements, it shall be constructed according to the following specifications: 
a.  Walls shall be constructed of reinforced protective decorative face brick (same as building), decorative poured reinforced concrete (to match building), or similar decorative building material determined to be acceptable by the Planning Commission. The color of brick or facing shall be compatible with brick used on the site and shall be durable, weather resistant, and easy to maintain. 
b.  Walls shall be placed on the subject property with the outer edge of the wall located on the property line. Walls shall have no openings for vehicular traffic, unless providing vehicular cross-access as approved by the Planning Commission. 
c.  The wall shall be constructed to meet all Building and Engineering requirements of the City. 
d.  No such wall shall be painted, nor shall it be constructed of exposed concrete block, cinder block, or wood products. 
e.  Unless otherwise expressly directed by the provisions of this Ordinance, all protective walls or greenbelts shall be provided when required along, and immediately joining, the zoning district boundary line and/or property line and shall be installed so as to lie wholly on the land of the applicant seeking site plan approval. In instances where drains, trees or other obstacles preclude such location, the Planning Commission shall determine the most appropriate alternative location. 
f.  All walls or greenbelts required by this Ordinance shall be completely installed prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit for the use of the premises, except as provided hereinafter. 
g.  In any case where the development of the land and/or buildings has been fully completed and an occupancy permit would otherwise be issued, and the completed installation of the wall, greenbelt and/or landscaping required is prevented by inclement weather or acts of nature beyond the control of the owner, the owner may receive a six month temporary occupancy permit subject to the completion of all such landscaping, provided that a sufficient financial guarantee has been posted at the City by the applicant. 
h.  Maintenance of the wall or any other substituted screening device shall be the responsibility of the property owner on whose property such wall or screen is located.

PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS. 
    The intent of these requirements is to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the City; to promote public safety; to moderate heat, wind and other local climatic effects produced by parking lots; and to minimize nuisances, particularly noise and glare. 
A.  INTERIOR PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING. All unpaved areas between a commercial or office building and a facing street shall be landscaped and maintained to include grass and/or placement of shrubbery. All off-street parking areas shall incorporate and provide curbed tree planting spaces to be laid out square and constructed to provide not less than one hundred and twenty-six (126) square feet of land area for each tree planting. These curbed islands shall be planted with sod (landscape rock, gravel, or other similar material is prohibited). Curbed, landscaped islands shall be placed at the ends of all parking space groupings to separate the parking spaces from the maneuvering lanes and to provide for safe traffic flow. These planting areas shall not be less than seven (7') feet in width. Trees shall be planted throughout the parking area. Trees shall be a minimum of three (3") inches caliper at the time of planting and shall be provided at a ratio of one (1) tree for each six (6) parking spaces or fraction thereof. These trees shall not be counted towards street frontage tree requirements. The following trees or similar types are suitable for parking lot and urban conditions: 
1.  White Fir (only when clear vision is maintained) 
2.  Norway Maple 
3.  Tulip Tree 
4.  Ginkgo Tree (male only) 
5.  Red Oak. 
B.  FRONTAGE LANDSCAPING. Large, deciduous street trees shall be provided within every zoning district. The trees shall be spaced evenly in a linear fashion along all road rights-of-way. One (1) tree shall be planted for each twenty-five (25') feet of road frontage and shall be planted five (5') feet outside of the road right-of-way. In the case of single-family residential development one (1) street tree shall be required per lot or for every forty (40') feet of road frontage, whichever is greater. The Planning Commission may approve plantings within the road right-of-way in instances where setbacks or other similar circumstances prevent the applicant from planting said trees outside of the public right-of-way. Where street trees are permitted to be planted within the road right-of-way, final approval of such plantings shall be granted by the Mount Clemens Superintendent of Streets. Plantings within the road right-of-way shall meet all requirements of the Mount Clemens Trees, Shrubs and Plants Ordinance. In no way shall the plantings impair the clear vision triangle. The trees shall be a minimum of three (3") inch caliper at the time of planting. These trees may not be counted towards parking lot tree requirements. 
C.  Landscaping of Buildings. Wherever a building is constructed which abuts a drive, service aisle, road, or other means of access or maneuvering, a minimum of seven (7') feet of landscaped area shall be provided around the equivalent of three sides or seventy-five (75) percent of the building. Landscaping shall not include walkways or paved service areas. One (1) small deciduous tree (see "Plant Material Size" Table) shall be provided for every twenty (20') feet of building length of such building. 
15.0114 - Sec. 11.4 
LOCATION AND SCREENING OF TRASH RECEPTACLES. 
    The location of trash receptacles shall be indicated on a site plan. All such trash receptacles shall be located so as to facilitate collection and minimize any negative impact on persons occupying the development site, neighboring properties, site traffic circulation patterns, or any public right-of-way. Trash receptacles shall not be located within the front yard. 
    All trash receptacles shall be screened on three (3) sides by durable masonry walls which are similar to, or compatible with, the exterior construction materials used elsewhere on site. The walls shall be constructed of either color impregnated poured concrete with a simulated brick pattern or decorative clay brick, the same as that used for the principle building. The dumpster enclosure shall not be painted. Further, the trash receptacle enclosure shall be complemented with evergreen plantings which provide a continuous screen. All trash receptacles shall be placed on an eight-by-ten foot (8'x10') concrete pad. Concrete or metal bollards shall be placed between the trash receptacle and the rear wall of the enclosure. The trash receptacle area shall be screened at the opening with a six (6') foot high metal framed wood screening gate. 
    The height of the masonry screening walls shall be six (6') feet. The walls shall be maintained so as to remain structurally sound and neat in appearance. Trash receptacles shall be so located and arranged to minimize their visibility from adjacent streets and uses. All trash receptacles shall be located on site to be as accessible as possible without interfering with vehicular circulation patterns. 
15.0115 - Sec. 11.5 
LOCATION AND SCREENING OF CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONING UNITS OR GENERATORS FOR A RESIDENTIAL USE. 
A.  Mechanical equipment such as central air conditioning units or generators, installed outside of residential dwellings and their attached structures, shall not result in being a noise nuisance and shall be subject to the following requirements: 
1.  The unit shall be located behind the rear wall of the structure, no less than three (3') feet from the wall of the main structure. However, generators shall be located a minimum of five (5) feet from the wall of the structure, unless otherwise permitted by the National Fire Protection Association. 
2.  In cases where a hardship exists which prevents the equipment from being located in a rear yard, the equipment may be located in a side yard. The Community Development Director shall make the determination of whether a hardship exists which prevents a rear yard location. All such equipment shall meet the minimum side yard setback requirements of this Ordinance. 
3.  All equipment shall be located on a concrete pad or other manufacturer recommended material as deemed acceptable by the Building Official. 
B.  All such equipment, wherever placed, must be properly screened from view and noise as required by the Community Development Department. Installation of any such equipment shall also comply with all other applicable provisions of the official Zoning Ordinance of the City of Mount Clemens, as amended.

15.0120 - ARTICLE 12: SPECIAL LAND USE APPROVAL 

15.0121 - Sec. 12.1 
SPECIAL LAND USE REVIEW REQUIREMENTS. 
    In all cases, the power to grant special land use approval is vested in the Planning Commission. All applications for special land use approval shall first be forwarded by the Community Development Department to the Planning Commission for review and processing. The application shall be submitted in the number of copies required and accompanied by the same number of site plans, all prepared and filed to meet the requirements of Article 3. 
    The Planning Commission shall review the application after proper notice has been given as required by State law and approve or deny the application. Approval may require conditions the Commission may find necessary; disapproval of the application will be accompanied by reasons in writing. If a public hearing is to be held as provided by State law, then the Planning Commission, after proper notice, shall hear any person wishing to express an opinion on the application. 
    The Planning Commission shall review each case individually as to its applicability and must find affirmatively to each of the following standards of the proposed land use if it is to be approved. 
A.  STANDARDS. 
1.  The proposed use shall be of such location, size and character that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the surrounding neighborhood and applicable regulations of the zoning district in which it is to be located. 
2.  The proposed use shall be of a nature that will make vehicular and pedestrian traffic no more hazardous than is normal for the district involved, taking into consideration vehicular turning movements in relation to routes of traffic flow, proximity and relationship to intersections, adequacy of sight distances, location and access of off-street parking and provisions for pedestrian traffic, with particular attention to minimizing pedestrian-vehicle conflicts. 
3.  The proposed use shall be designed as to the location, size, intensity, site layout and periods of operation of any such proposed use to eliminate any possible nuisance emanating therefrom which might be noxious to the occupants of any other nearby uses permitted, whether by reason of dust, noise, fumes, vibration, smoke or lights. 
4.  The proposed use shall be such that the proposed location and height of buildings or structures and location, nature and height of walls, fences and landscaping will not interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably affect their value. 
5.  The proposed use shall relate harmoniously with the physical and economic aspects of adjacent land uses as regards prevailing shopping habits, convenience of access by prospective patrons, continuity of development, and need for particular services and facilities in specific areas of the City. 
6.  The proposed use is necessary for the public convenience at the proposed location. 
7.  The proposed use is so designated, located, planned and operated so that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected. 
8.  The proposed use shall not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the vicinity in which it is to be located and will not be detrimental to existing and/or other permitted land uses in the zoning district. 
B.  DECISION. 
1.  Approval. If the Planning Commission determines that the particular special land use(s) should be allowed, it shall endorse its approval thereof on the written application and clearly set forth in writing thereon the particular use(s) which shall be allowed. Thereafter, the enforcing officer may issue a building permit in conformity with the particular special land use(s) so approved. In all cases where a particular special land use has been granted as provided herein, application for a building permit in pursuance thereof must be made and received by the City not later than two hundred seventy (270) days thereafter, or such approval shall automatically be revoked. The Planning Commission may grant an extension thereof for good cause shown under such terms and conditions and for such period of time not exceeding another two hundred seventy (270) days as it shall determine to be necessary and appropriate. 
2.  Denial. If the Planning Commission shall determine that the particular special land use(s) requested does not meet the standards of this Ordinance, it shall deny the application by a written endorsement thereon which clearly sets forth the reason for such denial. 
3.  Record. The decision on a special land use shall be incorporated in a statement of conclusions relative to the special land use under consideration. The decision shall specify the basis for the decision and any conditions imposed. 
4.  Hearings. The Planning Commission shall investigate the circumstances of each such case and give notice of the time and place of any hearing, meeting or review which may be held relative thereto as required by State law and/or its rules or procedure. 
5.  Conditions. The Planning Commission may impose such conditions or limitations in granting approval as may be permitted by State law and this Ordinance which it deems necessary to fulfill the spirit and purpose of this Ordinance. The conditions may include conditions necessary to insure that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by the land use or activity, to protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to insure compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner. Conditions imposed shall do all of the following: 
a.  Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety and welfare, as well as the social and economic well being of those who will use the land use or activity under consideration, residents and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the community as a whole. 
b.  Be related to the valid exercise of the police power and purposes which are affected by the proposed use or activity. 
c.  Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning regulations; be related to the standards established in this Ordinance for the land use or activity under consideration; and be necessary to insure compliance with those standards. 
6.  Once a Special Land Use has been approved, no Zoning Board of Appeals requests shall be permitted. Any changes in the development plans must be made in accordance with revision procedures contained herein. 
15.0122 - Sec. 12.2 
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT AND BUSINESS USES. 
A.  In the development and execution of this Ordinance, it is recognized that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. In addition to the review standards contained in this Article, additional special regulations are itemized in this Section. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses in any one area (i.e., not more than two (2) such uses within one thousand (1,000') feet of each other) which would create such adverse effects. 
B.  The Planning Commission may waive the locational requirement established in subsection A. herein for adult entertainment and business establishments if the following findings are made: 
1.  That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or injurious to nearby properties, and that the spirit and intent of this Ordinance will be observed. 
2.  That the proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development of a "skid row" area. 
3.  That the establishment of an additional regulated use in the area will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation. 
4.  That all applicable regulations of this Ordinance will be observed. 
C.  For establishments for the sale of beer or intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises, the City Commission may waive the locational requirements if the findings required in subsection B. can be made and after receiving a report and recommendation from the Planning Commission. 
D.  1.  It shall be unlawful to hereafter establish any adult book store, adult motion picture theater, adult novelty store, or class "D" cabaret within five hundred (500) feet of any building containing a residential dwelling or rooming unit. This prohibition may be waived if the person applying for the waiver shall file with the City Planning Commission a petition which indicates approval of the proposed regulated use by fifty-one (51) percent of the persons owning, residing or doing business within a radius of five hundred (500') feet of the location of the proposed use. The petitioner shall attempt to contact all eligible locations within this radius and must maintain a list of all addresses where no contact was made. 
2.  The City Clerk shall adopt rules and regulations governing the procedure for securing the petition of consent provided for in this Section of the Ordinance. The rules shall provide that the circulation of the petition requesting a waiver shall subscribe to an affidavit attesting to the fact that the petition was circulated in accordance with the rules of the City Clerk and that the circulation personally witnessed the signatures on the petition and that the same were affixed to the petition by the person whose name appeared thereon. 
3.  The City Planning Commission shall not consider the waiver of locational requirements set forth in subsections A., B. and C. until the above-described petition shall have been filed and verified.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUDs). 
    Purpose and Intent. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) concept is intended to provide a greater degree of flexibility in the regulation of land development and the arrangement of uses. Through this option, more creative approaches to development can be utilized which take advantage of the special characteristics of the land, which would otherwise not be possible through the strict enforcement of the Ordinance. The specific objectives of this article are to: 
Encourage innovation in land use and variety in design, layout and type of structures constructed; while preserving the intent and integrity of the City Master Plan. 
 Preserve significant natural resources. 
 Achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy, and the provision of public services and utilities. 
 Encourage the provision of useful open space. 
 Permit flexibility in the placement, lot area and building type regulations, while assuring the application of sound site planning standards. 
A.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) regulations that follow shall be applied to the initiation and regulation of all Planned Unit Development projects. Where there are conflicts between the PUD regulations herein and general zoning, subdivision, or other regulations or requirements, these regulations shall apply for the PUD project. Where the City Commission shall find, in the particular case and upon recommendation of the Planning Commission, that provisions herein do not serve the public purpose to a degree at least equivalent to such general zoning, subdivision or other regulations or requirements, the City may apply such standard requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, Land Division Ordinance or other standard regulations. 
1.  Ownership and Minimum Site Area. Any person or persons having a beneficial interest or right to obtain a beneficial interest in at least ten (10) acres of land may apply for development as a PUD under the procedures for, and in compliance with, the standards of this Article. 
2.  Access. The PUD must have direct access to a major or secondary road as defined in the City Master Plan. Local roads adjacent to the PUD shall not be used except for uses and traffic intensity compatible with the adjacent zoning. 
PUD Uses. 
a.  All uses permitted on a site under the existing zoning districts for the site shall be permitted in the PUD project. All such uses shall be subject to site plan approval. 
b.  All special land uses which may be considered for a site under the existing zoning district may be considered in the PUD project. All special land uses shall only be approved as part of a PUD upon a finding that the use or uses are consistent with all applicable special land use requirements and standards of Article 12 of the Zoning Ordinance. 
c.  The PUD shall include residential densities consistent with or less than what could be obtained through a conventional development on the residentially zoned property. The applicant shall submit a plan meeting all applicable ordinances to determine the permitted number of residential units within a PUD. 
d.  Non-residential uses shall not contain more floor area or impervious surfaces than what could be developed under conventional development standards. The applicant shall submit a plan meeting all Zoning Ordinance and other applicable ordinances to determine the permitted building size and impervious surface areas within a PUD. 
e.  The Planning Commission may accept a site land use plan which is consistent with the uses proposed in the City Master Plan. Such site land use plan will then govern the PUD development. 
3.  Open Space. At least ten (10) percent of the PUD shall be upland open space or upland parkland, exclusive of wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds, floodplains, retention/detention ponds or commercial recreation, such as, but not limited to golf courses. Such open space shall be in parcels not less than two (2) acres in size and in configuration and locations consistent with sound planning principles (i.e., central locations of parks for accessibility, use of open space and natural features as buffers). 
4.  Compatibility. Architectural features of all structures shall be designed to be compatibly integrated within the overall PUD. The plan shall demonstrate such common colors and architectural amenities. 
5.  Site Plans. The site plan shall provide for safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious groupings of structures, uses and facilities; for appropriate relation of space inside and outside buildings to intended uses and structural features; and for preservation of desirable natural or historic features and minimum disturbance of natural topography. In particular, streets, drives and parking and service areas shall provide safe and convenient access to dwelling units and general facilities and for service and emergency vehicles. 
6.  Suitability. The site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed, without hazards to persons or property, on or off the tract, from probability of flooding, erosion or other dangers, annoyances, or inconvenience. Condition of soil, ground water level, drainage and topography shall all be appropriate to both kind and pattern of use intended. 
7.  Layout. If appropriate to the form of planned development, lands to be included in the PUD may be divided by streets, right-of-way or easements, waterways, or other separation; but shall be so located, dimensioned and arranged as to permit unified planning and development and to meet all requirements in connection therewith, as well as to provide necessary protection against adverse relationships between uses in the PUD and uses in surrounding areas. 
8.  Perimeter and Internal Setbacks. Setbacks for buildings, parking areas or pavement (other than the access drive) shall be as follows: 
a.  No building, parking area or pavement (other than the access drive) shall be located within ten (10') feet of an external road right-of-way. 
b.  Required Front Yard Open Space: 
Regardless of use, no building or parking lot area shall encroach within ten (10') feet of an interior road right-of-way. 
c.  No parking lot area shall be constructed within twenty-five (25') feet of a single family residential structure. No non-residential parking lot area shall be constructed within twenty-five (25') feet of a multiple-family residential structure. In no case shall a parking area be located closer than seven (7') feet to any lot line. 
d.  Where setback criteria is not clearly provided within this subsection, the setbacks from the zoning district governing the subject use shall apply. In all cases, the Planning Commission may modify the required perimeter and interior setbacks upon a finding of one of following: 
(1)  adequate buffering exists between uses. 
(2)  other open space offered on the site will serve the intent of the setback. 
(3)  a mixed-use has been provided and no setbacks are established. 
(4)  layout, scale and architectural design are integrated into a compatible development scheme. 
10.  Bonus. The Planning Commission may award an applicant a development bonus with regard to the number of residential units permitted or the amount of square feet of non-residential building or impervious surface. Such bonus shall not exceed a five (5) percent increase in the number of residential units and shall not exceed a five (5) percent increase in the square footage allowance for non-residential structures or impervious areas. The Planning Commission may grant a bonus upon a finding that the applicant is preserving the natural features of the site or creating an environmental asset on the site. 
11.  Submission and Review Requirements. 
a.  Pre-application. Prior to filing an application for a Planned Unit Development, a pre-application conference shall be held with the Planning Commission at which time consideration of basic site information and sketch plans will be discussed. If the project is to be developed in phases, the pre-application conference shall include a discussion of each development phase and an anticipated timetable for development. Such pre-application conference shall be conducted as a Public Hearing. Following the pre-application conference with the Planning Commission, a planned unit development application shall be prepared and submitted by the applicant. 
b.  Application. The applicant shall submit the required number of prints of the preliminary development plan to the Planning Commission. The preliminary development plan shall contain, in addition to the requirements of Article 3, the following:

d.  Following said public hearing, the Planning Commission shall, within a reasonable time, forward their report and recommendation to the City Commission. 
e.  Planned Unit Development District Rezoning. Upon receipt of the report and recommendation from the Planning Commission, the City Commission may approve said rezoning and the accompanying plan as a single unit. 
(1)  If the City Commission shall determine to grant the application and approve the PUD zoning district with plan, it shall do so by adopting an ordinance amending the zoning ordinance and establishing the "P" overlay zoning district. 
(2)  If the application is denied, the City Commission shall specify, in writing, the reason for the denial. 
(3)  Once an area has been rezoned as a Planned Unit Development and a plan has been approved by the City Commission, no development may take place in such area, nor may any use thereof be made, except in accordance with the plan approved or in accordance with a City Commission approved amendment thereto. 
(4)  Within a period of two (2) years following approval by the City Council, final site and engineering plans for at least fifteen (15%) percent of the entire area embraced within the PUD approved for development must be submitted as hereinafter provided. Submittal of plans for an additional ten (10%) percent of the entire area must be made prior to the expiration of each successive two (2) year period thereafter. If such plans have not been submitted and approved within the two (2) year period, the right to develop under the approved plan shall terminate unless the time for submitting final plans is extended in writing by the City Commission. In such instances, the underlying zoning shall once again govern the property. 
f.  Submission of Site Plans and Engineering by Phase. 
(1)  A PUD may be developed in phases. Each phase prepared by the developer shall be in conformity with the approved PUD plan. 
(2)  The phase plan shall indicate necessary utilities, roads, environmental features (including landscape common areas and streetscape amenities) and conceptual building and parking layouts. All PUD site improvements necessary to service the entire phase shall be developed prior to, or in conjunction with, any initial individual site development. 
(3)  A conceptual building and parking layout shall be provided for all PUD areas within the phase which are not ready for final site plan submission at this time. 
(4)  For those improvements to be constructed at this time, final site plans or plats may be submitted simultaneously with the phase plan. All such final plans shall include the following: 
i.  A detailed site plan, fully dimensioned, showing a fully scaled plan view of all buildings, all public road right-of-way and private streets, densities, parking areas, utilities, parks, playgrounds, and areas to be set aside for the use of the public or by residents within the development. 
ii.  Floor plans and elevations typical of all buildings, except detached single-family, shall be submitted. 
iii.  Each plat or site plan submitted within the Planned Unit Development shall, either individually or in combination with previously approved project areas, meet the standards of this Section as to density and open space requirements. Open space shall be computed as a proportionate amount of the total open space requirement. 
iv.  All open space/common areas for use by the public or the residents shall be designated on the plan and shall be irrevocably committed to such uses by dedication, restrictive covenants, or in some manner satisfactory to the City Commission. 
v.  The final site plan shall be in conformity with the preliminary original plan previously approved. 
vi.  Provisions satisfactory to the City Commission shall be made to provide for the financing of any improvements shown on the plan for open spaces and common areas (if such open space and common areas are not to be improved prior to occupancy within the phase). The applicant shall provide for the maintenance of such improvements in a form satisfactory to the City Commission. 
vii.  The cost of installing all streets and the necessary utilities shall be assured by a means satisfactory to the City. 
viii.  Approval of the site plan shall be effective for a period of three (3) years. Failure to complete development in that period shall void the site plan and the Planned Unit Development and the subject site shall revert to its underlying zoning district.

WIRELESS COMMUNICATION TOWERS. 
    Wireless communication towers, including their respective transmission towers, relay and/or receiving antennas, and normal accessory facilities involved in television, radio, microwave, cable systems, cellular, personal communication, and similar communication services and facilities, shall be permitted as a special land use in the Light and Heavy Industrial Districts, when found to be essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare and in conformance with the following requirements: 
A.  The applicant shall submit a written statement and technical verification regarding the nature of any transmissions, electromagnetic fields, or any other radiation emitted from the facility, and any potential hazards to humans, animals, and/or any other materials or property in the area. Further, communication towers and facilities shall be designed and operated to prevent broadcast interference with any equipment located on nearby properties. 
B.  A written explanation of the design characteristics and ability of the structure(s) and attendant facilities to withstand winds, ice and other naturally occurring hazards shall be submitted. This information shall also address the potential for the tower or other mounting structure and/or antennae to topple over or collapse, and what tower configuration should be expected in such an event. Technical documentation of any information regarding these concerns shall also be provided. Monopole (stealth or equivalent type) antenna structures shall be required where such are technologically feasible. In all cases, communication towers shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment to the maximum extent feasible. 
C.  In order to maximize the efficiency of providing such services, while minimizing the negative impact of such facilities on the City, co-location of such facilities on an existing tower or other existing structure is required, when feasible. An applicant shall furnish written documentation as to why a co-location at another site is not feasible and whether they have, in fact, contacted the owners of existing facilities to determine if co-location is possible. If the application represents a new tower/antenna facility, the applicant shall provide a letter of intent to lease any excess space on a tower facility and shall commit itself to: 
1.  Promptly responding to any requests for information from a potential co-user of their tower/antenna; 
2.  Negotiate in good faith and allow for leased, shared use of the facility, when it is technically practical; and 
3.  Make no more than a reasonable charge for a shared use lease. 
If the application involves co-location on an existing tower or structure, the public hearing requirements shall be waived and approval shall only include a site plan and documentation by the co-user as to their compliance with all of the terms and conditions required of the host applicant. Co-location may be permitted by the Planning Commission, after site plan review, on all existing towers and existing similar structures, regardless of the zoning district in which it is located. 
D.  Approval of a communication tower facility shall not be granted until such time that the applicant has demonstrated all of the following: 
1.  The proposed facility is needed because of proximity to an interstate highway or major thoroughfare, or is in proximity to areas of population concentration, or concentration of commercial, industrial, and/or business centers; or 
2.  The proposed facility is needed because there are areas where signal interference has occurred due to tall buildings, masses of trees or other obstructions; and 
3.  The proposed facility is needed because the telecommunications provider is unable to co-locate its facility with another provider or other structure; and 
4.  The proposed facility is needed to complete its grid as it relates to the needs of the City of Mount Clemens, and its surrounding communities and that there are no suitable sites in any of said surrounding communities; and 
5.  The proposed facility is designed to operate within the requirements for radio frequency emissions of the Federal Communications Commission and applicant has operated similar facilities within these requirements consistently. 
E.  The development of any such facility, together with accessory uses, shall be in such a location, size and character as to be compatible with the orderly development of the zoning districts in which it is situated and shall not be detrimental to the orderly and reasonable development or use of properties in the adjacent areas or the community at large. Furthermore, the location and improvement of facilities, as provided for herein, shall also be subject to the following additional requirements. 
1.  Towers may be located in the I-1 and I-2 Zoning Districts after special land use approval, and provided the location of such facilities do not represent a hazard to the use and/or development of other uses on the site and in the area. The development of new towers is specifically prohibited in all other zoning districts in the City. The City strongly encourages the development of required towers on suitable City property. Consult with the City Community Development Department with regard to City property locations prior to submitting an application. 
2.  The site shall be of such size and shape that the proposed tower facility may be developed in compliance with all requirements of the City, and any such tower/antenna shall not exceed one hundred sixty (160) feet in height above the average grade around the structure it is mounted upon. 
3.  The tower site shall meet all City standards relating to drainage, lighting, landscaping, general safety and other applicable standards. All landscaping shall be placed in an aesthetically pleasing and functional manner. Such landscaping shall be incorporated along access drives servicing the tower site and around fencing and all associated cabinets. Maintenance of all landscaped areas associated with the construction of a tower or the co-location of an antenna shall be the sole responsibility of the tower owner. All landscaped areas shall be continuously maintained in a sound, weed-free, healthy and vigorous growing condition. All unhealthy and dead material shall be replaced within one (1) year. 
4.  All communication towers and facilities shall be surrounded by a six (6') foot fence to prevent unauthorized access and vandalism, six (6') foot high evergreen trees shall be placed at intervals of ten (10') foot on center outside of said fence to screen the tower base and ancillary facilities. 
5.  Lighting associated with communication towers and facilities shall comply with all applicable FAA regulations. Where tower lighting is required, it shall be shielded or directed to the maximum extent possible to minimize the amount of light that falls onto nearby properties. 
6.  A twelve (12') foot wide paved access road shall be provided and maintained in a good condition to provide access for service and emergency vehicles. Such access road shall meet all City engineering design requirements. 
7.  Setback requirements will be determined in relation to the tower/antenna design and collapse data previously required in this Section. Minimum setback requirements, unless otherwise provided for, are as follows: 
a.  When adjacent to non-residential zoning districts, the setback shall not be less than the overall height of the tower/antennas. This setback requirement shall also apply to any accessory buildings. If the design and collapse data for the tower properly documents its ability to collapse down upon itself, the setback requirements to any side or rear yard property line abutting a non-residential zoning district may be reduced to one-half the overall height of the tower. In no instance shall any tower facility be located within a front yard. Accessory buildings shall be screened from view by an obscuring greenbelt. 
b.  When adjacent to any residential zoning district, the tower setback shall not be less than the overall height of the tower/antennas, plus fifty (50) feet. If the design and collapse data for the tower properly documents its ability to collapse down upon itself, the setback requirement to any side or rear yard property line abutting any residential district may be reduced to the overall height of the tower/antenna. In no instance shall any tower be located within a required front yard. Accessory buildings and uses shall be screened from the view of any public right-of-way and residential zoning district by an obscuring greenbelt. 
c.  Further modifications to the side and rear yard setbacks may be considered when it is documented that the adjacent property is unbuildable due to wetlands, floodplains or other significant limitations. It shall also be found that no adverse effects on reasonable development patterns in the area would be created by developing the tower. 
8.  Cellular antennae and supporting structures shall be permitted to be attached to buildings and structures in all zoning districts whether or not they are accessory to the building use, subject to the following conditions. 
a.  The principal use is a conforming use and the building is a conforming structure. 
b.  If connected directly to the main building, antennae may be attached to any portion of the building. Such antennae or antennae with supporting structure may not exceed twenty (20') feet in height. 
c.  The structure that supports antennae may not exceed ten (10') feet in height. 
d.  Such antennae with supporting structure shall not be credited to the overall height of the building. 
e.  Any structure that supports antennae shall be setback from the outermost vertical wall or parapet of the building, a distance equal to at least two times the height of such supporting structure. 
F.  In addition to site plan review, the Commission, with a majority vote, may require an independent third party review of an application. Such review shall be conducted by a professional engineer specializing in this type of communication technology and will be paid for by the applicant. The requirement for such a review shall be based on one or more of the following findings: 
1.  The applicant has not substantiated a need for a proposed tower to the satisfaction of the Commission. 
2.  The applicant has been unable to disprove the ability to co-locate on an existing tower or structure to the satisfaction of the Commission. 
3.  The applicant has not substantiated the structural safety of a structure to be commensurate with the requested setback. 
4.  The data supplied by the applicant is determined to be disorganized, confusing or misleading by the Commission. 
5.  The applicant has not substantiated that alternative technology cannot be utilized as a substitute to the proposed tower construction. 
G.  All structures, buildings and required improvements shall comply with all other applicable codes and ordinances and shall be continuously maintained in a safe, healthful and complying condition. Every telecommunication provider with sites located in Mount Clemens shall provide the City with an annual report disclosing the radio frequency emissions of each tower or antenna it has within the City, and require annual inspections of radio frequency emissions of each tower or antenna by the City to insure that they are being operated within the requirements of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The permit may include a requirement for periodic structural and safety inspections and reports, as deemed necessary by the City Commission. The City shall charge a fee for the annual inspection to cover its costs. 
H.  Every telecommunication provider with sites located in Mount Clemens shall attend an annual meeting with the City Administration to advise the City of their current and future needs and plans, changes of technology, and possible modifications of their systems in Mount Clemens. The purpose of these meetings shall be to foster a better understanding of the needs of the industry, the concerns of the City, and promote a mutually beneficial working relationship between the two in order to better serve the community. 
I.  A condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility shall be adequate provision for the removal of the facility by users and owners when the facility has not been used for one hundred eighty (180) days or more. Removal of the tower/antenna and its accessory use facilities shall also include removing the top three (3) feet of the caisson upon which the tower is located and covering the remaining portion with top soil. For purposes of this Section, the removal of towers, antennas or other equipment from the facility, or the cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of radio signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse. 
J.  The applicant shall deposit with the City, in a form which is satisfactory to the City, a performance guarantee in an amount established by the City Commission resolution as security for the removal of tower if abandoned for use of cellular facilities.

15.0130 - ARTICLE 13: NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES 

15.0131 - Sec. 13.1 
PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES. 
    It is the intent to recognize that the elimination, as expeditiously as is reasonable, of existing structures and uses that are not in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance, is as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new structures and uses that would violate the provisions of this Ordinance. It is therefore, the intent to administer the elimination of nonconforming structures and uses, recognizing established private property rights, and avoiding any undue hardship. The following regulations shall apply to all nonconforming buildings and structures, or parts thereof, and nonconforming uses existing at the effective date of this Ordinance. 
A.  CONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING BUILDING. Any such nonconforming building or structure may be continued and maintained, provided there is no physical change other than necessary maintenance and repair in such building or structure, except as permitted hereinafter in subsections F., G. and H. 
B.  CONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING USE. Any such nonconforming use may be continued and maintained, provided there is no increase or enlargement of the area, space or volume occupied by, or devoted to, such nonconforming use within a building or on site. 
C.  CHANGE OF USE. The nonconforming use of a building, structure or land may not be changed to a different use unless one of the following conditions has been met: 
1.  Such different use is permitted in the Zoning District under which the property is currently zoned, subject to site plan review and approval as required in the Zoning Ordinance. 
2.  Such proposed use, while still nonconforming, is considered less intense than the previous nonconforming use as determined by the Mount Clemens Planning Commission, and would bring the site closer into conformance with existing Ordinance standards. A use may be deemed more intense if the Planning Commission determines that the proposed use meets any of the following criteria: 
a.  The proposed use generates more light, noise, air, or other pollution than the current use; 
b.  The proposed use generates more traffic and/or turning movements, or negatively alters the traffic circulation pattern on or off the site; 
c.  The use generates a greater need for parking on site; 
d.  The proposed use causes greater negative economic impacts on adjacent properties than the current use. 
Where a use change requires submission of a site plan, the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable zoning provisions as is deemed reasonably feasible by the Mount Clemens Planning Commission. Site plan compliance shall include but not be limited to such items as parking, landscaping, and signage. 
D.  ABANDONMENT; TERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING USE. Any part of a building, structure or land occupied by a nonconforming use which hereafter is abandoned and remains unoccupied for a continuous period of one (1) year shall not thereafter be occupied, except by a use which conforms to the use regulations of the district in which it is located. 
E.  CHANGE OF TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP. There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of an existing nonconforming use, provided there is no change in the nature or character of such nonconforming use. 
F.  MAINTENANCE PERMITTED. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a nonconforming building or structure may be maintained. The maintenance of such building or structure shall include necessary repairs and incidental alterations, which alterations, however, shall not extend to the extent or degree or nonconformity of such building or structure to this Ordinance, provided that in a building which is nonconforming as to use regulations, no structural alterations shall be made, except those required by law or ordinance. Provided further, that the cost of such work shall not exceed thirty (30) percent of the assessed valuation of such building or structure at the time such work is done. This requirement shall not be considered as prohibiting the bringing of a structure into conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
G.  RESTORATION OF DAMAGED BUILDING. A nonconforming building or structure having been damaged or partially destroyed by fire or other calamity to an extent not exceeding sixty (60) percent of its assessed valuation, exclusive of foundations, at that time, may be restored; and its immediately previous occupancy or use existing at the time of such partial destruction may be continued or be resumed, provided that such reconstruction is approved by variance as authorized under Article 14 hereof, and the work of restoration is commenced within one (1) year of the date of such partial destruction and is diligently carried on to completion. Whenever a nonconforming building or structure is damaged in excess of sixty (60) percent of its assessed valuation, exclusive of foundations, at that time, the repair or reconstruction of such building shall conform to all of the regulations of the district in which it is located and it shall be treated as a new building. 
H.  ADDITIONS, ENLARGEMENTS, MOVING. 
1.  A building or structure, nonconforming as to height regulations, may be added to or enlarged if such addition or enlargement conforms to the regulations of the district in which it is located. In such case, such addition or enlargement shall be treated as a separate building or structure in determining conformity to all of the requirements of this Ordinance. 
2.  When a building or structure, or portion thereof, is moved from one district to another or to another location within the same district, it must conform or be made to conform to all of the regulations, ordinances and codes of the district to which it is moved. 
I.  EXPANSION PROHIBITED. A nonconforming use of a portion of a building or structure, which building or structure otherwise conforms to the provisions of this Ordinance, shall not be expanded or extended into any other portion of such conforming building or structure, nor changed, except to a conforming use. If such nonconforming use, or portion thereof, is discontinued or changed to a conforming use, any future use of such building, structure, or portion thereof, shall be in conformity to the regulations of the district in which such building or structure is located. 
J.  NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND. Continuation of Use. The nonconforming use of land (where no building is involved) existing at the date this Ordinance becomes effective, may be continued, provided that: 
1.  No such nonconforming use of land shall in any way be expanded or extended either on the same or adjoining property. 
2.  If such nonconforming use of land or any portion thereof is discontinued or changed, any future use of such land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. 
K.  COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS FOR NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS OR USES. Whenever the owner shall fail to comply with the provisions of this Ordinance relating to removal or discontinuance of a nonconforming use, the Community Development Director shall serve notice in writing on such owner or his agent requiring him to comply therewith within a reasonable time after such notice. If, after such notice, the owner fails to comply therewith, the Community Development Director shall take such action as may be necessary, including civil action, to cause compliance with the provisions hereof. 
L.  NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD. Division of Nonconforming Lot. Parcels shall not be divided in a manner that increases nonconformity, causes an existing structure or site improvement to become nonconforming, or creates one or more nonconforming lots. 
M.  USE OF A NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD. Any nonconforming lot of record shall only be used as permitted in the district in which it is located. A single nonconforming lot may be developed or improved with a principal building and permitted accessory structures, without the need for a variance, provided that the following conditions have been met: 
1.  The structure and lot shall conform with all applicable yard dimensions, setbacks and other requirements, other than minimum lot width and lot area, for the district in which it is located. 
2.  The lot in question meets seventy-five percent (75) of the minimum lot width and lot area requirements of the district in which it is located. 
3.  The lot is not under contiguous single ownership with other lots that could be combined into one or more conforming lots. 
N.  CONTIGUOUS NONCONFORMING LOTS UNDER THE SAME OWNERSHIP. Two or more contiguous, nonconforming lots under the same ownership shall be considered one parcel. The applicant shall not be permitted to make improvements to the parcel prior to combining such lots to create one conforming lot of record.
