PREFACE
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Grand Ledge, Michigan. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2002 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council through February 27, 2017. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2002 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Mary Margaret Bielby, Code Attorney, and Amanda Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Gregory L. Newman, City Clerk, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

Section 1. Change. The City adopts the Code entitled "City Code," published by Municipal Code Corporation, consisting of chapters 1 through 46, each inclusive. 
Section 2. Repeal. The City repeals all ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before 27 February 2017, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein. This repeal shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
Section 3. Penalties. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule, or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500.00 and costs of prosecution, or by imprisonment for a period of not more than 90 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. However, unless otherwise provided by law, a person convicted of a violation of this Code which substantially corresponds to a violation of state law that is a misdemeanor for which the maximum period of imprisonment is 93 days, is punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.00 and costs of prosecution, or by imprisonment for a period of not more than 93 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall continue or occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the City may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief, and revocation of licenses or permits. 
Section 4. Additions and Amendments. Additions and amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the City to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

Section 5. Severability. The provisions of this ordinance are severable, and if any section, sub-section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this ordinance is, for any reason, held invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of all remaining sections, sub-sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases or portions of this ordinance. 
Section 6. Section Headings. The section headings used in this ordinance are for convenience only and are not a part of this ordinance.

CHAPTER 5. OFFICERS AND PERSONNEL
 
Sec. 5.1. Eligibility.
A.	No person shall hold any elective office of the city unless they have resided in the city for a minimum of one year and is a registered elector of the city on the last day for filing nominating petitions or filing fee for such office or prior to their appointment to fill a vacancy. 
B.	A councilmember shall be a registered elector of the ward they represent, and from which elected or for which appointed. 
C.	No person who is in default to the city shall be eligible for any elective or appointive position. The holding of office by any person who is in default shall create a vacancy unless such default shall be eliminated within 30 days after written notice thereof has been served at their last known place of residence by the City Clerk upon the direction of the City Council, or, unless the officer contests their liability for the default in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
D.	No person who holds or has held the office of mayor or councilmember shall be eligible to hold any appointive office for which there is compensation paid by the city until six months has elapsed following retirement or resignation. This provision would not apply to appointments where nominal compensation may be paid by the city. 
E.	No administrative officer, person holding an appointive position, or employee shall hold an elective office of the city unless they resign their position with the city upon election or appointment to elective city office. 
F.	All administrative officers (see section 7.1) shall be United States citizens. 
 
Sec. 5.2. Nepotism.
Unless the City Council shall, by majority vote, record as part of its official proceedings, a determination that the best interests of the city shall be served, family members of any elective or administrative officer are disqualified from holding any appointive office or employment during the term for which said elective or appointive officer was elected or appointed. This section shall in no way disqualify such family members who are bona fide appointive officers or employees of the city at the time of the election or appointment of said official. 
 
Sec. 5.3. Oath and bond.
Every officer, elective or appointive, before entering upon the duties of that office, shall qualify by taking the oath of office prescribed for public officers by the constitution of the State of Michigan, and by filing the oath with the City Clerk, together with any bond required by state law, this Charter or by the City Council. In case of failure to comply with the provisions of this section within 20 days from the date they are notified in writing of that officer's election or appointment, such officer shall be deemed to have declined the office and such office shall thereupon become vacant unless the City Council shall, by resolution, extend the time in which such officer may qualify as above set forth. 
 
Sec. 5.4. Official bond.
A.	Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, all officers of the city whose duties involve the custody of public property or the handling of public funds, either by way of receipt or disbursement or both, and all other officers and employees so required by the City Council shall, before they enter upon the duties of their respective offices, file with the city an official bond in such form and amount as the City Council shall direct and approve. 
B.	The official bond of every officer or employee whose duty it may be to receive or pay out money shall be conditioned that they will, upon demand, pay over or account for to the city, or any proper officer or agent thereof, all moneys received by them as such officer or employee. The requirements of this paragraph may be met by the purchase of one or more appropriate blanket official bonds covering all, or a group of, city employees and officers. 
C.	All official bonds shall be corporate official bonds and the premiums thereon shall be paid by the city. The City Clerk shall be custodian of all bonds of all officers or employees except that the City Manager shall be custodian of any bonds pertaining solely to the City Clerk. 
 
Sec. 5.5. Succession.
Whenever any officer or employee shall cease to hold such office or employment for any reason whatsoever, they shall, within five days or sooner on demand, deliver to their successor in office or to that officer's or employee's superior all the books, papers, money, equipment, and effects in their custody that in any manner pertain to that office. Any officer violating this provision may be proceeded against in the same manner as public officers generally for a like offense under the laws of the State of Michigan. 
 
Sec. 5.6. Declaring vacancy.
The office of councilmember or mayor shall become vacant (a) upon the official's death; (b) resignation; (c) removal from office in a manner authorized by this Charter or by law; (d) ceasing to possess the qualifications of office required by this Charter; (e) unexcused absence from four consecutive regular meetings of City Council or 25 percent of such meetings in any twelve-month period; (f) being found guilty of misconduct of office by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (g) if no person is elected to, or qualified for, the office at the election at which such office is to be filled. 
 
Sec. 5.7. Removal.
Removal by the City Council of elective officers shall be made for either of the following reasons: 
A.	For any reason specified by state law for removal of city officers by the governor; or 
B.	For any act declared by this Charter to constitute misconduct in office. 
Such removals by the City Council shall be made only after a hearing of which the officer has been given notice by the City Clerk at least ten days in advance, either personally or by certified mail, addressed to the officer in question at the last known place of residence of that officer. Such notice shall include a copy of the charges against the officer. The hearing shall afford an opportunity to the officer, in person or by their attorney, to be heard in their defense, to cross-examine witnesses and to present testimony. If the officer shall neglect to appear, without good cause, at the hearing and answer the charges, their failure to do so may be deemed cause for removal. A majority vote of the members of the City Council in office at the time, exclusive of any member whose removal is being considered, shall be required for any such removal. 
 
Sec. 5.8. Resignation.
Resignation of elective officers and of members of boards and commissions shall be made in writing and filed with the City Clerk and shall be acted upon by the City Council at its next regular or special meeting following receipt thereof by the City Clerk and is irrevocable upon acceptance. Resignations of appointive officers shall be made in writing to the appointing officer or body and shall be acted upon immediately. 
 
Sec. 5.9. Filling vacancies.
A.	The City Council shall fill a vacancy in the office of City Council by giving public notice, soliciting applicants, and appointment of a qualified, registered elector within 60 days from the date the vacancy was created. The appointment shall be for the balance of the term if the vacancy occurs within 30 months of the expiration of the term. If the unexpired term exceeds 30 months, the appointee shall hold office only until the first City Council meeting following the certification of the next regular city election, at which election the office shall be filled for the remainder of the term. 
B.	Vacancies in appointive offices shall be filled in the manner provided for making the original appointment. In the case of members of boards and commissions appointed for a definite term, such appointments shall be for the unexpired term. 
 
Sec. 5.10. Term of office.
Except by procedures provided by law or in this Charter, the terms of office of the elective officers, boards, and commissions shall not be shortened or extended beyond the term for which said officer was elected or person appointed, provided that the elected official or appointed person may continue to hold their position or office until a qualified successor is either elected or appointed. 
 
CHAPTER 6. CITY COUNCIL
 
Sec. 6.1. Regular meetings.
The City Council shall hold at least one meeting each month and provide for the time and place of its regular meetings.

Subject to the requirements of the Open Meetings Act, 1976 PA 267, as amended, the City Council may meet in emergency session on shorter notice in the event of a severe and imminent threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public. 
B.	No business shall be transacted at any special meetings of the City Council unless the same shall have been stated in the notice of such meetings. However, any business that might lawfully come before a regular meeting may be transacted at such special meeting if all the members present consent thereto and the business is not in conflict with this Charter. 
 
Sec. 6.3. Quorum.
Four members of the City Council shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the City Council. In the absence of a quorum, any number of members less than a quorum may adjourn any regular or special meeting to a later date.

C.	The City Council shall, not later than June 30, or such other date as may be established by ordinance, adopt, by resolution, a General Appropriations Act and any necessary Special Appropriations Acts, meeting the requirements of the Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act for the next fiscal year.

Each annual levy, determined by the City Council, shall include at least one mill for parks and recreation. 
B.	The foregoing tax limitation may be increased for any fiscal year of the city by a majority of the electors of the city voting on the question at a regular or special election.

C.	The subjects of ad valorem taxation for municipal purposes shall be the same as for state, county, school, and any other taxing entities under the law.

Sec. 10.5. Jeopardy assessments.
If the City Treasurer finds or reasonably believes that any person, who is, or may be, liable for taxes upon personal property, the taxable status of which was in the city on tax day, intends to depart or has departed from the city; or to remove or has removed therefrom personal property, which is, or may be, liable for taxation; or to conceal or conceals their person or their property; or does any other act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partly ineffectual, the proceedings to collect such tax, unless proceedings therefore be brought without delay, the City Treasurer shall proceed to collect the same as a jeopardy assessment in the manner provided by law. 
 
Sec. 10.6. Assessment.
The City Assessor shall annually place a value, in accordance with law, upon all property, both real and personal, in the city, which is subject to taxation.

A.	Prior to the date of the first meeting of the board of review in each year, or other date required by law, the City Assessor shall prepare and certify an assessment roll of all property in the city, in the manner and form provided in the general tax law of the State of Michigan. Such roll may be divided into volumes that the City Assessor shall identify by number, for the purpose of convenience in handling the assessment roll and for locating properties assessed therein. The attachment of any certificate or warrant required by this chapter to any volumes of the roll, either as an assessment roll or as a tax roll, shall constitute the attachment thereof to the entire roll, provided the several volumes are identified in such certificate or warrant. Values of property set forth on the assessment roll shall be determined according to recognized methods of systematic assessment. 
B.	The City Assessor shall give notice by first class mail to each owner of property which has been added to the assessment roll or the value of which has been increased or decreased on such roll. The notice shall be addressed to the owner according to the records of the City Assessor's office and mailed not less than twenty-one days before the date of the convening of the board of review. Neither the failure of the City Assessor to give notice nor the failure of a person to receive notice shall invalidate any assessment roll or any assessment thereon. 
C.	After the board of review has completed its review of the assessment roll, the majority of its members shall sign a certificate to the effect that the same is the assessment roll of the city for the year in which it has been prepared, as approved by the board of review, which certificate, when attached to any volume of the roll, shall constitute a conclusive presumption of the validity of the entire roll. 
D.	Upon the certification by the board of review the assessment roll, and from and after midnight ending the last day of the meeting of the board of review, it shall be the assessment roll of the city for county, school, and city taxes, and for other taxes on real and personal property that may be authorized by law.

Sec. 10.8. Tax roll.

After extending the taxes and placing other assessments and charges upon the roll, the City Assessor shall certify said tax roll and attach the City Assessor's warrant, directing and requiring the City Treasurer to collect from the several persons named in said roll the several sums mentioned therein opposite their respective names as a tax or assessment, and granting the City Treasurer for the purpose of collecting the taxes, assessments, and charges on such roll, all the power and immunities possessed by city treasurers for the collection of taxes under the general laws of the state. 
E.	All taxes, special assessments, charges, and collection fees, on the city tax roll which remain unpaid on the first day of March following the date when said roll was received by the City Treasurer shall, on that date, become delinquent and shall be returned to the county treasurer at the time and in the same manner and with like effect as returns by township treasurers of township, school, and county taxes. 
F.	Such returns shall be made upon a delinquent tax roll to be prepared by the City Treasurer and shall include all the additional charges which shall, in such return, be added to the amount assessed in said tax roll against each description. The taxes, assessments, charges, and fees, thus returned shall be collected in the same manner as taxes returned to the county treasurer are collected under the provisions of the general laws of the State of Michigan and shall be and remain a lien upon the lands against which they are assessed until paid. 
 
Sec. 10.9. Liens.
A.	All taxes thus assessed shall become a debt due the city as provided by general law and, as of August 1 of the year of assessment, the said taxes with any applicable charges, fees, or penalties shall become a lien upon the property against which they are assessed until paid. 
B.	The city shall have the power, insofar as the exercise thereof shall not conflict with or contravene the provisions of law, to acquire such interest in any premises within the city, by purchase at any tax or other public sale, or by direct purchase from or negotiation with the State of Michigan or the owner, as may be necessary to assure to the city the collection of its taxes, special assessments, charges, and any interest thereon which are levied against any lot or parcel of real property or to protect the lien of the city therefore, and may hold, lease, or sell the same. Any such procedure exercised by the city to ensure the collection of its taxes or the protection of its tax or other liens shall be deemed to be for a public purpose.

B.	The City Treasurer shall not be required to make personal demand for the payment of taxes, but, upon receipt of the city tax roll, shall, forthwith, give notice to the taxpayers of the city by forwarding a tax statement to each person named in the tax roll, which mailed statement shall be a sufficient demand for the payment of all taxes assessed. Neither the failure on the part of the City Treasurer to mail such statement nor the failure of any person to receive the same, shall invalidate the taxes on the tax roll or release any person or property assessed from the liabilities provided in this Charter in case of nonpayment. 
C.	The City Council shall, provide by ordinance, for a tax payment schedule and the amount of collection charges, penalties and interest to be added to taxes, charges, and assessments on the city tax roll. When so added, such collection charges, penalties, and interest shall be treated in all respects as an item of taxes and collected as such. Any collection charges, penalties, and interest shall be collectable in the same manner as taxes, assessments, and charges to which they are added. 
 
Sec. 10.11. Failure or refusal to pay personal property tax.
If any person shall neglect or refuse to pay any tax on personal property assessed to such person, the City Treasurer shall collect the same by seizing any personal property of such person, to an amount sufficient to pay such tax, together with any charges and interest added thereto, wherever the same may be found in the State of Michigan. No property shall be exempt from such seizure. The City Treasurer may sell the property seized, at an amount sufficient to pay the taxes and all charges, fees, penalties, and interest, in accordance with statutory provisions.

Sec. 11.3. Reconsideration of petitions.
In the event that the City Council shall fail to make any public improvement petitioned for as required by ordinance during the calendar year during which the petition is filed because of lack of funds therefore, such petition shall be reconsidered by the City Council prior to March 1 of the succeeding calendar year for the purpose of determining whether such improvement should be made during such fiscal year. 
 
Sec. 11.4. Condemnation costs.
The cost of condemning or otherwise acquiring property needed for any public improvement shall constitute a part of the cost of the improvement, but in no case shall the amount of such cost which is included in any special assessment for any improvement cause the assessment to exceed the amount of the benefit received on account of the improvement by any property assessed.

Such lien shall be of the same character and effect as that created by this Charter for city taxes and shall be treated as such in all procedures for the collection of special assessments and all collection fees or charges and interest, which may have been added or accumulated thereto. 
 
Sec. 11.7. Account.
Moneys raised by special assessment for any public improvement shall be credited to a special assessment account, and shall be used to pay the special assessment portion of the cost of the improvement for which the assessment was levied and of expenses incidental thereto, including the repayment of the principal of and interest on money borrowed therefore, and to refund excessive assessments if refunds be authorized.

The City Council shall establish the procedure for making this section effective.

All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for in the original assessment, and whenever any sum or part thereof levied upon any property in the assessment so set aside has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied upon the reassessment or if the payments exceed the amount of the reassessment, refunds shall be made.

The commission shall have the power to agree with the applicant upon use, height, area, or bulk requirements or restrictions governing buildings and premises within the subdivision, provided that such requirements or restrictions do not authorize the violation of the then-effective zoning ordinance of the municipality. Such requirements or restrictions shall be stated upon the plat prior to the approval and recording thereof and shall have the same force of law and be enforceable in the same manner and with the same sanctions and penalties and subject to the same power of amendment or repeal as though set out as part of the zoning ordinance or map of the municipality.

(Code 2002, § 69-2)
 
Sec. 8-98. Enforcement.
The City Assessor shall be the person with overall administrative and coordination responsibility to administer and enforce this article. 
(Code 2002, § 69-3)
 
Sec. 8-99. Use of words and terms.

(Code 2002, § 69-4)
 
Sec. 8-100. Definitions.
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article all have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Address means the combination of a set of numbers and a street prefix (N, S, E, W), a street name, and a street suffix (such as NE, SE, SW, NW) to designate the quadrant of the city in which the property is located. 
Address number means a set of numbers.

Sec. 8-101. Approval agency.
The City Assessor shall coordinate the naming of newly established public and private streets within the city, provided that the final decision on public street names shall remain with the governmental agency that is responsible for maintaining the public street in question, or for private street names the municipality having zoning jurisdiction shall make the final decision.

Sec. 8-104. Changing existing street names.

A street name change may be ordered by the appropriate approval agency upon receipt of a written recommendation from the City Assessor. 
(b)	Before recommending a change in street names, the City Assessor shall consider the official street name as recorded on plats and deeds of adjacent property and the most accurate historical name of the street in question.

b.	North of the baseline, even numbers shall be on the easterly sides of streets, odd numbers shall be on the westerly sides of the streets. 
c.	South of the baseline, even numbers shall be on the westerly sides of the streets, odd numbers shall be on easterly sides of the streets. 
d.	For the purpose of this chapter, streets running northeast/southwest and those whose major portion runs north-south shall be considered north-south streets. 
e.	Address numbers south of the baseline shall be followed with a street prefix "South" and address numbers north of the baseline shall be followed by a prefix "North" to avoid duplication of address numbers. 
(2)	A meridian shall be established as follows: Beginning at the intersection of the north city limit and the centerline of North Clinton Street south to the intersection of said centerline and the centerline of North Bridge Street, then southwesterly along the centerline to the intersection with the centerline of South Jenne Street and continuing south along this centerline and an extension thereof to the south city limits.

e.	Address numbers east of the meridian shall be followed by a street prefix "East" and numbers west of the meridian shall be followed by a street prefix "West" to avoid duplication of address numbers. 
(3)	A street suffix will be included as a portion of each property address to readily identify the quadrant of the city in which the property lies. This street suffix has been added to facilitate the implementation of this chapter with minimal address changes. (See Appendix A of the ordinance form which this article is derived for quadrant designations.) 
(4)	Address numbers shall be assigned so they run consecutively starting at the baseline or meridian line so that numbers are not out of sequence. 
(5)	Upon determination of the City Assessor, address numbers in common use prior to the adoption of this chapter may continue to be used if:

(2)	If the existing number is such that the assignment of address numbers for new buildings is not practical and in keeping with the requirements of this article. 
(3)	When a new street is constructed, or recognized, which results in the most appropriate address for a building to be on the new street rather than the original street such as where a building was previously located on an extended drive which subsequently becomes a private street. 
(4)	When an address is duplicated or otherwise violates this article. 
(Code 2002, § 69-13)
 
Sec. 8-109. Notice and enforcement procedures.

DIVISION 1. GENERALLY
 
Sec. 16-20. Findings.
The city finds that: 
(1)	The constitution and laws of the state authorize local units of government to provide stormwater management services and systems that will contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare and to the protection of our natural resources. 
(2)	Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within and downstream of city are at times subjected to flooding. 
(3)	Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds, which may result in increased stormwater runoff rates volumes, and duration, increased flooding, increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and deposition. 
(4)	Stormwater runoff produced as a consequence of land development contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants. 
(5)	Increases of stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and nonpoint source pollution have occurred as a result of land development, and have impacted the water resources of the Grand River Watershed. 
(6)	Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the city will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely affect the city water bodies and water resources, and those of downstream communities. 
(7)	Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater runoff from development. 
(8)	Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow. 
(9)	Adopting the standards, criteria, and procedures contained in this ordinance and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff. 
(10)	Substantial economic losses can result from adverse impacts on the waters of the city and the watershed. 
(11)	Improper design and construction of stormwater best management practices (BMPs) can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation. 
(12)	The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities is necessary in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff. 
(13)	The regulation of land development by means of stormwater management policy and procedures and effective site planning will produce development that is compatible with the natural functions of the land or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of excessive stormwater runoff from development. 
(Ord. No. 547, § 1(176-2), 6-10-2013)
 
Sec. 16-21. Purpose.
(a)	The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in the city and the watersheds to which it drains and to comply with the city's National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and other applicable federal and state regulations. 
(b)	This article seeks to meet that purpose by minimizing the negative impacts of increased stormwater discharges from new land development and redevelopment through the following objectives: 
(1)	To minimize increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes from identified land development and redevelopment. 
(2)	To minimize nonpoint source pollution. 
(3)	To minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses, culverts and bridges, and other structures. 
(4)	To encourage water recharge where geologically favorable conditions exists. 
(5)	To maintain the ecological integrity of stream channels. 
(6)	To minimize the negative impacts of development on downstream channel stability. 
(7)	To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by controlling increased flood discharges, stream erosion, and runoff pollution. 
(8)	To reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies and, to that end, this article establishes minimum standards to protect water bodies from degradation resulting from changing land use where stormwater management controls may be insufficient to meet water quantity and quality goals. 
(9)	To ensure that storm drains and stormwater BMPs are adequate to address stormwater management needs within a proposed development, and for protecting downstream landowners from flooding and degradation of water quality. The procedures, standards, and recommendations set forth in this article and the city's Post Construction Stormwater Management Guidance Manual (Guidance Manual) are designed for these purposes. 
(10)	To ensure that all stormwater facilities necessary for a proposed development will have an appropriate governmental unit responsible in perpetuity for performing maintenance or for overseeing the performance of maintenance by other entities. 
(11)	To facilitate the integration of stormwater management and pollution control with other ordinances, programs, policies, and the comprehensive plans of the city. 
(12)	To establish legal authority to carry out all of the inspection and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.

(2)	The stormwater plan must be sufficiently detailed to specify the type, location, and size of stormwater management facilities, using preliminary calculations. Detailed construction drawings are not required at the stormwater plan review stage. 
(3)	If it is proposed to develop a parcel in two or more phases, the stormwater plan shall be prepared and submitted for the total project. 
(c)	Plan preparation. The stormwater plan shall be prepared by a designer in accordance with the requirements outlined in the city's Post Construction Stormwater Management Guidance Manual. Other persons and professionals may assist in the preparation of the plan. All plans shall be properly sealed. 
(Ord. No. 547, § 1(176-10), 6-10-2013)
 
Sec. 16-58. Standards for post construction stormwater management concept plan (stormwater plan) approval.
(a)	All developments requiring a stormwater plan shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to prevent flooding, minimize stream channel impacts, protect water quality, and achieve the purposes of this article, as stated above. The city has adopted performance standards to meet the objectives of managing the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff from a site as detailed below and/or in the Guidance Manual. 
(b)	Designers may select any combination of stormwater BMPs which meet the performance standards provided the selections: 
(1)	Comply with the requirements identified in this article and the Guidance Manual; 
(2)	Comply with all other local, county, state, or federal requirements; and 
(3)	Do not conflict with the existing local stormwater management and watershed plans. 
(c)	The particular facilities and measures required on site shall take into consideration the natural features, upland areas, wetlands, and watercourses on the site; the potential for on-site and offsite adverse stormwater impacts, water pollution, and erosion; and the size of the site. 
(d)	The following on-site stormwater management concepts must be followed: 
(1)	Natural topography and site drainage shall be preserved and site grading shall be minimized to the maximum extent reasonably achievable considering the nature of the development. 
(2)	The preferred conveyance strategy is to transport, wherever possible, untreated and treated runoff in conveyance facilities open to the atmosphere (e.g., swales, vegetated buffer strips, energy-dissipating structures, etc.), rather than through enclosed pipes, so as to decrease runoff velocity, allow for natural infiltration, allow suspended sediment particles to settle, and to remove pollutants. 
(3)	Watercourses shall not be deepened, widened, dredged, cleared of vegetation, straightened, stabilized, or otherwise altered without applicable permits or approvals from the public service director, relevant county agencies and the applicable State of Michigan department. 
(4)	The following volume/channel protection criteria shall be met. No net increase in runoff from storm events up to the two-year, 24-hour event from predevelopment conditions. Specific details for compliance with this requirement are outlined in the city Guidance Manual. 
(5)	The following peak rate/flood control criteria shall be met: the peak discharge rate from all storms up to the 100-year, 24-hour event shall not be greater than predevelopment discharge rates. Where the runoff volume is not increased from the predevelopment condition, the peak rate corresponding to the same storms is considered controlled. If specific watershed conditions require additional peak rate control, the city may, in its discretion, upon the recommendation of its public service director restrict the peak discharge from the 100-year, 24 hour event to a fixed release rate; or require additional runoff volume reduction. Specific details for compliance with this requirement are outlined in the Guidance Manual. 
(6)	The following water quality criteria shall be met. Water quality criteria are met when the minimum treatment volume control criteria of one inch of runoff from the entire site is retained and when the following total suspended solids criteria is met: 
a.	A minimum of 80 percent of total suspended solids has been removed as compared with uncontrolled runoff; or 
b.	A minimum discharge concentration of TSS not to exceed 80 mg/L is met. 
If the required minimum TSS levels are not met by the capture of one inch of runoff from the entire site, then additional treatment methods must be designed to meet the minimum TSS removal requirements. Specific details for compliance with this requirement are outlined in the Guidance Manual. 
(7)	Under certain conditions, the city, upon recommendation by the public service director, may impose the following additional restrictions on stormwater discharges: 
a.	Peak discharge may be further restricted when it can be shown that a probable risk to downstream structures or unique natural areas exists or that existing severe flooding problems could be negatively impacted. 
b.	Measures may be imposed to protect against ground or surface water pollution where the nature of the soils or bedrock underlying a stormwater management structure constitutes substantial risk of contamination, such as might be the case in limestone formations. Special provisions to be followed in these cases will be provided by the public service director. 
c.	Where groundwater yields are very low or where a groundwater supply already is heavily used, the city may require that the entire volume of the two-year, 24-hour rainfall event be retained and infiltrated. If substantial irrigation needs are anticipated, portions of stored stormwater may be reused for irrigation purposes. 
(8)	Stormwater credits for on-site stormwater management may be considered in accordance with the provisions provided in the Guidance Manual.

If, after such hearing, the council determines to proceed with the special assessment project, a resolution shall be passed ordering the proposed improvement to be made, and directing the assessor to prepare a special assessment roll. 
(b)	Unless the city has available in a revolving fund, or otherwise, the monies required for defraying the cost of a public improvement, or at least that part thereof that will accrue before the special assessments thereon will be paid, or monies available from the sale of bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of such special assessments, no contract or expenditure, except for the cost of necessary legal procedures and engineering plans and estimates, shall be made for the improvement until the special assessment roll to defray the costs of the same has been confirmed. 
(Code 2002, § 44-4)
 
Sec. 32-5. Objections to improvements.
If, at or prior to the adoption of the resolution to proceed required by section 32-4, written objections have been filed by the owners of property in the special assessment district which, according to estimates, will be required to bear more than 50 percent of the assessed portion thereof, or by owners representing more than 50 percent of the property to be assessed, no resolution to proceed with the improvement shall be adopted, except by the affirmative vote of five or more members of the council.

No substantial deviation from the plans and specifications for any public improvement, as adopted by the council or included in the contract thereof, as the case may be, shall be permitted by any officer or employee of the city without authority of the council by resolution. A copy of the resolution authorizing such changes or deviation shall be certified by the City Clerk and attached to the approved plans and specifications or the contract, as the case may be, on file in his office. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the execution of change orders in accordance with procedures contained in construction contracts previously approved by the council. 
(Code 2002, § 44-7)
 
Sec. 32-8. Assessment procedure.
The assessment procedure for public improvements assessed according to this chapter shall be as follows: 
(1)	Assessing costs; assessment roll.
a.	Pursuant to the resolution to proceed, the City Assessor shall make an assessment roll for the lands within the portion of the city so designated showing the amount of expense, in proportion as nearly as possible to the benefits which each person is deemed to acquire by the making of such improvement. 
b.	The assessment roll shall include the names of the owners or parties in interest of such lands, as shown from the assessor's records, the description of the property assessed, and the amount assessed to each person respectively. Said roll shall be filed with the City Clerk, who shall make copies available for public inspection and who shall also forward the roll to the City Council for confirmation. 
(2)	Hearings on assessment roll.
a.	Upon the making and filing of the assessment roll, as required in subsection (1) of this section, the council shall adopt a resolution directing the clerk to give notice of at least one public hearing before the roll is confirmed. The City Clerk shall cause such notice of the public hearing to be published not more than 20 days and not less than ten days before such hearing in a daily newspaper of the city. The notice shall, at a minimum, contain the following information: 
1.	The time and place of the hearing; 
2.	A description of the section or area of the city determined by council to be within the assessment district as contained in the proposed special assessment roll; 
3.	That the proposed special assessment roll is on file with the City Clerk's office and available to be examined; 
4.	That any person aggrieved by the assessment as contained in the special assessment roll, or the necessity of the improvement, may file a written objection thereto which must be delivered to the City Clerk prior to the close of the hearing or that the person may appear and protest the same at the public hearing in person or by his representative; 
5.	That the appearance and protest, or written protest, in the manner described is required if the person desires to appeal the amount of the assessment to the state tax tribunal; and 
6.	That any appeal to the state tax tribunal must be taken within 30 days of the confirmation of the special assessment roll, provided that a protest was timely made. 
b.	In addition, the clerk shall give notice of the hearing not less than ten days before the date of the hearing to each owner of, or party in interest in, property to be assessed and whose name appears upon the last local tax assessment records, by first class mail addressed to each such owner or party at the address shown on the tax records. As used in this section, the term "last local tax assessment records" means the last local board of review, as supplemented by any subsequent changes in the names and addresses of owners or parties listed thereon. The notice required under this subsection shall be identical in content to the published notice described above. 
c.	Where any person claims an interest in real property whose name and correct address do not appear upon the last local tax assessment records, he shall be obligated to file immediately his name and address with the City Assessor and to provide evidence acceptable to the City Assessor that he is entitled to be the taxpayer of record. The assessor shall immediately enter on the local tax assessment records any changes in the names and addresses of owners or parties in interest filed with him and shall at all times keep such tax assessment records current, complete, and available for public inspection. 
d.	On the day appointed for the hearing and on such other days as the hearing may be adjourned to, the council shall receive all written protests and hear the allegations and proof of all persons who appear and protest the assessment. Following the hearing, the council may confirm the assessment roll without any changes or with such corrections as the council may deem appropriate. The council may rectify and amend such assessment roll, in whole or in part, or may set such roll aside and direct a new assessment, either by the same person or by such other person as council appoints for that purpose. If the proposed assessment roll is set aside, the same proceedings as are herein provided for the first order of assessment, including additional public hearing, shall be conducted for any new assessment roll. 
(3)	Correction of deficient or excessive assessment. If the estimated expense of the improvement was used to establish the special assessment and the special assessment proves insufficient to pay for the improvement or work for which it was levied, and for the expenses incident thereto, council may, within the limitations prescribed for such assessments, make an additional pro rata assessment to supply the deficiency. If this additional amount necessary is less than ten percent of the total cost, the additional amount shall be automatically added to the existing assessment. If a greater amount is collected than is necessary, and said coverage exceeds five percent of the actual costs, then the excess shall be refunded to those by whom it was paid. Overages of less than five percent shall not be refunded. 
(4)	Liens on property for assessments.
a.	When any special assessment for public, local or other improvements, or for any other purpose authorized by ordinance, has been made, as provided in this chapter, and the assessment roll for such assessment is delivered to the City Treasurer for collection, the assessment shall be a lien upon the premises upon which it was assessed from and after the date of the warrant for the collection thereof. The treasurer may levy on and collect such tax from any personal property in the possession of the person charged with such tax or in any other manner permitted by law. 
b.	If the assessment is not paid, the treasurer shall, within five days after the time prescribed by the warrant for the collection thereof has expired make a report to the City Clerk of the sum and interest, as the case may be, due and so remaining unpaid, which has not been collected, together with a description of the premises assessed for such unpaid taxes. The clerk, within five days thereafter, shall, in like manner, notify the City Assessor of the amount of such taxes, and the description of the premises assessed and charged with such tax, who shall assess such unpaid taxes on such premises, in the tax roll of the proper ward next thereafter to be made. 
c.	Real property exempt from taxation by law shall nevertheless, with or without valuation, be subject to taxation for special improvements, the same as other property. Such tax or taxes shall then be levied, collected, and returned, and the premises may be sold or forfeited for nonpayment of the ordinary city taxes. 
(5)	Invalid assessments; reassessments.
a.	Whenever any special assessment to defray the expense of any improvement is invalid, in the opinion of the council, the council may vacate and set the same aside. When any such special assessment is so vacated or is held invalid by the judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the council may, from time to time until a valid assessment is made, cause a new assessment to be made for the purpose for which the original assessment was made and in the manner provided for making the original assessment. Whenever the tax or any part thereof assessed upon any lot or parcel of real estate by the original assessment set aside or held invalid as aforesaid has been paid, and is not refunded, the City Treasurer shall apply such payment upon the reassessment on the lot or parcel of real estate and make a notation thereof upon the new assessment roll. Such reassessment shall, to the extent of such payment, be deemed paid and satisfied, after which no part of the amount paid on the original assessment shall be refunded, unless the amount paid as aforesaid exceeds the amount of the reassessment, in which case the excess shall be refunded, and the person or his legal representative who paid such amount shall be entitled to the amount to be refunded. 
b.	All the provisions of this chapter making special assessments a lien upon the lots and parcels of real estate enforced therein, and also those relating to the collection of special assessments, shall apply to such reassessments. This section shall apply to assessments made before, as well as after, the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(6)	New warrants of collection.
a.	Whenever any special assessment has not been collected within the life of the mayor's warrant affixed to the assessment roll, and is not vacated or held invalid, the mayor may affix a new warrant to such assessment roll, extending the time for the collection of the assessment so long as council directs. The mayor may continue to affix new warrants to any assessment roll, from time to time, under the direction of council, until the assessment is collected or returned. 
b.	Whenever any special assessment roll is hereafter ratified and confirmed, the time of payment of such special assessment is not extended over a term of years, and such special assessment is not collected within the life of the mayor's first warrant affixed to such special assessment roll and is not vacated or held invalid, there shall be added to, paid, and collected with such tax or assessment on each particular parcel or description of land or any undivided share thereof, a penalty of four percent at the time of the expiration of the mayor's first warrant affixed to such roll, together with interest at one-half percent per month, computed from the date of confirmation thereof, until paid or required by law to be returned as delinquent to the county treasurer. 
(7)	Assessment of nonresidents' or unoccupied lands. The lands of nonresidents and unoccupied lands of the city may be assessed their just proportion of the expenses of all improvements in the city, in the same manner and in the same amounts as assessments for improvements of other lands. 
(8)	Application of section. The provisions of this section are applicable to all public improvements permitted by law, including, but not limited to, streets, sidewalks, drains, sewers, water mains, malls, and promenades. 
(Code 2002, § 44-8)
 
Sec. 32-9. Payments and collection.
(a)	Collection of assessments: payments; interest; bond funds.
(1)	Every assessment ratified and confirmed by the council shall be final and conclusive. The City Treasurer shall collect the assessments on or before the due date, which shall be set forth in the resolution confirming the roll. In collecting the special assessments, the treasurer shall have all of the powers and collection options provided by law, including jeopardy assessment against personal property subject to said special assessment. 
(2)	The City Council may, in its discretion, establish by resolution that the special assessment may be paid in one or more installments, but the amount of any installment shall not be less than one-half of any subsequent installments. The council shall determine the appropriate number of installments applicable to each project on a case-by-case basis. 
(3)	Billing; installment payments. 
a.	Billing for payment of special assessments shall be in accordance with the resolution confirming the special assessment roll. If the assessment is payable in installments, interest shall be charged at the rate of seven percent per annum on the unpaid balance or, if the city has borrowed funds to pay for the improvement which is the subject of the special assessment, interest shall be charged at the borrowing interest rate plus one percent calculated to the date of payment on said unpaid balance. 
b.	No interest rate adjustment shall be made unless the rate was erroneously computed. The treasurer shall determine final payment of a special assessment liability. A penalty of four percent of the installment due shall be charged on all installment delinquencies. 
c.	Subsequent installment payments shall be due at intervals of 12 months from the due date of the first installment or from a date that the City Council shall fix. 
d.	If any installment becomes delinquent, such installment shall be processed and subject to interest and penalties as a delinquent tax. 
e.	Payments made in addition to the annual installments shall not be considered as installment prepayment nor relieve the taxpayer of the responsibility of paying any annual installment. Scheduled payments shall include principal, determined in the manner provided in this section, and all accrued interest and penalty. 
f.	Prior to any change of ownership of such properties on the installment payment special assessment program, certification must be presented to the assessor and treasurer proving that all special assessment taxes have been paid. Alternatively, a notarized agreement signed by the purchaser may be filed with the assessor and treasurer, which agreement clearly indicates that the purchaser is assuming the remaining lien. 
(4)	At the direction of City Council, the city engineer shall begin work or cause work to begin on a special assessment project on or before the first designated due date of a special assessment roll. If, due to some unavoidable circumstance, the engineer cannot commence such work before said date, he shall make a special report to council stating the circumstances in detail. 
(5)	The treasurer shall be responsible for accounting for all special assessment collections. 
(6)	The city shall have a lien for the total amount of special assessment taxes, interest, and penalties, which lien shall attach to the property liable for the same, from and after the date of the warrant for the collection of the whole or any installment thereof, and shall remain until all installments are fully paid. 
(b)	Authority of council; interest on unpaid installments. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the City Council may grant an extension of time for payment of special assessments by any taxpayer upon the showing of special need or economic hardship, without regard to the use, whether commercial, professional, industrial or otherwise, of the property within a special assessment district. As a condition of granting any deferral, the City Council shall require that any deferral assessment amount constitute a recorded lien against the property. 
(Code 2002, § 44-9)
 
Sec. 32-10. Special procedure where all landowners consent.
(a)	If the City Council determines to proceed with any improvement, and written waivers are received from each and every person or entity who would otherwise be subject to special assessment to defray the cost of improvement, then the City Council may declare, by resolution, that the improvement shall proceed pursuant to the unanimous consent of the proposed special assessment district. 
(b)	Such written waivers shall constitute and shall expressly state that the person executing the same consent to the establishment of a special assessment district and is irrevocably waiving all rights to notice of any and all public hearing in the establishment thereof. 
(c)	The City Council may determine that said assessments shall be paid in installments, in which case, interest shall be charged at a rate not to exceed the city's bond rate plus one percent. 
(Code 2002, § 44-10)

Sec. 34-2. Required sidewalk and non-motorized pathways within the city.
Sidewalks shall be required to be constructed, repaired, and maintained, in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter, along all dedicated streets within the city limits of the city, including all city, county, and state-owned streets and highways. Non-motorized pathways shall be required to be constructed, repaired, and maintained, in conformance with the standards set forth in this article, along routes designated as such from time to time by the City Council. 
(Code 2002, § 178-2)
 
Sec. 34-3. Standards for construction, repair, and maintenance of sidewalks and non-motorized pathways; fee.
(a)	All sidewalks within the city shall be a minimum of five feet wide, four inches thick (six inches at driveways), parallel to the edge of the abutting street, not less than one foot from the edge of the right-of-way thereof, and shall be constructed of concrete (brick or concrete pavers may be permitted within the downtown development authority boundary, as approved by the city's Public Services Director). 
(b)	Non-motorized pathways shall be a minimum of seven feet wide, four inches thick (six inches at driveways), parallel to the abutting street, not less than one foot from the edge of the right-of-way thereof, and shall be constructed of concrete (brick or concrete pavers may be permitted within the downtown development authority boundary, as approved by the city's Public Services Director). 
(c)	All sidewalks and non-motorized pathways shall be constructed in strict accordance with the city's standard construction specifications and the following: 
(1)	Longitudinal slopes shall be one-half percent minimum, five percent maximum. 
(2)	Cross slopes shall be one-half percent minimum, two percent maximum. 
(3)	The nominal grade shall be three percent above the existing curb (assuming the existing curb height is six inches). Where a curb does not exist, or where the existing curb is not six inches, the grade must be approved by the city's Public Services Director. 
(4)	Where practical, sidewalks and non-motorized pathways shall be sloped toward the abutting street. In all cases, however, adequate drainage must be provided. 
(d)	All repair, maintenance, and/or construction work done to sidewalks or non-motorized pathways within the public right-of-way of any street, highway, and/or alley must be performed by one or more licensed contractors. Such contractors must, prior to commencing any work within the public right-of-way, provide the city's Public Services Director with evidence of sufficient liability insurance, with the city named as an additional insured, as well as a performance and guarantee bond for a minimum period of two years, all of which are satisfactory to the city. All contractors shall be required, prior to commencing any work within the public right-of-way, to obtain a permit from the city public service department, and to pay a fee to cover the costs of review and inspection, as established by resolution of the City Council. 
(Code 2002, § 178-3)
 
Sec. 34-4. Responsibility for construction, repair, or maintenance.
(a)	The owner of every lot or parcel of land in the city, as well as any tenant thereof, shall be responsible to keep all sidewalks and/or nonmotorized pathways on, adjoining or adjacent to said lot or parcel free of all obstructions, defects, or other conditions causing an unsafe condition or impediment to pedestrian travel and/or nonmotorized transportation. The requirements of this section shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: 
(1)	Removal of snow and ice. The owner or tenant of every lot or parcel of land in the city shall remove all snow and ice on and over said sidewalks and nonmotorized pathways within 24 hours after more than three inches of such material has been deposited, redeposited, or reformed. Notice of failure to complete such removal shall be given by the designated city official by leaving a copy of the notice on the premises or by first-class mail addressed to the occupant (if any) of the property and the owner thereof by first-class mail to the address listed on the city's last property tax roll. 
a.	Notice. Notice as provided in this subsection shall state the nature of the obstruction (e.g., snow, ice, drifting snow, etc.) and hazard and shall require that the obstruction/hazard be removed within 24 hours of the notice. If the property owner or tenant fails to comply with the requirements of this section, he, and each of them, shall be guilty of a municipal civil infraction, punishable as provided in chapter 1 of this Code. 
b.	City removal of snow and ice. In addition to the civil fines set forth in the preceding subsection, the property owner shall be liable for the cost incurred by the city in procuring the removal of said snow and ice. If at any time within six months after notice has been provided pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, a subsequent violation (i.e., failure to remove snow and ice within 24 hours after accumulation of three inches of such material) may result in removal of snow and ice by the city with the cost thereof to be placed as a lien on the property involved and collected as the city shall deem appropriate, including in the manner provided for collection of property taxes. Upon receipt of an invoice from the contractor hired by the city for the removal of said snow and ice, the city shall provide notice of the amount due to the property owner with a demand for payment within 30 days. Upon failure of the owner to remit in full for said invoiced amount, plus an administration fee of $50.00, the unpaid amount shall be placed on the tax rolls as a lien against the property involved and collected in the same manner provided for collection of real property taxes, plus interest as provided for delinquent property taxes. 
c.	For purposes of this section, accumulation and drifting of snow and ice of more than three inches shall constitute a condition requiring removal hereunder. 
d.	Upon proof of financial hardship, the city administrator may authorize charges under this section to be paid in installments, to be reduced or to be cancelled, and such authorizations shall be subject to approval by the City Council. 
(2)	Maintain all landscaping and adjoining or abutting sidewalk or nonmotorized pathways in such a manner that said overhanging landscaping remains, at a minimum, no less than eight feet above the surface of any sidewalk or nonmotorized pathway. In addition, and as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, no landscaping, trees, shrubbery, or other berm, other than grass, sod, or mulch, shall be placed less than one foot from the edge of any sidewalk or nonmotorized pathway. In no event should any such landscaping, trees, shrubbery, or other berm be permitted to create a hazard to the public health, safety, or welfare or otherwise obstruct or hinder the public right-of-way. Trees and shrubbery existing along the side of any sidewalk or nonmotorized pathway as of the effective date of this article shall be maintained in a reasonable manner so as to protect the public health, safety, and welfare along the public right-of-way. 
(b)	Any sidewalk or non-motorized pathway within the city shall be presumed to be defective if one or more of the following conditions exist: 
(1)	There is a vertical displacement of three-fourths of an inch or greater; 
(2)	There is a crack greater than one-half inch wide; 
(3)	If any section is spalled, chipped or gouged over 25 percent or more of its surface area; or 
(4)	If the sidewalk or non-motorized pathway slopes exceed those contained in the standards enumerated in section 34-3(c)(1) through (4); 
(5)	If improper or insufficient drainage causes water to collect on the surface of the sidewalk or non-motorized pathway; 
(6)	If any obstructions encroach within one foot of either side or within eight feet above the surface of the sidewalk or non-motorized pathway; or 
(7)	If there are more than two cracks in any five-foot section of any sidewalk or non-motorized pathway. 
(c)	Costs for the construction, repair, and/or maintenance of any sidewalk or nonmotorized pathway within the city shall be allocated as follows: 
(1)	The cost of repairs and maintenance to sidewalks or nonmotorized pathways shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property adjoining or abutting the sidewalk or nonmotorized pathway requiring repairs and/or maintenance. Except in the case of snow or other debris removal, or in the case of required drainage improvements or where the sidewalk is damaged due to the actions of the property owner or tenant, the city shall, upon proper application and satisfactory documentation of such expenses to the Public Services Director, be responsible for up to 25 percent of the costs required to complete such repairs or maintenance. The term "repairs" includes replacement of damaged or unsalvageable sidewalk, if approved by the Public Services Director. 
(2)	The city shall assume all responsibility for the repair, maintenance, or construction of barrier-free sidewalk ramps at intersections and for repair or replacement of sidewalk due to upheaval caused by tree growth within the area between the sidewalk and curb. 
(3)	For the construction of new nonmotorized pathways, the owner of the adjoining or abutting property shall be responsible for the cost of the first five feet of width thereof, and the city shall reimburse said owner, upon proper application and satisfactory documentation of such expenses to the Public Services Director, 25 percent of the cost to construct said portion of the nonmotorized pathway. The city shall assume 100 percent of the responsibility for the cost of construction of the remaining width of any nonmotorized pathway. 
(4)	The costs of construction of new sidewalks within the city shall be allocated as follows: 
a.	With regard to new residential, commercial, business, and/or industrial development within the city, all costs shall be paid for by the developer and/or builder thereof. 
b.	With regard to a new sidewalk to be constructed upon or adjacent to existing improved property, the costs shall be the sole responsibility of the abutting or adjoining property owner. The city shall, upon proper application and satisfactory documentation of such expenses to the Public Services Director, reimburse 25 percent of the cost to construct such sidewalks. If a new sidewalk is required to be constructed on two or more sides of an existing improved property (i.e., a corner lot), the abutting or adjoining property owner shall be limited in responsibility to construction of sidewalk along the one side of the property with the greatest linear feet of frontage. The city shall assume 100 percent of the responsibility for the cost of construction of new sidewalk along the remaining sides of the property. 
c.	With regard to the construction of new sidewalks adjoining or abutting vacant land, such costs shall be the sole responsibility of the adjoining or abutting property owner. The city shall, upon proper application and satisfactory documentation of such expenses to the Public Services Director, reimburse 25 percent of the costs to construct such sidewalks. 
d.	Where a new sidewalk will be constructed as part of a project where matching state or federal funds are contributed, the cost of sidewalk construction allocated to adjacent or abutting property will be equal to the balance of said cost, subject to 50 percent reimbursement as provided in subsection (c)(4)b and c of this section. 
(Code 2002, § 178-4; Ord. No. 554, § 1, 10-26-2015)
 
Sec. 34-5. Notice to construct or repair.
Whenever the City Council shall determine, by resolution, that there is a need for sidewalks or sidewalks in travelable condition, or any other condition exists which, in the opinion of the City Council, constitutes a public nuisance or hazard which is dangerous to the health, safety, or welfare of the inhabitants of the city or others, except a public nuisance or hazard related to the accumulation of snow and ice, the City Council may, after investigation, give notice to the owners of land upon which such nuisance or hazard exists by posting of notice upon the premises and by personal service, or by first class mail, addressed to the property owner as listed on the general property tax roll, specifying the nature of the nuisance or hazard and requiring the owner to construct, alter, repair, tear down, abate, or otherwise remove the nuisance or hazard within a time to be specified by the City Council, which shall be commensurate with the nature of the nuisance or hazard. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this article shall not be construed to permit the City Council to require that any existing sidewalk which is less than five feet wide but more than four feet wide be repaired and/or replaced on that basis alone, unless there is a specific finding by the City Council that significant other defects or other conditions constituting the public nuisance or hazard which is dangerous to the health, safety, or welfare of the inhabitants of the city or others exists and which, therefore, requires the immediate repair or replacement of said sidewalk. 
(Code 2002, § 178-5)
 
Sec. 34-6. Failure to comply with notice.
If, at the expiration of the time limit in the notice described in section 34-5, the owner has not complied with the requirements thereof, or in any case where the owner of the land itself is not known or cannot be found, the City Council may order such nuisance or hazard to be abated, under the direction of the city's Public Services Director, who may contract or hire the work to be done. 
(Code 2002, § 178-6)
 
Sec. 34-7. Assessment of costs and expenses.
After the city's acceptance of a bid or contract for the work to be done in accordance with section 34-6, the cost thereof shall be apportioned among the benefitted properties on a tentative special assessment roll. The owner of benefitted properties shall receive notice of public hearing by first class mail at the address shown on the general property tax rolls. Such notice shall specify the tentative amount of the assessment as to said property and shall provide the time, date, and location of the public hearing to be held for the purpose of hearing objections to the apportionment and roll. The resolution confirming the roll shall describe the time allowed for payment, the interest rate, and penalties for late payments. All assessments levied hereunder shall constitute a lien on the property benefitted.

(Code 2002, § 205-19)
 
Sec. 42-66. Parking on streets.
(a)	Purpose. It is common for weather conditions between December 1 and March 31, and sometimes during other months, to include snowfalls requiring the plowing and removal of snow from city streets. It is also common for weather conditions to change requiring plowing all the way to curbs in order to clear snow cover over catch basins to allow for drainage when the snow and ice melt or rain occurs so as to prevent flooding, refreezing of undrained snowmelt and rain water, and other unsafe conditions. Plowing to the curbs is not possible when cars are parked on the street along the curb. The city recognizes on-street parking is important in some circumstances. In balancing these competing needs, the city is allowing for parking on only one side of the street during overnight hours in the months of December, January, February, and March, and at such other times as there is a declared snow emergency, with the allowed parking alternating on a daily basis to enable snowplowing of both sides of the street. 
(b)	Odd and even parking for winter and snow emergencies.
(1)	During the months of December, January, February, and March, and at other times during any declared snow emergency: 
a.	A licensed and operational motor vehicle or a licensed trailer attached to a licensed and operational motor vehicle shall be parked only on that side of the street having even-numbered street addresses on even-numbered calendar days and on that side of the road having odd-numbered street addresses on odd-numbered calendar days between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 7:00 a.m. of the same day. Overnight on-street parking may begin as early as 7:00 p.m. the day before. 
b.	On culs-de-sac, on-street parking of a licensed and operational motor vehicle or a licensed trailer attached to a licensed and operational motor vehicle is permitted between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 7:00 a.m. of the same day only on even-numbered calendar days. Overnight on-street parking may begin as early as 7:00 p.m. the day before. 
(2)	The City Manager may declare a snow emergency when they determine that because of current or anticipated winter weather conditions it is prudent to declare such an emergency in order to clear and maintain the streets of the city so as to allow normal and safe vehicular traffic, parking and access, or to open catch basins to improve street drainage. 
a.	A declared snow emergency shall continue in effect until such time that the City Manager declares the emergency to be ended. 
b.	The City Manager shall use reasonable means commensurate with the time and the weather conditions to notify the citizens of a snow emergency declaration by website, publication, media releases, or other means. 
(3)	This section shall not allow on-street parking where "no parking" signs are posted. 
(4)	Nothing contained in this section permits parking at times or places where it is otherwise prohibited by this Code. 
(c)	Violations.
(1)	Any violation of this article shall be punishable as a municipal civil infraction as provided in chapter 1 of the Grand Ledge City Code. 
(2)	Parking violation notices or municipal civil infraction citations for violations of this article may be issued by any city police officer, the City Manager, or any other person who the City Manager may authorize in writing to issue such parking violation notices or municipal civil infraction citations. 
a.	A parking violation notice issued pursuant to this subsection may be placed on or affixed to a vehicle that is parked in violation of this division to notify the owner or driver of the offense. Such notice shall state the date and time of issuance. A notice of violation shall not require payment of any fine or other cost of the violation. 
b.	A municipal civil infraction citation issued pursuant to this subsection shall be issued in the same form and manner as for any other parking violation and shall require the same response, appearance, payment of fine, and other consequences and actions as any other municipal civil infraction citation. 
c.	A parking violation notice or municipal civil infraction citation issued pursuant to this subsection shall contain or be accompanied by a statement that failure to move the parked vehicle to comply with the requirements of this division will result in the impoundment of the vehicle as provided in the City Code. 
(3)	A vehicle parked in violation of this article is a public nuisance per se. 
(4)	If 48 hours has elapsed since a parking violation notice or a municipal civil infraction citation was issued as provided in subsection (2) and the vehicle is still parked or again parked in violation of this article, a city official authorized to issue a parking violation notice or municipal civil infraction citation under subsection (2) may order the impounding of the vehicle so the street can be plowed. 
(5)	Notice of the impounding of the vehicle shall be given in the same manner as for impounding a vehicle under other circumstances in which neither the owner nor operator are present. Towing, storage, and other fees related to impounding the vehicle shall be due, payable, and collectable from the owner of the vehicle and the operator of the vehicle, jointly and severally, in the same manner as for impounding a vehicle under other circumstances. Any vehicle so impounded shall be released from impound in the same manner as for a vehicle impounded under other circumstances in which the owner or operator were not present or as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(6)	If the city has incurred costs to impound a vehicle as provided in this section, but that vehicle is not so actually removed but is released to the owner or operator prior to such removal, the owner or operator shall pay, in addition to the penalty fixed for such violation, all costs and expenses incurred by the city by reason of the institution of those steps necessary to the removal of that vehicle. 
(d)	Responsibility of owner or operator. In all cases of violation under this article, the registered owner and the operator of a vehicle parked in violation of this division are jointly and severally responsible for such violation. The registration of the vehicle shall constitute in prima facie evidence of its ownership.

(2)	The city will cause to be maintained and kept proper books of record and account, separate from all other records and accounts of the city, in which shall be made full and correct entries of all transactions relating to the system. Not later than 60 days after the close of each operating year, the city will cause to be prepared on forms furnished by the municipal finance commission, if such forms be available, a statement in reasonable detail, sworn to by its chief accounting officer, showing the cast income and disbursements of the system during each operating year, the assets and liabilities of the system at the beginning and close of the fiscal year, and such other information as is necessary to enable any taxpayer of the city, user of the service furnished, or any holder or owner of the bonds or anyone acting in their interest, to be fully informed as to all matters pertaining to the financial operation of the system during each year. A certified copy of such statement shall be filed within 90 days after the close of each operating year with the municipal finance commission, and a copy sent to the manager of the account purchasing the bonds. Such statement and books of record and account shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by any taxpayer of the city, user of the service, or holder or holders of any bonds or anyone acting in their behalf. The city will also cause an annual audit of such books of record and account for the preceding operating year to be made each year by a recognized independent certified public accountant, and will mail a copy of such audit to the manager of the syndicate or account purchasing the bonds. Such audit shall be completed and so made available not later than three months after the closing of each operating year.

(4)	The city will not sell, lease, or dispose of the system, or any substantial part thereof, until all of the bonds have been paid in full, both as to principal and interest. The city further will cause the operation of the system to be carried on as economically as possible, will cause to be made to the system all repairs and replacements necessary to keep the same in good repair and working order and will not do or suffer to be done any act which would affect the system in such a way as to impair or affect unfavorably the security of the bonds.

Sec. 44-159. Additional bonds.

(1)	To complete the public improvements in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor, and such bonds shall not be authorized unless the consulting engineers, or the successor engineers in charge of construction, shall execute a certificate evidencing the fact that additional funds are needed to complete the public improvements in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor. If such certificate shall be so executed and filed with the City Clerk, it shall be the duty of the City Council to provide for and issue additional revenue bonds in the amount stated in said certificate to be necessary to complete the public improvements in accordance with the plans and specifications. 
(2)	For subsequent extensions and improvements to the system, provided that no such additional bonds shall be issued unless the average net revenues for the last two preceding completed operating years of the system or the net revenues for the last completed operating year, whichever is lower, when supplemented by the net revenues estimated to accrue from an increase in rates for water and/or sewer service placed into effect at the time of or prior to the authorization of said additional bonds shall be equal to at least 1 ?times the largest annual principal and interest requirements thereafter maturing on the bonds herein authorized, on any then-previously issued bonds of equal standing with the bonds herein authorized, and on such additional bonds then being issued. Prior to the issuance of any additional bonds pursuant to this subsection, there shall be filed with the City Clerk a statement showing the net revenues for each of the two immediately preceding completed operating years, the estimated increase in net revenues from said increase in rates, and the annual principal and interest requirements on all outstanding bonds payable from revenues of the system and the bonds proposed to be issued. Said statement shall be executed by a registered engineer appointed by the city. Permission of the municipal finance commission (or such other State body having jurisdiction over the issuance of municipal bonds) to issue such additional bonds shall constitute a conclusive presumption of the existence of conditions permitting the issuance thereof. 
(b)	Except as herein authorized, no additional bonds having equal standing with the bonds of this issue shall be authorized or issued.

(1)	Where both property lines and mains abutting the intersecting streets are less than 200 feet long, only the shorter of the two sides shall be used in calculating sewer main charges. 
(2)	If one or both property lines and abutting lines are over 200 feet in length, 200 feet shall be subtracted from the total footage of abutting main in calculating the main charge. 
(d)	In addition to the charges described above, an interest charge of six percent per annum from the date the project was accepted by the city, and prorated through the month of payment, shall be added to all charges imposed pursuant to this section. 
(Code 2002, § 214-25)
 
Sec. 44-191. Calculation of water main charges.
(a)	Whenever a developer constructs a water main and the properties which may potentially be connected to the main do not participate directly in the cost of said main, the council shall determine, based upon information provided by the developer, the total project cost of the main as defined by section 44-188. 
(b)	Main size. 
(1)	The total project cost shall then be spread proportionately by percentage against all abutting properties that may potentially connect to the privately-funded extension. The percentage of the cost each abutting property shall bear (main charge) shall be determined by dividing the total street frontage of the individual lot or parcel by the total street frontage of all abutting properties that may potentially connect to, or may already be connected to, the privately-funded main. Further, even though the water main size abutting the actual premises may be greater than that listed in the following table, the main charge applicable to the abutting premises shall be based on that portion of the cost which would have been charged had the project of interest been constructed using a main of the size listed: 
Premises	Main Size
(inches)
Residential structures from one through four units 	6 
Residential structures from four units to 12,000 square feet of total floor area 	8 
Residential structures over 12,000 square feet of total floor area 	10 
Nonresidential structures less than 40,000 square feet of total floor area 	8 
All structures over 40,000 square feet of total floor area 	10 

(2)	If the actual main size abutting the premises is less than that listed in the table above, then the actual main size shall be used for determining the proportionate cost. 
(c)	Where a parcel lies at the intersection of two streets or roads and is abutted on both of those sides by a water main, the footage for which a main charge is made shall be calculated as follows in order to grant a measure of relief to the property owner: 
(1)	Where both property lines and mains abutting the intersecting streets are less than 200 feet long, only the shorter of the two sides shall be used in calculating water main charges. 
(2)	If one or both property lines and abutting lines are over 200 feet in length, 200 feet shall be subtracted from the total footage of abutting main in calculating the main charge. 
(d)	In addition to the charges described above, an interest charge of six percent per annum from the date the project was accepted by the city, and prorated through the month of payment, shall be added to all charges imposed pursuant to this section. 
(Code 2002, § 214-26)
 
Sec. 44-192. Calculation of benefit charges.
(a)	In any case in which a lateral main is to be connected to a privately-funded extension to the public sewer or water system, or in the case of any premises that are located such that their street frontage cannot be determined (i.e., landlocked premises), the council shall determine, by resolution, the benefit to be charged against the abutting premises in lieu of a sewer or water main charge. 
(b)	The benefit charge for abutting premises shall be calculated by first determining the percentage of the total project cost the property should bear based on frontage, in accordance with the formula set forth in sections 44-190 and 44-191, whichever is applicable. Further, council shall also consider the following additional criteria: 
(1)	The number of lots or parcels or residential equivalents contained in any subdivision to be serviced by the lateral main; 
(2)	If applicable, the fact that the party seeking to connect the lateral main is a developer who has otherwise contributed substantially to the improvement of the public sewer or water system beyond the developer's own needs; and 
(3)	Any other policy or criteria that the City Council, upon recommendation of the utilities department or the city engineer, believes should be considered in determining an appropriate charge. 
(c)	The benefit charge applicable to any premises whose frontage cannot be determined shall be computed by considering the residential equivalent flow applicable to the premises, as well as any other criteria that the council, upon recommendation of the utilities department or the city engineer, shall deem relevant in determining the benefit provided to such premises. 
(d)	In addition to the charges described above, an interest charge of six percent per annum from the date the project was accepted by the city, and prorated through the month of payment, shall be added to all charges imposed pursuant to this section. 
(Code 2002, § 214-27)
 
Sec. 44-193. Contracts between city and developer.
(a)	No privately-funded extensions to the public sewer and/or water supply systems shall be allowed except by prior written contract with the city. Before any sanitary sewer or water supply system (not including individual building leads) constructed by private, as distinguished from public, funding shall be permitted to connect to the system, the owner of said system shall enter into a utility agreement; said agreement shall relate to the construction of sanitary sewer and/or water supply and shall set forth the terms and conditions of such construction, plan review and approval, inspection, right-of-way transfer, cost, escrow, construction standards, allocation of risk of loss, and other matters as may be deemed appropriate. A specimen of the city's standard utility agreement is available for review in the city offices. 
(b)	Such contract and/or utility agreement for sanitary sewer may expressly provide for the rebate of main or benefit charges to the developer for the privately-funded extension to the system. 
(c)	Any contract between the city and the developer providing for a rebate of main and/or benefit charges shall specify that such rebates shall only be paid to the developer if and when the main and/or benefit charges due from third parties under this article are actually paid to and received by the city. Further, in no case shall the developer be reimbursed more than the total project cost incurred by him in constructing the privately-funded main. 
(Code 2002, § 214-28)
 
Sec. 44-194. Collection of main and benefit charges.
Subject to the provisions of sections 44-189(e) and 44-195, the main and benefit charges imposed by this article shall be collected under the following conditions and at the following times: 
(1)	From each premises requesting to use, or required to use, a privately-funded extension to the public sewer or water system for which the applicable main charge has not previously been paid. 
(2)	Upon application for a building permit for the purpose of erecting new buildings, all applicable charges established by this article shall be collected and fully paid before any such permit shall issue. 
(3)	Upon application for authorization to connect any new building or existing building to a privately funded addition to the public sewer or water system, all applicable charges shall be collected and fully paid. No authorizations to connect to the public sewer and/or water system shall be granted until the main charges applicable to the premises applied for have been fully paid in accordance with this article. 
(4)	Prior to the start of construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings when a building permit is not required, or prior to the connection of any lateral main to the public sewer or water system, all applicable charges shall be paid. 
(Code 2002, § 214-29)
 
Sec. 44-195. Deferment of main and benefit charges over time.
In order to provide the city's customers with the advantages of long-term financing, the charges established by this article may be deferred and paid in installments as follows: 
(1)	The main and benefit charges established by this article may be paid in as many as seven equal annual installments; provided, however, that the balance due shall be paid in full prior to the date upon which the developer's right to a rebate of such charges terminates pursuant to section 44-189(e) of this article. In the event the city extends the time period for rebating main and benefit charges to the developer in accordance with section 44-189(e), then the time period for paying said charges in installments shall also be extended to correspond with the extension granted the developer. Payments pursuant to this subsection shall bear interest at a rate of six percent per annum on the unpaid principal balance as computed at the time of connection. 
(2)	In order to secure the payment of the charges established by this article, the city shall have a lien in the amount of such charges upon the real property serviced by the main. Any payment delinquent for three months or more shall be certified to the office of the City Treasurer, who shall enter the same upon the next tax roll against the property for which such charges were incurred, and such charges shall be collected and such liens shall be enforced in the same manner and subject to the same collection and penalty charges as provided for with regard to the collection of general ad valorem property taxes. Further, in addition to any other enforcement methods, the payment may be enforced by discontinuing the water and/or sewer service to such property, and all charges may be recovered by the city by way of court action.

(Code 2002, § 220-64; Ord. No. 535, § 1, 08-22-2011)
 
Sec. 46-6. Special land uses.
The uses hereinafter referred to possess unique characteristics making it impractical to include them in a specific use district. With the exception of group day care homes which shall only require approval by the planning commission, such uses may be permitted by the City Council after review by the planning commission. All uses under this section may be permitted and after public hearing, upon such conditions as are imposed after finding that the use is not injurious to the district and environs; is not contrary to the spirit and purpose of this chapter; is not incompatible with already existing uses in the area; would not interfere with the orderly development of the area; and would not be detrimental to the safety or convenience of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. These uses require special consideration since they service an area beyond the city, require sizable land areas and/or create potential control problems with respect to adjacent land use and use districts, traffic, noise, appearance, and general safety. Reference to those uses falling specifically within the intent of this section is as follows: 
(1)	Drive-in theaters possess the unique characteristic of being used only after darkness, have structures which could exceed the height requirements of most zoning districts and causing heavy concentrations of vehicular traffic. Drive-in theaters may be permitted in the I-2 District subject to the following conditions: 
a.	The proposed internal design shall receive approval from the zoning administrator and the city engineer as to adequacy of drainage, lighting and other technical aspects. 
b.	Points of ingress and egress shall be available to the outdoor theater from an abutting major thoroughfare as defined in the city master plan.

d.	All vehicles, waiting or standing to enter the facility, shall be provided off-street waiting space. A minimum of 50 stacking spaces shall be provided and no vehicle shall be permitted to wait or stand within a dedicated right-of-way. 
e.	The theater shall be enclosed by a six-foot-high obscuring fence, wall, or berm on those sides abutting a residential, office, or business district or public street. On those sides abutting a residential district, a landscaped berm, six feet in height shall be created in accordance with section 46-7 and section 46-8. 
f.	Drive-in picture screens shall not be permitted to face any public street and shall be located as to be out of the view from any major thoroughfare. The picture screen tower shall not exceed 65 feet in height. 
(2)	Adult entertainment facilities. 
a.	Intent. In the development and execution of this chapter, it is recognized that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances thereby having deleterious effects upon the adjacent areas. Special regulations of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. These special regulations are itemized in this section. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses in any one area or next to residential zones. 
b.	Definitions. The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

d.	In the CBD district, this section shall only apply to sites where a parking lot adjoins a public right-of-way. 
(5)	Existing trees. The preservation and incorporation of existing trees is strongly encouraged. Furthermore, the planning commission may require the preservation of existing trees, as part of the site plan review process, when such preservation can be reasonably accommodated. Where existing trees are used to satisfy the requirements of this section, the following requirements shall apply: 
a.	Each tree preserved that is between 2.5 inches to 5.9 inches diameter in size shall be calculated as a credit for one required tree. Each tree greater than six inches shall be calculated as two credits for required trees. 
b.	Paving or other site improvements shall not encroach upon the dripline of the existing tree to be preserved. During construction, tree protection fencing shall be placed ten feet beyond the dripline of the tree. The ground area within the fence line shall be maintained with vegetative landscape material or pervious surface cover. The planning commission may allow pedestrian pathways, driveways, or parking within the dripline upon determination that the setback from the trunk of the tree is suitable to reasonably ensure protection of the tree and the public. Storage of soils or other materials within the dripline is prohibited. 
c.	If trees used to meet the minimum requirements of this chapter or those to be preserved as part of the site plan approval are cut down, damaged, or destroyed, a sufficient number of trees shall be planted to equal or exceed the diameter of the tree that was to be preserved. Each replacement tree shall be a minimum of 3½ caliper inches at 12 inches above ground level, and seven feet in height when planted. Replacement trees are required to be planted within six months from the date that the zoning administrator notifies the property owner that such replacement is required. The planning commission or zoning administrator may allow a property owner to plant up to 50 percent of the replacement trees on other public or private property in the city, with the written consent of the owner of the property on which the replacement trees are to be planted. 
(6)	Maintenance. Landscaped areas and plant materials required by this chapter shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Plant materials, including lawn, shall be maintained in a healthy, growing condition with a neat and orderly appearance. If any plant materials required by this chapter die or become diseased, they shall be replaced within 30 days of written notice from the city or within an extended time period as specified in said notice. 
(7)	Timing. The landscaping shall be planted within six months from the date of completion of the building or improvement, and shall thereafter be reasonably maintained with permanent plant materials to provide the necessary affect. Final certificate of occupancy shall be withheld until plantings have been installed and approved. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued in the interim.

Sec. 46-8. Walls, fences, and berms.
(a)	For those zoning districts and uses listed below, there shall be provided and maintained on those sides abutting or adjacent to a residential district, an obscuring wall, fence, or landscaped berm as required below, unless otherwise determined by the planning commission under subsection (g) of this section. The planning commission may require the use of a berm rather than a wall or fence. In lieu of a required wall, fence, or berm, the planning commission may, in its review of the site plan, approve the use of other existing or proposed natural or manmade landscape features (such as evergreens spaced ten feet on center) that would produce substantially the same results in terms of screening, durability, and permanence. 
Wall and Berm Requirements
District or Use 	Height 
P, OS, B-1, CBD Districts 	6.0 feet 
I-1 or I-2 District 	6.0 to 10.0 feet 
Off-street parking and circulation (other districts) 	4.5 feet 
Storage areas 	6.0 to 10.0 feet 
Utility buildings, stations, or substations 	6.0 feet 

(b)	The height of the wall, fence, or berm shall be measured from the surface of the parking area or land on the nonresidential side of the wall, fence, or berm. 
 

(c)	In the case of a variable wall, fence, or berm height as noted above, the extent of the obscuring wall, fence, or berm shall be determined by the planning commission on the basis of land usage; provided, further, that no wall, fence, or berm shall be less than the above required minimum, nor greater than the above required maximum. 
(d)	Berms shall be landscaped in accordance with section 46-7. 
All obscuring fences shall be constructed with new, durable, weather resistant, and easily maintained materials. Chain link and barbed wire fences are not permitted for screening purposes. 
(e)	Required walls or fences shall be located along the lot line except in the following instances: 
(1)	Where underground utilities interfere. 
(2)	Where a landscaped street yard is required, the wall or fence shall be placed along the setback line. 
(3)	A wall or fence may be located on the residential side of an alley when mutually agreeable to the property owners and if approved by the zoning board of appeals. 
(f)	In those instances where the following conditions occur, the wall, fence, or berm may be waived by the planning commission: 
(1)	The abutting or adjacent land is proposed on the city master plan of land use as a use other than residential. 
(2)	The abutting or adjacent land is developed for a use other than residential. 
(3)	The planning commission determines that the abutting or adjacent residential district will become nonresidential in the future. 
(4)	The abutting or adjacent residential district has physical characteristics which preclude the necessity of a wall, fence, or berm. Such conditions include, but are not necessarily limited to: 
a.	An abrupt rise in grade on the abutting or adjacent district. 
b.	Heavily wooded or landscaped areas that will buffer as effectively as a wall or berm. 
c.	Other natural or manmade features that will buffer the abutting or adjacent residential districts as effectively as a wall, fence, or berm. 
(g)	Berms shall have a maximum slope of 3:1 (three-foot horizontal to one-foot vertical). All berms shall have a rounded crest, at least two feet in width and shall be constructed of clean fill. 
(h)	Walls, fences, and berms shall have no openings for vehicular traffic or other purposes, except as otherwise provided in this chapter or approved by the planning commission. 
(i)	All walls herein required shall be constructed to specifications approved by the building inspector. Walls shall be constructed of brick or have brick veneer on the side facing the residential district. A wall that is constructed of poured concrete which simulates standard brick facing is also acceptable. The top of the wall shall be finished or capped to provide positive drainage. 
(j)	The planning commission may require that a wall be varied in height or stepped to match adjacent existing walls or to ensure that adequate sight distance is assured, provided that in no instance shall a required wall, fence, or berm be permitted to be less than 30 inches in height. 
(Code 2002, § 220-67; Ord. No. 537, § 1, 2-27-2012)
 
Sec. 46-9. Fences and hedges.
(a)	The issuance of an approved fence permit shall be required prior to commencing construction of a proposed fence or prior to replacing or rebuilding more than 50 percent of an existing fence. The zoning administrator or his designee shall examine all applications for fence permits, and if it appears that the application complies with all of the provisions of this chapter of this Code, does not appear to violate any other applicable law and all applicable fees have been paid, a fence permit shall be issued to the applicant. The applicant shall notify the zoning administrator or his designee when the fence has been completed, and the zoning administrator or his designee shall examine the construction to ensure that it complies with the standards of this chapter and the issued permit. Any permit granted under this section shall become null and void after six months from the date of granting such permit unless the zoning administrator or his designee has approved the construction after final inspection, prior to the expiration of the six-month period. 
(b)	Nonconforming fences. Existing fences that do not comply with all provisions of this chapter may be replaced or reconstructed, as long as not more than 50 percent of the total fence on the property is replaced or reconstructed over the life of the original fence. Nothing herein is intended to prohibit general maintenance and minor repairs necessary to ensure that the fence is not a threat to the safety of persons or property. 
(1)	Application. Application for a fence permit shall be made on forms provided by the zoning administrator or his designee and shall include the following information. A fence permit shall not be required for maintenance of existing fences, including the replacement or rebuilding of fence areas that comprise less than 50 percent of the existing fence. 
a.	Name, address, and signature of applying landowner. 
b.	A site drawing that shows the exact location of the proposed fence. 
c.	The height of the proposed fence. 
d.	The type of construction materials to be used. 
e.	Estimated dates of construction. 
f.	The name and address of the proposed contractors, if any, who will be constructing the fence. 
g.	A drawing or other descriptive information detailing the type, style, and pattern of the proposed fence. 
h.	If the proposed fence will be erected on a property line, the application shall be signed by the adjoining landowners. If the applicant is unable to obtain a neighbor's signature, such requirement may be waived by the zoning administrator. 
i.	A drawing identifying the location of all other fences, to remain or to be eliminated, within ten feet of all property lines. 
(2)	Fees. The fees for a fence permit shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the City Council. 
(3)	Location.
a.	Front yard. 
1.	When located within the front yard, fences and hedges shall have a maximum average height of 36 inches, measured from the finished grade at the property line, and shall be set back a minimum of one foot from the sidewalk. No part of a fence may exceed four feet in height in a front yard. 
2.	When located within the front yard, fences shall be of an ornamental nature, including picket, split rail, or wrought-iron-style fencing, with at least 50 percent open spaces, uniformly distributed along the surface of the fence. Wire and chain link fencing is prohibited in front yards. 
b.	In side or rear yards in residential districts, no fence or hedge shall exceed a height of six feet in any side or rear yard. In commercial and industrial districts, no fence shall exceed a height of eight feet in any side or rear yard.

d.	No fence or hedge shall materially obstruct the vision of motorists at street intersections or at the intersection of a driveway and any street, sidewalk, or right-of-way line. 
(4)	Dilapidated or dangerous fences. It shall be the duty of each property owner to ensure that all fences on the property are installed and maintained plumb, with adequate support and footings, and in a safe and sightly manner. The zoning administrator or his designee is hereby authorized to order the removal or repair of fences that are dangerous, damaged, paint peeled, or otherwise in violation of this chapter or state or federal law. 
(5)	Swimming pool fences. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, every swimming pool with a depth of 24 inches at any point and/or a volume of 150 cubic feet or more must be maintained within an adequate enclosure surrounding the pool area. 
a.	The pool enclosure shall extend not less than four feet above the ground. All enclosures shall be self-closing and self-latching with latches placed at least four feet above the ground. No opening in a pool enclosure fence or gate shall be designed or maintained so as to permit access to the pool except under the supervision of the pool owner or by his permission. 
b.	Pool enclosure fences shall be constructed so as to prohibit the passage of a sphere larger than four inches in diameter through any opening or under the fence. Pool enclosure fences shall be designed to withstand substantial (200 pounds per square foot) concentrated horizontal loads at any point in the fence. 
(6)	Materials. Fences shall be constructed with substantial and durable materials, except that welded wire and barbed wire materials shall only be used in agricultural or industrial zones and except that electrified fencing, or material such as scrap wood, metal panels, extrusions, stampings, forgings, or other materials not intended to be used for standalone fences, shall not be permitted within or adjacent to any residential or business district, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
(Code 2002, § 220-68; Ord. No. 530, § 1, 10-11-2010)
 
Sec. 46-10. Floodplain regulation.
(a)	The purpose of these regulations is to protect those areas of the city which are subject to periodic inundation from floodwaters of the major rivers, their branches and tributaries within the city so that the reservoir capacity shall not be significantly reduced, thereby creating changes to areas previously not so endangered in time of high water, or to impede, retard, accelerate, or change the direction of the flow or carrying capacity of the river valley or to otherwise increase the possibility of flood. Said regulations, while permitting reasonable use of such properties, will help protect human life, safety, health, and general welfare, and prevent or minimize material or economic losses, through public aid and relief efforts occasioned by the unwise occupancy of such flood areas. All land and land uses within the floodplain area shall be subject to the requirements specified herein, in addition to the zoning district requirements of the zones which said lands are located. 
(b)	The floodplain within the city is all of the land which would be inundated during the base (100-year) flood. The flood insurance rate map for the city (United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Insurance Administration, Community-Panel Number 260068 0005 A, effective January 2, 1981), serves as the official floodplain zoning map. This flood insurance rate map takes precedence over all prior maps and may be subject to alteration with any significant change in land use, including the indirect impact of such a change that seriously impedes, retards, accelerates, or changes the direction of flow or carrying capacity of the watercourse or which otherwise increases the possibility of flood. The official floodplain zoning map is on file at the office of the City Clerk. 
(c)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter within the floodplain, no building or structure shall be erected, converted or structurally altered, and no land and/or structure shall be used, except for one or more of the following uses: 
(1)	Open space uses, such as crop farming and gardening (not including related buildings), parks, playground, golf courses, nature preserves, bridle trails and nature paths, private and commercial recreation, and other similar open spaces. 
(2)	Public rights-of-way, private drives and off-street parking uses, provided that all parking shall be at grade level and in conformance with the provision of this chapter. 
(3)	Public utility facilities, provided that utilities are constructed or elevated to withstand flood damages and are as further regulated by this chapter. 
(4)	Storage yards for material and equipment, not including flammable liquids, herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers or toxic agents. 
(d)	Any use provided for within this chapter as permitted and regulated within the zoning district shall be permitted within the floodplain, provided: 
(1)	The use pattern and the structure proposed to accomplish said use shall be so designed as to not significantly reduce the impoundment capacity of the floodplain and the flow of water by the use of stilts, cantilevering, or such other design techniques which will place the desired buildings above the intermediate regional flood high water level of the site in a safe manner so said structure or building will withstand the anticipated velocity of the floodwater, and not suffer flood damage. 
(2)	All buildings substantially improved or newly constructed shall have a minimum floor elevation of the intermediate regional flood and shall further incorporate elevation for floodproofing of the structure and all attendant utility and sanitary facilities up to the level of the intermediate regional flood. 
(e)	Prior to the issuance of a building permit for structures on/or adjacent to floodplain areas, the zoning administrator shall require the applicant for such permit to submit topographic data, engineering studies, proposed site plans, or other similar data needed to determine the possible effects of flooding on a proposed structure and/or the effect of the structure on the flow of water. All such required data shall be prepared by technically qualified persons. Review of the data submitted an application for special use permit shall be processed according to the procedures described in section 46-586, Notice of public hearing. 
(f)	Dumping or backfilling in the floodplain areas with any material in any manner is prohibited unless, through compensating excavation and shaping of the floodplain, it is provided that the flow and natural impoundment capacity of the floodplain will be maintained or improved so that no significant or measurable change in flow or reduction in impoundment capacity of the floodplain would thereby result. Where there is dumping, backfilling, or excavation, in any manner, adequate site plan and engineering drawings shall be submitted to the zoning administrator which must effectively show the final results of such action. 
(g)	It is the intent of this chapter to permit existing uses to continue in the floodplain until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is recognized there exist within the floodplain, as defined by this chapter, lots and structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under terms of this chapter or future amendments. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the floodplain. It is further the intent of this chapter that illegal uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited in the floodplain. 
(1)	Should a structure located in the floodplain, as defined by this chapter, be damaged by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of the structure's precatastrophe market value, as recorded by the assessing officer, it shall not be reconstructed. The damage to the structure is the expenditure necessary to return the structure to its condition before destruction and shall be determined by the zoning administrator, who shall: 
a.	Receive an estimate of the structural damage. 
b.	Receive a figure representing the difference between the precatastrophe market value of the structure and the postcatastrophe value as determined by the assessing officer. 
c.	Divide the sum of the figure derived in subsection (g)(1)a from the zoning administrator and in subsection (g)(1)b from the assessing officer by two. 
(2)	Any building damaged by any means to an extent of less than 50 percent of the structure's precatastrophe market value, as recorded by the assessing officer, may be modified, repaired, or replaced, but any alterations must incorporate floodproofing of utility and sanitary facilities up to the level of the intermediate regional flood. The costs of said improvements for floodproofing shall not be included in determining the damage costs. 
The board of appeals may permit reconstruction of a use if it is protected against flood damage, is not located in the floodway, and not allowing reconstruction would create undue hardship in the appellant. 
(h)	Under no circumstances shall the city incur any liability whatsoever for the granting of any use or building in floodplain areas. 
(Code 2002, § 220-69)
 
Sec. 46-11. Exterior lighting.
(a)	All outdoor lighting in all use districts used to illuminate the general area of a specific site shall be shielded to reduce glare and shall be so arranged as to reflect lights away from all adjacent residential districts or adjacent residences. 
(b)	All outdoor lighting in all use districts shall be directed toward and confined to the ground area of lawns or parking lots. 
(c)	All lighting of nonresidential uses for the external illumination of buildings, so as to feature said buildings, shall be placed and shielded so as not to interfere with the vision of persons on adjacent highways or adjacent property. 
(d)	All illumination of signs and any other outdoor features shall not be of a flashing, moving, or intermittent type. Artificial light shall be maintained stationary and constant in intensity and color at all times when in use. 
(e)	Parking lot lighting shall not exceed an intensity of five footcandles, nor shall it be less than 1½ footcandles. 
(f)	Exterior lighting shall in no way imitate directional or traffic lighting. 
(Code 2002, § 220-70)
 
Sec. 46-12. Corner clearance.
No fence, wall, shrubbery, sign, or other obstruction to vision above a height of two feet from the established street grades shall be permitted within the triangular area formed at the intersection of any street right-of-way lines by a straight line drawn between said right-of-way lines at a distance along each line of 25 feet from their point of intersection, nor shall such obstruction to vision be permitted at the intersection of any driveway or alley and a street right-of-way line within a triangular area formed at such intersection by a straight line drawn between the driveway or alley line and the street right-of-way line at a distance along each line of 15 feet from their point of intersection. In those instances where such triangular area cannot be constructed on the property in question, a 15-foot setback shall be required between the property line and the driveway or alley (see sketch). 
 

(Code 2002, § 220-71)
 
Sec. 46-13. Access to a street.
Any lot of record created after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall have at least 20 feet of frontage on a public street. Any one lot of record created before the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived without any frontage on a public street shall not be occupied without access provided by an casement or other right-of-way no less than 20 feet wide. 
(Code 2002, § 220-72; Ord. No. 552, § 1, 5-26-2015)
 
Sec. 46-14. Residential entranceway.
In all residential districts, so-called entranceway structures, including, but not limited to, walls, columns and gates marking entrances to single-family neighborhoods or multiple-housing complexes, may be permitted and may be located in a required yard, except as provided in section 46-12, provided that such entranceway structures shall comply with all codes of the city and shall be approved by the zoning administrator and building inspector. Site plan review by the planning commission is not required. 
(Code 2002, § 220-73)
 
Sec. 46-15. Access management.
(a)	Generally. The standards of this section are intended to promote safe and efficient travel within the city; minimize disruptive and potentially hazardous traffic conflicts; separate traffic conflict areas by reducing the number of driveways; provide efficient spacing standards between driveways, and between driveways and intersections; protect the substantial public investment in the street system; and to ensure reasonable access to properties, though not always by the most direct route. 
(b)	Standards. The following standards shall apply to all uses except residential developments involving fewer than five dwelling units. However, if it appears that there would be unusual difficulty encountered in meeting these requirements because of grade changes, existing or proposed intersections, driveways, bridges, or other land restrictions, the planning commission may waive or modify the requirements of this section, if recommended by the city engineer and, if located on a state trunkline, the state department of transportation. 
(1)	Acceleration deceleration passing lanes: 
a.	Driveways providing ingress and egress to all two-lane, paved major thoroughfares shall be provided with paved acceleration and deceleration lanes and passing lanes, if recommended by the city engineer and, if located on a state trunkline, the state department of transportation. 
b.	Driveways providing ingress and egress to all three-lane, paved major thoroughfares shall be provided with paved acceleration and deceleration lanes, if recommended by the city engineer and, if located on a state trunkline, the state department of transportation. 
c.	Driveways providing ingress and egress to roads of four or more lanes shall be provided with paved tapers or turning lanes, if recommended by the city engineer and, if located on a state trunkline, the state department of transportation. 
d.	Required lanes or tapers shall be indicated schematically on the site plan and shall be constructed in accordance with the standards for such facilities as established by the city engineer, and, if located on a state trunkline, the state department of transportation. 
(2)	Driveway spacing: 
 

a.	If a driveway curb radius extends beyond the frontage of the property, written consent from the affected adjacent property owner allowing the design shall be provided. 
b.	Except where a center median or boulevard is provided, to reduce left-turn conflicts, new commercial driveways shall be aligned with those across the roadway where possible. If alignment is not possible, driveways should be offset a minimum of 150 feet from those on the opposite side of the roadway. 
c.	Minimum driveway spacing requirements shall be determined based on posted speed limits along the parcel frontage, as indicated in the following table: 
(c)	Distance from intersecting streets. Driveway spacing from an intersection shall be measured from the centerline of the driveway to the closest edge of the nearest travel lane on the intersecting street. The required minimum distance between a driveway and an intersecting street varies as follows: 
Intersecting Street	Full Movement Driveway	One-Way Drives
Major thoroughfare 	250 feet 	100 feet 
Signalized major thoroughfare 	200 feet 	75 feet 
Local or secondary thoroughfare 	100 feet 	75 feet 

(d)	Number of driveways. Where driveway spacing standards can be met (outlined in subsection (b) of this section), an individual parcel, or contiguous parcels under the same ownership shall be permitted one two-way driveway or a paired one-way driveway system wherein one driveway is designed, and appropriately marked, to accommodate ingress traffic and the other egress traffic. In the following instances, the planning commission may allow more than one driveway: 
(1)	Developments that can demonstrate that the number of vehicle trip ends will exceed 3,000 during an average day (or will be used by 300 or more vehicles during the peak hour of traffic for either the thoroughfare or the use), and lacking access to a second street, a second driveway may be allowed along the major thoroughfare provided that the additional driveway can meet the spacing standards of subsection (b) of this section. 
(2)	For parcels with arterial frontage of at least 300 feet, one additional driveway may be allowed, with another driveway allowed for each 300 feet of frontage thereafter, provided that these driveways meet the standards of subsection (b) of this section. 
(3)	Where parcels have frontage on more than one street the planning commission may allow the provision of two drives; one to each street provided that the standards of subsections (b) and (c) of this section are met. 
(e)	Alternative means of access. To reduce the number of curb cuts to the city's major thoroughfares, alternative means of access shall be encouraged in general. However, due to the driveway spacing standards specified in subsection (b) of this section, a shared driveway may be the only design solution that will be permitted. In such cases the following alternative means of access may apply: 
(1)	Shared driveways. Sharing or joint use of a driveway by two or more property owners shall be encouraged. The shared driveway shall be constructed along the midpoint between the two properties. If a written easement is provided which allows traffic to travel across one parcel to access another, or access the public street, the driveway can be located entirely on one parcel. 
(2)	Frontage roads.
a.	In cases where a frontage road exists, is recommended in a plan adopted by the planning commission and/or is proposed in an approved site plan for an adjoining lot or parcel, access shall be provided via such frontage road, rather than by direct connection to the major thoroughfare. 
b.	In areas where frontage roads are planned, but adjacent properties have not yet developed, the site shall be designed to accommodate a future road. In such instances, the planning commission may temporarily grant individual parcels a direct connection to the adjacent major thoroughfare. A performance bond or other financial guarantee must be provided which ensures elimination of the temporary access upon completion of the service road. Occupancy permits shall not be issued until such financial guarantee has been submitted to the city. 
(3)	Parking lot connections. All parking lots shall be designed in such a way as to allow for a connection to the parking lot of an existing or future use. Such connection shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width and shall be set back a minimum of 30 feet from the planned future right-of-way of adjacent roads.

Sec. 46-95. Interpretation of district boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any districts established in this chapter as shown on the zoning district maps, the following rules shall be applied: 
(1)	Where boundaries approximately follow the centerlines of streets, alleys or highways, such centerlines shall be construed to be said boundaries. 
(2)	Boundaries indicated so that they approximately follow lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. 
(3)	Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following city limits. 
(4)	Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be the midway between the main tracks. 
(5)	Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
(6)	Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subsections (1) through (5) of this section shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map. 
(7)	Insofar as some or all of the various districts may be indicated on the zoning map by patterns which, for the sake of map clarity, do not cover public right-of-way, it is intended that such district boundaries do extend to the center of any public right-of-way. 
(8)	Where physical or natural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances not covered by subsections (1) through (6) of this section, the board of appeals after recommendation from the city planning commission shall interpret the district boundaries. 
(Code 2002, § 220-7)

Sec. 46-126. Accessory uses permitted subject to special conditions.
The following uses shall be permitted in single-family residential districts, subject to the conditions hereinafter imposed for each use: 
(1)	Bed and breakfast facilities, provided that: 
a.	The rooms utilized are a part of the principal residential use, and not specifically constructed for rental purposes. 
b.	The bed and breakfast facility does not require any internal or external alterations or construction features, equipment, or outdoor storage not customary in residential areas and does not change the character of the dwelling. 
c.	The principal use is a one-family residential dwelling and is owner-occupied at all times. 
d.	Sufficient off-street parking is provided in addition to that required by Article XVII of this chapter, for residential purposes, at the rate of one space per leasable room. 
e.	Signage shall be architecturally compatible with the home. One nonilluminated nameplate, not more than one square foot in area, may be attached to the building which shall contain only the name and occupation of the resident of the premises. 
(2)	State-licensed family day care homes are permitted after review and approval by the zoning administrator, subject to the following conditions: 
a.	The licensee shall occupy the dwelling as a residence. 
b.	One nonilluminated nameplate, not more than one square foot in area, may be attached to the building which shall contain only the name and occupation of the resident of the premises.

Such occupation may include the giving of instruction in a craft or fine art within the residence. All home occupation uses shall be subject to noise, advertising, hours of operation or other conditions which may accompany the use of a residence as a home occupation pursuant to the terms of this chapter), may be permitted after review by the zoning administrator provided that: 
a.	No more than one-quarter of the usable floor area of a residence may be devoted to a home occupation. If more than one-quarter of the usable floor area is devoted to the business, such business will be considered the principal use and, thus, illegal in a residential district. 
b.	The home occupation shall not require any internal or external alterations or construction features, equipment, vehicles or outdoor storage not customary in residential areas and does not change the character of the dwelling. 
c.	The home occupation is conducted entirely within the dwelling and shall be conducted so as to not be noticeable from the exterior of the dwelling. 
d.	Automotive repair on vehicles not owned by a person residing on the premises is not permitted as a home occupation. 
e.	Other than residents of the dwelling unit, no more than one employee may be located on the premises.

i.	A lawfully established home occupation shall lose its right to operate should it no longer meet the conditions outlined above or stipulated by the zoning board of appeals. 
j.	In cases where the zoning administrator finds that an existing or proposed home occupation does not meet the above criteria the zoning board of appeals may grant an exception to any of the above standards. In such cases, the zoning board of appeals may eliminate or modify any of the existing standards or may apply new standards altogether to assure that a use permitted by exception will be in character with its surroundings and will in general not be a nuisance or result in nuisance factors. 
(Code 2002, § 220-13; Ord. No. 531, § 1, 10-11-2010; Ord. No. 563 , § 1(220-13), 6-26-2017)
 
Sec. 46-127. Required conditions.
(a)	Compliance with article XVI of this chapter, limiting the height and bulk of buildings, the minimum size of lot permitted by land use, the maximum density permitted, and minimum yard setback requirements. 
(b)	New single-family buildings shall have an appearance that is nonobtrusive and consistent in color, materials, roofline, and architecture with the residential district in which it is located. 
(Code 2002, § 220-14)
 
Sec. 46-128. Subdivision open space plat.
(a)	The purpose of a subdivision open space plat is to promote the preservation of open space while allowing a reduction in lot sizes and maintaining the density of population. In reviewing a subdivision open space plat, the planning commission shall consider the following objectives: 
(1)	To provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the natural character of open fields, stands of trees, brooks, hills, and similar natural assets. 
(2)	To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the development of residential areas. 
(3)	To encourage a more efficient, aesthetic, and desirable use of open area while recognizing a reduction in developing costs and by allowing the developer to bypass natural features on the site. 
(4)	To encourage the provision of open space within reasonable distance of all lot development of the subdivision and to further encourage the development of recreational facilities or preservation of natural environmental assets. 
(b)	Modifications of the standards as outlined in article XVI of this chapter may be made in the R-LD Districts when the following conditions are met: 
(1)	Lot dimensions may be reduced provided that the number of residential lots shall be no greater than if the land area to be subdivided was developed in the minimum square foot lot areas as required for the R-LD District under article XVI of this chapter. 
(2)	Lot widths may be reduced from a minimum width of 80 feet to a minimum of 70 feet. 
(3)	Lot depths shall not be less than 140 feet except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
(4)	Minimum front setbacks may be reduced from 35 feet to 30 feet. 
(5)	Lot depths may be reduced to not less than 120 feet when such lots border on land dedicated to the common use of the subdivision as indicated in subsection (c) of this section: 
(6)	Rear yards may be reduced to not less than 30 feet when rear yards border on land dedicated to the common use of the subdivision as indicated in subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)	For each square foot of land gained under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section within a residential subdivision through the reduction of lot sizes below the minimum requirements, as outlined in article XVI of this chapter, equal amounts of land shall be dedicated to the common use of the lot owners in the subdivision in a manner approved by the city. 
(d)	Access shall be provided to areas dedicated for the common use of the subdivision for those lots not bordering on such dedicated areas by means of streets, parkways, or pedestrian accessways. The open space for pedestrian access-ways shall be no less than 20 feet in width. 
(e)	Under this subdivision open space plat approach, the proprietor shall dedicate sufficient park area so that each final plat is within maximum density requirements; provided, however, that the entire park area within a single block shall be dedicated as a whole. 
(f)	Application for approval of the subdivision open space plat shall be submitted at the time of submission of the preliminary plat for approval as required by chapter 36 of this Code. 
(Code 2002, § 220-15)
 
Sec. 46-129. One-family clustering option.
(a)	Intent.
(1)	The intent of this section is to permit the development of one-family residential patterns which, through design innovations, will provide for an alternative means for development of single-family areas where a parcel of land has characteristics which hinder practical development under the normal subdivision approach or where the alternative will permit better preservation of natural features. Also, this option may permit increased densities under certain circumstances. To accomplish this, modifications to the one-family residential standards, as outlined in article XVI of this chapter, may be permitted in the R-LD Districts. 
(2)	In the R-LD Districts, the requirements of article XVI of this chapter, may be waived and the attaching of one-family dwelling units may be permitted subject to the standards of this section. 
(b)	Conditions for qualification.
(1)	Qualification for the cluster option shall be based on two findings by the planning commission with final density dependent upon whether or not the site qualifies under both findings. 
a.	First, the planning commission shall find that the parcel will qualify for the cluster development option as defined in subsection (b)(2)a through g of this section. Development would be at the single-family densities as permitted in subsection (c)(1) of this section. This finding must be made in all cases. 
b.	Second, the planning commission may additionally find that the parcel is located in a transition area or is impacted by nonresidential uses or traffic on major or secondary thoroughfares or other similar conditions. If the planning commission makes such a finding, it may permit an increase in density up to the maximum densities established in subsection (c)(2) of this section. 
(2)	The planning commission may approve the clustering or attaching of buildings on parcels of land under single ownership and control which, in the opinion of the planning commission, have characteristics that would make sound physical development under the normal subdivision approach impractical because of parcel size, shape or dimension, or because the site is located in a transitional use area or the site has natural characteristics which are worth preserving or which make platting difficult. In approving a parcel for cluster development, the planning commission shall find at least one of the following conditions to exist: 
a.	The parcel to be developed has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare and is generally parallel to said thoroughfare and is of shallow depth as measured from the thoroughfare. 
b.	The parcel has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare and is of a narrow width, as measured along the thoroughfare, which makes platting difficult. 
c.	A substantial portion of the parcel's perimeter is bordered by a major thoroughfare which would result in a substantial proportion of the lots of the development abutting the major thoroughfare. 
d.	A substantial portion of the parcel's perimeter is bordered by land that is zoned other than single-family residential or is developed for a use other than one-family homes. 
e.	The parcel is shaped in such a way that the angles formed by its boundaries make a subdivision difficult to achieve and the parcel has frontage on a major or secondary thoroughfare. 
f.	The parcel contains a floodplain or soil conditions which result in a substantial portion of the total area of the parcel being unbuildable. 
g.	The parcel contains natural assets which would be preserved through the use of cluster development. Such assets may include natural stands of large trees, land which serves as a natural habitat for wildlife, unusual topographic features or other natural assets which should be preserved. 
(3)	In order to qualify a parcel for development under subsection (b)(1)f and g of this section, the planning commission shall determine that the parcel has those characteristics and the request shall be supported by written or graphic documentation, prepared by a landscape architect, engineer, professional community planner, registered architect or environmental design professional. Such documentation shall include the following as appropriate: soil test borings, floodplain map, topographic map of maximum two-foot contour interval, inventory of natural assets. 
(4)	This option shall not apply to those parcels of land which have been split for the specific purpose of coming within the requirements of this cluster option section. 
(c)	Permitted densities. In a cluster development, the maximum density permitted shall be as follows (including streets and road rights-of-way): 
(1)	For those parcels qualifying under subsection (a)(1)e through g of this section, the density permitted is 2½ units per acre. 
(2)	For those parcels qualifying under subsection (a)(1)a through d of this section, an increase in density may be permitted by the planning commission up to 3.7 units per acre. 
(3)	Water areas within the parcel may be included in the computation of density provided that land adjacent to the water is substantially developed as open space. 
(4)	In those instances where increased densities may be permitted under subsection (c)(2) of this section, the planning commission must find that such increased density does not result in the destruction or total removal of the natural features. 
(d)	Development standards and requirements. On parcels meeting the criteria of subsection (b)(1) of this section, the minimum yard setbacks, heights, and minimum lot sizes per unit, as required by article XVI of this chapter, may be waived and the attaching of dwelling units may be accomplished subject to the following: 
(1)	The attaching of one-family dwelling units, one to another, may be permitted when said homes are attached by means of one of the following: 
a.	Through a common party wall forming interior room space which does not have over 75 percent of its length in common with an abutting dwelling wall, including garage. 
b.	By means of an architectural wall detail which does not form interior room space. 
c.	Through common garage party walls of adjacent structures. 
d.	No other common party wall relationship is permitted and the number of units attached in this manner shall not exceed three. This number may be increased to four if, in the opinion of the planning commission, greater preservation of natural assets would result. 
(2)	Yard requirements shall be provided as follows: 
a.	Spacing between groups of attached buildings or between groups of four unattached buildings shall be equal to at least 25 feet, measured between the nearest points of adjacent buildings. The minimum distance between detached units within groups of four shall be 15 feet, unless there is a corner to corner relationship in which case the minimum may be reduced to ten feet. 
b.	It is intended that setbacks for each dwelling shall be such that one car length space will be available between the garage or required off-street parking spaces and the street pavement. Setbacks from minor residential streets should follow the guidelines below: 
1.	Garages or required off-street parking spaces shall not be located less than 20 feet from the right-of-way of a public street. 
2.	Where streets are private, required off-street parking spaces shall not be located less than 30 feet from the pavement edge of the street. 
c.	That side of a cluster adjacent to a major or secondary thoroughfare shall not be nearer than 25 feet to said road right-of-way. 
d.	Any side of a cluster adjacent to a private road shall not be nearer to said road than 20 feet. 
(3)	The area in open space (including subdivision recreation areas and water) accomplished through the use of one-family cluster shall represent at least 15 percent of the horizontal development area of a one-family cluster development. 
(4)	In order to provide an orderly transition of density, where the parcel proposed for use as a cluster development abuts a one-family residential district, the planning commission shall determine that the abutting one-family district is effectively buffered by means of one of the following within the cluster development: 
a.	Single-family lots subject to the standards of the R-MD District as specified in article XVI of this chapter. 
b.	Detached buildings with setbacks, as required by article XVI of this chapter, for the applicable residential district. 
c.	Open or recreation space with a minimum depth of 50 feet. 
d.	Changes in topography which provide an effective buffer. 
e.	A major or secondary thoroughfare. 
f.	Some other similar effective means of providing a transition that is acceptable to the planning commission. 
g.	In those instances where the parcel has been qualified for the cluster option under subsection (b)(2)a or where the adjoining land may be used for purposes other than detached one-family dwellings, the planning commission may approve a plan in which the units are attached if the parcel is too small to provide the transition and the greatest setback possible is provided. 
(e)	Procedures.
(1)	In making application for approval under this section, the applicant shall file a sworn statement that the parcel has not been split for the purpose of coming within the requirements of this option, and shall further file a sworn statement indicating the date of acquisition of the parcel by the present owner. 
(2)	Qualification for cluster development: 
a.	Application to the planning commission for qualification of a parcel for cluster development shall include documentation substantiating one or more of the characteristics outlined in subsection (b) of this section, Conditions for qualification. 
b.	As an initial step, the applicant may ask the planning commission to make a preliminary determination as to whether or not a parcel qualifies for the cluster option under one or both of the provisions of subsection (b)(1) of this section, based upon the documentation submitted. 
c.	A preliminary determination by the planning commission that a parcel qualifies for cluster development does not ensure approval of the site plan and, therefore, does not approve the cluster option. It does, however, give an initial indication as to whether or not a petitioner should proceed to prepare a site plan. 
d.	The applicant may submit a site plan, as follows, if a preliminary determination is not sought. 
(3)	Site plan and cluster approval. 
a.	The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the site plan after an initial review of a preliminary plan which shall not require a public hearing. 
b.	In submitting a proposed layout under this section, the sponsor of the development shall include, along with the site plan, the following: 
1.	Typical building elevations and floor plans, topography drawn at one-foot contour intervals, all computations relative to acreage and density, a preliminary grading plan, and any other details which will assist in reviewing the proposed plan. 
2.	An accurate tree survey indicating the location of all trees on the site of eight-inch DBH or greater. Such survey shall be at the same scale as the site plan. 
c.	Site plans submitted under this option shall be accompanied by information as required by chapter 36, Subdivisions, of the Code of the city, provided, however, that: 
1.	Submission of an open space plan and cost estimates with the preliminary site plan shall be at the option of the applicant. 
2.	The open space plan and cost estimate shall be submitted prior to final review or the public hearing. 
d.	The planning commission shall give notice of the public hearing in accordance with section 46-586, Notice of public hearings. 
e.	If the planning commission is satisfied that the proposal meets the letter and spirit of the zoning ordinance and should be approved, it shall give tentative approval with the conditions upon which such approval should be based. If the planning commission is not satisfied that the proposal meets the letter and spirit of this chapter, or finds that approval of the proposal would be detrimental to existing development in the general area and should not be approved, it shall record the reasons therefor in the minutes of the planning commission meeting. Notice of approval or disapproval of the proposal together with copies of the proposal with copies of all layouts and other relevant information shall be forwarded to the City Clerk. If the proposal has been approved by the planning commission, the clerk shall place the matter upon the agenda of the City Council. If disapproved, the applicant shall be entitled to a public hearing before the City Council, if requested in writing within 30 days after action by the planning commission. 
f.	If the City Council approves the plans, it shall instruct the City Attorney to prepare a contract, setting forth the conditions upon which such approval is based, which contract, after approval by the City Council, shall be entered into between the city and the applicant prior to the issuance of a building permit for any construction in accordance with site plans. 
g.	As a condition for the approval of the site plan and open space plan by the City Council, the applicant shall deposit cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or other equivalent form of security as approved by the City Attorney, in the amount of the estimated cost of the proposed improvements to the open land guaranteeing the completion of such improvement within a time to be set by the City Council. Actual development of the open space shall be carried out concurrently with the construction of dwelling units. 
(Code 2002, § 220-16)
 
Sec. 46-130. One-family, low density site condominium option.
(a)	The low density site condominium option is intended to provide for the division of land as regulated by the Condominium Act (Act 59 of 1978, as amended, MCL 559.101 et seq.) rather than the Subdivision Control Act (Act 288 of 1967, as amended, MCL 560.101 et seq.). In accordance with Section 141 of Act 59 (MCL 559.241), it is further intended that development utilizing the site condominium options be treated no differently than a subdivision developed under the Subdivision Control Act and that the same standards be applied in their design layout and improvements. 
(b)	If the low density site condominium option is selected, the following conditions are applicable: 
(1)	Article XVI of this chapter, limiting the height and bulk of buildings, the minimum lot sizes and yard requirements shall be applicable as permitted in each zoning district or as otherwise altered within this section. 
(2)	Any development which utilizes the site condominium option shall conform to article IV of this chapter and article V of chapter 36 of this Code. 
(3)	A site plan shall be submitted in accordance with section 46-20. 
(4)	Other options, as defined and regulated by section 46-128, can be used in conjunction with this section. 
(5)	If building footprints are shown on the site plan, setbacks shall be measured to the building. Otherwise, setbacks shall be provided for each building envelope equal to the minimum setback requirements of the zoning district and shall be measured as specified below: 
a.	Rear setbacks shall be measured from the rear area line to the rear building envelope. 
b.	Side setbacks shall be measured from the side area line to the side building envelope. 
c.	Front setbacks shall be measured from the street right-of-way for public or private streets, and from the pavement edge for streets not having a right-of-way. In instances where there is no right-of-way, the setback shall be increased by 15 feet. 
(6)	If building footprints are shown on the plan, building floor plans, and elevations must be submitted. 
(7)	The planning commission may request that several different facades be used to provide a variety of building appearances. 
(8)	Plans for the development and landscaping of all commons areas must be submitted and shall meet the applicable requirements of section 46-7. 
(9)	All streets shall be dedicated to the public and constructed in accordance with all applicable requirements of chapter 36, except that the minimum right-of-way width may be reduced after review and recommendation by the city engineer, public services director, and fire chief.

ARTICLE XIX. NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES, AND USES
 
Sec. 46-543. Intent.
(a)	Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. 
(b)	It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(c)	A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. 
(Code 2002, § 220-91)
 
Sec. 46-544. Nonconforming lots.
If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter. 
(Code 2002, § 220-92)
 
Sec. 46-545. Nonconforming uses of land.
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)	No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
(2)	No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
(3)	If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is located. 
(Code 2002, § 220-93)
 
Sec. 46-546. Nonconforming structures.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)	No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. 
(2)	Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. In instances where a nonconforming structure is partially destroyed the city's chief building official shall make a determination as to whether or not repairs to the structure will exceed 50 percent of the replacement cost. 
(3)	Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(Code 2002, § 220-94)
 
Sec. 46-547. Nonconforming uses of structures and premises.
If a lawful use of structure, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)	No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
(2)	Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
(3)	If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the board of appeals, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the zoning board of appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this chapter. 
(4)	Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(5)	When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-year period, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Structures occupied by seasonal uses shall be excepted from this provision. 
(6)	Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. 
(7)	Given the historical development pattern in the city, a number of two-family residential uses exist on lots zoned for one-family residential uses. It is the intent of this subsection to allow such uses to continue subject to compliance with the following standards and procedures: 
a.	A nonconforming two-family dwelling and its accessory structures within single-family districts may be continued, replaced, or remodeled if damaged by fire, vandalism, flood, or other force of nature, if approved by the zoning board of appeals. Such approval shall require a finding that the resulting building footprint will be the same size or smaller than that of the building before such change, and that the new building shall have an appearance that is nonobtrusive and consistent in color, materials, roofline, and architecture with the residential district in which it is located. 
b.	Replacement of such nonconforming two-family buildings shall commence within six months of the date of damage and work shall be diligently pursued toward completion. 
c.	Failure to complete replacement or diligently work toward completion, or use of the building for a conforming single-family use for any period of time, shall result in the loss of legal, nonconforming status unless good cause for the delay or temporary change in use in found to be acceptable at a hearing before the zoning board of appeals. 
(Code 2002, § 220-95)
 
Sec. 46-548. Repairs and maintenance.
(a)	On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement value of the building, provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall not be increased. 
(b)	Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
(Code 2002, § 220-96)
 
Sec. 46-549. Uses under exception provisions.
Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in this chapter shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall, without further action, be deemed a conforming use in such district. 
(Code 2002, § 220-97)
 
Sec. 46-550. Change of tenancy or ownership.
There may be a change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any existing nonconforming uses of land, structures and premises provided there is no change in the nature or character of such nonconforming uses.
