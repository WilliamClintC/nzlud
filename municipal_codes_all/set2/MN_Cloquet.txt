imposed by the City pursuant to this chapter may be collected by the State on behalf of the City as provided

Section 4.5 Security Alarm Responses by Law Enforcement 9
Section 4.5: Security Alarm Responses By Law Enforcement
4.5.01 Purpose. It has come to the attention of the City Council that it is becoming increasingly common for
private citizens to install and utilize security alarm systems. As a direct result of the increased use of such systems,
there has been a significant increase in the number of false alarms that have required local law enforcement response.
The purpose of these provisions is to encourage alarm users and alarm companies to properly use and maintain such
systems so as to reduce or eliminate false alarms which may unduly divert law enforcement resources from
responding to their regular duties within the City and County. These provisions are intended to address the use of
systems which directly or indirectly summon law enforcement response unnecessarily. These provisions further
establish a system of fines and provides penalties for violators, and establishes a system for the administration of
alleged violations.

organization of any kind who (which) uses or is in control of any security alarm system at an alarm
site.
C. False alarm means an alarm signal sent to a law enforcement authority requesting a response
when a situation requiring a response does not exist. Examples of false alarms include, but are not
limited to, circumstances which result by the activation of the alarm system through mechanical

user, owner or lessee of an alarm system or of his/her employees or agents. For purposes of this
section false alarms do not include signals sent as a result of changing climatic conditions such as
tornadoes, thunderstorms, utility line mishaps, or any other conditions which are clearly beyond the
control of the alarm manufacturer, installer, owner or user.
D. Law enforcement authority means the Cloquet Police Department, the Carlton County Sheriff's
Department or other authorized enforcement agency, or their designated representatives which are
notified to respond to the alarm signal.
Subd. 2. Reports of false alarms; notice to alarm user. The law enforcement authority shall file a
written report with the Cloquet Chief of Police each time they respond to an alarm signal which they
determine to be a false alarm. Each time such a report is filed with the Chief of Police, the Chief of Police
shall notify the alarm user by certified mail of the false alarm incident and will provide the security system
owner with a copy of the provisions of this section.
Subd. 3. User Fines; notice. An alarm user shall be subject to fines and warnings based strictly upon the
number of false alarms emitted from the alarm system which are reported and filed with the Cloquet Chief
of Police during a calendar year. Fines will be assessed as follows:

days of the Citys mailing of the notice of false alarm. Notices received after ten (10) days are considered
late and will not be considered. The City Administrator will review the appeal and determine whether the
appellant is to be charged with a false alarm. Appeals from the final determination by the City
Administrator will be governed by the City Administrative process providing for administrative hearings.
Subd. 5. Payment of fines. When and where due. Payment of administrative fines pursuant to this
section must be made to the City Administrator's office within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the written
notice from the City to the alarm user. Failure to pay the fine within said thirty (30) day period will cause
the alarm user to be considered delinquent and the violator will be assessed a penalty for non-payment of a
full ten (10) percent of the fine due in each instance.
A. Delinquencies. All delinquent charges for user fines may be certified by the City Administrator to

property on which the alarm system is installed. This certification process shall take place on a
yearly basis on October 10th of each year or by such earlier date as is necessary to have the
delinquent charges collectible with taxes due and payable against the property in the next calendar
year.

calendar year, the alarm user shall submit a written report to the City Administrator within ten (10) days
after being charged with the fifth false alarm, describing actions taken or to be taken to discover and
eliminate the cause of the false alarms. Failure to submit the written report required by this section will also

may be necessary for the implementation of this section and the administration thereof.

Section 4.8 Designated Predatory Offender Residency Restrictions 14
Section 4.8: Designated Predatory Offender Residency Restrictions
4.8.01. Purpose. The Cloquet City Council intends to serve the citys compelling interest to promote, protect and
improve the health, safety, and welfare of Cloquet citizens under this Section. It is the express intent of the City
Council to further that interest by: creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in
concentrated numbers, within which certain predatory offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or
permanent residence; and, by mitigating the concentration of certain predatory offenders, as recommended by
Minnesota Statutes § 244.052, Subd. 4a, by prohibiting certain predatory offenders from establishing temporary or
permanent residence within close proximity to one another.
4.8.02. Findings. The City Council finds that repeat predatory offenders present a real threat to the public safety
and especially to that of children. Certain predatory offenders are likely to use physical violence and present a high
risk to repeat their offenses, and most such predatory offenders have committed many more offenses and have many
more victims than are ever reported and prosecuted. This makes dealing with the danger posed to the public safety
and especially that of children by those certain predatory offenders extremely important.
4.8.03. Definitions. For purposes of this section the following definitions will apply unless the context or intent
clearly requires a different meaning:
Designated predatory offender. Any person who is required to register as a predatory offender under
Minnesota Statutes § 243.166 and who has been categorized as a Level III predatory offender under
Minnesota Statutes § 244.052, Subd. 3, a successor statute, or a similar statute from another state, in which
that persons risk assessment indicates a high risk of reoffense.
Permanent residence. A place where a person abides, lodges, or resides for 14 or more consecutive days.
Temporary residence. A place where a person abides, lodges, or resides for a period of 14 or more days
in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not the persons permanent address or a place where
the person routinely abides, lodges, or resides for a period of four or more consecutive or non-consecutive
days in any month and which is not the persons permanent residence.
School. A public or nonpublic preschool, elementary or secondary school.
Licensed child care center. A group child care center currently licensed by the Carlton County,
Minnesota, public health and human services department.
Public park/playground. A city-owned, improved outdoor area designed, equipped, and set aside for
childrens play and includes in that area such facilities as play equipment, surfacing, fencing, signs, internal
pathways, internal land forms, vegetation and related structures.
4.8.04. Prohibited Acts.
A. Prohibited location of residence. It is unlawful for any designated predatory offender to
establish a permanent residence or temporary residence within 1,000 feet of any of the following:
1. School;
2. Licensed child care center;
3. Public park/playground; or
4. The permanent or temporary residence of any other designated predatory offender.
B. Measurement of distance. For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the
requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of the

5. The school, licensed child care center or public playground within 1,000 feet of the persons
permanent residence was opened after the designated predatory offender established the
permanent residence or temporary residence and reported and registered the residence
pursuant to Minnesota Statutes §§ 243.166 and 243.167, or a successor statute;
6. The residence is also the primary residence of the designated predatory offenders parents,
grandparents, siblings or spouse, and was their residence prior to February 3, 2014;
7. The residence is a property purchased, leased, or contracted with and licensed by the
Minnesota Department of Corrections prior to February 3, 2014.
4.8.05. Penalty. Any person who violates this section shall be punished according to the laws of the State of
Minnesota. A violation of this Section shall constitute a misdemeanor. If the matter is not charged criminally or if
there are extenuating circumstances warranting leniency, it may be treated as an administrative offense in the
discretion of the prosecuting attorney, with a financial penalty commensurate with that of a petty misdemeanor as
then provided by Minnesota Statute. Each day a person maintains a residence in violation of this ordinance
constitutes a separate violation.
4.8.06. Severability. The provisions of this Section are severable and if any provision of this Section or application
of any provision of this Section due to any circumstance is held invalid, the application of such provision to other
circumstances and the remainder of this Section shall not be affected thereby.

Section 4.9 Regulation of Synthetic Drugs 16
Section 4.9: Regulation of Synthetic Drugs
4.9.01 Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prescribe the regulation of synthetic drugs and synthetic drug
establishments to protect the general health, safety, and welfare of the Citys residents.
4.9.02 Findings of the City Council. The City Council makes the following findings regarding the need to regulate
synthetic drugs and the distribution and possession of synthetic drugs:
A. The consumption of products labeled not for human consumption is a public health hazard, creates
public nuisances, and results in an increased need for public safety services.

nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, loss of consciousness, hypertension, tremors, seizures, psychosis,
strokes, addiction, paranoid behavior, anxiety, increased heart rate, and even death.
C. The manner in which synthetic drugs are marketed, manufactured, and sold is, purportedly, not
currently regulated by the federal drug administration.
D. Synthetic drugs were being sold as legal products without even the basic regulation and licensing
requirements that many other businesses have within the City.
E. Prohibiting the possession and sale of synthetic drug products will provide for better public health
and safety.
4.9.03 Conclusions of the City Council. In direct furtherance of the substantial goals of public health, safety, and
welfare, the City Council adopts this section, recognizing that it has a great interest in the health and safety of its
citizens as well as the present and future character of the Citys residential and commercial neighborhoods.
4.9.04 Definitions.
A. The term synthetic drug means any compound, substance, or derivative that is not approved for
human consumption by the United States Food and Drug Administration or specifically permitted
for human consumption under Minnesota law, and, when introduced into the body, induces an
effect similar to that of a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance listed in Minnesota Statute
section 152.02, subdivisions 2 and 3, or Minnesota Rules, parts 6800.4210 and 6800.4220,
regardless of whether the substance is marketed for the purpose of human consumption.
4.9.05 Other Applicable Laws. This Ordinance is intended to complement state and federal laws regulating
synthetic drugs.

6.2.41 Temporary expansion of licensed premises; outdoor sales and services. The purpose of this section is to
allow for the temporary expansion of the licensed premises of a liquor licensee, to temporarily include limited
outdoor areas directly adjacent to and contiguous with the permanently licensed premises on City owned land or
City public right-of-way, from time to time, subject to such conditions as the City Council determines will protect
the public health, safety and welfare. The City Council finds that allowing outdoor sales and services in downtown
commercial areas is beneficial to the creation of a vibrant and prosperous business community so long as adequate
review, controls, and accountability are in place. Accordingly, liquor licensees shall be entitled to apply for the
benefits available under this section.
Therefore, the holder of any retail liquor license for premises located in the HC and CC zoning districts of the City
may, on an annual basis, apply for a permit for temporary expansion of its licensed premises, for an area directly
adjacent to and contiguous with the permanently licensed premises. The City Council may grant such a permit on
the terms and conditions specified under this section and such other terms and conditions as the City Council may
determine are necessary or advisable to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such permit shall authorize
use of any temporary expansion area on particular days, dates and times and shall be valid for a period of time as

general public that the City provide for compliance checks and administrative penalties for licensees who sell, barter
or dispense intoxicating (and non-intoxicating beverages) in violation of the provisions of Minnesota Statutes

CHAPTER 6 - LICENSES AND PERMITS
Section 6.10: Regulations Regarding the Licensing of Sexually Oriented Businesses 64
Section 6.10: REGULATIONS REGARDING THE
LICENSING OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
6.10.01 Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prescribe licensing requirements for sexually-oriented
businesses in order to protect the general health, safety, and welfare and to control certain land uses that may have a
direct and detrimental effect on the character of the City's residential and commercial neighborhoods.
6.10.02 Findings of the City Council. The City Council makes the following findings regarding the need to
license sexually-oriented businesses. The findings are based upon the experiences of other cities where such
businesses have located, as studied by a City staff committee. It is apparent from that review and the data compiled
by staff that there are a number of issues that must be addressed:
A. Sexually oriented businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending
places of worship, children attending state licensed family day care home, state licensed
group family day care homes, and state licensed childcare centers; student attending
school; and people using public parks and libraries.
B. Sexually-oriented businesses can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal
activity. The experience of other cities indicates that the proper management and
operation of such businesses can, however, minimize this risk, provided the owners and
operators of such facilities are regulated by licensing or other procedures.
C. Sexually oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of
residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the residential
housing in the area in which such businesses are located, thereby exacerbating the
shortage of affordable and habitable housing for City residents.
D. The concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area can have a substantially
detrimental effect on the area in which such businesses are concentrated and on the
overall quality of life in the community. A cycle of decay can result from the influx and
concentration of sexually oriented businesses. The presence of such businesses is often
perceived by others as an indication that the community or area is deteriorating and the
result can be devastating to other businesses that may be required to move out of the
vicinity and which could influence residents to relocate from the area. It has been noted
that the presence of such businesses can have the overall effect of causing declining real
estate values, which result can be exacerbated by the concentration of such businesses,
which can erode the City 's tax base and contribute to overall community blight.
E. Sexually-oriented businesses can increase the risk of exposure to communicable diseases
including but not limited to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) for which
currently there is no cure. Experiences of other cities indicate that such businesses can
facilitate the spread of communicable diseases by virtue of the design and use of the
premises, thereby endangering not only the patrons of such establishments but also the
general public.
F. Sexually-oriented businesses can cause or contribute to public health problems by the
presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with food and/or drink on the same
premises.
6.10.03 Conclusions of the City Council. In direct furtherance of the substantial goals of public health, safety,
and welfare, the City Council adopts this section, recognizing that it has a great interest in the present and future
character of the City's residential and commercial neighborhoods.

by its enabling legislation to regulate the disposal of Solid Waste within its boundaries; Laws of
Minnesota 1989, 1st Special Session, Chapter 1, (the "Score Legislation"). To reduce the volume
of Solid Waste requiring disposal, the legislation requires the District and other governmental
agencies in the State of Minnesota to be responsible for the disposal of solid waste to provide
residents an opportunity to recycle which shall include:
A. Local recycling center in the District and sites for collecting recyclable materials
that are located in areas convenient for persons to use them; and,
B. Curbside pickup, centralized drop-off, or a local recycling center for recyclable
materials in cities with a population of 5,000 or more persons.
The District has adopted a code relating to mixed municipal solid waste management and

altering those provisions which: (1) creates a system of licensing collectors; (2) regulates rates
for collection; (3) mandates the collection of mixed municipal solid waste; (4) provides residents
an opportunity to recycle as required by Minn. Stat. Section §115A.552, Subd. 1 and 2; (5)
supplies the District copies of all license applications for collectors on a monthly basis; and (6)
provides a certified copy of the ordinance to the District within five (5) days following
enactment. The City supports the goals of the Score Legislation and believes it is in the best
interest of its residents to design methods of accomplishing the goals consistent with factors
unique to the City. It shall be the express intent of this Section, specifically the mandatory
recycling provision of this Section, to require the recycling of Recyclable Materials within the
City in order to aid the District in meeting the goals specified in Minnesota Statutes §115A.551.
It shall be further the express intent of this Section to recognize that the District has regional
authority for the solid waste generated by residents of the City. Therefore, where this Section is
in contradiction to the rules and regulations of the District, the rules and regulations of the
District shall supersede the specific portions of this Section in contradiction or contravention of
the rules and regulations of the District.

Section 7.10: Smoking Prohibited in Certain Locations
7.10.01 Purpose and Application. Tobacco smoke has been determined to be a major
contributor to indoor air pollution and is known to be a leading cause of disease. There is
compelling evidence that second hand smoke causes and contributes to the development of
health conditions including lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory infection, decreased respiratory
function and other health- related problems. At special risk are children, elderly people,
individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function,
including people with asthma and those with obstructive airway disease. In view of these risks, it
is apparent that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space does
not sufficiently protect the general public and nonsmokers from exposure to harmful
environmental tobacco smoke and its associated health risks.
Accordingly, the purpose of this section is to:
1. Protect the public health, welfare and safety by better ensuring the ability of
citizens to breath safe and uncontaminated air; and,
2. Affirm that the need to breath uncontaminated air has priority over the desire to
smoke or to be exposed to tobacco smoke; and,
3. Protect vulnerable populations, including employees, children, the elderly and
those with chronic health conditions from exposure to tobacco contaminated air
and to guarantee the right of the public and nonsmokers to breath smoke-free air
while dining in public restaurants located within the City.

intake of a restaurant.
Subd. 3. Repealed in conformity with Carlton County Smoke-Free Ordinance No. 29.
7.10.04. Responsibilities of Proprietors. The proprietor or other person in charge of a
restaurant subject to Section 3 shall:

destroyed unless properly reclaimed by its owner. The owner will remain liable for all charges incurred by
the City in impounding, holding or destroying the animal.

owner shall be notified, or if the owner of the animal is unknown written notice shall be posted for three days at the
City Hall and the Animal Control Shelter, or designated Veterinarian Hospital used by the City as a pound,
describing the animal and the time and place of taking the impoundment. The owner of any animal so impounded
may reclaim the animal upon payment of the license fee and additional charge which shall be established by
resolution as adopted from time to time by the City Council as a late fee penalty for failure to license as required by
this Section. In addition the animal owner shall be responsible to pay for all costs and charges incurred by the City
for impounding and maintenance of the animal. The owner shall be notified that the Veterinarian will inject the
impounded animal with rabies shots if the animal is overdue for injection or if the Veterinarian cannot obtain

cost which shall be established by resolution as adopted from time to time by the City Council:

five (5) regular business days. If upon the expiration of five (5) regular business days from the date of notice to the
owner or the posting of the notice, the dog or cat shall not have been redeemed, it may be destroyed. Any
unlicensed dog or cat required by law to be licensed, or any dog or cat which appears to a licensed veterinarian to be
suffering from rabies or affected with hydrophobia, mange or other infectious or dangerous disease shall not be
released but may be forthwith destroyed with all costs accessible to the owner.
8.2.10 Muzzling. Whenever it becomes necessary to safeguard the public from the dangers of hydrophobia, the
Mayor, if he or she deems it necessary, may issue a proclamation ordering every person owning or keeping a dog to
confine it securely on his or her premises unless the dog shall have a muzzle of sufficient strength to prevent it from
biting any person. Any unmuzzled dog running at large during the time of the proclamation shall be seized and
impounded unless noticeably infected with rabies. All dogs so noticeably infected with rabies and displaying
vicious propensities shall be killed by any peace officer or animal control officer without notice to the owner.
Dogs impounded during the first two days of the proclamation shall, if claimed within four days, be released to the
owner, unless infected with rabies, and upon payment of the impounding charges, maintenance and serving of the
notice provided in this Section. If unclaimed after that period, the dog may be summarily destroyed.

Section 8.2: Dogs and Cats 7
8.2.11 Rabies Notice. If a dog or cat is believed to have rabies or has been bitten by a dog or cat suspected of
having rabies, the animal shall be confined by a leash or chain on the owner's premises and shall be placed under the
observation of a veterinarian at the expense of the owner for a period of two weeks. The owner shall notify the

officer or the Chief of Police. Every owner, or other person, upon ascertaining a dog or cat is rabid shall
immediately notify the City designated animal control officer or a police officer who shall either remove the animal
to the pound or summarily destroy it.
8.2.12 Proceedings for Destruction of Certain Dogs and Cats. Upon sworn complaint to the District Court and
upon good cause shown that any one of the following conditions exist, the Court may issue an Order to Show Cause

properly on its own premises or has habitually trespassed in a damaging manner on the
property of persons other than the owner;

become necessary to remove an existing utility this shall be done by its owner. No utility owned by the
City shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of the work is borne by the permittee.
The cost of moving privately owned utilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other
arrangements with the person owning the utility. The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or
otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the
excavation work and do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or
across the work. In case the pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged, they shall be
repaired by the agency or person owning them and the expense of the repairs shall be charged to the
permittee, and his or her bond shall be liable for the cost. The permittee shall be responsible for any
damage done to any public or private property by reason of the breaking of any water pipes, sewer, gas
pipe, electric conduit or other utility and its bond shall be liable therefor.
Subd. 9. Protection of Adjoining Property. The permittee shall at all times and at his or her own
expense preserve and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and
taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where in the protection of the property it shall be necessary
to enter upon private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall
obtain written permission from the owner of the private property for such purpose and if he or she cannot
obtain written permission from the owner the director may authorize him or her to enter the private
premises solely for the purpose of making the property safe. The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore
up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the
excavations work and shall be responsible for all damages to public or private property or roadways
resulting from its failure to properly protect and carry out the work. Whenever it may be necessary for the
permittee to trench through any lawn area, the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after
ditches have been back-filled as required in this Section. All construction and maintenance work shall be
done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as
possible to that which existed before the work began. The permittee shall not remove even temporarily any
trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas or easements across private property without first having
notified and obtained the consent of the property owner, or in the case of public property the appropriate
City Department or the City officials having control of the property.
Subd. 10. Protective Measures. The permittee shall erect adequate fences, railing or barriers about the
site of the excavation work as shall prevent danger to persons using the City street or sidewalks, and the
protective barriers shall be maintained until the work shall be completed or the danger removed. At
twilight there shall be placed upon the place of excavation and upon any excavated materials or structures
or other obstructions to streets suitable and sufficient lights which shall be kept burning throughout the
night during the maintenance of the obstructions. It shall be unlawful for anyone to remove or tear down
the fence or railing or other protective barriers or any lights provided there for the protection of the public.
Subd. 11. Attractive Nuisance. It shall be unlawful for the permittee to suffer or permit to remain
unguarded at the place of excavation or opening any machinery, equipment or other device having the
characteristics of an attractive nuisance likely to attract children and be hazardous to their safety or health.

trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that as little inconvenience as possible shall be caused to
those using streets and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow
to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as might be the case in a narrow alley, the
Director shall have the authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site
and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of back-filling. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to

thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from such work. All cleanup
operations at the location of the excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the permittee and
shall be completed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. From time to time as may be ordered by the
director, and in any event immediately after completion of the work, the permittee shall at this or its own
expense clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from the work and upon
failure to do so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so by the director, the work may be done

obstruct the gutter of any street but shall use all proper measures to provide for the free passage of surface
water. The permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt, slickings or other
run-off pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing or other operations and shall be responsible for
any damage resulting from its failure to so provide.

shall be in accordance with the Citys Storm Water or Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance. In the
absence of a local Storm Water or Erosions and Sediment Control Ordinance, recommended Best
Management Practices shall be utilized as identified in the MINNESOTA STORMWATER MANUAL
as prepared by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Inlet protection should be provided at curb inlets
and yard drains where necessary. Under no circumstances shall material be allowed to enter the storm
drain or storm sewer systems of the City. Excess material/sediment shall be removed by sweeper or

and adequate facilities be employed by the permittee 24 hours a day to the end that the excavation work
may be completed as soon as possible.
Subd. 22. Emergency Action. In the event of any emergency in which a sewer, main, conduit or utility in

that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten (10)
days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the director that the
violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time,
the Director may revoke the permit pursuant to Sec. 9.1.13 or this Chapter.

business days after the occurrence of the emergency the owner shall apply for the necessary permits, pay
the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into
compliance with this section for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local
representative of each facility owner affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the
city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be
borne by the person whose facilities occasioned the emergency.
Subd. 2. Non-Emergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having
obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and
as a penalty pay double the normal fee for said permit and comply with all of the requirements of this

(e) The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition
indicated on an order issued pursuant to Section 9.1.10, Subd. 3(b).
Subd. 2. Written Notice of Breach. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a substantial
breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the
city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that
continued violations might be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial breach, as stated above,
will allow the city, at its discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and
remedy the breach.
Subd. 3. Response to Notice of Breach. Within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving notification of the
breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, which will cure the breach.
Permittee's failure to so contact the city, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or

completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the Director accurate maps and
drawings certifying the as-built location of all equipment installed, owed and maintained by the
permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and
equipment and shall be provided consistent with the Citys mapping standards. Failure to provide maps
and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for denying the permittees future permit
applications.
Subd. 2. Service Laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals, other than
minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rules 7560.0150 subpart 2, shall require the permittees use of
appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals, and the service
lateral vertical locations in those cases where the city reasonably requires it. Permittees or their
subcontractors shall install a locating wire or have an equally effective means of marking the location of
each nonconductive underground facility within the public right-of-way. This requirement does not apply
when making minor repairs to an existing nonconductive facility.
Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the city evidence of the installed service lateral locations.
Compliance with this subdivision 2 and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules
governing service laterals installed after December 31, 2005, shall be a condition of any city approval
necessary for 1) payments to contractors working on a public improvement project including those under
Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 429, and 2) City approval of performance under development agreements, or
other subdivision or site plan approval under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 462. The city shall reasonably
determine the appropriate method of providing such information. Failure to provide prompt and accurate
location information on service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the
work or may result in the denial of future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.

permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper
corridor for the facilities at issue.
Subd. 4. Limitation of Space. To protect health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to protect the
right-of-way and its current use, the director shall have the power to prohibit or the director shall strive to
the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided
primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the
condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing
facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects
which have been determined to be in the public interest.
9.1.16. Damage to Other Facilities. When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to
maintain, support, or move facilities to protect it, the director shall notify the local representative as early as is
reasonably possible and placed as required. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that facility owner and
must be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Each facility owner shall be responsible for the cost of
repairing any facilities in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damages. Each facility owner shall be responsible
for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another caused during the city's response to an emergency
occasioned by that owners facilities.

remove them from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with other right-of-way repair, excavation, or
construction, unless the director waives this requirement.

a permit revoked; (4) believes that the fees imposed are invalid; or (5) disputes a determination of the city regarding
this Chapter, may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision reviewed, upon written request, by the
City Council. The City Council shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A
decision by the City Council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be writing and supported by
written findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.

CHAPTER 9 - PUBLIC WORKS (STREETS)
Section 9.2 Project Labor Agreements 16
Section 9.2: Project Labor Agreements
9.2.01 Policy. The City desires to advance or preserve its own proprietary interest in a Project where it acts as an
owner, investor or developer. That interest is best served when construction of Covered Projects proceed in a timely,
cost-effective manner with the highest degree of quality and with minimal delays and disruptions. City contracts
should be performed with the highest degree of safety for workers and the public, and in a manner, that provides
meaningful training and employment opportunities for residents. Throughout the state and country, public and
private construction owners regularly utilize and require project labor agreements for billions of dollars worth of
construction each year. Project labor agreements that establish uniform terms and conditions of employment for the
contractors and other parties working on a project have been shown to provide an effective mechanism for
construction management because they allow project owners to:
(1) Predict their labor costs and requirements, and, therefore, more accurately estimate actual total project costs;
(2) Promote cost-efficient, timely and safe construction project delivery, by providing access to a reliable supply of
properly trained and skilled construction craft personnel for all aspects of the project;
(3) Assure greater productivity and workmanship quality from construction craft personnel, thereby yielding high
quality, cost-efficient projects, while also reducing maintenance and repair costs over the life of the project;
(4) Integrate work schedules and standardize work rules for the project to provide a well-coordinated, efficiently
functioning construction worksite that will minimize delays, promote quality, and maintain
project safety; and
(5) Assure that construction will proceed without interruption from staffing shortages, high employee turnover,
safety incidents, and labor disputes by providing reliable project staffing, contractual guarantees against work
stoppages and mutually binding procedures for resolving disputes.
9.2.02 Project Labor Agreement Required. A project labor agreement, will be substantially in the form adopted
by resolution of the Council from time to time and will be kept by the city administrator as a public document. It
shall be required to be used on any Covered Project, as Covered Project is defined below, which involves a project
with a total City investment of $175,000 or more. Any project labor agreement entered into by the City shall be
made binding on all contractors and subcontractors working on the Covered Project. The City shall implement the
project labor agreement by requiring adherence to the agreement in the bid specifications in all relevant bid
documents. No contractor shall be required to be or become a party to a collective bargaining agreement on any
other construction project in order to qualify to work under a project labor agreement implemented for a particular
city project.
Project Defined. Project shall mean the erection, destruction, demolition, painting, remodeling or repairing of
any building, highway, sidewalk, bridge, water or gas line, sewer and sewage treatment facility or other similar
work.
Covered Project Defined. Covered Project means that the City has a contract for construction services on a
Project owned by the City with a total Project cost of $175,000 or more, or the City has a proprietary interest
because one or more of the following conditions are met:
(1) The City makes a payment or grant of $175,000 or more to assist the development of a Project.
(2) The City guarantees loan payments, lease payments or contract for deed payments of $175,000 or more to
assist the development of a Project.
(3) The City receives ongoing revenue from a Project to repay loans provided by the City to assist the
development of said Project, including incremental tax revenues generated by the Project and used directly or
indirectly, to repay the loan by the City where the proceeds of the loan are used for development of that Project and
the amount of the loan is $175,000 or more.

(4) The City receives ongoing revenue from a Project to pay debt service on bonds provided by the City to assist in
the development of said Project, including incremental tax revenues generated by the Project and used, directly or
indirectly, to pay debt service on bonds by the City where the proceeds of the bonds issued are used for development
of the Project and the amount of the bonds are $175,000 or more.
(5) That the City otherwise has assets at risk equal to or in excess of $175,000 because it has agreed to underwrite
or guarantee the development of a project.

health, fire, building and zoning codes, and to provide a more effective system for compelling the correction of code
violations and the proper maintenance of rental housing within the city. This registration program is intended to
protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the entire community. Under these regulations
inspections will be done on a complaint basis with inspection guidelines being spelled out in Section 10.7.7, and with
enforcement to be made only against the owner of rental housing found to be in violation.

Section 11.1 General 1
Section 11.1: General
11.1.01. Water and Sewer Department. The City Engineer shall supervise the maintenance, care, management
and operation of the streets, lights, water and sewer. The City Engineer shall be responsible for the management,
maintenance, care and operation of the water works and sanitary sewer system of the City.
11.1.02. Use of Water and Sewer System Restricted. No person shall make or use any water or sewer service
installation connected to the City water or sewer system except pursuant to application and permit as shall be
provided in this Chapter. No person shall make or use any installation contrary to the regulatory provisions of this
Chapter.
11.1.03. Applications for Service.
Subd. 1. Procedure. Application for a water or sewer service installation and for water and or sewer
service shall be made to the City Engineer on forms prescribed and furnished by the City. By his or her
signature, the applicant shall agree to conform to this Chapter and to the rules and regulations that may be
established by the City as conditions for the use of these services.
Subd. 2. Fees or Deposit. Application for a service installation shall be made by the owner of the
property to be served or by his or her agent. The applicant shall, at the time of making application, for
water or sewer services, pursuant to this Section elect either to pay the established connection fees in full
immediately; or to pay the connection fees over a period of five (5) years, if so approved by resolution of
the City Council. Payment of the fees and rate of interest shall be according to the authorizing resolution.
In those cases, where a person elects to pay connection fees over a period of five years, he or she shall be
required to execute an agreement, acceptable in form to the City Attorney, which shall be recorded against
the property to which the water or sewer connection shall be made, and which shall be binding upon the
applicant and future owners of the property to pay the unpaid balance.
Subd. 3. Non-Resident Connections. No individual connections or hookups to the City water and/or
sewer system shall be allowed to non-residents adjacent to or outside the city limits of Cloquet without a
resolution by the City Council authorizing such connections. As part of this approval process, the City
Engineer must provide information stating that the proposed connections shall not adversely affect the
systems of the City and that there shall be sufficient capacity to provide the services to the non-residents
without diminishing the services to the residents of the City. Upon receipt of this statement from the City
Engineer, the City Council may, by resolution, permit non-residents to hook-up or connect to the City water
and sewer systems. If so approved, the connection fees for non-resident connections shall be two times the
cost for a resident of the City, unless there is a written agreement between the City of Cloquet and the
adjoining governmental authority which specifically addresses non-resident connections in a different
manner.
11.1.04. Permits and Charges for Service Connections.
Subd. 1. Permit. No connection shall be made to the City water or sanitary sewer system without a permit
from the City Engineer. The City Engineer may deny a permit for sewer or water connection if:
A. The Engineer finds the property can reasonably be served by an extension of the existing
public system to the property of the applicant and intervening lands. It is the stated intention
of the City to eliminate, where possible, construction of private lines serving private parcels
of land in lieu of public lines.
B. The Engineer finds that granting of a permit would encourage development of property which
cannot economically be served by other utilities or improved accesses. A decision on the part
of the City Engineer may be appealed by the applicant to the City Council upon written
notice.

Section 11.2: User Charge System
11.2.01. Accounting, Billing and Collecting. Each user of water and sewer services to property served by the City
water and/or sewer system shall pay monthly a water and sewer user charge as set forth in this Section.
Subd. 1. Accounts in Name of Owner and/or Occupant. All accounts shall be carried in the name of the
owner of the premises connected to the water and sewer services, and/or the occupant of the premises, if
the owner is not directly paying for the services. Where the term user appears in this Code in reference to
the payment for water or sewer charges, the term shall include the owner and the occupant of the premises.
Subd. 2. Required Information. The owner, occupant or person in charge of any premises shall furnish
the City with such information as may reasonably be required relating to use of water or sewer services
provided by the City systems. Willful failure to provide the information, willful falsification of the
information, or willful failure to comply with any requirement or order issued pursuant to this Section shall
constitute a violation of this Section.
Subd. 3. Bills for Service. Water and sewer service charges shall be billed together. Bills shall be mailed
to the owner, and/or occupant monthly and shall specify the water consumed in even thousand gallons and
the sewer and water charges in accordance with the rates as established by City Council resolution. The
procedure shall include a late payment penalty provision and shall provide for an interest charge on the
unpaid balance of the charges as provided in this Section.
Subd. 4. Meters Required. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, for the purpose of determining
the charges to be rendered against premises using the City's water and/or sewer systems, the volume of
water used from the water system, and the volume of wastewater discharged into the sewer system by the
owner, lessee, or occupant of any premises shall be based and computed upon the amount of water used on
the premises as measured by an approved meter.
Subd. 5. Metering of Private Water Sources. In all cases in which the water shall be derived in whole or
in part from sources independent from the city water system, the water supplied from private sources but
placed into City sewers shall be measured by a water meter of a type approved by the City Engineer to be
installed by the owner, lessee or occupant of the premises at his or her own cost and will be subject to the
supervision and inspection by the City. User charges against the premises shall be based upon the volume
of water used as measured from both public and private sources. Whenever the owner, lessee or occupant
fails to install the meter, or where it shall not be practicable to measure the water consumed on any
premises by a meter, the City Engineer shall determine the manner and the method used to estimate the
volume of water from private sources which discharges into the system. The estimate shall be used in lieu
of the meter volume of water from private sources to determine the wastewater charge thereon.
Subd. 6. Wastewater Meters. Where an accurate wastewater flow cannot be measured or determined
with the use of a water meter, the City may require the installation of an acceptable wastewater flow meter
as recommended by the City Engineer. The owner, occupant or user of the sewer service shall be required
to install approved wastewater meters or other measuring devices that serve to demonstrate the volume of
wastewater being discharged to the city sewer system. The volume of wastewater as so measured shall be
the basis upon which the wastewater charges shall be made under this Section. Said meters shall be
installed and maintained by the owner, lessee or occupant of the premises at his or her own expense and
shall be subject to the supervision and inspection by the City.
Subd. 7. Minimum Usage Billings. The minimum usage that shall be billed by the City for any billing

Subd. 10. Delinquent Accounts. All charges for water and sewer service shall be due on the monthly due
date specified by the City for the respective amount and shall be delinquent twenty (20) days thereafter.
The City shall endeavor to collect delinquent accounts promptly. When the delinquent customer shall be
the tenant in possession or the property owner, and satisfactory arrangements for payment have not been
made, after the procedural requirements of Section 11.2.01, Subd. 12 have been complied with, the City
may discontinue service to the delinquent customer by shutting off the water at the curb box. When water
service to any premises has been discontinued, service shall not be restored except upon the payment of all
delinquent bills and an off/on fee as established and adopted by resolution of the City Council from time to
time.
Delinquent accounts shall be certified to the City Administrator who shall prepare an assessment roll each
year providing for assessment of the delinquent amounts against the respective properties served. The
assessment roll shall be delivered to the Council for adoption on or before November 30th of each year for
certification to the County Auditor for collection along with taxes. Such action shall be optional and may
be subsequent to taking legal action to collect delinquent accounts.
If the delinquent customer shall be a tenant who has vacated the property or an owner who no longer has an
ownership interest because of mortgage foreclosure, cancellation of contract for deed or for any other
reason, collection of the delinquent account shall, at the option of the City Administrator, be either through
a collection agency or legal proceedings in accordance with the City's Collection Policy.
Subd. 11. Liability For Payment of Services. The owner of premises which are connected to the City's
water and sewer facilities, and the occupant thereof, shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for the
service to the premises and the service shall be furnished to the premises by the City only upon the
condition that the owner and occupant of the premises shall be jointly and severally liable to the City for
the charges. The owner of rental property agrees, as a condition of receiving service, to be personally liable
for water and sewer service furnished the tenants, lessees, or other occupants. A claim for unpaid charges
which have been billed to the occupant of the premises or the user of the service may be recovered against
the owner or occupant in a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction or in the discretion of the City
Administrator may be certified to the County Auditor to be collected with taxes against the premises so
served or reported to a collection agency. Money paid to the County Auditor on the account shall belong to
the City and shall be remitted to the City Administrator by the County Auditor in the manner provided by
law for the payment of other money belonging to the City. In addition to, and not in lieu of, the foregoing
method of enforcing payment of the charges, the City Engineer may, according to the rules and regulations
as he or she may have established and the Council shall have by resolution approved, cause the City water
supply for and to any premises to be shut off until all arrears, with interest and penalties on the delinquent
charges, shall be paid, together with the cost of shutting off and turning on the water.
Subd. 12. Procedure for Shutoff of Services. If the amount claimed to be owed shall be actually due and
unpaid and that there shall be no legal reason why the water supply of the delinquent customer may not be
shut off in accordance with this Chapter, the City may shut off the supply. Water shall not be shut off
under this Chapter or for a violation of rules and regulations affecting utility service until notice has first
been given to the occupant of the premises involved and the customer is given a right to protest the shut-off
notice in writing before the shut-off date. The shutoff notice shall state that if arrangements for payment
are not made before a day stated in the notice not less than ten (10) days after the date on which the notice
shall be given and the customer does not file a written protest, the water supply to the premises shall be
shut off. Every possible attempt shall be made to notify the occupant personally before his or her water
shall be actually shut off.
Subd. 13. Minnesota Cold Weather Rule. Water service will not be shut off between October 15
through April 15 if the shut-off would affect the primary heat source of the unit of residence affected and
the customer otherwise complies with the requirements of Minnesota Statute § 216B.097 (Cold Weather
Rule).

Authority to Construct, Operate, Maintain, and Extend a Natural Gas Distribution Plant and System,
and Granting the Right to Use the Streets, Alleys, and Other Public Places Within the
Present or Future Corporate Limits of the City of Cloquet, Minnesota
11.7.01 FRANCHISE GRANTED
The City of Cloquet, Minnesota, (hereinafter referred to as "Grantor") hereby grants a nonexclusive
franchise to
Minnesota Energy Resources, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, a Wisconsin corporation, (hereinafter called
"Grantee"), its lessees, successors and assigns. Grantee is hereby granted the right, privilege, franchise, permission
and authority to lay, construct, install, maintain, operate and extend in, along, over or across the present and future
streets, alleys, avenues, bridges, public rights-of-way and public places as are now within the present or future limits
of said Grantor, a natural gas distribution system and all facilities necessary for the purpose of supplying natural gas
or processed gas for all purposes to the inhabitants of said Grantor and consumers in the vicinity thereof, and for the
distribution of natural gas from or through said Grantor to points beyond the limits thereof. Such facilities shall
include, but not be limited to, all mains, services, pipes, conduits and appliances necessary or convenient for
transmitting, transporting, distributing and supplying natural gas for all purposes for which it may be used, and to do
all other things necessary and proper in providing natural gas service to the inhabitants of Grantor and in carrying on
such business. Grantee may do all reasonable things necessary or customary to accomplish these purposes, subject
however, to such reasonable regulations as may be imposed by Grantor pursuant to ordinance or permit
requirements and to the further provisions of this franchise agreement.
11.7.02 TERM
The rights and privileges granted by this Ordinance shall remain in effect for a period of Twentyfive
(25) years
from the effective date of this Ordinance.
If Grantor and Grantee are unable to agree on the terms of a new franchise by the time this franchise expires, this
franchise will remain in effect until a new franchise is agreed upon, or until 90 days after Grantor or Grantee serves
written Notice to the other party of its intention to allow the franchise to expire. However, in no event shall this
franchise continue for more than one year after expiration of the 25 year term.
11.7.03 FRANCHISE FEE
During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in addition to permit fees being imposed or that Grantor has a
right to impose, Grantor may charge Grantee a franchise fee. The fee may be (i) a percentage of gross revenues
received by Grantee for its operations within Grantor, or (ii) a flat fee per customer based on metered service to
retail customers within Grantor or on some other similar basis, or (iii) a fee based on units of energy delivered to any
class of retail customers within the corporate limits of Grantor. The method of imposing the franchise fee, the
percentage of revenue rate, or the flat rate based on metered service may differ for each customer class or combine
the methods described in (i) -(iii) above in assessing the fee. Grantor shall seek to use a formula that provides a
stable and predictable amount of fees, without placing Grantee at a competitive disadvantage. If Grantee claims that
Grantor's required fee formula is discriminatory or otherwise places Grantee at a competitive disadvantage, Grantee
shall provide a formula that will produce a substantially similar fee amount to Grantor and reimburse Grantor's
reasonable fees and costs in reviewing and implementing the formula. Grantor will attempt to accommodate Grantee
but is under no franchise obligation to adopt Grantee-proposed franchise fee formula and each review will not delay
the implementation of Grantor-imposed fee.
The franchise fee shall be imposed by separate ordinance duly adopted by the City Council. The Grantor shall
provide Grantee written notice via certified mail, enclosing such adopted ordinance, within ten (10) days after
adoption. The Company will notify the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission of any new, renewed, expired, or
changed fee, authorized by Minn. Stat. § 216B.36 to raise revenue, at least 60 days prior to its implementation.

The franchise fee shall be payable not less than quarterly during complete billing months of the period for which
payment is to be made. The franchise fee formula may be changed from time to time, however, the change shall
meet the same notice requirements and the fee may not be changed more often than annually. Such fee shall not
exceed any amount that Grantee may legally charge to its customers prior to payment to Grantor. Such fee is subject
to subsequent reductions to account for uncollectibles and customer refunds incurred by Grantee. Grantee agrees to
make available for inspection by Grantor at reasonable times all records necessary to audit Grantee's determination
of the franchise fee payments.
If this franchise expires and Grantor and Grantee are unable to agree upon terms of a new franchise, the franchise
fee, if any being imposed by Grantor at the time this franchise expires, will remain in effect until a new franchise is
agreed upon notwithstanding the franchise expiration.
11.7.04 GOVERNING RULES AND REGULATIONS
This Ordinance is granted subject to all conditions, limitations and immunities now provided for, or as hereafter
amended, and applicable to the operations of a public utility, by State or Federal law. The rates to be charged by
Grantee for service within the present or future corporate limits of Grantor and the rules and regulations regarding
the character, quality and standards of service to be furnished by Grantee shall be under the jurisdiction and control
of such regulatory body or bodies as may, from time to time, be vested by law with authority and jurisdiction over
the rates, regulations and quality and standards of service to be supplied by Grantee. Provided however, should any
judicial, regulatory or legislative body, having proper jurisdiction, take any action that precludes Grantee from
recovering from its customers any cost associated with services provided hereunder, then Grantee and Grantor shall
renegotiate the terms of this Ordinance in accordance with the action taken, so as to allow Grantee to be made whole
economically. In determining the rights and duties of the Grantee, the terms of this franchise Ordinance shall take
precedence over any conflicting terms or requirements contained in any other Ordinance enacted by the Grantor.
If an energy supplier is unable to furnish an adequate supply of energy due to an emergency, an order or decision of
a public regulatory body, or other acts beyond the control of the Grantee, then the Grantee shall have the right and
authority to adopt reasonable rules and regulations limiting, curtailing or allocating extensions of service or supply
of energy to any customers or prospective customers, and withholding the supply of energy to new customers,
provided that such rules and regulations shall be uniform as applied to each class of customers or prospective
customers, and shall be non-discriminatory as between communities receiving service from the Grantee.
11.7.05 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF COMPANY FACILITIES
Any pavements, sidewalks or curbing taken up and any and all excavations made shall be done in such a manner as
to cause only such inconvenience to the inhabitants of Grantor and to the general public as is reasonably necessary;
and repairs and replacements shall be made promptly by Grantee, leaving such properties in as good as condition as
existed immediately prior to excavation.
After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any public right-of-way, Grantee shall restore the public rightof-
way in accordance with Minnesota Rules, part 7819.1100 and applicable City ordinances consistent with law.
Grantee shall restore the public land to as good a condition as formerly existed, and shall maintain the surface in
good condition for six months thereafter. All work shall be completed as promptly as weather permits, and if
Grantee shall not promptly perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and
put the public land in the said condition, Grantor shall have, after demand to Grantee to cure and the passage of a
reasonable period of time following the demand, but not to exceed five days, the right to make the restoration of the
public land at the expense of Grantee. Grantee shall pay to Grantor the cost of such work done for or performed by
Grantor.
Grantee agrees that for the term of this grant, it will use its best efforts to maintain facilities and equipment sufficient
to meet the current and future energy requirements of Grantor, its inhabitants and industries. While maintaining its
facilities and equipment, Grantee shall obtain permits as required by ordinance, except that in emergency situations,
Grantee shall take immediate unilateral actions as it determines are necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare; in which case, Grantee shall notify Grantor as soon as reasonably possible.

Grantee shall not open or disturb the surface of any public right-of-way or public land for any purpose without first
having obtained a permit from Grantor, if required by a separate ordinance, for which Grantor may impose a
reasonable fee. Permit conditions imposed on Grantee shall not be more burdensome than those imposed on other
utilities for similar facilities or work. Grantee may, however, open and disturb the surface of any public right-of-way
or public land without a permit if (i) an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of Gas Facilities and (ii)
Grantee gives telephone, email or similar notice to Grantor before commencement of the emergency repair, if
reasonably possible. Within two business days after commencing the repair, Grantee shall apply for any required
permits and pay any required fees.
Grantor will give Grantee reasonable notice of plans for street improvements where paving or resurfacing of a
permanent nature is involved that affect Grantee's facilities. The notice shall contain the nature and character of the
improvements, the rights-of-way upon which the improvements are to be made, the extent of the improvements and
the time when the Grantor will start the work, and, if more than one right-of-way is involved, the order in which this
work is to proceed. The notice shall be given to the Grantee a sufficient length of time, considering seasonable
working conditions, in advance of the actual commencement of the work to permit the Grantee to make any
additions, alterations, or repairs to its facilities.
Grantee must promptly provide complete and accurate mapping information for any of its Gas Facilities in
accordance with the requirements of Minnesota Rules, parts 7819.4000 and 7819.4100.
11.7.06 EXTENSION OF COMPANY FACILITIES
Upon receipt and acceptance of a valid application for service, Grantee shall, subject to its own economic feasibility
criteria, make reasonable extensions of its distribution facilities to serve customers located within the current or
future corporate limits of Grantor.
11.7.07 RELOCATION OF COMPANY FACILITIES
Grantee shall comply with Minnesota Rules, part 7819.3100 and applicable City ordinances consistent with law. If
Grantor elects to change the grade of or otherwise alter any street, alley, avenue, bridge, public right-of-way or
public place for a public purpose, Grantee, upon reasonable notice from Grantor, shall remove and relocate its
facilities or equipment situated in the public rights-of-way, if such removal is necessary to prevent interference and
not merely for the convenience of the Grantor, at the cost and expense of Grantee. If Grantor orders or requests
Grantee to relocate its facilities or equipment for the primary benefit of a commercial or private project, or as a
result of the initial request of a commercial or private developer or other nonpublic
entity, and such removal is
necessary to prevent interference and not merely for the convenience of the Grantor or other right-of-way user,
Grantee shall receive payment for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocating its facilities or
equipment. Grantor shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public works projects so as not arbitrarily
to cause Grantee unreasonable additional expense in exercising its authority under this section.
Grantor shall also provide a reasonable alternative location for Grantee's facilities. Grantor shall give Grantee
written notice of vacating of a public right-of-way. Vacating of a public right-ofway
shall not deprive the Grantee
of its right to operate and maintain existing facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same are first paid to
the Grantee.
Any person or corporation desiring to move a building or other structure along, or to make any unusual use of any
street, alley, avenue, bridge, public right-of-way or public place which shall interfere with the facilities or equipment
of the Grantee, shall first give notice to the Grantor and the Grantee and a pay a sum sufficient to cover the expense
and damage incident to the moving of Grantee's facilities and equipment.
11.7.08 VACATION OF PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAYS
Grantor shall give Grantee at least two weeks prior written notice of a hearing of a proposed vacation of a public
right-of-way. Grantor and Grantee shall comply with Minnesota Rules, part 7819.3200 and applicable ordinances
consistent with law.

Grantor acknowledges that certain information it might request pursuant to this franchise may be of a proprietary

confidential due to such proprietary or commercial value, Grantor and its employees, agents, and representatives
shall maintain the confidentiality of that information, to the extent allowed by law. If Grantor is requested or
required by legal or administrative process to disclose any such confidential information, Grantor shall promptly

compliance with any court order, law, statute, ordinance, executive order, or regulation promulgated by a

otherwise not reasonably within the control of the affected party to prevent or overcome. Each party shall make
reasonable efforts to avoid Force Majeure and to resolve such event as promptly as reasonably possible once it
occurs in order to resume performance; provided, however, that this provision shall not obligate a party to settle any
labor strike.
11.7.11 INSURANCE
Grantee is required to maintain Commercial General Liability Insurance on an occurrence basis protecting it from
claims for damages for bodily injury, including death, and for claims for property damage, which may arise from

defend and indemnify Grantor, Grantor shall be entitled to tender the defense of such lawsuit directly to Grantee as

operation of the Gas Facilities located in the public right-of-ways and public lands. Grantor shall not be indemnified

In the event a suit is brought against Grantor under circumstances where this agreement to indemnify applies,
Grantee at its sole cost and expense shall defend Grantor in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to
Grantee within a period wherein Grantee is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. If Grantee is required to indemnify
and defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation. Grantee agrees to notify the Grantor of any settlement
discussions and to discuss with the Grantor the Grantee's settlement strategy and keep the Grantor informed
throughout the settlement process, but the Company has the authority to enter into any final settlement. This section
is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to Grantor. Grantee, in defending
any action on behalf of Grantor, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that Grantor
could assert on its own behalf. This franchise agreement shall not be interpreted to constitute a waiver by Grantor of
any of its defenses of immunity or limitations on liability under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 466.

At the Grantee's request, Grantor shall meet with Grantee at a mutually convenient time to discuss items of concern

not used or if the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days after first meeting with the selected
mediator, either party may commence an action in District Court to interpret and enforce this franchise or for such
other relief as may be permitted by law or equity.

public use of Public Ground, upon reasonable Notice by the City to the Company, then the Company will move
its Electric Facilities at its sole cost. The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public
works projects so as not to arbitrarily cause the Company unreasonable additional expense in exercising its
authority under this Section 5.1. This Section 5.1 shall not constitute a taking by the City nor be construed as a
waiver or modification of any easement or prescriptive rights acquired by the Company independent of and
without reliance by the Company on this Franchise.

out of their failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring the Companys Electric Facilities while
performing any work connected with grading, regarding or changing the line of any Public Way or with any
construction on or adjacent to any Public Way; provided, however, this Section 5.2 shall not limit the Citys

connection with the operations of the Company under and pursuant to this Franchise, the Company shall fully
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its agents, servants or employees from any and all such claims,
including, but not limited to, reimbursement of any reasonable attorneys fees and costs and expenses the City
may incur in handling, denying, or defending such claims. The Companys obligation to indemnify the City
shall not extend to any injury to persons or property caused by the negligent act or failure to act by the City or
any actions taken by the Company pursuant to directions of the City if performed within the scope of the Citys
directions without negligence by the Company. The City shall determine who will defend any such claims
arising under this Section 6.1 and the Company will thereafter have complete control of such litigation;
provided, however, the Company may not settle any such claims without the prior approval of the City, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld. This Section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or
immunity otherwise available to the City; and the Company, in defending any action shall be entitled to assert
every defense or immunity that the City could itself assert in its own behalf. The Companys obligations under
this Section shall survive the expiration, amendment, or termination of this Ordinance.
6.2. Insurance. Before the Effective Date, the Company shall furnish the City a summary of insurance, if
any, carried by the Company, or of its self-insured status, in either case demonstrating adequate protection to

such insurance coverage at all times during this Franchise.

or surrounding its Electric Facilities or caused to be located on, in or surrounding the Public Ways and Public
Grounds or elsewhere in the City in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and lawful government
orders, and pay or cause to be paid all costs associated therewith. The indemnification terms and conditions of
Section 6.1 shall apply to all claims made against the City by any Person, including any governmental agency,
who or which asserts any right to costs, damages or other relief based upon the terms and conditions imposed
upon the Company under this Section 6.3 or which arise from or are related to the Companys acts or failure to
act in compliance with any law, rule, regulation or lawful order governing Hazardous Substances.
SECTION 7. VACATION OF PUBLIC WAYS. The City will consult with the Company at least four (4) weeks
prior to its action on any proposed vacation of a Public Way. Except where ordered pursuant to Section 5.1, the vacation
of any Public Way after the installation of Electric Facilities shall not operate to deprive the Company of its rights to
operate and maintain such Electric Facilities until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and expense
resulting from such relocation are first paid to the Company. However, in no case shall the City be liable to the
Company for failure to specifically preserve a Public Way in the exercise of its authority under Minnesota Statutes,
Section 160.29.
SECTION 8. ABANDONED FACILITIES. The Company shall comply with City ordinances and Minnesota

Statutes, chapter 216B. In the event the Company shall determine after the Effective Date to change its rates or terms
and conditions of electric service, the Company shall provide reasonable advance Notice of such proposed action to the
City.

retroactively reduce its rates or costs to its retail electric customers so that a refund is due from the Company of
an amount previously paid or incurred by the retail electric customers.

payment made is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of the payment be construed as a release
of any claim that the City may have for further sums payable under the provisions of this Ordinance. All
amounts paid shall be subject to audit and re-computation by the City. The Company agrees to make all
records necessary to audit the Companys calculation of any payment available for inspection by the City or its

proposed change shall be given to the Company not later than the effective date of the ordinance adopting the
change.

The Company's construction, reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance, location and relocation of
Electric Facilities shall be subject to permits if required by separate ordinance and to other reasonable

regulations of the City consistent with authority granted the City to manage its Public Ways and Public
Grounds under state law, to the extent not inconsistent with a specific term of this Ordinance.
4.2. Construction; Maintenance; Repairs. Whenever the Company desires to open or disturb any
Public Way or Public Ground for the purpose of constructing, maintaining, or repairing Electric Facilities,
it shall give the City reasonable advance Notice, but not less than ten (10) business days, by filing a written

any required permits and pay any required fees.
4.4. Restoration. Following the completion of any work, the Company shall promptly and diligently
restore the affected Public Ways and/or Public Ground to as good a condition as before the work
commenced. If the Company fails to promptly restore such Public Ways and/or Public Ground within ten
(10) days of Notice by the City, the City may engage an independent contractor at the expense of the
Company to perform the restoration of the Public Ways and/or Public Ground as required under this
Section. The Company shall pay to the City upon demand the cost to the City of affecting such restoration
including the Citys administrative expenses and overhead.
4.5. Avoidance of Damage. The Company must take reasonable measures to prevent the Electric
Facilities from causing damage to persons or property. The Company must take reasonable measures to
protect the Electric Facilities from damage that could be inflicted on the Electric Facilities by persons,

the Electric Facilities, if given reasonable Notice by the City of such work prior to its commencement.
4.6. Field Locations. The Company shall provide field locations for all its underground Electric
Facilities when requested by the City within a reasonable period of time. The period of time will be
deemed reasonable if it meets the requirements of the one call excavation notice system as now provided in

CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 11 - UTILITIES

Company Service Area to the extent the Company finds it necessary to avoid interference with the proper
construction, operation, repair and maintenance of any of the Companys Electric Facilities installed or
maintained hereunder provided that Company shall hold the City harmless from any liability arising
therefrom, and subject to permit or other reasonable regulation by the City.
4.9. Notice of City Improvements. The City will give the Company reasonable advance Notice of
plans for improvements to Public Ways and Public Ground in the Company Service Area where the City
has reason to believe that the Companys Electric Facilities may affect or be affected by such
improvements. The Notice will contain: (i) the nature and character of the improvements, (ii) the Public
Ways and/or Public Ground upon which the improvements are to be made, (iii) the extent of the
improvements, (iv) the time when the City will start the work, and (v) if more than one Public Way or

Electric Facilities or the Company Service Area, or portion(s) thereof, at any time by way of eminent
domain under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 117 or under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 216B, in either case,
as such statutes or amendments to such are in effect on the date the City commences such purchase or
acquisition. In that event, the pleading commencing the acquisition proceeding by the City shall be noticed
to the Company for it to make any adjustments to its long-range planning for facilities and service for the
area affected by the proceeding. Any damages to the Company as a result of such proceeding shall be
determined as of the commencement of such proceeding. The Company shall continue to operate the
Electric Facilities at the City's sufferance only until such acquisition is completed. The expiration or
termination of this Franchise as hereinbefore provided shall not, by itself, be an independent basis of any
claim by the Company against the City.
SECTION 5. ELECTRIC FACILITIES RELOCATION.
5.1. Relocation. In the event the City reasonably determines that it is necessary for the Company to
move any part of its Electric Facilities because the City has determined to change, move or improve its
Public Ways or that the Electric Facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment to the
existing or imminent public use of Public Ground, upon reasonable Notice by the City to the Company,
then the Company will move its Electric Facilities at its sole cost. The City shall consider reasonable
alternatives in designing its public works projects so as not to arbitrarily cause the Company unreasonable
additional expense in exercising its authority under this Section 5.1. This Section 5.1 shall not constitute a
taking by the City nor be construed as a waiver or modification of any easement or prescriptive rights
acquired by the Company independent of and without reliance by the Company on this Franchise.
5.2. No Release of Liability. Nothing contained herein shall relieve any third party from liability
arising out of their failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring the Companys Electric Facilities
while performing any work connected with grading, regarding or changing the line of any Public Way or
with any construction on or adjacent to any Public Way; provided, however, this Section 5.2 shall not limit
the Citys rights to indemnification under Section 6.1 nor shall the City in any way be liable to the
Company for claims arising from the negligence of any third party.
SECTION 6. INDEMNIFICATION.
6.1. Indemnification. If at any time any claim of any kind is made against the City for injury to
persons or property arising from the acts or failure to act by the Company, its agents, servants, or
employees in connection with the operations of the Company under and pursuant to this Franchise, the
Company shall fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its agents, servants or employees from
any and all such claims, including, but not limited to, reimbursement of any reasonable attorneys fees and
costs and expenses the City may incur in handling, denying, or defending such claims. The Companys
obligation to indemnify the City shall not extend to any injury to persons or property caused by the
negligent act or failure to act by the City or any actions taken by the Company pursuant to directions of the
City if performed within the scope of the Citys directions without negligence by the Company. The City
shall determine who will defend any such claims arising under this Section 6.1 and the Company will
thereafter have complete control of such litigation; provided, however, the Company may not settle any
CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 11 - UTILITIES
Section 11.11 (Ordinance 461A Lake Country Power Franchise Agreement) 56
such claims without the prior approval of the City, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. This
Section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City; and
the Company, in defending any action shall be entitled to assert every defense or immunity that the City
could itself assert in its own behalf. The Companys obligations under this Section shall survive the
expiration, amendment, or termination of this Ordinance.
6.2. Insurance. Before the Effective Date, the Company shall furnish the City a summary of
insurance, if any, carried by the Company, or of its self-insured status, in either case demonstrating
adequate protection to the City from any and all obligations, liabilities, or claims of any nature whatsoever,
growing out of the operation, construction, and maintenance of its Electric Facilities within the City. The
Company shall maintain such insurance coverage at all times during this Franchise.
6.3. Compliance with Laws; Hazardous Substances. In its operation under this Ordinance, the
Company shall observe all federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and orders with respect to the
transmission, distribution, transformation or furnishing of electric energy and the handling of materials,
substances and wastes deemed toxic or hazardous to health, natural resources or the environment
(collectively, Hazardous Substances). The Company shall remove or remediate any Hazardous
Substances located on, in or surrounding its Electric Facilities or caused to be located on, in or surrounding
the Public Ways and Public Grounds or elsewhere in the City in compliance with all applicable laws,
regulations and lawful government orders, and pay or cause to be paid all costs associated therewith. The
indemnification terms and conditions of Section 6.1 shall apply to all claims made against the City by any
Person, including any governmental agency, who or which asserts any right to costs, damages or other
relief based upon the terms and conditions imposed upon the Company under this Section 6.3 or which
arise from or are related to the Companys acts or failure to act in compliance with any law, rule, regulation
or lawful order governing Hazardous Substances.
SECTION 7. VACATION OF PUBLIC WAYS. The City will consult with the Company at least four (4) weeks
prior to its action on any proposed vacation of a Public Way. Except where ordered pursuant to Section 5.1, the
vacation of any Public Way after the installation of Electric Facilities shall not operate to deprive the Company of its
rights to operate and maintain such Electric Facilities until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss
and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to the Company. However, in no case shall the City be
liable to the Company for failure to specifically preserve a Public Way in the exercise of its authority under
Minnesota Statutes, Section 160.29.
SECTION 8. ABANDONED FACILITIES. The Company shall comply with City ordinances and Minnesota
Statutes, Section 216D.01 et seq., as they may be amended from time to time. The Company shall maintain records
describing the exact location of all abandoned and retired Facilities within the City, produce such records at the
Citys request and comply with the location requirements of Section 216D.04 with respect to all Electric Facilities,
including abandoned and retired Electric Facilities.
SECTION 9. RATES AND SERVICE. The electric service provided and the rates charged by the Company for
electric service, as of the Effective Date, may be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission as provided in
Minnesota Statutes, chapter 216B. In the event the Company shall determine after the Effective Date to change its
rates or terms and conditions of electric service, the Company shall provide reasonable advance Notice of such
proposed action to the City.
SECTION 10. FRANCHISE FEE.
10.1. Authority. The City reserves all rights under Minnesota Statutes, Sections 216B.36 and 301B.01
or other law to require a franchise fee at any time during the term of, and in consideration for, this
Franchise. The franchise fee may be expressed (i) as a specified charge per measurable unit of electricity
being provided, transported, transmitted, sold, furnished, delivered, or received within the City, or (ii) as a
percentage of the Gross Revenues received by the Company for its operations within the City, or (iii) a flat
fee per customer based on service to retail customers within the City or on some other similar basis, or (iv)
in such other manner or fashion as the City may determine. The method of imposing the franchise fee may
differ by customer class, by type of Utility, by particular circumstances of a Utility Service Provider, or by
other relevant factor, and may combine the methods described in (i) through (iv) above.

10.2. Payment of Fee. The franchise fee shall be payable not less often than quarterly and shall be
based on the complete billing month for which payment is due. The payment shall be due forty-five (45)
days after the end of the month for which the payment is due. Each payment shall be accompanied by a
brief report showing the basis for the computation of the payment and such other relevant facts to support
the computation as may be requested by the City from time to time. The Company may, in its sole
discretion, impose a surcharge equivalent to the franchise fee in its rates for electric service. The Company
shall pay the City the franchise fee based upon the prevailing rate and as billed to the customer, but subject
to subsequent adjustment in either of the following events: (i) if any amount so billed subsequently
becomes uncollectible after reasonable efforts of collection by the Company or (ii) if the Company shall,
after any said billings, retroactively reduce its rates or costs to its retail electric customers so that a refund is
due from the Company of an amount previously paid or incurred by the retail electric customers.
10.3. No Waiver or Release. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the
payment made is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of the payment be construed as a
release of any claim that the City may have for further sums payable under the provisions of this
Ordinance. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and re-computation by the City. The Company
agrees to make all records necessary to audit the Companys calculation of any payment available for
inspection by the City or its designated representative at reasonable times.
10.4. Separate Ordinance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, including the provisions of 10.1
herein, the franchise fee may be changed by the City from time to time by separate ordinance; provided,
however, such changes shall not occur more often than once in any calendar year and shall be effective
upon the earlier of (1) approval by the Commission authorizing the Company to incorporate such fee within
its rate schedule, or (2) sixty (60) days after the Company has provided timely notice to the Commission of
the ordinance adopting the change. Notice of any proposed change must be given to all electrical service
providers and shall be applied equally and shall be given to the Company(s) not later than the effective date
of the ordinance adopting the change.
SECTION 11. DEFAULTS. If the Company shall be in default in the performance of any of the material terms
and conditions of this Ordinance, and shall continue in default for more than thirty (30) days (or fails to initiate the
cure of the default within said period and diligently pursue said cure, if the cure of the default cannot reasonably be
accomplished within said 30 days) after receiving Notice from the City of such default, the City may elect to cure
such default and charge the Company for the costs thereof.
SECTION 12. AMENDMENT PROCEDURE. The City reserves the right to amend this Franchise by ordinance.
The Companys rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the City to adopt and enforce ordinances

necessary or appropriate in the exercise of such power.

FINANCING AND ASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS
Effective Date: March 7, 2006
Amendments: 06-05-07 340A /
12.2.01. General Policy. It shall be the policy of the City to finance certain street and utility improvements by the
methods prescribed in this Section. The apportionment of the cost between benefited property and the City at large
and the method of levying assessments prescribed in those sections shall be followed in each case unless the
Council, by resolution, finds that because of special circumstances, as provided for by Statute, a different policy
shall be necessary or desirable. Any local improvement described in Minn. Stat., Chapter 429 and not specifically
addressed by this Section shall be financed as the Council determines to be most feasible and equitable in each case.
12.2.02. Applicable State Statutes. All procedures for the construction and financing of local improvements,
when at least part of the cost shall be defrayed by special assessments against benefited property, shall conform with
the applicable regulations of this Section and Minn. Stat., Chapter 429 and the definitions as set forth in the statutes.
12.2.03. Method of Initiation.
Subd. 1. Petition. No petition for construction of sidewalks, curb and gutter, sanitary sewer and water or
permanent street surfacing filed in compliance with State law shall be required to be accepted or acted upon
by the Council unless it shall be filed with the City Administrator on or before August 1 of the year prior to
the year of requested construction.
Subd. 2. Initiation Of Improvements Without Petitions. The City may initiate improvements covered
by this Section without first receiving a petition from affected property owners; however, in order to do so,
a 6/7ths vote of the City Council shall be required.
12.2.04. Establishment Of Assessment Districts For Street Improvements. For the purpose of determining
special assessments associated with various street improvements covered by this Section, the City shall be divided
into two separate assessment districts as specified in the following Subdivisions.
Subd. 1. Assessment District #1. Assessment District #1 for the purpose of this Section shall be the
corporate limits of the City of Cloquet prior to the Knife Falls Township consolidation of 1975. It shall
also include those properties of the consolidated Knife Falls area to which City sanitary sewer and water
utilities have been extended to within four hundred feet.
Subd. 2. Assessment District #2. Assessment District #2 shall be that part of the Knife Falls Township
which was consolidated with the City of Cloquet in 1975 and to which City sanitary sewer and water
utilities have not been extended to within four hundred feet. (As a condition of the 1975 consolidation
agreement, this area currently pays ¼ of the City's property tax rate until such time that these utilities are
extended to within four hundred feet). Once City sanitary sewer and water utilities are extended to
properties within Assessment District #2, they shall then be reclassified into Assessment District #1 and
any future special assessment made in conjunction with improvements covered by this Section shall follow
the applicable regulations for Assessment District #1.
12.2.05. Classification of Street Improvement Projects. Street improvement projects shall be divided into two
classifications as specified in the following subdivisions and to property specially served by the improvement. The
project classification shall depend on the designation of the particular street as either part of Cloquet's Municipal
State Aid (MSA) street system or part of Cloquet's local street system.
Subd. 1. Construction or Reconstruction of MSA Routes. MSA routes shall refer to those City streets,
under the ownership and jurisdiction of Cloquet, which have been specifically designated, by resolution of
the City Council, in accordance with the "Rules and Regulations for State Aid Operations" under Minn.
Stat., Chapters 161 and 162.
Subd. 2. Construction or Reconstruction of Non-MSA Routes. Non-MSA routes shall refer to those
City streets, under the ownership and jurisdiction of Cloquet, which have not been specifically designated
MSA routes in accordance with Subdivision #1 above.

12.2.06. Improvement or Reconstruction of MSA Routes.
Subd. 1. In General. The regulations and requirements of this Section shall apply to the improvement or
reconstruction of all MSA routes as designated by the City Council and established for public travel.
Subd. 2. Curb and Gutter. When curb and gutter shall be installed in either new construction or
reconstruction, 50% of its cost shall be assessed to the adjacent property on the basis of frontage.
Subd. 3. Sidewalks. The cost of sidewalk construction or reconstruction shall be paid for by the City at
the time the entire street is constructed to State Aid standards with the use of State Aid funds. The cost of
any sidewalk improvements, whether construction or reconstruction, not associated with a State Aid street
project, shall be assessed 100% against the adjacent property on the basis of frontage.
Subd. 4. Pavement. When a street shall be paved or repaved, the abutting property shall be assessed on
the basis of frontage, for the cost of a ten foot wide strip of bituminous surface constructed to a three inch
thickness. The cost of the pavement in excess of the assessed twenty foot width shall be paid for by the
City. If the street shall be paved with concrete or to standards higher than those the City would use for a
typical residential street, all costs in excess of the three inch bituminous design shall be paid for by the
City.
Subd. 5. Grading and Base Construction. All grading and gravel base construction or reconstruction
costs shall be paid for by the City.
Subd. 6. Storm Sewers. All storm sewer construction or reconstruction costs shall be paid for by the City.

applicable project development, design and administrative fees associated with any assessed improvements.
Subd. 8. Miscellaneous Construction Costs. All miscellaneous street construction costs not specifically
addressed by this Section shall be paid for by the City
Subd. 9. Corner Lots. In any assessment made on the basis of frontage for curbs, sidewalks and
pavement installations, where these improvements are installed on both sides of a platted corner lot, these
corner lots shall be assessed for the frontage of their short side plus 1/3rd the frontage of their long side.
This adjustment shall not apply to lots, who because of their size could be subdivided into two or more
buildable lots.
Subd. 10. Double Frontage Lots. In the case of double frontage lots where assessable street
improvements are made along both the front and backyards of a single lot, double-frontage lots shall be
assessed for one side only. This adjustment shall not apply to lots whos backyards front on an alley, or to
lots who because of their size and lot depth could be subdivided into two separate buildable lots.
Subd. 11. Adjusted Frontage - Irregular Shaped Lots. When the amount of an assessment shall be
determined by frontage, in the case of pie-shaped or irregular shaped lots, an equivalent assessable front
footage shall be determined by dividing the square footage of the lot by the general lot depth of the
subdivision.
Subd. 12. Special Cases. In special cases, the City Council may, by resolution, exempt certain properties
from special assessments if the property shall be considered unsuitable for residential, commercial or
industrial development or would otherwise not be benefited or improved by the installation of sanitary
sewer or water utilities. As an alternative to assessing the cost of certain utility extensions on the basis of
frontage, the City Council may elect to assess these improvements on a per connection or on a per lot basis.
Furthermore, as an alternative to assessing the cost of certain utility extensions at the time of construction,
the City Council may elect to establish utility connection fees to be charged to certain properties at their
time of connection.

Subd. 13. Federal, State And County Aid Use. If the City shall receive financial assistance from the
federal government, the State or the County to defray a portion of the cost of a particular street
improvement, the aid shall be used first to reduce the share of the project cost which would be met from
general City funds according to the assessment formulas contained in this Section. If such aid shall be
more than the amount of the improvement cost to be borne by the City, the remainder of the aid so received
shall be credited to the City's Permanent Improvement Fund.
Subd. 14. Minimum Project Assessable Cost. If a portion of a particular improvement shall be financed
through special assessments as shall be provided for by this Section, under no circumstances shall the total
project assessable cost be less than twenty percent (20%) of the total improvement cost. If in the use of the
formulas as established by this Section, the total assessable cost for a particular improvement shall be less
than twenty percent, the front foot assessment for each benefited parcel shall be adjusted so that a minimum
of twenty percent of the total project cost shall be assessed.

Subd. 10. Bituminous Overlays In Assessment District #2. In Assessment District #2, the cost of all
bituminous overlays on existing paved streets shall be assessed, on the basis of frontage, for a twelve foot
wide strip of bituminous surface constructed to a one and one-half inch thickness. The cost of the
pavement overlay in excess of the assessed twenty-four foot width shall be paid for by the City. For the
purpose of determining the assessable cost of the twelve foot wide strip, the cost of any tack coat material,
if applicable, shall be included. For the purpose of the assessment of bituminous overlays within
Assessment District #2, the City shall establish a maximum assessed frontage of 200 feet for large
unplatted property owned by a single owner. However, if the property has been subdivided or platted into
smaller individual lots conforming to applicable zoning requirements and all of the lots exist under single
ownership, the 200 foot maximum assessment shall not apply and the full frontage shall be assessed.
Subd. 11. Project Development, Design and Administrative Fees. The City may assess the cost of
applicable project development, design and administrative fees associated with any assessed improvements.
Subd. 12. Miscellaneous Construction Costs. All miscellaneous street construction costs not specifically
addressed by this Section shall be paid for by the City.
Subd. 13. Corner Lots. In any assessment made on the basis of frontage for curbs, sidewalks and
pavement installations, where these improvements are installed on both sides of a platted corner lot, these
corner lots shall be assessed for the frontage of their short side plus 1/3rd the frontage of their long side.
This adjustment shall not apply to lots, who because of their size could be subdivided into two or more
buildable lots.
Subd. 14. Double Frontage Lots. In the case of double frontage lots where assessable street
improvements are made along both the front and backyards of a single lot, double-frontage lots shall be
assessed for one side only. This adjustment shall not apply to lots whose backyards front on an alley, or to
lots who because of their size and lot depth could be subdivided into two separate buildable lots.
Subd. 15. Adjusted Frontage - Irregular Shaped Lots. When the amount of an assessment shall be
determined by frontage, in the case of pie-shaped or irregular shaped lots, an equivalent assessable front
footage shall be determined by dividing the square footage of the lot by the general lot depth of the
subdivision.
Subd. 16. Special Cases. In special cases, the City Council may, by resolution, exempt certain properties
from special assessments if the property shall be considered unsuitable for residential, commercial or
industrial development or would otherwise not be benefited or improved by the installation of sanitary
sewer or water utilities. As an alternative to assessing the cost of certain utility extensions on the basis of
frontage, the City Council may elect to assess these improvements on a per connection or on a per lot basis.
Furthermore, as an alternative to assessing the cost of certain utility extensions at the time of construction,
the City Council may elect to establish utility connection fees to be charged to certain properties at their
time of connection.
Subd. 17. Federal, State And County Aid Use. If the City shall receive financial assistance from the
federal government, the State or the County to defray a portion of the cost of a particular street
improvement, the aid shall be used first to reduce the share of the project cost which would be met from
general City funds according to the assessment formulas contained in this Section. If such aid shall be
more than the amount of the improvement cost to be borne by the City, the remainder of the aid so received
shall be credited to the City's Permanent Improvement Fund.
Subd. 18. Minimum Project Assessable Cost. If a portion of a particular improvement shall be financed
through special assessments as shall be provided for by this Section, under no circumstances shall the total
project assessable cost be less than twenty percent (20%) of the total improvement cost. If in the use of the
formulas as established by this Section, the total assessable cost for a particular improvement shall be less
than twenty percent, the front foot assessment for each benefited parcel shall be adjusted so that a minimum
of twenty percent of the total project cost shall be assessed.

extensions, where these improvements are installed on both sides of a platted corner lot, these corner lots
shall be assessed for the frontage of their short side only or an equivalent front footage determined by
dividing the square footage of the lot by the general lot depth of the subdivision where other rules do not
apply. In no case shall the assessed frontage for corner lots be less than the average assessed frontage for
other properties within the project.
Subd. 5. Double Frontage Lots. In the case of double frontage lots where assessable utility extension
improvements are made along both the front and backyards of a single lot, double-frontage lots shall be

12.2.10. Sanitary Sewer and Water Main Reconstruction Projects.
Subd. 1. When existing City owned sanitary sewer and water mains are reconstructed, replaced or
rehabilitated as a result of system age or deterioration, in areas that have already been previously serviced,
a portion of the reconstruction cost shall be assessed against benefited abutting property on the basis of
frontage. After completion of the project, the City Engineer shall recommend, and the City Council shall
adopt by resolution, a Front Foot Assessable Cost which shall apply to that project. This Front Foot
Assessable Cost shall be calculated and established in accordance with the following "Typical Design
Assessment Formula" utilizing current unit construction prices as experienced during that year. If
numerous reconstruction contracts are let during that year, average unit prices shall be calculated. In
calculating the Front Foot Assessment, 50% of the Total Construction Cost, as established by the Typical
Design Assessment Formula, shall be assessed against an Assessable Frontage of 864 feet. The Front Foot
Assessment shall then be applied to all benefited properties in accordance with other applicable rules.

D. Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) Requirements. Any person, firm, sole
proprietorship, partnership, corporation, state agency, or political subdivision proposing a
subdivision of land, a subdivision plat, or any type of construction project that results in a
land disturbing activity involving 1 acre or more within the City, must submit to the City
a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) for review and approval, unless an
exemption waiver is provided in accordance with this Section.
CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 13 - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Section 13.1 18
1) The SWPPP shall contain and be prepared in accordance with the City of
Cloquets Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan Criteria and Requirements
document on file with the City Engineers office. In addition, any further
requirements of the MPCAs NPDES permit program must be followed. These
requirements shall include a drawing or drawings delineating the features
incorporated into the SWPPP, including details of perimeter protection,
construction phasing, storm drain inlet protection, erosion control measures,
temporary and final stabilization measures, drainage easements and storm water
management facilities, including all BMP's to be utilized. In addition any
construction specifications for the project shall contain technical provisions
describing erosion, sedimentation, and water control measures to be utilized
during and after construction as well as to define the entities responsible for the
installation and maintenance of the BMP's. The project SWPPP must be
incorporated into the construction projects specification documents.
2) The SWPPP developed for all projects, including all plans, drawings,
specifications, and computations for storm water management facilities, shall be
prepared, reviewed and signed by a Professional Engineer registered in the State
of Minnesota, except in the following cases:
a. All residential or non-commercial/industrial projects that include less
than five acres of impervious surface.
b. All residential development projects with an ultimate planned density
of less than one-half (0.5) units per acre.
3) The provisions of this Section shall also apply to any project site that is part of a
larger Common Plan of Development or Sale that will disturb greater than or
equal to one acre.
4) Subdivision Plat Approval and Subdivision Registration Process. No subdivision
approval, plat approval or building permit shall be issued, nor shall any land be
disturbed until the SWPPP has been approved by the City and a copy of a State
issued NPDES permit for the project has been provided to the City. Upon the
sale of individual lots, the new owners shall be required to file a Subdivision
Registration Form with the MPCA, which allows the original permittee to
transfer the responsibilities of the project NPDES permit for a portion of the site
to another party without reapplying for permit coverage. Each new owner must
complete this form and submit it to the MPCA and provide the assigned
registration number to the City.
5) For sites or projects that are less than one acre, but are within 100 feet of Special
Waters or Protected Waters such as Otter Creek, Fond du Lac Creek, any
protected wetlands, or are within an existing subdivision or development with
documented flooding problems associated with storm water runoff, a SWPPP
shall be provided to the City in compliance with the provisions of this Section to
preserve or protect the water quality of downstream resources. In addition, a
Grading permit must be obtained for all grading projects in accordance with the
Minnesota State Building Code, as adopted by the City of Cloquet.
6) Erosion and Sediment Control. Erosion and sediment control, at a minimum,
shall meet the requirements and provisions defined in the most current MPCA
NPDES General Storm Water Permit for Construction Activities, also referred
to as the NPDES Construction Permit.
CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 13 - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Section 13.1 19
7) Storm Water Detention/Retention/Treatment Facilities. Storm Water Detention,
Retention or Treatment facilities proposed to be constructed in the Storm Water
Management Plan shall be designed and maintained according to the most
current practices as reflected in the Nationwide Urban Runoff Program study
and in accordance with the MPCAs NPDES Permit requirements. All above
ground Storm Water Detention, Retention or Treatment Facilities shall have a
minimum setback from all property lines as established by the Cloquet Zoning
Ordinance.
8) Regional Ponds. Regional ponds may be used provided they are constructed
ponds, (not a natural wetland or water body) and designed in accordance with
the NPDES permit program requirements for all water from impervious surfaces
that reach the pond. Permittees shall not construct regional ponds in wetlands,
regardless of their condition, quality or designation, unless such wetlands are
mitigated in accordance with applicable rules. The owner must obtain written
authorization from the City or private entity that owns and maintains the
regional pond. If the City is the owner of the regional pond, the City may apply
a System Charge or Assessment that would cover a prorated share of the ponds
construction and operation and maintenance costs.
9) Adequacy of Outlets. The adequacy of any Outlet used as a discharge point for
proposed Storm Water Management Systems must be assessed and documented
to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. To the extent practicable, hydraulic
capacities of downstream natural channels, storm sewer systems, or streets shall
be evaluated to determine if they have sufficient conveyance capacity to receive
and accommodate post-development runoff discharges and volumes. In addition,
projected velocities in downstream natural or manmade channels shall not
exceed that which is reasonably anticipated to cause erosion.
10) Storm Water Discharges to Trunk Highway Right-of-Way. For development
projects which lie adjacent to trunk highway right-of-ways and include Storm
Water Management Systems that will discharge storm water onto highway rightof-
way, a drainage permit must first be obtained from the Minnesota Department
of Transportation (Mn/DOT) prior to the City approving any SWPPP for the
project.
11) Drainage Easements and Discharges to Adjacent Property. No constructed
Storm Water Management Systems or Permanent Facilities, proposed as part of
the SWPPP for a development, may discharge storm water onto adjacent
property unless a drainage easement is in place or the peak design flow rate for
the Permanent Facilities maintains the pre-development existing flow rates and
hydrologic conditions for the 2-year, 10-year, and 100-year rainfall events.
12) Maintenance Agreements for Privately Owned Storm Water Management
Facilities. For storm water management facilities that are on private property or
owned by an entity other than the City and discharge within the City, a plan for
maintenance and inspections of the system must be submitted to and approved
by the City as part of any SWPPP.
13) Exemptions. Exemptions to the SWPPP requirements of this section include:

Subd. 2 The street layout shall provide access adequate for emergency and public service vehicles to all
lots and parcels of land within the subdivision.
Subd. 3 Where appropriate to the design, streets shall be established to avoid jogs at intersections and to
promote continuity of local streets and those of higher classifications. Street jogs with centerline offsets of
less than one hundred and fifty (150) feet shall be discouraged.
Subd. 4 Streets shall be established to take advantage of the contour of the land so as to produce usable
lots, cause a minimum of cutting and filing, and to produce streets with reasonable grades as defined in
Section 13.1.13.
Subd. 5 Certain proposed streets, where appropriate, shall be extended to the boundary line of the tract to
provide for adequate circulation of traffic within the vicinity for adjacent but as yet undeveloped or platted
land tracts.
Subd. 6 Streets shall intersect other streets as near to a 90 degree angle as topography and other factors
permit. Intersections of streets with arterial or collector streets shall be limited to a minimum angle of 70
degrees unless specifically approved by the Commission.
Subd. 7 Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted portion of a street or alley adjacent to the proposed
subdivision which conforms to the Official Map, the remainder of the street or alley shall be platted to the
prescribed width within the proposed subdivision.
Subd. 8 Half-width streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of the
subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations. Where an existing, half-width
street adjoins a portion of the boundary of a proposed subdivision, street dedication in a width needed to

with the view also of minimizing interference with traffic on such traffic ways as well as the accident
hazard. This may be accomplished in several ways:
A. By platting the lots abutting such traffic ways at very generous depth, with setbacks or
front yards at least ten (10) feet greater or deeper than otherwise required; and providing
vehicular access to them by means of frontage access roads next to the traffic way,
connected therewith at infrequent intervals;
B. By not fronting the lots on the highway or thoroughfare but on a parallel local street at a
distance of a generous lot depth, in which case private driveways shall connect with such
local street;
C. By a collector street platted more or less parallel with the highway or thoroughfare, six
hundred (600) to one thousand (1000) feet distance therefrom, from which loop streets or
dead end streets would extend toward the highway, the ends of which provide access to
the lots abutting the highway to their rear.
Subd. 12 Dead end streets will be approved if limited to five hundred (500) feet in length, provided a
permanently designed turn around area having a minimum diameter to the edge of the finished street or
curb line of not less than eighty (80) feet and a minimum right of way diameter of one hundred (100) feet,
is constructed.
Subd. 13 Closed subdivisions (with only one exit) shall not be permitted. Unique circumstances may allow
this with the approval of a variance.
Subd. 14 Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth, unless, in
the opinion of the Commission, prevented by unusual topography or other physical conditions.
Subd. 15 The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks, and lots within blocks, shall be determined with due
regard to:
A. Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the principal and all
required accessory uses.
B. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions, and provisions regulating off-street
parking and loading spaces.
C. Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic.
D. Limitations and opportunities of topography.
E. Generally, blocks shall not exceed thirteen hundred twenty (1320) feet nor less than five
hundred (500) feet in length measured along the greatest dimension of the block.
Subd. 16 Residential blocks shall normally be of sufficient width for two tiers of lots. Block lengths shall
be determined by circulation and other needs. Where residential blocks with lots deeper than two hundred
(200) feet are proposed, a reservation for a future street through the middle of the block, longitudinally,
may be required.

to provide circulation, or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other
community facilities.
Subd. 18 The number of intersecting streets along arterial and collector streets shall be held to a minimum,
and where practicable, blocks along such traffic ways shall not be less than eight hundred (800) feet in
length.
13.1.11 Minimum Widths for Streets and Alley Right-of Way. For all public ways hereafter dedicated and
accepted, the minimum right-of-way widths for streets and thoroughfares shall be shown in the Comprehensive Plan
and where not shown therein, the minimum right-of-way width for streets, arterial highways or pedestrian ways
included in any subdivision shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each classification as follows:
Classification Desirable Acceptable
Principal Arterial Highways 104 feet 80 feet

Collector Streets 80 feet 80 feet
Local Streets 66 feet 66 feet
Service Drives 60 feet 32 feet
Alley 20 feet
Pedestrian Way 20 feet 12 feet
Where existing or anticipated traffic on principal and minor arterial highways warrants greater widths of rights-ofway,
these shall be required.
13.1.12 Minimum Pavement Widths and Surface Types. The following requirements are applicable to all
subdivisions within the jurisdiction of these regulations:
Subd. 1 Pavements widths for arterial and collector streets will be designated in the Transportation Plan.
Where required to be provided as part of the subdivision the subdivider will be responsible for thirty-three
(33) feet. The difference, if any, between the cost of the portion to be provided at the expense of the
subdivider including the cost of curb and gutter, if any, and that of the total width designated in the
Transportation Plan shall be borne by the City of Cloquet, the County of Carlton or by the Minnesota
Highway Department where applicable, unless it is determined by the City Council that such greater width
will benefit the subdivider in proportion to its cost.
Subd. 2 Local streets and dead end streets shall have minimum paved widths of thirty-three (33) feet.
Where curb and gutter is required the total width, face to face of curb, shall be thirty-three (33) feet. Curb

CHAPTER 13 - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Section 13.1 28
Subd. 5 The subdivider shall perform all initial grading of all streets from property line to property line,
including temporary approved ditching and the supply and installation of culverts where necessary for over
the ground drainage until curb and gutter is installed, to within one (1) foot below the final approved grade
prior to installation of water and sewer facilities. Centerline street grades are to be established by the
subdivider subject to approval of the City Engineer.
Subd. 6 After the subdivider has performed the initial street grading and after sewer and water mains are
in, a minimum of six (6) inch compacted gravel street 33 feet in width shall be constructed in accordance
with current City policy established by resolution of the City Council.
Subd. 7 Upon receipt of a valid petition therefore, and/or in accordance with current City policy
established by resolution of the City Council, streets shall be graded full width and fully constructed with a
concrete pavement or of asphaltic concrete for a seven-ton axle weight capacity in residential areas and a
nine-ton axle weight capacity in commercial and industrial areas, unless otherwise required by the City
Council. If the classification of the street justifies the construction of a thicker section, the additional cost
thereof may be borne by the City of Cloquet, the County of Carlton, or the Minnesota Department of
Transportation, depending upon the agency having jurisdiction.
Subd. 8 Concrete curb and gutter is the standard for all paved streets, unless the City Council determines
that a rural street section is appropriate.
13.1.13 Street Grades, Curves and Sight Distances. The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions
within the jurisdiction of the City of Cloquet:
Subd. 1 The grades of any street or alley shall not be less than four-tenths (0.4) percent. (Where
specifically approved by the City Engineer, alleys may be redesigned with a 0.25 grade when constructed
with concrete pavements).
Subd. 2 Street Grades: The grades in all streets, arterial highways, collector streets, minor streets and
alleys in any subdivision shall not be greater than the maximum grades for each classification as follows:
Principal Arterial Highway 6 percent
Minor Arterial Highway 6 percent
Collector Street 6 percent
Local Street 8 percent
Alley 8 percent
Pedestrian Way 20 percent (May be increased if steps of
an acceptable design are provided)
Subd. 3 All changes in street grade of one (1) percent of more shall be connected by vertical curves. The
length of the vertical curve will be determined on the basis of providing stopping sight distances for each
road classification where design speed for arterial and collector streets is forty (40) mph and local streets is
twenty-five (25) mph. In no case shall the length of the required vertical curve be less than fifteen (15)
times the algebraic difference in rate of grades for arterial and collector streets or one-half (1/2) of this
minimum for all other streets.
Subd. 4 The radius of curvature on the center line of the street shall not be less than that required to
produce stopping sight distance as defined in Subd. 3 above. In no case, however, shall the radius of
curvature for arterial and collector streets be less than three hundred (300) feet or for local streets, service
drives and alleys be less than one hundred (100) feet.

Section 13.1 29
13.1.14 Intersections. The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions within the jurisdiction of the
City of Cloquet:
Subd. 1 At a street intersection, the street curb intersection shall be rounded by a radius of at least fifteen
(15) feet.
Subd. 2 Where, in the opinion of the Engineer, the center line profiles of streets presented as part of the
Preliminary Plat do not clearly indicate that adequate intersection design will be accomplished, the
Commission may request an intersection detail at a scale not to exceed one (1) inch equals twenty (20) feet,
which detail will clearly represent the construction details for said intersection.
Subd. 3 Intersections shall be designed so as to avoid abrupt changes in longitudinal or transverse slope.
13.1.15 Lots. The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions within the jurisdiction of the City of
Cloquet:
Subd. 1 The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the proposed
subdivision and for the type of development contemplated. Lot dimensions shall conform to the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
Subd. 2 Excessive depth in relation to widths shall be avoided. A proportion of not more than three (3) to
one (1) normally shall be considered appropriate.
Subd. 3 Every lot shall abut on a street. Lots for residential purposes shall meet the size requirements of
the Zoning Ordinance and also the requirements relative to building setback and side yard requirements.
Subd. 4 Corner lots for residential use shall be platted at least ten (10) feet wider than interior lots in order
to permit conformance with the setback required by the Zoning Ordinance on the side streets.
Subd. 5 Residential lots fronting on arterial or collector streets should have extra depths to permit deep
setbacks for the buildings.
Subd. 6 Double frontage lots and reversed frontage lots shall not be platted except as hereinbefore
permitted under Section 13.1.10, et. Al.
Subd. 7 Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to the right-of-way line of the street on which
the lot fronts.
Subd. 8 Narrow, triangular lots, unusual shapes and lots not permitting at least a 26 foot width house with
side yards and driveway, rear yards and front yards are prohibited. No plat will be accepted that contains
lots undesirable for building, property subject to recurrent flooding, property at grades greater than 8
percent or other factors that may cause such properties to be marginal in building operations and cause such
property to be returned for property taxes.
Subd. 9 Lot Remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing of a larger
tract must be added to adjacent lots, or a plan shown as to future use rather than allowed to remain as
unusable parcels.
13.1.16 Utilities and Drainage. The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions within the
jurisdiction of these regulations:
CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 13 - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Section 13.1 30
Subd. 1 Water Lines: Where approved public water supply is within reasonable access to the subdivision
as determined by the number of lots, distance from and capacity of existing mains, water lines shall be
placed within the right-of-way of each street. Water lines shall have a minimum diameter of eight inches
(8). Fire hydrants shall be installed at intervals of not less than four hundred (400) feet. The minimum size
water main shall be eight inches (8) in diameter and all water mains shall be looped so that water is
available from two directions to any point. Water main, fire hydrants, gate valves and appurtenances shall
be installed in accordance with acceptable engineering practice. In general, in new residential areas, water
main services with a shutoff shall be installed to appropriate public recreational areas in conjunction with
the water main construction.
Subd. 2 Sanitary Sewers: Sanitary sewers shall be constructed in accordance with the standards of the
City of Cloquet and each lot shall be provided with a connection to a sanitary sewer. The City may accept
an area for platting where such service cannot be provided when the lots are of sufficient size and the soil is
suitable for private disposal systems in accordance with City and State Health Department
recommendations. No such private disposal systems shall be interconnected or run to a common private or
public drain. The minimum size public sanitary sewer shall be eight (8) inches in diameter. Manholes shall
be installed at intervals of not more than every 400 feet. In general in new residential areas sanitary sewer
services shall be installed to appropriate public recreational areas in conjunction with the sewer
construction.
Sewage lift stations will be constructed if necessary to serve an area, provided a lift station will be
constructed on an assessment basis to serve an area only if at least 50 percent of the cost is immediately
assessable. The lift station cost beyond the 50 percent and the prorata immediately assessable will be held
for future assessment to the future area to be served.
Subd. 3 Storm Drainage: All necessary facilities including underground pipe, manholes, inlets, catch
basins and other appurtenances necessary to provide adequate drainage for the property or to maintain any
natural drainage course shall be the responsibility of the developer.
Open drainage ditches will not be allowed unless specifically directed by the City Engineer.
Platting of property is prohibited unless it is possible to drain the property by gravity drainage to the natural
drainage course for the area (Refer to Chapter 18: Stormwater Management Regulations to verify
compliance). As a minimum, no property plat will be accepted unless street grades are at least five feet
above lake level and lots are of such elevation as to drain into the streets. The meeting of this minimum
requirement does not obligate the City Council to accept the plat if there are substantial obstructions to the
drainage of the property contained therein, and the City Council may require that the subdivider install
pumping facilities for storm drainage prior to plat acceptance if such facilities are necessary.
Subd. 4 Extensions Not in Platted Area: In some cases the proposed area to be platted will not be served
at its borders by water mains or sanitary sewer. The City Council may require a petition for the creation of
an assessment district to extend the facilities to the platted area; or may require the subdivider to pay the
cost of such extension; or may accept the plat with a separate water or sewer system; or may pay the cost
thereof and hold the amount for future assessment; or may refuse acceptance of the plat.
Subd. 5 Building Permit: No building permit shall be issued in the platted area until sewer and water
mains are designed, approved and the contract for installation awarded with a satisfactory completion date.
No building shall be occupied in the platted area until provided with sanitary sewer and water service and
until the street is graveled and such graveling accepted as adequate by the City Engineer to serve the
building. The occupancy of a building in violation of this section shall not relieve the subdivider of any
responsibility for street improvement. The transfer of property in the plat from the original subdivider to
other parties shall not relieve the subdivider of his responsibility for initial street work as defined herein.
CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 13 - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Section 13.1 31
Subd. 6 Design of Improvements: The City Engineer will design only the improvements to be installed
by the City. A subdivider desiring to contract and install his own improvements shall do so in accordance
with City specifications and practice. The City Engineer will approve or disapprove all plans, specifications
and installations in the public street and for improvements installed by the subdivider shall furnish a written
statement to the subdivider of City acceptance of the improvement prior to the City accepting maintenance
of the improvement or street as a part of the City system.
13.1.17 Other Requirements. The following requirements are applicable to all subdivisions within the jurisdiction
of these regulations:
Subd. 1 Sidewalks: Sidewalks shall be constructed at a minimum on one side of all streets being
dedicated for public use, both sides if it is a collector street or higher classification. The sidewalks shall be
a minimum of five (5) feet wide, constructed of concrete pavement with a minimum thickness of four (4)
inches.
Subd. 2 Driveways: The subdivider shall install driveways, driveway approaches and curb returns for each
connection to the street
Subd. 3 Screen Planting: The installation of trees and shrubs to form a tight screen effective at all times
shall be required along the rear line of any lot in any subdivisions which back onto an arterial or collector
street.
Subd. 4 Street Names: All streets are to be named. A proposed street which is in alignment with and
which joins an existing and named street shall be given the name of the existing street. The name of a
proposed street shall not duplicate the name of an existing street to which it does not connect or with which
it is not in alignment.
Subd. 5 Street Name Signs: Reflectorized street name signs shall be provided at all street intersections or
where a change of direction of a street requires a change of street name. The signs shall be of the size and
type approved for use by the City of Cloquet. Normally, one sign will be required at each residential
intersection; however, more may be required dependent upon the character and/or width of the streets.
Subd. 6 Easements: The following standards and requirements shall apply for all plats where easements
are necessary:
A. An easement for utilities, at least ten (10) feet wide, shall be provided along each side of
a side line of lots and/or the rear line of lots where necessary to form a continuous rightof-
way, at least twenty (20) feet in width. Such easements are to be dedicated and provide
for utility service from street to street. The intent of such easements is to furnish overhead
wire utility service from the rear of the lots to buildings. If necessary for the extension of
main water or sewer lines, electrical transformer pads or similar utilities, easements of
greater width may be required along lot lines or across lots. A ten (10) foot wide
drainage and utility easement is also required adjacent to all front property lines.
B. Utility easements shall connect with easements established in adjoining properties. These
easements, when approved, shall not thereafter be changed without the approval of the
City Council, by Ordinance, upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission.
C. Additional easements for pole guys should be provided at the outside of turns. Where
possible, lot lines shall be arranged to bisect the exterior angle so that pole guys will fall
along side lot lines.

CHAPTER 13 - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Section 13.1 32
D. Where a subdivision is transversed by a water course, drainage way, channel or stream, a
storm water easement, drainage right-of-way or park dedication, whichever the Planning
Commission may deem the most adequate, conforming substantially with the lines of
such water course shall be provided, together with such further width or construction, or
both, as will be adequate for the storm water drainage of the area. The width of such
easements shall be determined by the Planning Commission.
E. Where a connection to a trail system is feasible, easements for a connection to the trail
system may be allowed in lieu of sidewalk requirements as stated in Subd. 1 of this
Section.
13.1.18 Public Utilities
Subd. 1 All new electric distribution lines (excluding main line feeders and high voltage transmission
lines), telephone service lines, Cable TV, and any other services constructed within the confines of and
providing service to customers in a newly platted residential area shall be buried underground; unless the
Council specifically shall find, after study and recommendation by the Planning Commission, that:
A. The placing of utilities underground would not be compatible with the development
planned;
B. The additional cost of burying such utilities would create an undue financial hardship; or
C. Topographical, soil, or any other conditions make the underground installation
unreasonable or impractical.
Subd. 2 All utility lines for telephone and electrical service shall be placed in rear line easements when
carried on overhead poles. The Planning Commission may recommend, and the City Council require, that
the type of overhead pole used be of a quality and durability aesthetically in conformance with the nature of
the residential development.
Subd. 3 Where telephone, electric and/or gas service lines are to be placed underground entirely, conduits
or cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways, in such a manner so as not to conflict
with other underground services.
Subd. 4 All drainage and other underground utility installations which traverse privately owned property
shall be protected by easements.
Subd. 5 The subdivider is responsible for complying with the requirements of this Section, and shall
submit to the Planning Commission a written record from the utilities showing that the necessary
arrangements with the utility involved for the installation of said facilities have been made.
Subd. 6 All meters used to measure consumption of users must be attached or in close proximity (within
3 feet) of the principal structure.

13.1.23 Modifications and Exceptions
Subd. 1 Major Subdivisions: The general principle of design and minimum requirements for the layout of
subdivisions, set forth in Section 13.1.06, may be varied by the City Council in the case of a subdivision
large enough to constitute a more or less self-contained neighborhood which is to be developed in
accordance with a comprehensive plan safeguarded by the appropriate restrictions, and which, in the
judgment of the City Council, makes adequate provisions for all essential community requirements;
provided, however, that no modification shall be granted by the Council which would conflict with the
purposes of the official Map or with the other features of the Comprehensive Plan of Cloquet, or with the
intent and purposes of said general principle of design and minimum requirements.
Subd. 2 Unusual, Physical Conditions: In any particular case where the subdivider can show that, by
reason of exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, strict compliance with any requirement of
this ordinance would cause unusual difficulty or exceptional and undue hardship, the City Council may
relax such requirement to the extent deemed just and proper, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship,
provided that such relief may be granted without detriment to the public good and without impairing the
intent and purposes of these regulations or the desirable general development of the neighborhood and the
community in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cloquet.
Any modifications thus granted shall be entered in the minutes of the City Council setting forth the reasons
which, in the opinion of the Council, justified the modification.
13.1.24 Enforcement. If a subdivision, construction, reconstruction, or use occurs in violation of this Chapter, the
City Planner/Zoning Administrator may, in addition to other remedies, institute any proper criminal action or
proceedings in the name of the City of Cloquet, and hereby shall have the powers of a police officer to prevent such
unlawful subdivision, construction, reconstruction, or use, to restrain or correct such violations, to prevent the
occupancy of said property, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about said premises.

ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
Effective Date: March 7, 2006
Amendments: 01-02-08 (Res 08-03) /
Section 15.1: Administrative Offenses
15.1.01. Purpose. The administrative offense procedures established pursuant to this section are intended to
provide the public and the City with an informal and cost effective alternative to the traditional criminal procedures
followed for charges for violations of certain city code or ordinance provisions. The procedures provided herein are
intended to provide the charged party with an election either to proceed pursuant to the voluntary administrative
process established herein or elect to proceed under the existing criminal scheme which affords of the charged party
with all of the rights afforded by the criminal process. At any time prior to the payment of a listed administrative
penalty, as is provided for hereafter, the individual may withdraw from participation in the administrative procedure
and require the City to bring criminal charges in accordance with its ordinance, code, and the law. Likewise the City,
in its discretion, may choose not to initiate an administrative offense and may bring criminal charges in the first
instance. In the event a party participates in the administrative offense procedures but does not pay the monetary
penalty imposed, the City retains the right to seek criminal charges and can proceed to collect the costs of the
administrative offense procedures incurred as part of a subsequent criminal sentence in the event the party is charged
and is adjudicated guilty of the criminal violation alleged.
15.1.02. Administrative Offense Defined. An administrative offense is a violation of the provisions cited by this
section and is subject to the administrative penalties set forth in the schedule of offenses and penalties referred to in
Subd. 9 herein.
15.1.03. Notice. Any Police Officer of the Cloquet Police Department or any other person employed by the City,
authorized in writing by the City Administrator as having authority to enforce this section, shall, upon determining
that there has been a violation, provide prompt written notice to the violating party of the offense cited. If the
violation involves a motor vehicle, notice should be attached to the vehicle involved in the violation. Said notice
shall set forth the nature, date and time of violation, the name of the official issuing the notice, and the amount of the
scheduled administrative penalty to be paid.
15.1.04. Payment. Once such notice is given, the alleged violator may, within seven (7) days of the time of
issuance of the notice, pay the amount set forth on the schedule of penalties for the violation, or request a hearing in
writing, as is provided for hereafter. The penalty may be paid in person or by mail, and payment shall be deemed to
be an admission of the violation.
15.1.05. Hearing. Any person contesting an administrative offense pursuant to this Chapter may, within seven (7)
days of the time of issuance of the notice of violation, request an administrative hearing to contest the fact that a
violation has occurred. The hearing officer shall have authority to dismiss the violation or reduce or waive the
penalty. If the violation is sustained by the hearing officer, the violator shall pay the penalty imposed. Failure to pay
the administrative penalty for the violation cited may result in the person being cited for a criminal violation.
15.1.06. Hearing Officer. A City employee designated in writing by the City Administrator shall be the hearing
officer for purposes of this section. The hearing officer is authorized to hear and determine any controversy relating
to the administrative offenses provided for in this section. This process is intended to replace any existing
administrative procedures previously established by ordinance with regard to violations enumerated herein.
15.1.07. Failure to Pay. In the event a party charged with an administrative offense fails to pay the penalty
provided by this section, a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor charge may be brought against the alleged violator in
accordance with applicable statutes, code, or ordinance. If the penalty is paid or if an individual is found not to have
committed the administrative offense by the hearing officer, no such criminal charge may be brought by the City for
the same violation.
15.1.08. Disposition of Penalties. All penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be paid to the City
Administrator's office and may be deposited in the City's general fund.

ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
15.1.09. Offenses and Penalties. Offenses which may be charged as administrative offenses shall be designated by
the City Council and the penalties for such offenses may be established by resolution of the City Council from time
to time. Copies of such resolutions shall be maintained in the office of the City Administrator.
15.1.10. Subsequent Offenses. In the event a party is charged with a subsequent administrative offense within a
twelve (12) month period of paying an administrative penalty for the same or substantially similar offense, the
subsequent administrative penalty shall be increased by twenty-five percent (25%) above the then existing
administrative penalty for the same offense.
15.1.11. Administrative Penalties. Listed below are the administrative offenses covered by this section and the
corresponding administrative penalties for those offenses. The following administrative penalties will be assessed

CHAPTER 15
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
Section 15.2: Administrative Hearing Process
15.2.01 Purpose. The City Council has determined that there is a need for a standard method of addressing
administrative appeals and an alternative method of enforcing certain violations of City Code or Ordinances which
provide for the imposition of administrative penalties and fees instead of criminal penalties. Accordingly, the City
Council finds that the use of administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties is a legitimate and
necessary alternative method of enforcement with regard to certain types of Code or Ordinance violations. This
method of enforcement shall be in addition to any other legal remedy which may be pursued by the City for City
Code and Ordinance violations.
15.2.02 Amending Existing Administrative Hearing Processes. Presently, City Code sections 6.4 and 6.6
provide for administrative hearings which extend due process to those individuals or merchants that are alleged to
have bartered or sold tobacco products and/or alcoholic products to individuals that are under legal age. Provisions
contained in sections 6.4 and 6.6 presently provide for civil penalties which involve the payment of administrative
fees and license suspension with regard to violations. At the time those sections were adopted the system of
conducting administrative hearings was untested. Given the experience that has been gained by enforcing those
sections, and in the interest of consistency and fairness, it is the express intent of this section to provide for a
consistent administrative hearing process for all hearings conducted pursuant to those sections and any other
ordinances that the City Council may hereinafter adopt which provide for the imposition of administrative fees and
penalties.
15.2.03. Administrative Citations. Hereafter, all administrative citations issued with regard to violations of City
Code or Ordinances will be issued by a City Police Officer or another City Official authorized by the City to issue a
citation regarding the prohibited conduct. All such citations must be issued in person or must be sent by mail to the
person or entity responsible for the violation or must be attached to the motor vehicle involved in the violation in the
case of a vehicular offense. The citation must state the date, time, and nature of the offense, the name of the issuing
officer or authorized individual, the amount of the scheduled administrative penalty, and the manner for paying the
administrative penalty or for appealing the citation. The person responsible for the violation must either pay the
scheduled administrative fee as provided for in the section for which they are cited or request a hearing within twenty
(20) days of the receipt or mailing of the written notice of violation.
15.2.04. Administrative Hearing Process. The City Council hereby ordains that all administrative hearings will
be conducted before a hearing officer who is either licensed to practice law in the State of Minnesota, is a retired
Judge, a hearing officer, or is a trained arbitrator or mediator. The City Administrator is hereby authorized to select
a hearing officer to hear and determine matters for which a hearing is requested provided that the person selected as
a hearing officer is not a City employee and is not a person that would have a personal interest in the outcome. The
cited individual in any given instance shall have the right to ask that the hearing officer assigned to the case be
removed from the case, for cause, as long as a written request is filed with the City Administrator within five (5) days
after the cited individual or person has been notified as to the identity of hearing officer chosen. If denied, any
subsequent requests must be directed to the assigned hearing officer directly and must also be based upon cause.
The assigned hearing officer will then decide whether or not he or she can fairly and objectively review the case. If
the hearing officer assigned determines that cause exists for
removal, that officer shall remove himself or herself from the case and the City Administrator shall assign another
hearing officer. A hearing officer is not a judicial officer but is a public officer as defined by Minnesota Statute
§609.415.
Section 15.2 Administrative Hearing Process 5
CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 15
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
(A) Notice of Hearing. Notice of a prospective administrative hearing must be served in person or by
mail on the person or the entity alleged to be responsible for the violation at least seven (7) days in
advance of the proposed hearing unless a shorter time is agreed to by all parties. At the hearing,
the City will be required to proceed first to present testimony and question any witnesses that the
City believes supports the alleged administrative fee or citation sought to be enforced. The strict
rules of evidence will not apply and the hearing officer shall receive and give weight to evidence,
including hearsay evidence, which possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonable
and prudent people in the conduct of their personal affairs. Either party is entitled to be
represented by an attorney at their own cost and the hearing will not be transcribed by a court
reporter unless a transcript is requested and paid for by the person or entity requesting the hearing.
Any person requesting that the hearing be transcribed agrees to provide the City with a copy of the
transcript at no cost to the City.
(B) Hearing Officer's Authority. The hearing officer chosen herein is authorized by the City
Council to determine whether or not a violation has occurred, whether it is proper to impose the
scheduled administrative penalty, or whether or not it is proper to reduce, stay, or waive a
scheduled penalty.
1. Subpoena Authority. Upon the hearing officer's own initiative or upon written request
of an interested party demonstrating the need, the hearing officer may issue an
administrative subpoena requiring the attendance of witnesses or the production of
books, papers, records, or other documents that are material to the matter being
considered. The party requesting the subpoena shall be responsible for serving the
subpoena in a manner provided for civil actions and for paying the fees and expenses and
mileage of any witnesses required to attend. A person served with an administrative
subpoena pursuant to these provisions may file an objection with the hearing officer
promptly but not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance. The officer
may cancel the subpoena, the hearing, or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable or
oppressive or if the proposed witnesses provide adequate grounds for modification of the
subpoena's requirements. However, any person who fails to file an objection, or, without
just cause, fails to or refuses to attend and testify or to produce the required documents in
obedience to an administrative subpoena issued herein shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
Alternatively, the party requesting the subpoena may seek a continuance of the hearing
and an Order from the District Court directing compliance with the subpoena issued
pursuant to this section.
2. Decision. The hearing officer's decision and supporting reasons must be stated in writing
and must be completed within ten (10) days of the date of the hearing. That decision will
be produced in writing and provided to the City Administrator and the parties involved
within ten (10) days from the date of the hearing. If mailed, the hearing officer will be
given an additional three (3) days to provide for mailing.
(C) Judicial Review. Any person that maintains that they are aggrieved by an administrative decision
consistent with this provision may have that decision reviewed in the district court consistent with
Minnesota Statute §462.361.
15.2.05. Recovery of Civil Penalties or Administrative Fees. If a civil penalty or administrative fee assessed
pursuant to code or ordinance or determined after an administrative hearing requested herein is not paid within the
time specified, it shall constitute a lien against the real property on which the violation occurred if the property or
improvements on the property was the subject of the violation and the property owner was found responsible for the
violation, and/or, be a personal obligation of the violator in all other situations.
Section 15.2 Administrative Hearing Process 6
CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 15
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
1. A lien assessed herein may be assessed against the property and collected in the same
manner as taxes.
2. A personal obligation may be collected by any appropriate legal means.
3. Failure to pay fine or administrative fee assessed herein is grounds for suspending or
revoking a license associated with the violation.
4. During the time that any civil penalty administrative fee remains unpaid, the City will be
entitled to assess interest based upon the prevailing judgment interest rate and provided
by law by the State District Courts.
15.2.06. Additional Criminal Penalties. The following are misdemeanors, punishable in accordance with state
law:
(A) Failure without good cause to pay a fine or final determination made by the hearing officer as
provided herein.
(B) Failure to appear at an administrative hearing requested and scheduled pursuant to this section or
for failure to comply with an administrative subpoena without filing a timely objection as provided
herein.
(C) Failure to pay a fine imposed by the hearing officer within sixty (60) days of the date of citation or
no later than thirty (30) days after the date of any written decision to determine that a violation has
occurred and all appeals therefrom.

A. Pre-Application Meeting. Prior to the submission of an application as required by
this Chapter, a pre-application meeting may be required by this Chapter or
encouraged by the Zoning Administrator or other Authorized Agent as follows:
(1) Purpose of the meeting. A pre-application meeting is a meeting between a
potential applicant and the City Planner/Zoning Administrator or other
Authorized Agent(s) of the City. Where beneficial / appropriate review
bodies may also be included in a pre-application meeting. The meeting is
an opportunity for the applicant to describe what application is being
considered, and for the City Planner/Zoning Administrator, review body,
or other Authorized Agent, to indicate which application is appropriate
and what criteria will be used to determine whether the application should
be approved.
(2) Meeting format. Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, there is no
required format for a pre-application meeting.
(3) Combined meetings. Pre-application meetings may be combined when an
applicant anticipates making simultaneous applications for the same
project.

B. Application Forms and Fees. The following provisions shall apply to all required
applications pursuant to this Chapter.
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.2 Application, Review Procedures 21
(1) Forms. Applications shall be submitted on forms, with any requested
information and attachments, and in such numbers as required by the City,
including any checklists for submittals. The City Planner/Zoning
Administrator or other Authorized Agent of the City shall have the
authority to request any other pertinent information required to ensure
compliance with this Chapter. The City Planner/Zoning Administrator or
other Authorized Agent shall make the required forms available to all
applicants.
(2) Application fees. Fees for those applications required by this Chapter
shall be in accordance with the Citys current fee schedule, which the City
Council may update from time to time. The fees are intended to cover the
Citys actual costs in processing the application and are not refundable.
Such costs may include, but are not limited to, filing the application,
publishing notices, and mailing notices regarding the application.
C. Reimbursement for City Review Costs. The following provisions shall apply to all
required applications pursuant to this Chapter.

all such reviews shall be borne by the applicant. The City reserves the
right to require an escrow account be established to provide funds for
anticipated review costs.
(2) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure to
reimburse the city for its cost of review, analysis, and evaluation of
development proposals, conditional use permits, comprehensive plan
amendments, zoning amendments, and enforcement of the ordinance from
which this chapter is derived in cases where, due to the level of
complexity of the application under consideration, excessive costs beyond
those normally incurred by the city as a result of the administration of the
ordinance from which this chapter is derived are incurred. The excess
costs result from problems presented in review, analysis, and evaluation
which necessitate intensive investigation and research. The intent of this
section is to ensure an adequate level of review of these cases and to
ensure that the adverse effects of development on the city are minimized
and in compliance with goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan
and this chapter are obtained.
(3) Conditions where reimbursement is authorized. The city may, in its sole
discretion, require reimbursement of city costs under the following
conditions:

and City Council meetings are required to review a particular item
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.2 Application, Review Procedures 22

initial meeting.

D. Vibration. No ground vibration shall be permitted which is discernable without
instruments at the points of measurement for ordinance enforcement.
E. Smoke. No emission shall be permitted at any point, from any chimney or otherwise,
of visible grey smoke of a shade equal to or darker than No. 2 on the Powers Micro-
Ringlemann Chart (published by McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, Inc., and
copyrighted 1954, being a direct facsimile reduction of the standard Ringlemann
Chart as issued by the United States Bureau of Mines), except that visible grey smoke
of a shade equal to No. 3 of said chart may be emitted for four (4) minutes in any
thirty (30) minutes. These provisions applicable to visible grey smoke shall also apply
to visible smoke of a different color but with an apparently equivalent capacity.
F. Odors. No emission shall be permitted of odorous gases or other odorous matter in
such quantities as to be unreasonably noxious at the points of measurement. Any
process which may involve the creation or emission of any odors shall be provided
with a secondary safeguard system, so that control will be maintained if the primary
safeguard system should fail. There is hereby established as a guide in determining
such quantities of offensive odors Table III, Odor Thresholds, in Chapter 5, Air

17.4.04 Non-Conformities.
Subd. 1 Intent. Within the district established by this Chapter or amendments that may later
be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful
before this Chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited under the terms
of this Chapter or future amendment.
It is the intent of this Chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are
removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this Chapter to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this
Chapter that non-conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded nor extended, nor be
used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land, or a non-conforming use
of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Chapter by
attachment of additional signs to a building, or the placement of additional signs or display
devices on the land outside the building, or by the addition of other uses, if such additions are
a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the
plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was
lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter and upon
which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is
hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.4 General Standards 66
fastened in a permanent manner, and demolition, elimination and removal of an existing
structure in connection with such construction, provided that actual construction work shall
be diligently carried on until the completion of the building involved.
Subd. 2 Non- Conformities.
A. Non-conforming Lots of Record. In any district in which single-family dwellings are
permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Chapter, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
undeveloped single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this Chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable
in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving
area or width, or both, of lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which
such lot is located. Variance of lot coverage and / or
yard requirements shall be obtained only though
action of the Planning Commission acting as the
Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals.
If in the case of two (2) or more contiguous lots or
parcels of land under single ownership, any
individual lot or parcel does not meet the minimum
requirements of this Chapter, such individual lot or
parcel shall not be considered as a separate parcel of
land for purposes of sale or development, but must
be combined with adjacent lots so that the
combination of lots will equal one or more parcels
of land meeting the full requirements of this section
or the provisions of the zoning district in which the property is located, whichever is
more restrictive. In no circumstances will there be approval of any proposal for
multiple lot developments based upon lots of record, and not conforming with the
provisions of the existing zoning district.
B. Non-Conforming Uses of Land. Where the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this Chapter, lawful use of land exists that is no longer permissible under the terms
of this Chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Chapter.
(2) No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other
portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Chapter.
(3) If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of
more than ninety (90) days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.4 General Standards 67
the regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which such land is
located.
C. Non-Conforming Structures. Any structure existing
on the effective date of this Chapter, which is not in
conformity with the regulations contained in this
Chapter, shall be allowed to continue, subject to the
following:
(1) Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the
placing of a structure in safe condition when
the Building Official declares said structure
unsafe.
(2) When any lawful non-conformity in any
district is discontinued for a period of more
than twelve (12) months or is changed to a
conforming use, any future use of said
structure or land shall be in conformity
with the provisions of this Chapter.
(3) Non-conforming structures may not be
enlarged or altered in a way that
increases their non-conformity unless in
compliance with the following:
(a) Expansion or alteration of a
structure found to be nonconforming
may be permitted
provided the expansion complies
with the requirements of this
Chapter.
(3)Whenever a lawful non-conforming
structure has been damaged by fire,
flood, explosion, earthquake, war, riot, act of God or similar occasion, it may
be reconstructed, and used as it was before, if it is reconstructed within twelve
(12) months after such calamity. If the damage to the building or structure is
fifty percent (50%) or more of its fair market value, the owner may, within six
(6) months, apply for a building permit to reconstruct a non-conforming
structure for its use prior to the damage.
(4) Any structure which will, under this Chapter, become non-conforming but for
which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to it becoming nonconforming,
may be completed in accordance with the approved plans;
provided construction has started within sixty (60) days of the date it became
non-conforming and continues to completion within one year. Such structure
shall thereafter be a legally existing non-conforming structure.
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.4 General Standards 68
(5) A lawful non-conforming use of a structure or parcel of land may be changed
to a similar or more restrictive non-conforming use. Once a structure or parcel
of land has been placed in a more restrictive non-conforming use, it shall not
return to a less restrictive non-conforming use.
(6) Normal maintenance of a building or other structure containing or related to a
lawful non-conforming use is permitted, including necessary non-structural
repairs and incidental alterations which do not extend or intensify the nonconforming
use.
(7) Alterations may be made to a building containing lawful non-conforming
residential units when they will improve the livability thereof, provided they
will not increase the number of dwelling units or bulk of the building except
that a garage may be added if none previously existed.
(8) A lawfully existing non-conforming structure, or structure containing a legally
existing non-conforming use may expand if the following criteria are satisfied:
a. A complete building permit application shall be submitted to the
Building Official, found satisfactory and issued prior to the
commencement of any work on the expansion.
b. The structure expansion shall meet all of the bulk standards for the
Zoning District within which the structure is located. A variance may
be applied for, if the structure expansion could not meet the respective
bulk standards. The variance application and its review by the City
shall be regulated according to Section 17.2.11: Variance.
c. If any expansion is requested under this sub-section, the City may
impose standards and / or conditions upon the underlying nonconforming
use or structure for purposes of health, safety or welfare.
D. Repairs and Maintenance. On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming
use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months
on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring
or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the current appraised
market value of the building, provided that the cubical space content of the building
as it exists at the time of passage or amendment of this Chapter shall not be increased.
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed so as to prevent the restoration of a nonconforming
structure to a safe condition when said structure is declared to be
hazardous or unsafe by authorized City Administrative officials. Such restoration
shall not extend the non-conforming structure in any manner, except as reasonably
required to eliminate the hazardous or unsafe conditions.
17.4.05 Violations and Penalty.
Subd.1 Complaints Regarding Violations. Whenever a violation of this Chapter occurs, or
is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint, stating
fully the causes and basis thereof, shall be filed with the City Planner/Zoning Administrator.

17.5.04 Landscaping Requirements.
Subd. 1 Intent. It is the intent of the City of Cloquet to preserve its significant natural
resources as a complement to existing and future urbanization. In particular, steep slopes,
very steep slopes, woodlands, wetlands and drainage ways shall be preserved in their natural
state for their functional and ecological value as well as for their positive impact upon
proximate urban development. It is the intent of the City to require significant landscaping /
planting in open or disturbed areas as a normal part of land development. Specific
requirements shall be as set forth in this Section.
Subd. 2 Landscape Plan Required. A landscape plan shall be provided for all new
Industrial / Business / Office / Commercial / Multiple-Family Residential / and Public /
Semi-Public facilities and developments. The applicant for a building permit shall submit a
landscape plan prepared by a landscape architect, nursery designer or other qualified person
in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
The landscape plan shall include the following information:
A. General. Name and address of developer / owner; name and address of landscape
architect, designer; date of preparation; date and description of all revisions; name of
project or development.
B. Site Plan. A scale drawing of the site based upon a survey of property lines with
indication of scale and north point; name and right-of-way of proposed and existing
streets; location of all proposed utility easements and rights-of-way; location of
existing and propose buildings; parking areas; water bodies; proposed sidewalks.
C. Landscape Plan. A scale drawing of proposed landscaping for the site based upon a
survey of property lines with indication of scale and north point; existing and
proposed topography at two (2) foot contour intervals; delineation of both sodded and
seeded area; location and identification of proposed landscape or man-made materials
used to provide screening from adjacent and neighboring properties; location and
identification of all planting (trees, shrubs, flowers, ground cover, etc.) existing trees
and shrubbery to remain; details of fences, retaining walls, berms and other landscape
improvements; location of landscape islands and planter beds with identification of
plant material used; and location and details of irrigation systems.
D. Certain types of stormwater improvements that are landscaping in nature may qualify
for stormwater utility credit (to be evaluated by City Engineer). Listed below are
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 75
certain stormwater best management practices that meet the citys landscaping
requirements; these areas are not required to be irrigated:
(1) Rain Gardens. Residential or commercial rain gardens designed and
vegetated to capture and soak in stormwater.
(2) Green Roofs. Green roofs filter, absorb and detain rainfall. The specialized
soil and plants reduce runoff by holding back and slowing down water that
would otherwise flow into the storm drains.
(3) Ribbon Curbs. Ribbon curbs, or curbless parking areas / streets, slope into
adjacent vegetated areas and allow rain from paved areas to drain into rain
gardens or vegetated swales. By reducing curbs and gutters, there are fewer
infrastructure costs and water can drain into the structure and soak into the
ground.
E. Planting Schedule. A table containing the common and botanical names, size of plant
materials, root specifications, quantities and special planting instructions.
Subd. 3 General Requirements, All Districts.
A. Required Landscaping: All disturbed areas of developed lots which are not devoted to
off-street parking, loading and driving areas, sidewalks, patios, gardens and similar
uses, shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, trees, shrubs or other ornamental
landscape material. Minimum amount of green space on each site shall be twenty-five
percent (25%) of the total lot. Undisturbed areas containing existing viable natural

soil and plants reduce runoff by holding back and slowing down water that
would otherwise flow into the storm drains.
(6) Ribbon Curbs. Ribbon curbs, or curbless parking areas / streets, slope into
adjacent vegetated areas and allow rain from paved areas to drain into rain
gardens or vegetated swales. By reducing curbs and gutters, there are fewer
infrastructure costs and water can drain into the structure and soak into the
ground.
E. Planting Islands. Planting islands shall be required where necessary to visually break
up expanses of hard surface parking areas as determined by the Zoning
Administrator. Planting islands shall occupy at least five percent of the parking area.

Subd. 4 Review. A zoning permit and site plan shall be required for all fences two feet six
inches (26) or more in height. Exception: Fences in the F-R, Farm Residential District
intended as livestock and / or field enclosures shall not require a zoning permit. A fee
determined by the City Planner/Zoning Administrator shall be required to process the zoning

17.5 Special Provisions 117
a sign otherwise not permitted by these regulations where an exception would not be

Commission acting as the Board of Adjustment shall find that either condition (1) or
(2) hereinafter set forth exists:

actions of the applicant;
c. A literal interpretation of the provisions of these regulations would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties

any special privilege for a use not common to other lands, structures or
building in the same district; and
e. The proposed use of the property shall have an appearance what will
not have an adverse effect upon adjacent properties and there will be
no deterrence to development of vacant land.

17.5 Special Provisions 120
17.5.14 Design Standards for the West End and Downtown Business Districts
Subd. 1 Intent. The intent of this Section is to provide design standards that will preserve
and enhance the architectural character that exists in the West End and Downtown Business
Districts. The communitys business heritage is tied to its buildings, and these buildings
contribute significantly to the communitys image and identity. These standards are intended
to implement the communitys vision for the West End and Downtown Business Districts as
articulated in the Community Revitalization Master Plan of 1998. These standards shall be
applicable to all new construction and uses of land, and to any remodeling, additions and / or
renovations to the existing development, which takes place after the effective date of
adoption of these standards. Additions, alterations or repairs may be made to any building or
structure without requiring the existing building or structure to comply with all of the
requirements of this Section, provided the addition, alteration or repair conforms to that
required for a new building or structure. Existing buildings, where the siding material is not
in conformance with these standards, may have such non-conforming material replaced with
similar material, provided such replacement does not constitute more than fifty percent
(50%) of the area of the wall on which it is located. Replacement of more than fifty percent
(50%) shall require that all of the material on that wall shall be replaced with conforming
materials.
Subd. 2 District Boundaries
A. The West End Business District shall consist of all properties zoned HC, Historic
Commercial District, lying within an area bounded on the north by Avenue A, on the
west by Market Street, on the south by Avenue D, and on the east by Trunk Highway
#33, as depicted on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Cloquet.
B. The Downtown Business District shall consist of all properties zoned commercial and
/ or industrial lying within an area bounded on the north by the Railroad Right-of 
Way just north of Avenue B, on the west by Trunk Highway #33, on the south by
Avenue F, and on the east by 18th Street, as depicted on the Official Zoning Map of
the City of Cloquet. This District shall reflect a Central Business District character
and permit a wider range of architectural styles and designs. A Central Business
District is characterized by a broad mix of commercial uses and building styles and
designs reflective of such an eclectic mix.
Subd. 3 General Provisions
A. Renovation of existing buildings shall return a buildings storefront to as close to its
original architectural character as possible. In many cases, this will require removal of
inappropriate later façade additions, such as: wood siding cover-ups; ribbed steel
siding overlays; large signs, inappropriate to the scale of the building; wood shake
mansard roofs; plastic or oddly shaped awnings; window openings in-fills or
surrounds designed to reduce the size of the openings; lighting fixtures inconsistent
with the era and architectural style; and other features of similar inappropriate
character.
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 121
B. The upper stories of a building shall be visually integrated with lower stories through
the use of design details, colors and materials.
C. New construction shall be designed to be architecturally compatible with existing
buildings. The creation of a false historical look, through the use of materials and
features which appear to be historic but are in fact new, is to be avoided. Infill
building construction shall reflect the design of adjacent structures in height,
materials and style.
D. Buildings shall be the focus in the Districts, not parking areas, accessory uses or
signs. Such features shall be designed, located and arranged to complement the
principle building on the property and on adjacent properties.
E. Formula and corporate architecture (i.e. incorporates symbols or designs which are
highly representative of a corporate logo or image, or which utilize the same
architectural designs regardless of location), franchise patterns and buildings that are
designed as signs shall be prohibited. Building design shall, as much as possible,
incorporate characteristics that already exist in the area.
F. These Standards shall apply primarily to buildings facing Avenue C in the West End
Business District and Cloquet Avenue in the Downtown Business District. They shall
also apply to corner buildings and those buildings within the block where the sides of
the building can be seen from Avenue C and / or Cloquet Avenue. Buildings not
facing Avenue C and / or Cloquet Avenue may conform to a lesser standard as an
exception to the rule. This includes buildings facing other streets within the said
Districts.
Subd. 4 Dimensional Standards. Building height, lot area, bulk and yard setback
requirements shall be those set forth in Section 17.6.24: Tabulation of Dimensional and
Special Requirements for Zoning Districts, with the following exceptions:
A. Build-to Line (the line measured from the street right-of-way which at least seventy
(70) percent of the primary structure must touch).
(1) West End and Cloquet Avenue  0 feet
(2) Avenue B and other side streets  10 feet
B. Minimum street frontage build-out (that portion of the primary street frontage which
must be occupied by the primary structure at the build-to line).
(1) West End and Cloquet Avenue  One hundred (100) percent, except that
pedestrian passages and plaza spaces developed in concert with buildings are
exempt.

(3) Side streets  Thirty percent (30%)
C. Minimum lot coverage by structures (plazas, outdoor gatherings or sales areas are not
included in minimum coverage calculation).

spaces developed in concert with buildings are exempt.
D. Building footprint size and bay width (the width of a storefront or segment of a
continuous façade at which the building must be divided) for the primary structure
one each site:
(1) West End and Cloquet Avenue  Two thousand (2,000) square feet minimum,
ten thousand (10,000) square feet maximum; twenty (20) to forty (40) foot
bays
(2) Avenue B  Two thousand (2,000) square feet minimum, thirty thousand
(30,000) square feet maximum; twenty (20) to sixty (60) foot bays
(3) Up to one hundred (100) percent lot coverage, and buildings larger than the
maximums permitted in 1. and 2. above, may be permitted by Conditional Use
Permit, as stipulated in Section 17.2.10, if adequate off street parking is
provided through the use of parking ramps, shared parking lots, etc. and if
other amenities are incorporated into the building design to effectively
substitute for the require landscaping features.
Subd. 5 Parking Standards. General off street parking requirements shall be as specified in
Section 17.5.11: Off-Street Parking, with the exception as noted in Section 17.6.13, Subd. 6,
B: City Center, Special Provisions, Parking. Other parking standards specific to the West
End and Downtown Business Districts shall be as follows:
A. Off street parking shall be located in the side or rear yards only. No more than
twenty-five (25) percent of required parking shall be in a side yard.
B. Parking areas adjacent to street intersections shall be prohibited unless buffered
landscaping and appropriate setbacks are provided.
C. Parking areas and access drives shall not be placed closer than ten (10) feet to any
building, and no closer than ten (10) feet to a public sidewalk. Interior walk ways and
landscaping complying with the provisions of Subd. 7 herein shall be installed

ornamental fencing (no berms) that is at least fifty percent (50%) opaque to a height
of twenty-eight (28) to thirty-six (36) inches in all seasons.
D. Joint-use parking facilities that balances high peak and off peak parking demand, and
shares spaces between adjoining properties, shall be encouraged.
E. On street parking that fronts each site shall be included in the calculation of the
required number of parking spaces as per Section 17.5.11: Off-Street Parking. On
street parking on the side of the building shall not be included in this calculation.
F. Employee parking shall be designated in remote areas of parking areas to allow
customer parking nearest the destination. On street parking for employees shall be
discouraged.
G. Access to off street parking areas and sites shall be from cross streets only. No curb

Avenue B or Avenue C.
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 123
H. Parking ramps or similar structures may be used to fulfill off street parking
requirements, provided such structures incorporate design elements consistent with
this Section.
Subd. 6 Architectural Standards. The Department of Interior Standards for Rehabilitation
and the Guidelines which accompany them shall be the starting point for storefront and
building design, and shall guide the re-use and rehabilitation of any structure in the West End
Business District consistent with its historical character. The Standards applicable to the
Downtown Business District shall promote a more eclectic character consistent with that
which has emerged over the years. New construction shall incorporate such design principles
as are consistent with these Standards and Guidelines. Because of the sensitive nature of
storefront and building design in the West End and Downtown Business Districts, it is
strongly encouraged that the design for such work be prepared by a registered architect with
particular expertise in such areas. It is the intent of these Standards that buildings fronting on
Avenue C and Cloquet Avenue will require a different architectural standard than those
fronting on side and other streets within the District. The following Standards are intended to
reflect that difference:
A. Materials. The use of quality building materials and methods to create an enduring
stock of buildings shall be required. Acceptable materials and methods shall include:
(1) Brick, stone, wood, EIFS (exterior insulating finish system) or high quality
precast concrete are acceptable as exterior finish material. Wood, high quality
metal (matte finish preferred) or synthetic siding may be acceptable as
secondary trim or accent materials if used in combination with other
acceptable materials, provided such materials do not exceed twenty percent
(20%) of the exterior façade which is visible from a public way. Wood
frame, steel frame or masonry construction is acceptable. Exceptions will be
allowed for high quality synthetic material that mimics brick, masonry, etc.
Materials must be durable and property maintained at all times.
(2) Materials shall be durable, easily maintained, attractive at close distances, and
scaled to pedestrians when structures are within ten (10) feet of public rightof-
way or public walkway (i.e. no jumbo brick).
(3) Exception for side and other streets. Buildings not fronting on Avenue C and /
or Cloquet Avenue may use any materials permitted by applicable Zoning and
Building Codes, provided they are durable and properly maintained at all
times.
(4) Exception for residential buildings. Buildings fronting on Avenue C and / or
Cloquet Avenue that are residential in character or use may use materials that
will reflect that character. For example, vinyl lap siding may substitute for
wood lap siding, provided such material complies with Subd. 6 above.
(5) Accessory structures. Mechanical systems shall be integrated into the design
of the building. Trash storage areas that are visible from a public roadway
shall be completely enclosed or incorporated as part of the building.
Accessory buildings shall be designed to be compatible with the principal
building in color, architectural style, building materials, etc.
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 124
(6) Any outdoor storage of materials and merchandise shall be screened from
public view with a fence, wall, or other enclosure, or vegetative screening.
B. Doors and Windows. Buildings shall relate to people at all publicly visible sides. A
back door appearance for service areas and rear entrances from parking lots shall be
eliminated or prohibited.
(1) Facades facing streets or public walkways shall be articulated with windows
and doors resulting in a minimum of forty percent (40%) window or door area
at street level (sidewalk to twelve (12) feet high).
(2) Windows shall have a generally vertical orientation, and shall consist of
transparent glass if located at street level. Mirrored glass at street level shall
not be permitted.
(3) Entries shall be designed to be the highlight of the building.
(4) Original window and door openings shall be retained in the case of existing
buildings, unless security and functional issues require a change. New doors
will be allowed as long as the design complements the overall architectural
style of the building. New windows shall have similar mullion arrangement to
the original windows. Newer types of windows, such as casement windows,
shall not replace original double-hung windows.
C. Colors. Colors should be selected from historic analysis of what is found at each site
and architectural feature. They should be from a palette of base colors that are earth
tones with accent colors that are earth tones or complimentary highlights. Color
selections shall be governed as follows:
(1) Selection shall be from historical color palettes available from all paint
manufacturers.
(2) For painted buildings, subdued colors shall be used because the sheer mass of
a building will make the color appear considerably brighter than on a small
paint chip.
(3) Use of a multi-colored paint scheme is encouraged where the various colors
will highlight ornate architectural detailing.
(4) Large expanses of white or light colored walls shall not be allowed.
D. Details and Restoration. Each property is a unique example of physical features, time
and use. Therefore, restoration of any original architectural detailing that has been
removed from a building, or covered over, shall be a priority. The following rules
shall govern:
(1) Distinctive features, finishes and craftsmanship that specially characterize a
property shall be preserved.
(2) Deteriorated features shall be repaired rather than replaced. If replacement is
necessary, it shall be selective rather than total, and be substantiated by
documented evidence of what was authentically present.
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 125
(3) Changes that create a false sense of history, or copy elements from nearby or
similar buildings shall be prohibited. Colonial details, for example, are almost
always inappropriate, since they do not represent the history of the districts.
(4) Cleaning shall be done by the gentlest means possible. Chemical treatments
and sandblasting shall be avoided, unless it can be conclusively shown that
such treatment will not be harmful.
(5) New work. Additions or alterations shall not destroy the historic materials that
characterize the property, and shall be differentiated from the old, yet shall be
compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features of the
original structure. Such work shall be applied such that, if removed in the
future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and
environment will be maintained.
(6) Changes to buildings that have acquired historic significance in their own
right may be retained and preserved.
E. Signs and Awnings. The following standards shall supersede and, where necessary,
substitute for the provisions found in Section 17.5.13: Signs.
(1) Canvas awnings in the West End Business District or extension of the roof
material, for awnings are encouraged. Nylon awnings, or other synthetic
materials, as well as those awning structures meant to be illuminated from
within, are prohibited. Awnings may be continuous only across storefronts
occupied by a single tenant. They shall not be allowed to extend across the
face of more than one building, even if the buildings are occupied by the same
tenant. Back lit awning signs are permitted if well designed and in keeping
with the character of the building. These requirements do not apply to the
Downtown Business District.
(2) Signs shall be incorporated into the building façade, windows or awnings, and
shall not exceed one (1) square foot of signs area per lineal foot of street
frontage façade (exception buildings located on corner lots as defined in
17.1.05 Subd. 69 or that have corner visibility exposure and are not
significantly setback from the street or sidewalk grid may be allowed a second
building sign that is held to the maximum size of what is allowed on the
primary or main building face and will be located on the building in
accordance with 17.5.13, Signs, Subd.8, Subp. A (1) d). Signs projecting over
the sidewalk may be permitted as a second sign, and must be perpendicular to
the building front, or be part of a marquee complying with Section 17.5.13:
Signs. Projecting signs shall be no larger than six (6) square feet in sign area.
Window signs must maintain seventy percent (70%) of clear window area in
the surface of the window. One sign will be permitted for each public entry
(exception: signs that are part of an awning, or within or part of a window, are
encouraged and will not be counted in determining the number of signs
allowed)
(3) Tenant signs in multi-tenant buildings shall be no larger than three (3) square
feet of sign area per tenant at each public entrance
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 126
(4) Temporary signs up to a maximum of six (6) square feet in area may be
permitted for up to twenty-one (21) successive days. One such sign may be
permitted per business, and may cover up to fifty percent (50%) of the total
window area if placed in a window. Such signs shall not be placed in a public
right-of-way, nor be attached to a building.
(5) Ground signs may be allowed to a maximum size of one half (1/2) square foot
of sign area per lineal foot of street facing façade on each of two sign faces.
Ground signs shall not exceed a height of seven (7) feet. Pylon or similar freestanding
signs are prohibited.
(6) All buildings must be identified at each public entrance with its full street
address in numbers no smaller than two (2) inches nor larger than four (4)
inches in height. This signage shall not be included in the total signage
allowed.
(7) Building mounted signs may not exceed the height of the building on which
mounted. Signs may not be mounted on top of the roof of the building.
Subd. 7 Landscaping and Lighting Standards
A. All open areas of properties not used for buildings, off street parking, access drives,
plazas or storage shall be landscaped with combination of conifers and deciduous
trees, shrubs, flowers, ground covers and grass. Properties without open areas and / or
off street parking shall be exempt from such landscaping requirement. Landscape
plans shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect or other professional
possessing equivalent expertise by training or experience, for all development
projects valued at $50,000 or more. A landscape architect, or other professional, is
not required, but is encouraged, for projects valued at less than $50,000. All
landscaping shall be in accordance with the following minimum standards:
(1) Maintenance of landscaped areas shall consist of all acts necessary to ensure
that areas remain useable as originally designed and that no hazards, nuisances
or unhealthy conditions exist. The property owner shall be responsible for all
such maintenance.
(2) Credit may be given for existing trees, buffers or other landscape materials,
provided they are maintained in accordance with Subd. 7, A above. The City
Planner/Zoning Administrator, upon receipt of a written request and submittal
of a survey of existing trees, landscaping or buffers, may waive the
landscaping requirements to the degree that the waiver is consistent with the
intent of this Chapter.
(3) Certain types of stormwater improvements that are landscaping in nature may
qualify for stormwater utility credit (to be evaluated by City Engineer). Listed
below are certain stormwater best management practices that meet the citys
landscaping requirements these areas are not required to be irrigated:
(a) Rain Gardens. Residential or commercial rain gardens designed and
vegetated to capture and soak in stormwater.
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 127
(b) Green Roofs. Green roofs filter, absorb and detain rainfall. The
specialized soil and plants reduce runoff by holding back and slowing down
water that would otherwise flow into the storm drains.
(c) Ribbon Curbs. Ribbon curbs, or curbless parking areas / streets, slope
into adjacent vegetated areas and allow rain from paved areas to drain into
rain gardens or vegetated swales. By eliminating curbs and gutters, there are
fewer infrastructure costs and water can drain into the structure and soak into
the ground.
(4) Plant materials shall be provided along property lines, within separation areas
in parking areas, and in similar open areas as follows:
a. Side and rear yards abutting parking areas shall be screened at a
minimum of fifty percent (50%) opacity to a height of twenty-eight
(28) to thirty-six (36) inches;
b. Trees shall be planted to provide a shade canopy within, throughout
and along the edges of off-street parking areas. Such trees shall be
arranged in landscaped islands at least four (4) feet wide to break up
the expanse of the parking area in a defined manner, with a goal of
achieving fifteen percent (15%) shade coverage when the trees reach
maturity; and
c. Plantings shall not block important architectural, historic or natural
features on the site or on adjacent property, nor shall they block the
line of sight at driveway access points.
(5) Minimum plant sizes are established as follows:
a. Canopy trees: 2.5 caliper (diameter or thickness)
@ 6 above ground
b. Understory / Evergreen trees:
Understory: 1.5 caliper (diameter or thickness)
@ 6 above ground
Evergreens: 60 in height
c. Shrubs:
Deciduous: 24 in height
Evergreen: 18 in height
Plantings in excess of the initial fifty percent (50%) of required plantings may
be of any size.
(6) All plant materials shall conform to the standards of the American Association
of Nurserymen, and be planted in accordance with the standards of the
American Institute of Architects. Plant species shall be indigent to the area
and / or of a hardiness that will assure successful growth. 17.5.15 Subd. 9:
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 128
Table: Examples of Acceptable Plantings, may be used as a guide in this
respect.
(7) No occupancy permit shall be granted for any structure or site required to
meet the provisions of this Chapter until these landscaping requirements have
been met. However, a temporary occupancy permit may be granted if the
owner provides the City with a letter of credit, performance bond, or some
other financial guarantee acceptable with the City Attorney, in an amount
equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the estimated cost of
completing the landscape work. Any improvements covered by the financial
guarantee must be completed by the owner prior to the following August 1, or
the City shall have the right to exercise said guarantee and have the work
completed.
(8) Any modification to the exterior of an existing structure, or the construction of
any new structure, or the addition to an existing structure shall require
compliance with these landscaping standards, unless exempted by Subd. 7, A
above. The minimum amount of landscaping shall equal at least three (3)
percent of the project cost, or be measured at a ratio of one (1) square foot of
landscaping for each ten (10) square feet of new development. Whichever
formula results in the greater amount of landscaping shall govern.
B. Parking lot and yard lighting shall be of a similar, though not necessarily identical,
style as the street lighting within the district. Within each property, lighting shall be
of the same height, pole type and color, fixture type and wattage, and mounting
height and levels if mounted on the building.
Subd. 8 Review Procedure. Any proposed improvement project subject to compliance with
these design standards, and valued at one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, shall
require plan review and approval by the Cloquet Planning Commission before a building
permit for the project shall be issued. Any project valued at less than one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000) shall be reviewed for compliance with these regulations by the City
Planner/Zoning Administrator.
Appeals of City Planner/Zoning Administrator decisions may be made to the Planning
Commission in accordance with Section 17.2.12: Appeals, of this Chapter. Variances of these
rules may be filed in accordance with Section 17.2.11: Variance, of this Chapter. Variances
shall be granted only upon finding that the proposed variance is consistent with the purpose
and intent of these Standards. Cost of compliance by itself, with no additional reasoning,
shall not be a valid reason for granting a variance.
17.5.15 Design Standards for the Highway 33 Corridor
Subd. 1 Intent. The intent of this Section is to provide design standards that will establish
and enhance an architectural character for the Trunk Highway 33 Commercial Corridor. The
communitys image on Highway 33 must be tied to the character of development that occurs
along the corridor. These Standards are intended to define that character, and are intended to
implement the communitys vision for the Highway 33 Corridor as articulated in the
Community Revitalization Master Plan of 1998. These Standards shall be applicable to all
new construction and uses of land, and to any remodeling, additions and / or renovations to
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 129
and of existing development, which takes place after the effective date of adoption of these
standards. Additions, alterations or repairs may be made to any building or structure without
requiring the existing building or structure to comply with all the requirements of this
Section, provided the addition, alteration or repair conforms to that required for a new
building or structure. Existing buildings, where the siding material is not in conformance
with these standards, may have such non-conforming material replaced with similar material,
provided such replacement does not constitute more than fifty percent (50%) of the area of
the wall on which it is located. Replacement of more than fifty percent (50%) shall require
that all of the material on that wall shall be replaced with conforming materials.
Subd. 2 District Boundaries. These Standards shall apply to all lands located within the
Highway 33 Corridor which are zoned commercial. The Highway 33 Corridor extends from
the intersection with Interstate 35 on the south, to the north City limits. The corridor shall not
extend more than one quarter mile to the east or west of the highway. The area lying within
the West End and Downtown Business District shall be exempted from these standards, since
that area is covered by its own standards as stipulated in Section 17.5.14 of this Chapter.
Subd. 3 General Provisions
A. Buildings in the Highway 33 Corridor shall be designed to reflect a sense of
permanence. New buildings, and additions to existing buildings, may be of steel
frame, wood frame, masonry or concrete. They shall have an exterior façade of
primarily masonry, concrete, brick or EIFS (exterior insulating finish system, or
stucco), and may have metal or wood trim. Metal buildings may be allowed, provided
exterior facades which can be viewed from a public way (i.e. public or private
roadway) are at least fifty percent (50%) masonry, concrete, brick, EIFS or wood. If
all sides of a building can be viewed from a public way, a minimum of two (2) sides
of the building shall have exterior facades constructed to this standard. Heavy
vegetative screening may substitute on the remaining two sides, subject to compliance
with all other requirements of this Section. New buildings should be designed
whenever possible to maximize land utilization. The concrete block or metal building
pillbox must be avoided. Exceptions will be allowed for high quality synthetic
material that mimics brick, masonry or other appearance as approved by the City
Planner/Zoning Administrator. Materials must be durable and properly maintained at
all times.
B. Buildings shall be designed to relate to people at all publicly visible sides. Buildings
shall be scaled to pedestrians, with architectural elements designed to establish some
rhythm and relief. Single block form buildings, or the white concrete block look,
shall be avoided, and the forms shall be broken into smaller increments. Exterior
materials shall be muted in color, and shall be of brick, stone or other long lasting
material. Windows will be strongly encouraged, and should be positioned to allow
views into and out of the building. Canvas awnings should be considered to add detail
and interest to the façade.
C. Development shall be designed to have the appearance of being carved from the
forest. The design of the site shall have equal importance to the design of the
buildings. Buildings shall be sited relatively close to the street and property lines to
define the street edge. Dense plant material shall be used as buffers along the sides.
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 130
Parking shall be primarily located to the sides or rear of the building, with limited
parking allowed in the front. Strict and careful attention shall be made to landscaping
and site design to achieve these ends.
D. Formula and corporate architecture, franchise patterns and buildings that are
designed as signs shall be strongly discouraged.
Subd. 4 Dimensional Standards. Building height, lot area, bulk and yard setback
requirements shall be those set forth in Section 17.6.24: Tabulation of Dimensional and
Special Requirements for Zoning Districts, with the following exceptions:
A. Setback at Front Yard: Thirty-five (35) feet minimum; one hundred (100) feet
maximum for buildings under twenty thousand (20,000) square feet; one hundredfifty
(150) feet maximum for buildings twenty thousand (20,000) square feet and
larger. In designing the site layout, the established setbacks of neighboring properties
should be used as a guideline and followed as closely as possible.
B. Minimum Street Frontage Build-Out. (That portion of the primary street frontage
which must have a majority of the primary structure touching the setback line):
(1) Sunnyside area of Highway 33 North  forty percent (40%)
(2) Remainder of Highway 33 Corridor  thirty percent (30%)
Exception: Development proposals which cannot meet the above build-out standard
will require special review by the Planning Commission to assure that compliance
with the goals of this Section and the Community Revitalization Master Plan of 1998
will be achieved.
C. Building footprint size for the primary structure on each site: one thousand (1,000)
square feet minimum; seventy thousand (70,000) square feet maximum. Proposals to
develop large lots with relatively small buildings (i.e. with less than ten percent
(10%) lot coverage) shall require review of the development plan by the Planning
Commission to assure compliance with the goals of this Section and the Community
Revitalization Master Plan of 1998. A phased development plan may be required to
show how compliance will be achieved at a future date.
D. Complexes, or planned developments, of more than one building sized at the
maximum allowed footprint may be permitted if designed in accordance with these
Standards, and provided the maximum lot coverage stipulated in Section 17.6.12:
Regional (Highway) Commercial District, is not exceeded. Buildings over seventy
thousand (70,000) square feet may be permitted subject to issuance of a Conditional
Use Permit as stipulated in Section 17.2.10, provided the overall development plan is
consistent with these Standards and the general provisions of this Chapter.
Subd. 5 Parking Standards. General off street parking requirements shall be as specified in
Section 17.5.11 of this Chapter. Parking standards specific to the Highway 33 Corridor shall
be as follows:
A. Sites shall be designed to facilitate the location of off street parking in the side and
rear yards. Parking spaces located in the front yard shall be buffered from the street
with appropriate landscaped screening, and shall be designed with amenities to reduce
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 131
the visual impact. Examples include, but are not limited to, breaking up the expanse
of the parking lot with landscaped islands, decorative lighting designs and patterns,
decorative paving materials and layout, etc.
B. Parking areas adjacent to street intersections shall be prohibited, unless buffered
landscaping and appropriate setbacks are provided.
C. Parking areas and access drives shall not be placed closer than ten (10) feet to any
building, and not closer than ten (10) feet to a public sidewalk or street. Interior walk
ways and landscaping shall be installed within those separation areas. A visual barrier
shall be installed between parking areas and public rights-of-way that consist of
landscaping or ornamental fencing (no berms) that is at least fifty percent (50%)
opaque to a height of twenty-eight (28) to thirty-six (36) inches in all seasons. For
very large parking areas, the accumulated additional separation may be located in a
median between two rows of parking.
D. Joint-use parking facilities that balances high peak and off peak parking demand, and
shares spaces between adjacent properties, shall be encouraged. Trade-offs in the
required number of off street parking spaces may be considered between adjacent
properties where joint-use parking is factored into the site design (e.g. a movie
theaters parking being available to serve a nearby office use during the theaters nonpeak
hours).
E. A goal of these Standards is to achieve fifteen percent (15%) shaded coverage of
parking areas with mature trees. Calculations for such coverage shall be based upon
noontime shade measurements. Landscaping plans shall incorporate this goal into the
overall design. Lesser coverage may be considered if the landscaping plan shows that
fifteen percent (15%) coverage is not necessary to achieve the general goals of this
Section.
F. Access to off street parking areas and sites shall be from side streets or frontage roads
only. Direct access from Highway 33 shall not be allowed except in the Sunnyside
area of Highway 33 North, and in that area such access shall be restricted to right turn
in and out designs that comply with MnDOT standards. The Sunnyside area is
bounded by the St. Louis River on the south and by Adams Street on the north.
Subd. 6 Architectural Standards. The Cloquet Community Revitalization Master Plan of
1998 shall be the starting point for building and site design in the Highway 33 Corridor. New
construction shall incorporate the general design principles found in Chapter IV, Design
Guidelines, and in particular shall follow the guidelines found in Sections 17.2.01: General
Provisions and 17.2.02: Zoning Permit, and following, as they apply to the Highway 33
Corridor. Additional, specific standards shall apply as follows:
A. Materials. The use of quality building materials and methods to create an enduring
stock of buildings shall be required. Materials shall be durable, easily maintained,
attractive at close distances and scaled to pedestrians (i.e. jumbo brick or block is to
be avoided). Acceptable primary exterior finish materials shall include: brick, stone,
decorative concrete block, EIFS and precast concrete. Wood, high quality metal
(matte finish) or synthetic materials may be acceptable as secondary, trim or accent
materials used in combination with a primary material as listed above, provided they
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 132
do not exceed fifty percent (50%) of any exterior façade which is visible from a
public way. Exceptions will be allowed for high quality synthetic material that
mimics brick, masonry, etc. Materials must be durable and properly maintained at all
times.
B. Doors and Windows. Buildings shall relate to people at all publicly visible sides. A
back door appearance for service areas and rear entrances from parking lots shall be
eliminated or prohibited. Facades facing streets or public walkways shall be
articulated with windows and doors. Entries shall be designed to be the highlight of
the building.
C. Colors. Colors shall be selected from a palette of base colors that are earth tones.
Accent colors shall be earth tones or complimentary highlights. For painted buildings,
subdued colors shall be used because the sheer mass of the building will make the
color appear considerably brighter than on a small paint chip. Large expanses of
white or light colored walls shall not be allowed.
D. Signs. The following standards shall supersede and, where necessary, substitute for
the provisions found in Section 17.5.13, Signs, of this Chapter.
(1) Signs shall be incorporated into the building façade, windows or awnings.
Signs shall not exceed one (1) square foot of sign area per lineal foot of lot
width at the street frontage, or ten percent (10%) of the front exterior façade
area of the principle building, whichever is less. Signs may be part of a
marquee complying with Section 17.5.13: Signs. Window signs must maintain
seventy percent (70%) of clear window area in the surface of the window. No
more than one sign shall be allowed, except as provided in subpart 3 below.
(2) Each tenant, or business, in a multi-tenant building, or building with more
than one business, may be allowed one sign complying with the standards in
Subd. 6, A above. The area of the sign shall be based upon the square footage
of the exterior façade, or storefront face, occupied by the tenant, not the entire
building. Tenants without exterior façade or storefront face may have a sign
not exceeding fifty (50) square feet in area.
(3) It is the intent of these Standards to reduce the amount of overhead clutter that
interferes with the view of the forest. Therefore, tall post or pylon signs will
be discouraged. Ground signs are encouraged in lieu of such pylon signs. A
pylon sign may be allowed as a second sign. The size of the sign shall be
limited to one-half (1/2) square foot of sign face area per lineal foot of lot
width facing the street on each of two signs faces. Pylon sign height shall not
exceed twenty-five (25) feet for developments of less than fifty thousand
(50,000) square feet, and thirty (30) feet for developments fifty thousand
(50,000) square feet and larger. Ground sign height shall not exceed seven (7)
feet.
(4) Signs shall be designed to be complimentary to the principle building
architecture and approved color scheme. Sign design and color shall be part of
the plan review process stipulated in Subd. 9 herein.
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 133
E. Accessory Structures. Mechanical systems shall be integrated into the design of the
building. All dumpsters, trash cans, incinerators, exterior storage, etc. shall be
screened from public view with a fence, wall or other enclosure six (6) feet in height
with a minimum of ninety percent (90%) opacity, unless contained within a
completely enclosed building. Accessory buildings shall be designed to be
compatible with the principle building in color, architectural style, building materials,
etc.
Subd. 7 Landscaping and Lighting Standards
A. All landscaping within the Highway 33 Corridor shall be guided by the concept of
development being carved from the forest, as articulated in the Cloquet Community
Revitalization Master Plan of 1998 (see pages 55 and 60 thereof). In other words,
plantings of indigenous species shall be arranged in a manner reflective of a forest
environment. The planting layout shall be designed accordingly (i.e. clustering of
plants shall be employed, as well as buffer yards along property lines, etc.). Open
areas shall be strategically designed and placed on the property to complement, buffer
and shade buildings, off street parking areas, access drives, storage areas, etc. in
accordance with the above, and with the minimum standards set forth below.
Landscape plans shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect or other
professional possessing equivalent expertise by training or experience, for all
development projects valued at fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or more. A landscape
architect, or other professional, is not required, but is encouraged, for projects valued
at less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).
These landscaping standards shall apply to all new construction, and to all
remodeling, additions and / or renovations of existing development, which takes place
after the effective date of adoption of these standards. In the case of existing
development, the measure of required landscaping shall be based upon the amount of
new construction only, as per subpart 10 below, and shall not be retroactively
applied.
(1) Maintenance of landscaped areas shall consist of all acts necessary to ensure
that areas remain useable as originally designed and that no hazards, nuisances
or unhealthy conditions exist. The property owner shall be responsible for all
such maintenance.
(2) Credit may be given for existing trees, buffers or other landscape materials,
provided they are maintained in accordance with subpart 1 above. The Zoning
Administrator, upon receipt of a written request and submittal of a survey of
existing trees, landscaping or buffers, may waive the landscaping
requirements to the degree that the waiver is consistent with the intent of this
Chapter.
(3) Certain types of stormwater improvements that are landscaping in nature may
qualify for stormwater utility credit (to be evaluated by City Engineer). Listed
below are certain stormwater best management practices that meet the citys
landscaping requirements:
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 134
(a) Rain Gardens. Residential or commercial rain gardens designed and
vegetated to capture and soak in stormwater.
(b) Green Roofs. Green roofs filter, absorb and detain rainfall. The
specialized soil and plants reduce runoff by holding back and slowing down
water that would otherwise flow into the storm drains.
(c) Ribbon Curbs. Ribbon curbs, or curbless parking areas / streets, slope into
adjacent vegetated areas and allow rain from paved areas to drain into rain
gardens or vegetated swales. By eliminating curbs and gutters, there are fewer
infrastructure costs and water can drain into the structure and soak into the
ground.
(4) Plant materials shall be provided along property lines, within separation areas
in parking areas, and in similar open areas as follows:
a. Side and rear yards shall be buffered with dense plant materials to
delineate boundaries and screen parking and outside storage areas;
b. The front yard shall be landscaped to define the street edge and
provide a visual framework for the buildings. Where parking is located
in the front yard, additional landscaping shall be required to screen
objectionable elements of such.
c. Trees shall be planted to provide a shade canopy within, throughout
and along the edges of off street parking areas which are more than
one hundred (100) feet wide at any dimension or which can
accommodate fifty (50) or more vehicles. Such trees shall be arranged
in landscaped islands at least four (4) feet wide to break up the
expanse of the parking area in a defined manner, with a goal of
achieving fifteen percent (15%) shade coverage when the trees reach
maturity; and
d. Plantings shall be utilized so as to frame and enhance denoted view
corridors and vistas, and shall not block important architectural,

17.5.16 Wireless Communication Facilities.
Subd. 1 Intent. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued wireless
communication licenses for personal communications services and other wireless
technologies in order for those license holders to provide wireless services throughout the
United States. The growing demand from citizens and businesses for new wireless
communications services has produced an increased need for the installation of wireless
communication facilities. The location, siting, design and construction of wireless
communication facilities can have adverse impacts on celestial observation and the
surrounding area. The City of Cloquet therefore finds that it is necessary to adopt regulations
that will accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while protecting
the health, safety and welfare. These regulations will also minimize adverse visual effects of
wireless facilities through careful design and siting standards, avoid potential hazards or
damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards and setback
requirements, maximize the use of existing and approved towers and structures for new
wireless communication antennas, and reduce the number of towers needed to serve the area.

Per MN Rule 7082.0040, Subp. 2, Carlton County Planning and Zoning Department administers
subsurface sewage treatment requirements for the City of Cloquet, MN.
17.5.18 Floodplain Regulations
Subd. 1 Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact and Purpose.
A. Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota
Statutes Chapters 103F and Chapter (394 for counties or 462 for municipalities)
delegated the authority to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 144
minimize flood losses. Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 103F further stipulates that
communities subject to recurrent flooding must participate and maintain eligibility in
the National Flood Insurance Program. Therefore the City Council, City of Cloquet,
Minnesota does ordain as follows:
B. Statement of Purpose. The purpose of this Ordinance is to maintain the communitys
eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and to minimize potential losses
due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
C. Warning or Disclaimer of Liability. This Ordinance does not imply that areas outside
of the floodplain district or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from
flooding and flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of
the City of Cloquet or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decisions lawfully made
thereunder.
Subd. 2 General Provisions.
A. Adoption of Flood Insurance Rate Map. The Flood Insurance Rate Map for the City
of Cloquet, dated September 27, 1991, developed by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) is hereby adopted by reference as the Official
Floodplain Zoning District Map and made a part of this Ordinance. This map was
previously entitled the Flood Hazard Boundary map dated April 23, 1982.
B. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies. This Ordinance shall apply to all lands
designated as floodplain within the jurisdiction of the City of Cloquet.
C. Interpretation. The boundaries of the floodplain district shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Official Floodplain Zoning District Map. Where interpretation is
needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the floodplain district, the City of
Cloquet City Planner/Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation
based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, if available. If 100-year
flood elevations are not available, the community shall: 1) require a floodplain
evaluation consistent with Subd. 4, C of this Section to determine a 100-year flood
elevation for the site; or 2) base its decision on available hydraulic / hydrologic or site
elevation survey data which demonstrates the likelihood the site is within or outside
of the floodplain.
D. Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
Ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in
common usage and so as to give this Section its most reasonable application.

projection, excavation, dredged spoil, channel modification, culvert, building,
wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, stockpile of sand or gravel or
other material, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel,
watercourse, lake bed, or regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard, or
change the direction of flow, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris
carried by floodwater.
(7) Regional Flood. A regional flood is a flood which is representative of large
floods known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably
characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in
magnitude of the 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous
with the term base flood used in the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(8) Regulator Flood Protection Elevation. The Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of
the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway.

17.5 Special Provisions 146
B. Compliance. No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall
be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with
the terms of this Section and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within
the jurisdiction of this Section. Within the Floodway and Flood Fringe, all uses not
listed as permitted uses in Subd. 4 in this Section shall be prohibited. In addition, a
caution is provided here that:
(1) New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain
travel trailers and travel vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this
Section and specifically Subd. 4 and Subd. 12;
(2) Modifications, additions, structural alterations or repair after damage to
existing nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of structures or
land are regulated by the general provisions of this Section and specifically
Subd. 9; and
(3) As-built elevations for elevated structures must be certified by ground surveys
as stated in Subd. 7 of this Section.
Subd. 4 Permitted Uses, Standards, and Floodplain Evaluation Criteria.
A. Permitted Uses in the Floodplain. The following uses of land are permitted uses in the
floodplain district:
(1) Any use of land which does not involve a structure, an addition to the outside
dimensions to an existing structure or an obstruction to flood flows such as
fill, excavation, or storage of materials or equipment.
(2) Any use of land involving the construction of new structures, the placement or
replacement of manufactured homes, the addition to the outside dimensions of
an existing structure or obstructions such as fill or storage of materials or

Subd. 4, B of this Section and the floodplain evaluation criteria in Subd. 4, C
of this Section for determining floodway and flood fringe boundaries.
(3) Travel trailers and travel vehicles are regulated by Subd. 12 of this Section.
B. Standards for Floodplain Permitted Uses.
(1) Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by
the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation  FEMAs
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards
should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
(2) Storage of Materials and Equipment.
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.5 Special Provisions 147
a. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding,
flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or

shall notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) the issuance of a variance to construct
a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and 2) such
construction below the 100-year or regional flood level increases risks of life and
property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its
annual or biennial report submitted to the Administrator of the Natural Flood
Insurance Program.
Subd. 9 Nonconformities. A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful

Administrator and Local Government may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions,
after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a request to the National

construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or approval is
granted by the Community. If the construction of development is already completed,
then the City Planner/Zoning Administrator may either 1) issue an order identifying
the corrective actions that must be made within a specified time period to bring the
use or structure into compliance with the official controls, or 2) notify the responsible
party to apply for an after-the-fact permit / development approval within a specified

17.6.03 FR - Farm Residential District.
Subd. 1 Intent. Many areas within corporate limits are not yet urbanized, unsuitable for
development because of drainage or terrain, or used for agricultural purposes. It is not good
planning to allow unrestrained growth where it is not feasible to provide sewer and water
services, efficient police and fire protection and other centralized municipal services. The FR
District is essentially a holding district that includes land that should be managed through
conservation measures, land suitable for limited agriculture activities and land suitable for
urban development at some future time when the City would rezone it to a more intensive use
according to a sound growth plan. The developer would be responsible for showing good
land use relationships that would not burden the City with unreasonable municipal services
expense. However pursuant to authority granted by Minnesota Statutes, Section 462.3593,
subdivision 9, the City of Cloquet opts-out of the requirements of Minn. Stat. 462.3593,
which defines and regulates Temporary Family Health Care Dwellings.
Subd. 2 Permitted Uses. The following uses shall be permitted as regulated herein, without
special application requirements or conditions attached:

Development Plan. The character of the R-3 District should remain essentially residential;
however, provisions are made for conditionally permitting transitional office and service uses
which relate reasonably to multiple family structures and are pedestrian rather than
automobile oriented in function. However pursuant to authority granted by Minnesota

Subd. 6 Special District Provisions.
A. General Guidelines for Industrial Uses in the District. The City Council of the
City of Cloquet recognizes that a variety of industrial uses exists in the CC
District. Guidelines for continuation and / or expansion of industrial uses in the
district are as follows:
(1) Existing industrial uses that are not compatible with the vision of the area
as expressed in the Citys Comprehensive Plan (for example, a heavy
manufacturing use) should be encouraged to relocate to an appropriate
industrial district in the city. However, under unique conditions, expansion
or improvements to existing industrial uses may be considered pursuant to
the Conditional Use Permit procedures pursuant to Section 17.2.10.
(2) Existing industrial uses that are compatible with the city center area (for
example, a relatively clean and quiet light manufacturing use) may be
allowed to continue (and possibly expand) if the use does not adversely
affect the neighborhood and is consistent with the vision of the City as
expressed in the Comprehensive Plan).
(3) New industrial uses in the district are not anticipated. However, in unique
situations the City Council may find that it is in the best interest of the city
center and the overall community to allow the replacement of existing,
more intense industrial uses with appropriate light manufacturing, research
and development, or similar industrial uses that have less of an adverse
impact on the surrounding area.
City of Cloquet: Chapter 17 Zoning
17.6 Zoning Districts 192
(4) In general, industrial uses should be limited to arterial or collector streets,
or to areas where there is a distinct cluster of appropriate industrial uses.
B. Parking. The parking provisions of this Chapter are modified as follows to carry
out the intent of the CC District. Existing buildings are exempt from off street
parking requirements: Also see Section 17.5.14 Subd. 5.

between building façade and the front lot line or street right-of-way. Nor
shall off-street parking be located less than five (5) feet from any property
line except as provided through access drives or by shared or joint parking
agreements as permitted in this Chapter.
(2) Required Screening. Any off-street parking space or parking lot that abuts
a street right-of-way shall be buffered from the right-of-way by a
landscaped area no less than five (5) feet wide in which is located in a
continuous row of shrubs no less than three and one half (3 ½) feet high,
or by a wall no less than four (4) feet and no more than six (6) feet high, in
addition to any required shade trees.
(3) Exception and Alternatives to Off-Street Parking Requirements. The City
Council may allow exceptions and alternatives to the off-street parking
requirements as follows:
a. Parking Reduction. The City Council may allow a reduction in the
number of required parking stalls provided the property owner
enters into a development contract and the following criteria are
met:
1. Evidence is provided that demonstrates the proposed use
will have a peak parking demand less than the required
parking of this Chapter. Factors to be considered when
reviewing the proposed parking demand shall include, but
not limited to the following:
 Size of building.
 Type and use.
 Number of employees.
 Projected volume and turnover of traffic.
 Projected frequency and volume of delivery or
service vehicles.
 Number of company owned vehicles.

17.6 Zoning Districts 193
pursuant to the joint and off-site parking provisions of this
Chapter as described below.
3. The property owner can demonstrate that the site has
sufficient area to accommodate the parking required by the
Chapter if the parking demand exceeds on-site supply. The
property owner shall enter into a development contract with
the City guaranteeing that additional parking shall be
constructed in accordance with this Chapter if the actual
site parking demand exceeds on-site supply.
b. Joint Parking Facilities. The City Council may approve a
Conditional Use Permit for one or more uses to provide the
required off-street parking facilities by joint use of one or more
sites where the total number of spaces provided are less than the
sum of the total required for each business should they provide
them separately. Conditions to be considered when reviewing the
proposed joint parking facilities shall include, but not be limited to
the following:
1. The building or use for which the application is being made
to utilize the off-street parking facilities provided by
another building or use shall be located within three
hundred (300) feet of such parking facilities.

on-site parking is provided or a site located closer to the
principal use is acquired and developed for parking.
4. Compliance with off-street parking requirements provided
through leased off-street parking may be approved by the
City Council, subject to the following conditions:
 The lease shall specify the total number and
location of parking spaces under contract and this
number, when added to any on-site parking
provided, must be equal to the total number of
parking spaces required.
 The lease requirement shall legally bind all parties
to the lease and provide for amendment or
cancellation only upon written approval from the
City.
C. Landscaping. The landscaping provisions of this Chapter are modified as follows
to carry out the intent of the CC City Center District: Also see Section 17.5.14

Chapter are modified as follows to carryout the intent of this District.
(2) The applicant shall submit to the City a landscape plan for all site work
requiring a building permit. The plan shall identify the location and size of
both existing vegetation to be retained and proposed new vegetation,

landscaped area required. Nor shall there be a minimum amount of trees
required. However, the City shall approve the landscape plan before a
building permit can be issued.
(3) Parking lots larger than nineteen (19) spaces and / or six thousand (6,000)
square feet in size shall be provided with at least one shade tree for every
eight (8) parking spaces or fraction thereof, located in internal planting
islands and perimeter buffer strip(s) along the street edge(s) of the lot.

extraordinary limitations are imposed on a lot due to topography, unusual lot
shape, placement of existing structures, and similar conditions, adjustments in the
standard regulations will be made by issuance of a conditional use permit.

(20) acres. This limitation shall not apply when the tract of land is contiguous to
an active sand and gravel operation, provided that both tracts are being operated
by the same producer.
D. Access. The sand and gravel overlay district shall have direct access to nonresidential,
collector streets or county roads of sufficient load carry capacity to
serve traffic generated by the sand and gravel operation.
E. Environmental Impacts. An environmental assessment worksheet (as defined by
Minnesota Environmental Quality Board rules) shall be completed for each gravel
mining project proposed. The proposed project shall meet the recommended
standards provided by the mandatory environmental assessment worksheet. The
responses and recommendations of the environmental assessment worksheet shall
be considered by the City Council prior to any final action on a rezoning request.
The application for rezoning shall not be considered complete until such time as
the final comment has been received on the adequacy of the environmental
assessment worksheet.
Subd. 4 Permitted Uses. Within any SG Overlay District, uses as permitted by the
underlying zoning district shall be deemed as permitted uses until such time as a
Conditional Use Permit for sand and gravel mining and / or processing has been applied

A. Permitted Uses. Single-family detached residential dwellings, agriculture, parks, open
space, and similar and related uses are the only permitted uses in a Conservation
Subdivision Development. Commercial and industrial uses shall be prohibited.
B. Overall Density and Development Yield. The overall density for the parent parcel is
the same as would be allowed for a conventional development in the FR Farm
Residential Development District, except that the base development yield may be
increased if the development complies with one or more of the following standards.
The maximum bonus permitted is twenty (20) percent.
(1) Endowment. Creation of an endowment where the principal would generate
sufficient annual interest to cover the conservation easement holders yearly
costs relating to taxes, insurance, maintenance, enforcement, and similar
items.

CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 18 - STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
Section 18.2 Definitions 3
Subd. 14. Drainage Easement. A right to use the land of another for a specific purpose, such as a rightof-
way for the movement of water across or under the land surface or the storage of water.
Subd. 15. Erosion. Removing the surface of the land by the action of water, wind, ice, or gravity. Erosion
can be accelerated by the activities of man and nature.
Subd. 16. Erosion Control. Refers to methods employed to prevent erosion. Examples include soil
stabilization practices, horizontal slope grading, temporary or permanent cover, and construction phasing.
Subd. 17. Erosion & Sediment Control Plan (E&S Control Plan). A written description and/or plan
indicating the number, locations, sizes, and other pertinent information about best management practice
methods designed to reduce erosion of the land surface and the deposition of sediment within a waterway.
An E&S Control Plan is required as part of a Storm Water Management Plan. Both the Storm Water
Management Plan and E&S Control Plans are used in developing the State mandated Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). An E&S Control Plan may be required for certain projects not
requiring a full Storm Water Management Plan, as outlined in this ordinance or determined necessary by
the City Engineer.
Subd. 18. Exposed Soil Areas. All areas of the construction site where the vegetation (trees, shrubs,
brush, grasses, etc.) or impervious surface has been removed, thus rendering the soil more prone to erosion.
This includes topsoil stockpile areas, borrow areas and disposal areas within the construction site. It does
not include temporary stockpiles or surcharge areas of clean sand, gravel, concrete or bituminous, which
have less stringent protection. Once soil is exposed, it is considered "exposed soil," until it meets the
definition of "final stabilization."
Subd. 19. Final Stabilization. Means that all soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed,
and that a uniform (evenly distributed, e.g., without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a
density of seventy (70) percent of the cover for unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent
structures has been established, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures have been employed.
Simply sowing grass seed is not considered final stabilization. Where agricultural land is involved, such as
when pipelines are built on crop or rangeland, final stabilization constitutes returning the land to its
preconstruction agricultural use.
Subd. 20. Green Infrastructure. A wide array of practices at multiple scales that manage wet weather and
that maintain or restore natural hydrology by infiltrating, evapotranspiring, or harvesting and using storm
water. On a regional scale, green infrastructure is the preservation or restoration of natural landscape
features, such as forests, floodplains and wetlands, coupled with policies such as infill and redevelopment
that reduce overall imperviousness in a watershed. On the local scale, green infrastructure consists of site
and neighborhood-specific practices.
Subd. 21. Hydric Soils. Soils that are saturated, flooded, or ponded long enough during the growing
season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part of the soil profile.
Subd. 22. Hydrophytic Vegetation. Macrophytic (large enough to be observed by the naked eye) plant
life growing in water, soil, or on a substrate that is at least periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of
excessive water content.
Subd. 23. Impervious Area. A constructed hard surface that either prevents or retards the entry of water
into the soil, and causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities and at an increased rate of flow
than existed prior to development. Examples include rooftops, sidewalks, patios, driveways, parking lots,
storage areas; and concrete, asphalt, or gravel parking lots and roads.
Subd. 24. Illicit Connections. An illicit connection is either of the following: (1) Any drain or
conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface, that allows an illegal discharge to enter the storm sewer
system including but not limited to any conveyances that allows any non-storm water discharge including
sewage, process wastewater, and wash water to enter the storm sewer system and any connections to the
storm sewer system from indoor drains and sinks, regardless of whether said drain or connection
CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 18 - STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
Section 18.2 Definitions 4
had been previously allowed, permitted, or approved by the City OR, (2) any drain or conveyance
connected from a commercial or industrial land use to the storm sewer system that has not been
documented in plans, maps, or equivalent records and approved by the City.
Subd. 25. Illicit Discharge. (See PROHIBITED DISCHARGE).
Subd. 26. Land Use Development. The act of subdivision or platting properties for
personal use, adding value or for the purposes of resale. This includes the construction and/or demolition of
buildings, structures, roads, parking lots, paved storage areas, and similar facilities.
Subd. 27. Land Disturbing Activity. Any land change that may result in soil erosion from water or wind
and the movement of sediments into or upon waters or lands within the City's jurisdiction, including
construction, clearing & grubbing, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land. Within the context
of this ordinance, land disturbance activity does not mean:
a) Minor land disturbance activities such as home gardens and an individual's home landscaping,
repairs, and maintenance work, which will not result in sediments entering the storm water
system.
b) Additions or modifications to existing single family structures that result in creating under
five thousand (5,000) square feet of exposed soil or impervious surface and will not result in
sediments entering the storm water system.
c) Construction, installation, and maintenance of trees, fences, signs, posts, poles, and electric,
telephone, cable television, utility lines or individual service connections to these utilities,
which result in creating under five thousand (5,000) square feet of exposed soil or impervious
surface and will not result in sediments entering the storm water system.
d) Tilling, planting, or harvesting of agricultural, horticultural, or silvicultural (forestry) crops.
e) Emergency work to protect life, limb, or property and emergency repairs, unless the land
disturbing activity would have otherwise required an approved erosion and sediment control
plan, except for the emergency. If such a plan would have been required, then the disturbed
land area shall be shaped and stabilized in accordance with the City's requirements as soon as
possible.
Subd. 28. Landowner. Any person, firm, corporation or other entity holding title to or having a divided
or undivided interest in land.
Subd. 29. Local Detention. Detention intended to serve only the developing area in question and no areas
outside of the development boundaries. As such it is under the control of one owner or group of owners.
This is also known as on-site detention.
Subd. 30. Local Drainage System. The storm drainage system which transports the minor and major
storm water runoff to the major storm water system serving only the property within the development
boundaries, under the control of one owner or group of owners. This is also known as the on-site drainage
system.
Subd. 31. Management Practice. A practice or combination of practices to control erosion and water
quality degradation.
Subd. 32. Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4). A conveyance or system of
conveyances including roads with drainage systems, municipal streets, catch basins, curbs,
gutters, ditches, man-made channels, or storm drains:

Subd. 62. Storm Water Management. The planned set of public policies and activities undertaken to
regulate runoff and reduce erosion, and maintain or improve water quality under various specified
conditions within various portions of the drainage system. It may establish criteria for controlling peak
flows and/or runoff volumes, for runoff detention and retention, or for pollution control, and may specify
criteria for the relative elevations among various elements of the drainage system. Storm water
management is primarily concerned with limiting future flood damages and environmental impacts due to
development, whereas flood control aims at reducing the extent of flooding that occurs under current
conditions.

Subd. 79. Watershed Master Plan. A plan that an engineer/designer formulates to manage urban storm
water runoff for a particular project or drainage area. It typically addresses such subjects as characterization
of the existing and future site development, land use, and grading plan, peak rates of runoff, flow duration,
runoff volumes for various return frequencies, locations, criteria and sizes of detention or retention ponds
and conveyances; runoff control features; land parcels, easement locations, opinions of probable costs,
measures to enhance runoff quality, salient regulations, and how the plan addresses them, and consistency
with secondary objectives such as public recreation, aesthetics, public safety, and groundwater recharge. It
may be submitted to regulatory officials for their review for adoption.
Subd. 80. Wetland or Wetlands. (as defined in Minn. R. 7050.0130, Subp. F) and includes those areas
that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to
support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for
life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
Constructed wetlands designated for wastewater treatment are not Waters of the State. For purposes of this
definition, wetlands must have the following three attributes:
a) A predominance of hydric soils;
b) Are inundated or saturated by the surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient
to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
conditions; and
c) Under normal circumstances support the prevalence of such vegetation.

CHAPTER 18 - STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
Section 18.4 General Storm Water Practices 12
Section 18.4: General Storm Water Practices
18.4.01. General Storm Water Practices. The following general storm water management practices and erosion
control requirements shall apply to all land disturbing activities, regardless of project size and whether or not a
NPDES Permit or SWPPP is required.
Subd. 1. City Grading Permit Required. No grading or land disturbing activity shall be
performed without first having obtained a Grading Permit from the City Building Official, in
accordance with the Minnesota State Building Code, as adopted by the City of Cloquet.
Subd. 2. Land Disturbing Activity Involving the Construction of Single-Family or Two-
Family Dwellings. Construction of single family or two family dwellings must comply with in
place approved BMPs and any existing permitted SWPPP for the subdivision, including NPDES
Permit requirements and Subdivision Agreements. Upon the sale of individual lots, the new
owners shall be required to file a Subdivision Registration Form with the MPCA, which allows
the original permittee to transfer the responsibilities of the project NPDES permit for a portion of
the site to another party without reapplying for permit coverage. Each new owner must complete
this form and submit it to the MPCA and provide the assigned registration number to the City. A
City issued Grading Permit shall also be required as provided for in Section 18.4.01, Subd. 1,
above.
Subd. 3. Utility Work or Any Other Work Within Street Right-of-ways. Utility contractors working in
a street right-of-way to repair existing or install new utilities, or any other work disturbing less than one
acre, are required to provide appropriate inlet protection and sediment control during the course of the work
so as to ensure the storm sewer system is protected from pollution. The utility contractor is also required to
provide street sweeping as necessary to insure that sediment resulting from their activity does not enter the
storm water system following construction. The street shall be swept within (1) working day of completion
of all work on the site. All disturbed vegetation shall be replaced with seed or sod within seven (7) days of
completion of utility installation on the site. The City will provide guidance regarding acceptable temporary
protection BMPs for inlets and methods to stabilize the exposed soil areas until they meet the definition of
final stabilization.
Subd. 4. Erosion or Sedimentation Related to Any Activity. Any land disturbing activity, regardless of
project size, and whether conducted pursuant to this Chapter or otherwise, shall be undertaken in a manner
designed to minimize surface runoff, and to prevent erosion and sedimentation. Whenever the City
determines that any land disturbing activity on any private property has become a hazard to life or limb,
endangers the property of another, adversely affects the safety, use, slope or soil stability of a public road,
publicly controlled wetland, or watercourse, or results in sedimentation to the same, then the owner of the
property upon which the land disturbance activity is located, or other person or agent in control of said
property, upon receipt of notice in writing from the City, shall within the period specified therein, repair or
eliminate such condition.
Subd. 5. Sedimentation From Existing Facilities. For all existing home sites, commercial or industrial
developments, that are susceptible to erosion and the discharge of sediment onto or into public streets or
storm sewers, the owner shall be responsible to provide for and pay for the cost of all necessary street
sweeping and/or the removal of all discharged sediment. Furthermore, if such erosion and sedimentation
continues to reoccur, the owner shall take such measures as may be necessary to stabilize the erosion or to
otherwise provide sedimentation basins to prevent the discharge of sediment offsite or to the stormsewer
system.
Subd. 6. All storm water must be discharged in a manner that does not cause nuisance conditions, erosion
in receiving channels or on downslope or adjacent properties, or inundation in wetlands causing an adverse
impact to the wetlands.

b) Any land alterations, filling or grading that significantly retard or severely impede the drainage of
adjacent properties or cause water to backup or pond on adjacent properties.
18.4.02. Management of Site Vegetation. Any Landowner shall provide for the installation and maintenance of
vegetation on their property in accordance with the following criteria, regardless as to whether or not a Storm Water
Management Plan or Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan has been approved or is necessary under this Chapter:
Subd. 1. Unimproved Land Areas. Except for driveways, parking lots, sidewalks, patios, areas occupied
by structures, landscaped areas, natural rock outcrop areas, or areas that have been otherwise improved, all
areas shall be covered by plants or vegetative growth.

disturbing activity, or other construction activities which may result in an increase in storm water quantities,
degradation of storm water quality, or restriction of flow in any storm sewer system, open ditch or natural channel,
storm water easement, water body, or wetland outlet within the jurisdiction of the City, without having first
complied with the terms of this Chapter and the most current version of NPDES general permit for construction.
Subd. 1. For construction or development projects, or any land disturbing activity that disturbs one or
more acres of land, site owners and their construction operators must apply for coverage under the
Minnesota Pollution Control Agencys (MPCAs) NPDES permit program.
Subd. 2. SWPPP Review by City of Cloquet. Prior to submitting any NPDES permit application to the
MPCA, and prior to conducting any construction activity, a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP) must be completed and submitted to the City of Cloquet for review and approval.
Subd. 3. Submission of SWPPP to State for Permit. Following review and approval of the SWPPP by
the City, the applicant shall make application to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) for
coverage under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program and receive
a valid permit.
Subd. 4. Submission of NPDES Permit to City and Issuance of City Grading Permit. Following the
issuance of a NPDES Permit by the MPCA, the applicant shall provide a copy of the issued permit for the
project to the City. At this point the City shall issue a Grading Permit in accordance with by the Minnesota
State Building Code, as adopted by the City of Cloquet. No person shall commence construction activity
until a NPDES permit for the project is issued by the MPCA and a Grading Permit has been issued, as
required by the City of Cloquet.
Subd. 5. Other Required Permits. For certain construction or development projects, various other
permits may also be required. It shall be the Applicant's responsibility to obtain any required permits from
the City of Cloquet and other governmental agencies having any jurisdictional authority over the work to
be performed. Typically, such agencies may include, but are not limited to the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the
Minnesota Department of Transportation, the State Historical Preservation Office, and others.
18.5.02. Storm water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) Requirements. Any person, firm, sole proprietorship,
partnership, corporation, state agency, or political subdivision proposing a subdivision of land, a subdivision plat, or
any type of construction project that results in a land disturbing activity involving 1 acre or more within the City,
must submit to the City a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) for review and approval, unless an
exemption waiver is provided in accordance with this Section.
Subd. 1. The SWPPP shall be prepared in accordance with requirements of the MPCAs NPDES permit
program. These requirements shall include a drawing or drawings delineating the features incorporated
into the SWPPP, including details of perimeter protection, construction phasing, storm drain inlet
protection, erosion control measures, temporary and final stabilization measures, drainage easements and
storm water management facilities, including all BMP's to be utilized. In addition any construction
specifications for the project shall contain technical provisions describing erosion, sedimentation, and water
control measures to be utilized during and after construction as well as to define the entities responsible for
the installation and maintenance of the BMP's. The project SWPPP must be incorporated into the
construction projects specification documents.
Subd. 2. The SWPPP developed for all projects, including all plans, drawings, specifications, and
computations for storm water management facilities, shall be prepared, reviewed and signed by a
Professional Engineer registered in the State of Minnesota, except in the following cases:
All residential or non-commercial/industrial projects that include less than five acres of impervious
surface.
CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 18 - STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
Section 18.5 Construction Site Management and the NPDES Construction General Permit 15
A) All residential development projects with an ultimate planned density of less than one-half
(0.5) units per acre.
Subd. 3. The provisions of this Section shall also apply to any project site that is part of a larger Common
Plan of Development or Sale that will disturb greater than or equal to one acre.
Subd. 4. Subdivision Plat Approval and Subdivision Registration Process. No subdivision approval,
plat approval or building permit shall be issued, nor shall any land be disturbed until the SWPPP has been
approved by the City and a copy of a State issued NPDES permit for the project has been provided to the
City. Upon the sale of individual lots, the new owners shall be required to file a Subdivision Registration
Form with the MPCA, which allows the original permittee to transfer the responsibilities of the project
NPDES permit for a portion of the site to another party without reapplying for permit coverage. Each new
owner must complete this form and submit it to the MPCA and provide the assigned registration number to
the City.
Subd 5. For sites or projects that are less than one acre, but are within 100 feet of Special Waters or
Protected Waters such as Otter Creek, Fond du Lac Creek, any protected wetlands, or are within an existing
subdivision or development with documented flooding problems associated with storm water runoff, a
SWPPP shall be provided to the City in compliance with the provisions of this Section to preserve or
protect the water quality of downstream resources. In addition, a Grading permit must be obtained for all
grading projects in accordance with the Minnesota State Building Code, as adopted by the City of Cloquet.
Subd. 6. Erosion and Sediment Control. Erosion and sediment control, at a minimum, shall meet the
requirements and provisions defined in the most current MPCA NPDES General Storm Water Permit for
Construction Activities, also referred to as the NPDES Construction Permit.
Subd. 7. Storm Water Detention/Retention/Treatment Facilities. Storm Water Detention, Retention or
Treatment facilities proposed to be constructed in the Storm Water Management Plan shall be designed and
maintained according to the most current practices as reflected in the Nationwide Urban Runoff Program
study and in accordance with the MPCAs NPDES Permit requirements. All above ground Storm Water
Detention, Retention or Treatment Facilities shall have a minimum setback from all property lines as
established by the Cloquet Zoning Ordinance.
Subd. 8. Regional Ponds. Regional ponds may be used provided they are constructed ponds, (not a
natural wetland or water body) and designed in accordance with the NPDES permit program requirements
for all water from impervious surfaces that reach the pond. Permittees shall not construct regional ponds in
wetlands, regardless of their condition, quality or designation, unless such wetlands are mitigated in
accordance with applicable rules. The owner must obtain written authorization from the City or private
entity that owns and maintains the regional pond. If the City is the owner of the regional pond, the City
may apply a System Charge or Assessment that would cover a prorated share of the ponds construction
and operation and maintenance costs.
Subd. 9. Adequacy of Outlets. The adequacy of any Outlet used as a discharge point for proposed Storm
Water Management Systems must be assessed and documented to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. To
the extent practicable, hydraulic capacities of downstream natural channels, storm sewer systems, or streets
shall be evaluated to determine if they have sufficient conveyance capacity to receive and accommodate
post-development runoff discharges and volumes. In addition, projected velocities in downstream natural or
manmade channels shall not exceed that which is reasonably anticipated to cause erosion.
Subd. 10. Storm Water Discharges to Trunk Highway Right-of-Way. For development projects which
lie adjacent to trunk highway right-of-ways and include Storm Water Management Systems that will
discharge storm water onto highway right-of-way, a drainage permit must first be obtained from the
Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) prior to the City approving any SWPPP for the
project.
CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 18 - STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
Section 18.5 Construction Site Management and the NPDES Construction General Permit 16
Subd. 11. Drainage Easements and Discharges to Adjacent Property. No constructed Storm Water
Management Systems or Permanent Facilities, proposed as part of the SWPPP for a development, may
discharge storm water onto adjacent property unless a drainage easement is in place or the peak design flow
rate for the Permanent Facilities maintains the pre-development existing flow rates and hydrologic
conditions for the 2-year, 10-year, and 100-year rainfall events.
Subd. 12. Exemptions. Exemptions to the SWPPP requirements of this section include:
a) An individual SWPPP is generally not required for individual lots or properties located within
a subdivision or plat for which a SWPPP has already been approved. All construction,
however, must be in accordance with the previously permitted SWPPP for the subdivision,
including the NPDES Permit requirements and Subdivision Agreement. (See Section 18.4.02,
Subd. 4).
b) A parcel for which a building permit has been approved on/or before the effective date of this
Chapter and an NPDES permit was not required.
c) Any land disturbance activity not associated with building construction that will affect less
than 1 acre of undeveloped land.
d) Emergency work to protect life, limb, or property.
18.5.03. Plan Review.
Subd. 1. SWPPP Requirements. The SWPPP shall include all requirements of the most current NPDES
Construction Permit and address the applicable provisions of this ordinance.
a) Review and Approval of SWPPP. The City shall review and approve the proposed
development plan and SWPPP prior to the submission of an application to the MPCA for a
NPDES Permit.
b) Modification of Plan. Modifications to the SWPPP or plans shall be submitted to the City
for review and approval.
18.5.04. Inspections.
Subd. 1. Inspections By Owner, Owners Contractor or Owners Agent. In accordance with MPCA
requirements, the SWPPP for a project must identify the person responsible for the completion of routine
inspections of the site to insure compliance with the SWPPP and the effectiveness of all BMPs employed.
At a minimum, inspections of the site must take place once every seven (7) days during active construction
and within 24 hours after a rainfall event greater than 0.5 inches in 24 hours. A written record of rainfall
amounts received onsite, as well as a written record of all inspections and maintenance conducted during
construction must be maintained by the responsible person and be made available to the City upon request.
Subd. 2. City inspections. The City may conduct inspections on a regular basis to monitor erosion and
sediment control practices. In all cases the inspectors will attempt to work with the builder or developer to
maintain proper erosion and sediment control at all sites. In cases where cooperation is withheld,
construction stop work orders may be issued by the City until erosion and sediment control measures meet
the requirements of this ordinance. Inspections as defined in this provision do not fulfill the inspections
and maintenance requirements of the owner and/or contractor as required by the NPDES Construction
Permit Program and Subdivision 1 of this Section.
Subd 3. Notification of Failure of the SWPPP. The City may notify the permit holder of the failure of
the SWPPPs measures.
CITY OF CLOQUET - CITY CODE
CHAPTER 18 - STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
Section 18.5 Construction Site Management and the NPDES Construction General Permit 17
a. Initial contact. The initial contact will be to the party or parties listed on the application
and/or the SWPPP as contacts. Except during an emergency action, forty-eight (48) hours
after notification by the City or seventy-two (72) hours after the failure of erosion control
measures, whichever is less, the City at its discretion, may begin corrective work. Such
notification should be in writing, but if it is verbal, a written notification should follow as
quickly as practical. If after making a good faith effort to notify the responsible party or
parties, the City has been unable to establish contact, the City may proceed with corrective
work. There are conditions when time is of the essence in controlling erosion. During such a
condition the City may take immediate action, and then notify the applicant as soon as
possible.
b. Erosion off-site. If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the applicant shall immediately
develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain the right-of-entry from the adjoining property
owner, and implement the cleanup and restoration plan within forty-eight (48) hours of
obtaining the adjoining property owners permission. In no case, unless written approval is
received from the City, may more than seven (7) calendar days go by without corrective
action being taken. If in the discretion of the City, the permit holder does not repair the
damage caused by the erosion, the City may do the remedial work required. When restoration
to wetlands and other resources are required, the applicant should be required to work with
the appropriate agency to ensure that the work is done properly.
c. Erosion into streets, wetlands or water bodies. If eroded soils (including tracked soils from
construction activities) enter or appear likely to enter streets, wetlands, or other water bodies,
cleanup and repair shall be immediate. The applicant shall provide all traffic control and
flagging required to protect the traveling public during the cleanup operations.
d. Failure to do corrective work. When an applicant fails to conform to any provision of this
policy within the time stipulated, the City may take the following actions.
1) Issue a stop work order, withhold the scheduling of inspections, and/or the issuance
of a Certificate of Occupancy.
2) Revoke any permit issued by the City to the applicant for the site in question or any
other of the applicants sites within the Citys jurisdiction.
3) If circumstances exist such that noncompliance with this ordinance poses an
immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare, as determined by the City,
the City may take emergency preventative action to correct the deficiency or hire a
contractor to correct the deficiency. The issuance of a permit constitutes a right-ofentry
for the City or its contractor to enter upon the construction site for the purpose
of correcting deficiencies in erosion control.
4) Require reimbursement to the City for all costs incurred in correcting storm water
pollution control deficiencies. If payment is not made within sixty (60) days after
costs are incurred by the City, then the City may assess the remaining amount against
the property. As a condition of the permit, the owner shall waive notice of any
assessment hearing to be conducted by the City, concur that the benefit to the
property exceeds the amount of the proposed assessment, and waive all rights by
virtue of Minnesota Statute 429.081 to challenge the amount or validity of such
assessment costs related to cleanup or corrective actions taken by the City.

a) Exceptions. A lesser volume control standard on the site of the original construction activity
may be applied, at the discretion of the city, under the following circumstances:
1) The owner and/or operator of a construction activity is precluded from infiltrating
storm water due to limitations under Subd. 3. c), d) or f).
2) The owner and/or operator of the construction activity implements to the maximum
extent practicable volume reduction techniques, other than infiltration, on the site of
the original construction activity that reduce storm water discharge volume but may
not meet the requirements of post-construction storm water management .
b) Mitigation. If the owner and/or operator of a construction activity believes that the
requirements for TP and/or TSS cannot be met on the site of the original construction activity,
the owner and/or operator must provide appropriate documentation to the city as support.
Storm water discharges that do not meet the TP and/or TSS standards on the site of the
original construction activity may be mitigated off-site at the citys discretion. The proposed
mitigation must meet the following criteria:
1) Mitigation project areas should be selected in the following order of preference and
in consultation and with approval by the city:
a) Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that receives
runoff from the original construction activity.
b) Locations within the same Department of Natural Resource (DNR)
catchment area as the original construction activity.
c) Locations in the next adjacent DNR catchment area up-stream.
d) Locations within the city.
2) Mitigation projects must involve the creation of new structural storm water BMPs,
the retrofit of existing structural storm water BMPs, or the use of a properly designed
regional structural storm water BMP.
3) Routine maintenance of structural storm water BMPs required by this section cannot
be used to meet mitigation requirements.
4) Mitigation projects must be completed within 24 months after the start of the original
construction activity.
c) If the mitigation project is a private structural storm water BMP and the city is not
responsible for long-term maintenance of the project, the city will require written and
recorded documentation of maintenance responsibilities.

attachment to the maintenance agreement. At a minimum, maintenance plans must include
the following:
1) Responsible person(s) for completing inspections and conducting maintenance.
2) Frequency of inspections and maintenance.
3) Inspection checklist and type of maintenance anticipated.
d) If site configurations or structural storm water BMPs change, causing decreased BMP
effectiveness, new or improved structural storm water BMPs must be implemented to meet
the requirements of this section.
e) The property owner shall keep on file all structural storm water BMP annual inspection and
maintenance records for 5 years and submit to the City as requested.
Subd. 7. Financial Security. The City shall require the submittal of a letter of credit or other financial
security in a form acceptable to the city in the amount of $5,000 to ensure the storm water treatment
systems are installed correctly and in accordance with this ordinance.
Subd. 8. Impaired Waters and Total Maximum Daily Loads. If a site drains to a surface water that has
been listed as impaired pursuant to section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act more stringent water
quality measures may be required. If a total maximum daily load (TMDL) has been written for the impaired
water then all best management practices deemed necessary to comply with the requirements of the TMDL
must be implemented.
