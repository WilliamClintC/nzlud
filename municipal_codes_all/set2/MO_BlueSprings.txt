property and may include links on its website to other sources for such
information.
B. Policies For Disposition. The Land Bank Agency shall determine and set
forth in policies and procedures of the Board the general terms and
conditions for consideration to be received by the Land Bank Agency for

consideration may take the form of monetary payments and secured
financial obligations, covenants, and conditions related to the present
and future use of the property, contractual commitments of the
transferee, and such other forms of consideration as determined by the
Board to be in the best interest of the Land Bank Agency. Such policy
shall include a provision that if a Land Bank Agency owns more than
five (5) parcels of real property in a single City block and no written
offer to purchase any of those properties has been submitted to the
agency in the past twelve (12) months, the Land Bank Agency shall
reduce its requested price for those properties and advertise the
discount publicly; such publication may be on its website and printed
lists available at its principal office.
C. Authority For Disposition Or Pledge As Collateral. Subject to the
limitation set forth in Section 120.550, Section 141.980, Subsection 1,
RSMo., as amended and Subsection (E) below, the Land Bank Agency

instruments of conveyance and all other related documents pertaining

1. Subject to Subsection (F) of this Section, the Land Bank Agency
shall determine a hierarchical priority ranking for the particular
use of a parcel of real property conveyed by such Land Bank
Agency, and such priorities may include, not necessarily in
hierarchical order, but are not limited to:
a. Opportunities for revitalization of deteriorating residential,
retail and commercial neighborhoods;
b. Creation of safe, decent and affordable housing for existing
and future residents;
c. Creation of retail, commercial and industrial areas on vacant
or deteriorated properties within neighborhoods or the City in
general;
d. Creation or expansion of side yards with unimproved vacant
lots in neighborhoods for the benefit of abutting residences;
Section
120.640
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
120.640
AO:76
e. The assemblage of property for future development in a
manner consistent with the purposes of the City's
Comprehensive and associated plans, particularly in areas
designated by the City as a target area for revitalization or
development;
f. Space for community gardens;
g. Public spaces and places for parks, green spaces and other
public purposes;
h. Wildlife conservation areas; and
i. Such other uses, and in such hierarchical order, as determined
by the Land Bank Agency or the City.
2. Further, the Land Bank Agency shall adopt a policy specifying for
which categories of priority uses parcels need not be listed for sale,
and may make such determination on any particular parcel. The
foregoing priority uses contemplate that land that is in a nonrevenue-
generating, non-tax-producing status, may be returned to
use in private ownership, contingent upon the recipient's
covenants to develop or renovate the property consistent with their
plan incorporated into and a part of their accepted offer, which can
include additional conditions imposed by the Land Bank Agency,
and the recipient's obligations to pay: 1) outstanding real property
taxes for any property owned by the recipient, or entities in
common control with recipient, within the City, including but not
limited to, property acquired from the Land Bank Agency, 2) all
installments of special assessment for public improvements then
due and owing, 3) any outstanding special assessments or liens
imposed by the City for municipal services and/or property
maintenance violations, and 4) any unsatisfied fines or fees for
property maintenance violations or previously issued City Code
citations or violations issued by the City (collectively referred to as
"financial obligations"). The Land Bank Agency may request a
waiver by the City of financial obligations on a particular parcel if
not extinguished pursuant to the Land Tax Collection Law, and the
recipient's obligation shall not extend to such waived financial
obligation. Payments upon an ancillary parcel, defined in Section
120.650(B), shall be controlled by such Section. Such covenants
and obligations may be secured by a deed of trust or other
collateral pledge, with the appropriateness of such pledge and
length of that pledge being a determination delegated to the Land
Bank Agency. The Land Bank Agency's determination shall consider
that the beneficiaries of its efforts are the City and the other taxing
authorities in accordance with Section 120.560. The length of the
secured pledge shall be for no more than a period of three (3)
years, provided that the length will be automatically extended upon
the then owner's failure to develop or renovate the property, pay
property taxes or other financial obligations to the City or maintain
Section
120.640
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
120.640
AO:77
the property, with such extension being for whatever period
necessary to exercise the Land Bank Agency's rights under such
deed of trust or other pledge of collateral. The Land Bank Agency
is empowered to exercise any and all rights under any deed of trust
or pledge of collateral as security.
3. The City hereby delegates to the Board of Commissioners
governing such Land Bank Agency to determine as to a particular
property for which there are competing requests for acquisition
with different priority uses which use best serves the residents of
the City, first, and then the taxing authorities. But in all events,
such priorities shall be consistent with and no more restrictive than
municipal planning and zoning ordinances.16
F. Offers.
1. What Constitutes An Offer. Subject to Subsections (E) and (F) of
this Section, a Land Bank Agency shall accept and will consider all
written offers equal to or greater than fair market value to
purchase real property held by the Land Bank Agency. A written
offer must be made on the forms available for that purpose from the
Land Bank Agency. Further, the Land Bank Agency may adopt
policies and procedures as to what constitutes an offer. An offer
must state the proposed use for the property, and the Land Bank
Agency may consider as a part of the acceptance of such offer
whether the proposed use is in compliance with the existing zoning
designation and land use regulations of such property and is a use
consistent with the priority for that particular parcel. Further, an
offer must include at a minimum:
a. A certified statement from the proposed purchaser, signed by
at least one (1) duly authorized individual officer if an entity,
that the proposed purchaser, or the holder of a controlling
interest therein, does not have any outstanding delinquent real
property taxes for any property owned within the City, is
current on all installments of special assessment for public
improvements then due and owing, does not have any
outstanding special assessments or liens imposed by the City
for municipal services and/or property maintenance violations,
and does not have any pending property maintenance
violations or any unsatisfied fines for previously issued City
Code citations or violations as issued by the City;
b. A list of all owners, officers, members or partners of an entity
which is the proposed purchaser, with their primary
residences; and
c. For any proposed purchaser that is an entity the offer must
include a designation of local agent, with a valid City-issued

authorized to accept on behalf of such entity notices of Code
violations or other service of process, which designation shall
be deemed to remain in full force and effect until written notice
to the contrary is provided to the Land Bank Agency, which
shall be effective only if a subsequent local agent, similarly
qualified, is named in such notice.
2. Fair Market Value. The Land Bank Agency shall determine the fair
market value by reasonable and cost-effective means, including,
without limitation: adopting the market value as determined by the
Jackson County Assessor, establishing a set value for unimproved
vacant residentially zoned property generally in the same area,
based on tiers of square footage and on market conditions for that
property, relying upon Land Bank Agency or City staff input, which
may be based on appraisals or valuations obtained for whatever
municipal purpose on similar properties, or real estate broker's
sale price summary of other comparable properties. An appraisal,
done by a licensed or certified appraiser pursuant to Chapter 339,
RSMo., holding a City-issued business license, submitted by the
person or entity with their offer, will be considered by the Land
Bank Agency, but is not determinative as to what constitutes a fair
market value.
3. Rejection Of An Offer. If a Land Bank Agency rejects a written offer
equal to or greater than fair market value, or does not respond to a
written offer equal to or greater than fair market value within sixty
(60) days, the Land Bank Agency's action shall be subject to judicial
review under Chapter 536, RSMo., or any other applicable
provision of law unless the basis for the Land Bank Agency's
rejection is that it has accepted another offer equal to or greater
than fair market value for that property. Venue shall be in the
Circuit Court of Jackson County.
A. When any parcel of real estate acquired by a Land Bank Agency
pursuant to a deemed sale under Subsection 3 of Section 141.560,
RSMo., by deed from a land trust under Subsection 1 of Section
141.984, RSMo., or pursuant to a sale under Subdivision (2) of
Subsection 2 of Section 141.550, RSMo., is sold or otherwise disposed
of by such Land Bank Agency, the proceeds therefrom shall be applied
and distributed in the following order:
1. To the payment of the expenses of sale;
2. To fulfill the requirements of the resolution, indenture or other
financing documents adopted or entered into in connection with
bonds, notes or other obligations of the Land Bank Agency, to the
Section
120.640
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
120.650
AO:79
extent that such requirements may apply with respect to such
parcel of real estate;
3. The balance to be retained by the Land Bank Agency to pay the
salaries and other expenses of such Land Bank Agency and of its
employees as provided for in its annual budget; provided, however,
that such budget shall be deemed to include: (a) all expenses for
the staffing and administrative support of the Land Bank Agency
provided by the City, and (b) the maintenance, repair and
demolition of properties, as accounted for by the Land Bank Agency
in cooperation with the City, and the actual costs thereof may
exceed the funds budgeted, and all such actual expenses and costs

attendance and less than a quorum of the members of the public
governmental body participating via telephone, facsimile, Internet, or
any other voice or electronic means, the nature of the emergency of the
public body justifying that departure from the normal requirements
shall be stated in the minutes. Where such emergency exists, the votes
taken shall be regarded as if all members were physically present and

as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall
separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make the non-exempt
material available for examination and copying in accord with the policies
provided herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to
the extent practicable, facilitate a separation of exempt from non-exempt
information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person requesting to
inspect or receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe
the material exempted unless that description would reveal the contents of
the exempt information and thus defeat the purpose of the exemption.
Section 122.090. Custodian Designated — Response To Request For
Access To Records.
A. Each meeting shall be held at a place reasonably accessible to the
public and of sufficient size to accommodate the anticipated attendance
by members of the public and at a time reasonably convenient to the
public unless for good cause such a place or time is impossible or
impractical. Every reasonable effort shall be made to grant special
access to the meeting to handicapped or disabled individuals.
B. When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24)
hours' notice, or at a place that is not reasonably accessible to the
public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the public, the
nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal

meetings in accord with the policies enumerated herein.
B. Each public governmental body shall make available for inspection and
copying by the public of that body's public records. No person shall

body or its custodian without written permission of the designated
custodian. No public governmental body shall, after August 28, 1998,
grant to any person or entity, whether by contract, license or otherwise,
the exclusive right to access and disseminate any public record unless
the granting of such right is necessary to facilitate coordination with, or
uniformity among, industry regulators having similar authority.
C. Each request for access to a public record shall be acted upon as soon
as possible, but in no event later than the end of the third business day
following the date the request is received by the custodian of records of

a public governmental body. If records are requested in a certain
format, the public body shall provide the records in the requested
format, if such format is available. If access to the public record is not
granted immediately, the custodian shall give a detailed explanation of
the cause for further delay and the place and earliest time and date that
the record will be available for inspection. This period for document
production may exceed three (3) days for reasonable cause.
D. If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon
request, a written statement of the grounds for such denial. Such
statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which access is
denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of
the third business day following the date that the request for the
statement is received.

shall provide access to and, upon request, furnish copies of public
records subject to the following:
1. Fees for copying public records, except those records restricted
under Section 32.091, RSMo., shall not exceed ten cents ($0.10)
per page for a paper copy not larger than nine (9) inches by
fourteen (14) inches, with the hourly fee for duplicating time not to
exceed the average hourly rate of pay for clerical staff of the public
governmental body. Research time required for fulfilling records
requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time. Based
on the scope of the request, the public governmental body shall
produce the copies using employees of the body that result in the
lowest amount of charges for search, research and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the
person requesting the records may request the public
governmental body to provide an estimate of the cost to the person
requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without
charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body
determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the public
governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest
of the requester.
2. Fees for providing access to public records maintained on
computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films,
pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or
visual items or devices and for paper copies larger than nine (9)
inches by fourteen (14) inches shall include only the cost of copies,
staff time, which shall not exceed the average hourly rate of pay for
staff of the public governmental body required for making copies
and programming, if necessary, and the cost of the disk, tape or
other medium used for the duplication. Fees for maps, blueprints or

required beyond the customary and usual level to comply with a
request for records or information, the fees for compliance may
include the actual cost of such programming.

1968 § 14-46; Ord. No. 1147 § 1, 4-12-1982]
A. A person is not guilty of an offense unless their liability is based on
conduct which includes a voluntary act.
B. A "voluntary act" is:
1. A bodily movement performed while conscious as a result of effort
or determination; or
2. An omission to perform an act of which the actor is physically
capable.
C. Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procures or
receives the thing possessed, or having acquired control of it was aware
of their control for a sufficient time to have enabled them to dispose of it
or terminate their control.
D. A person is not guilty of an offense based solely upon an omission to
perform an act unless the law defining the offense expressly so
provides, or a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by
law.
A. Except as provided in Section 220.210, a person is not guilty of an
offense unless they act with a culpable mental state, that is, unless they
act purposely or knowingly or recklessly or with criminal negligence, as
the ordinance defining the offense may require with respect to the
conduct, the result thereof or the attendant circumstances which
constitute the material elements of the offense.
B. A person "acts purposely," or with purpose, with respect to their
conduct or to a result thereof, when it is their conscious object to
engage in that conduct or to cause that result.
C. A person "acts knowingly" or with knowledge:
1. With respect to their conduct or to attendant circumstances when
the are aware of the nature of their conduct or that those
circumstances exist; or
2. With respect to a result of their conduct when they are aware that
their conduct is practically certain to cause that result.
D. A person "acts recklessly" or is reckless when they consciously
disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist
or that a result will follow, and such disregard constitutes a gross

deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would
exercise in the situation.
E. A person "acts with criminal negligence" or is criminally negligent
when they fail to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
circumstances exist or a result will follow, and such failure constitutes a
gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person
would exercise in the situation.
A. If the definition of an offense prescribes a culpable mental state but
does not specify the conduct, attendant circumstances, or result to
which it applies, the prescribed culpable mental state applies to each
such material element.
B. If the definition of an offense prescribes criminal negligence as the
culpable mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely or
knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish a
culpable mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely or
knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish a culpable

dispense with the requirement of any culpable mental state as to a
specific element of the offense.

is committed by their own conduct or by the conduct of another person for
which they are criminally responsible as set out in Section 220.225, or both.

of resistance or threatened resistance of the arrestee. In addition to the
use of physical force authorized under other Statutes or ordinances,
they are, subject to provisions of Subsections (B) and (C) below,
justified in the use of such physical force as they reasonably believe is
immediately necessary to effect the arrest or to prevent the escape

commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other
person or persons. [Ord. No. 4638 § 4, 12-19-2016]
D. If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, they are guilty of
only one (1) conspiracy so long as such multiple offenses are the object
of the same agreement.
E. No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit an offense unless
an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to
have been done by them or by a person with whom they conspired.
F. No one shall be convicted of conspiracy if, after conspiring to commit
the offense, they prevented the accomplishment of the objectives of the

when the offense or offenses which are its object are committed or
the agreement that they be committed is abandoned by the
defendant and by those with whom they conspired.
2. If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is
terminated as to them only if they advise those with whom they
have conspired of their abandonment or they inform the law
enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of
their participation in it.

the same course of conduct of both the actual commission of an offense
and a conspiracy to commit that offense.

deems it necessary to immediately abate a nuisance as defined by
ordinance, by common law, or by the Statutes of the State of Missouri,
in order to secure the general health or safety of the City or of any of
its inhabitants, the Codes Administrator or their designee is authorized
to abate such nuisance without notice; and they may use any suitable
means or assistance for the purpose, whether regular personnel of the
City or laborers especially employed for that purpose, or any other help or
assistance necessary therefor. The Codes Administrator or their designee
shall certify the cost of abating said nuisance to the City Council, and the
City Council may by ordinance levy the cost thereof as a special tax against
the property on which said nuisance was located, and may authorize the
issuance of special tax bills therefor. Said tax shall be collected like other

If any nuisance abated by the Codes Administrator or their designee as
hereinbefore provided extended before the abatement over the property of
more than one (1) owner, the cost of abating the same shall be assessed
in proportion to the amount of work and expense for each proportionate
part of the entire work in the area, and the special tax bills hereinbefore
provided for shall be levied and collected accordingly; but, in determining
who is the owner of any particular lot, plot, or parcel of land as for instance
in joint tenancy or in common, shall be deemed a single owner in order to
preserve to the City its lien against the particular lot, plot, or parcel of land
under the special tax bill levied against the same as, aforesaid.

Section 245.280. Smoking Limited In Certain Areas. [R.O. 1996

4134 § 1, 2-4-2008; Ord. No. 4168 § 1, 7-7-2008]
A. Legislative Intent.
1. Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major
contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand
smoke (also known as "environmental tobacco smoke") is a cause of
disease in smokers and healthy non-smokers alike, including heart
disease, stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer. The National
Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is
responsible for the early deaths of at least sixty-five thousand
(65,000) Americans annually. [National Cancer Institute (NCI),
"Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the
report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking
and Tobacco Control, Monograph 10" Bethesda, MD: National
Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.]
2. The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program has listed
secondhand smoke as a Class "A" carcinogen (the deadliest).
[Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS),
"Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on
Carcinogens," United States Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, National Toxicology
Program, 2000.]
3. The United States Surgeon General has determined that the simple
separation of smokers and non-smokers within the same air space
may reduce odors, but does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers
to dangerous secondhand smoke. (Department of Health
and Human Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary
Smoking: A Report of the Surgeon General. Public Health Service,
Centers for Disease Control, 1986.) The Environmental Protection
Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced
to safe levels in any enclosed space by high rates of ventilation. Air
cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter
and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in
secondhand smoke. [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
"Indoor air facts no. 5: environmental tobacco smoke," Washington,
D.C.: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), June 1989.]
4. The City Council hereby finds that the effects of smoke generated
by the smoking of cigarettes, cigars, pipes and similar articles pose
a danger to the health, safety and well-being of persons who do not
smoke.
Section
245.280
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
245.280
AO:299
5. The City Council further finds that the Surgeon General's 1984 and
1986 reports on smoking hazards link high levels of involuntary
smoke exposure to reduced breathing ability in passive smokers
and other health dangers, and therefore further buttresses the
need to provide protection to non-smokers in public settings.
6. The City Council further finds that the smoking of tobacco is a
positive danger to health and a cause of material annoyance,
inconvenience and discomfort to those who are present in confined
places.
7. Therefore, the purpose of this Section is to place limitations on
smoking within certain areas in the City while striking a reasonable
balance between the needs of all individuals including those too
young to make choices where they go and to what they are
subjected.

When, Effect Of. [R.O. 1996 § 340.210; Ord. No. 3416 § 2, 9-5-2001]
A. Upon the trial of any person for violation of any of the provisions of
Section 340.200(A) or (B), arising out of acts alleged to have been
committed by any person while driving a motor vehicle while in an
intoxicated condition, the amount of alcohol in the person's blood at the
time of the act alleged as shown by any chemical analysis of the
person's blood, breath, saliva or urine is admissible in evidence and the
provisions of Subdivision (5) of Section 491.060, RSMo., shall not
prevent the admissibility or introduction of such evidence if otherwise
admissible. If there was eight-hundredths of one percent (.08%) or
more by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, this shall be prima facie
evidence that the person was intoxicated at the time the specimen was
taken.
B. Percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams of
alcohol per one hundred (100) milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol
per two hundred ten (210) liters of breath.
C. The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not be construed as
limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon
the question whether the person was intoxicated.
D. A chemical analysis of a person's breath, blood, saliva or urine, in order
to give rise to the presumption or to have the effect provided for in

E. Any charge alleging a violation of Section 340.200(A) or (B) shall be
dismissed with prejudice if a chemical analysis of the defendant's
breath, blood, saliva, or urine performed in accordance with Sections
340.200(C), (D), and (E) demonstrate that there was less than tenhundredths
of one percent (0.10%) of alcohol in the defendant's blood
unless one or more of the following considerations cause the court to
find a dismissal unwarranted:
1. There is evidence that the chemical analysis is unreliable as
evidence of the defendant's intoxication at the time of the alleged
violation due to the lapse of time between the alleged violation and
the obtaining of the specimen;
2. There is evidence that the defendant was under the influence of a
controlled substance, or drug, or a combination of either or both
with or without alcohol; or
3. There is substantial evidence of intoxication from physical
observations of witnesses or admissions of the defendant.

and supports that of any abutting zoning districts.
3. The precedents that might result from approval or denial of the
application, and the possible effects of such precedents on the
character of the area, and in particular the building form, site
design, and other development patterns and urban design aspects
that accompany precedents for the proposed district.
4. Compliance of any proposed development with the requirements of
this Development Code.
5. The ability of the City or other government agencies to provide any
services, facilities or programs that might be required if the
application were approved.
6. The effect of approval on the condition or value of property in the
City or in the vicinity, including the likelihood of surrounding areas
to be developed in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.
7. The requested zoning change is justified by a change in conditions
since the existing zoning was designated or by an error in the

8. The consistency of the application with other adopted policies of
the City.
9. The recommendations of professional staff.
C. Protest Petitions. If a valid protest petition is submitted to the City prior
to City Council final action on the application, an amendment to the
Official Zoning Map (rezoning) shall not become effective except by the
favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all of the members of the City
Council. In order to be considered valid, a protest petition for a Zoning
Map amendment must be duly signed and acknowledged by the owners
of thirty percent (30%) or more, either of the areas of the land

Section 403.040. Planned Developments. [R.O. 1996 § 403.040; Ord.
No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
A. Overview/Applicability. The planned development process is a way to
facilitate coordinated master planned development that meets or
exceeds the intent of this Development Code and the goals of the
Comprehensive Plan through an integrated plan, process and flexible
standards. A planned development application is a specific type of
Zoning Map amendment, and must meet all of the procedures and
requirements of that process, but it also accommodates specific master
development plans. The planned development process involves at least
two (2) steps - the concept plan where the general design, arrangement
and parameters of subsequent development are proposed, and the final
plan, where specific development projects are reviewed. In many cases
land will need to be subdivided in order to carry out a development
plan. The subdivision process is a separate process and may run
concurrently with or following the planned development process. In
addition to the general requirements in Table 403.010-167 and Section
403.010 the following requirements are specific to planned
development applications.
B. Concept Plan. A concept plan is a generalized development plan for the
entire area proposed to be included within a planned development. The
purpose of a concept plan is to allow preliminary review of a proposed
planned development before substantial technical work has been
undertaken. A concept plan shall generally include:
1. Community Character Plan. A plan outlining the general location,
design characteristics, and functions of all proposed streets,
stormwater management, open spaces, civic spaces, and
circulation networks — whether public, common or private — that
will create the public realm for the plan.
2. Land Use And Development Plan. A plan indicating the specific
land uses and their density/intensity, block and lot patterns,
building types and scale, materials and design characteristics, and
other building and site design elements. This plan shall have a
particular emphasis on how these elements relate to the
community character plan and where transitions between these
elements occur at a parcel or block scale both within the
development and in coordination with abutting property. The land
use and development plan shall specifically identify where
development standards may differ from those otherwise applicable
through the base zoning districts and general development
requirements of this Development Code.
3. Existing Conditions. Analysis identifying the general layout of any
existing structures, streets or infrastructure and the location of
natural features such as watercourses, steep grades, significant
67.Editor's Note: Table 403.010-1 is included as an attachment to this Chapter.

403.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
403.040
AO:459
stands of trees, specimen trees or other features available on the
most refined scale of the Natural Resources Inventory identified in
Appendix A3 of the Comprehensive Plan.
4. Phasing Or Implementation. A strategy indicating the estimated
timing of development and any other administrative details of
implementing the plan through future final plans.
5. Illustrative Plan. The concept plan may include an illustrative plan
that includes renderings, elevations or plans of buildings,
streetscapes, and public spaces or other urban design and
architectural details demonstrating how the plan will be executed
according to the applicable development standards.
C. Concept Plan Review Criteria. A concept plan shall be reviewed
according to the following criteria:
1. The plan represents an improvement over what could have been
accomplished through strict application of otherwise applicable
base zoning district standards, based on the goals of the
Comprehensive Plan, and based upon generally accepted planning
and design practice.
2. The benefits from any flexibility in the standards proposed in the
plan promote the general public health, safety and welfare of the
community, and in particular the areas immediately near or within
the proposed project, and are not strictly to benefit the applicant.
3. The benefits from any flexibility in the standards proposed in the
plan meet or exceed the intent statements of the base zoning
district(s) and any standards proposed to be modified when applied
to the specific project or site.
4. The plan reflects generally accepted and sound planning and urban
design principles with respect to applying the Comprehensive Plan
and any specific plans to the area.
5. The plan meets all of the review criteria for a Zoning Map
amendment.
D. Effect Of Concept Plan Approval. Approval of a concept plan shall
constitute acceptance of the overall planning concepts and
development parameters. In reviewing and approving a concept plan,
the Planning Commission may recommend or the City Council may
require conditions that must be met before an applicant submits a final
plan. An approved concept plan shall lapse and be of no further force
and effect if a final plan (or a final plan for a designated phase of the
concept plan) has not been approved within two (2) years of the date of
approval of the concept plan.
E. Designation On Official Zoning Map. Sites governed by an approved
Concept Plan shall be designated on the Official Zoning Map with the
Section
403.040
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
403.040
AO:460
letters of the base zoning district plus "PD" (Planned Development). For
example, where a portion of the development plan uses the MF-14 and
the NB base zoning districts for the Concept Plan, the future zoning of
each area shall be MF-14-PD and NB-PD respectively. [Ord. No. 4585
§ 2, 2-16-2016]
F. Final Plan. A final plan is a detailed plan for implementing the concept
plan including technical information on building, site, open/civic space,
and infrastructure development. A final plan may include the entire
area covered in the concept plan or it may include one (1) or more
phases of the approved concept plan. The plan shall include all
necessary information to demonstrate that all applicable standards,
requirements, and conditions of the concept plan have been met.
G. Final Plan Review Criteria. A final plan shall be reviewed according to
the following criteria:
1. The final plan is in substantial compliance with the approved
concept plan.
2. Minor deviations may only be approved if they meet or exceed the
approved concept plan.
a. Minor deviations shall be:
(1) An increase in the proposed building footprints of less than
five percent (5%).
(2) An increase in the intensity of the project - less than ten
percent (10%) of floor area for non-residential projects and
less than five percent (5%) density for residential projects.
(3) An increase in impervious surfaces such that stormwater
detention and stormwater quality as defined by KCAPWA68
5600 are not required.
(4) An increase in building heights of less than five (5) feet.
(5) A rearrangement of buildings that does not impact any
setback standard, or decreases setbacks by less than five
percent (5%).
(6) A decrease in landscape areas by less than ten percent
(10%), provided there is no impact on the performance of
stormwater or screening functions from the approved
concept plan.
(7) A decrease in any civic open space or frontage areas by
less than five percent (5%), or any similar adjustments to
the general location of streets, common areas or other
68.Editor's Note: "KCAPWA" refers to the Kansas City Metro Chapter of the American Public
Works Association.

components of the community character plan, provided
there is no impact on the performance, screening or urban
design functions of the approved concept plan.
(8) Adjustments to building elevations that do not change the
character or relationships of buildings to the public realm
and adjacent property.
(9) Adjustments in proposed building types or uses that do not
significantly change the character of the project; a change
of ten percent (10%) or more of any building type (by
quantity) or any specific use category (by land area or
building square footage) will be assumed significant,
unless the context of the project and concept plan clearly
demonstrate otherwise.
(10) Changes in ownership patterns, stages of construction or
phasing that have no impact on the timing and function of
public facilities and that do not alter the delivery of
private, common, or public amenities in the concept plan.
b. Any modification that, in the sole discretion of the Director of
Community Development, negatively affects or impacts use,
investments, or design of public facilities beyond the particular
project and site may not be considered a minor change. Any
change that violates a condition of approval in the concept
plan, or alters the findings of any technical study that supports
the approved concept plan, may not be considered a minor
change.
H. Effect Of Final Plan Approval — Lapse Of Approval. Approval of a final
plan authorizes the development of the property in accordance with the
approved final plan. The authorization to develop in accordance with an
approved final plan shall lapse and be of no further effect if all
development shown on the final plan is not complete within the time
frame established by the City Council at the time of final plan approval.
Once approval lapses, the regulations of the base zoning district shall
control.
A. Overview/Applicability. Platting is a process where a proposed division,
or partition of land and property interests therein, is reviewed to
ensure: development patterns in compliance with long-range
comprehensive plans; coordinating infrastructure with existing, future
and potential capital improvements; and that all lots are buildable,
served with adequate public facilities, and capable of meeting the
zoning and development standards. The platting process involves two
(2) steps - the preliminary plat where the general design, arrangement
and parameters of subsequent development are proposed, and the final
Section
403.040
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
403.050
AO:462
plat, where specific and technical engineering, design and planning
elements are reviewed. Platting shall be required for any division of
land into two (2) or more parcels or units, or development on one (1)
or more contiguous parcels not previously platted, or for development
that involves construction of any public improvements that are to be
dedicated to the City, except that the following shall not require
platting:
1. The division of any parcel or tract of land when the smallest parcel
created is greater than forty (40) acres;
2. Land taken or used for street or railroad right-of-way, a drainage
easement or other public utilities subject to local, State or Federal
regulations where no new street or easement of access is involved,
or for a cemetery;
3. The development of any lot, parcel or tract of land located within
the area governed by this Development Code that was subdivided,
resubdivided or replatted prior to January 21, 1980. However, any
further resubdivision of lots, interests in real property, parcels or
tracts must be done in accordance with this Development Code;
4. Agriculture (limited or general) uses on a site of at least forty (40)
acres.
B. Preliminary Plat Review Criteria. A preliminary plat shall be reviewed
according to the following criteria:
1. The application is in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and
any official plan or program developed under the guidance of the
Comprehensive Plan. In particular the physical patterns,
arrangement of streets, blocks, lots and open spaces, and public
realm investments reflect the principles and concepts of the plan.
2. Compliance with the requirements of this Development Code. In
particular the blocks and lots proposed are capable of meeting all
development and site design standards under the existing or
proposed zoning.
3. Any phasing proposed in the application is clearly indicated and
demonstrates a logical and coordinated approach to development,
including coordination with existing and potential development on
adjacent property.
4. Any impacts identified by specific studies or technical reports,
including a preliminary review of storm water, are mitigated with
generally accepted and sound planning, engineering, and urban
design solutions, that reflect long-term solutions and sound fiscal
investments.
Section
403.050
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
403.050
AO:463
5. The application does not deter any existing or future development
on adjacent property from meeting the goals and policies of the
Comprehensive Plan.
6. The design does not impede the construction of future public
infrastructure within the area.
7. The recommendations of professional staff.
C. Effect Of Approval. Approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute
acceptance of the overall planning concepts for the subdivision and is a
prerequisite for the filing of a final plat. After approval of the
preliminary plat the applicant may proceed with the construction plans
and submit the proposed final plat for review and approval.
D. Lapse Of Approval. If no final plat of a subdivision for which preliminary
plat approval has been given is submitted within two (2) years of the
date of preliminary plat approval, such preliminary plat may be
renewed for one (1) additional two-year period upon application to the
Planning Commission before expiration of the prior approval. If such
preliminary plat is not renewed or a final plat recorded, a resubmittal
and review of the preliminary plat shall be required.
E. Construction Plans. After approval of the preliminary plat and prior to
or concurrently with submittal of the final plat, the applicant shall
submit detailed construction plans in accordance with the requirements
of this Subsection.
1. Construction plans shall be prepared and sealed by an engineer,
licensed in the State of Missouri, for streets, utilities, and other
public improvements required within the proposed subdivision.
2. At least four (4) complete sets of construction plans, including a
sidewalk layout plan, shall be submitted to the Director of Public
Works in a form established by the City, along with a nonrefundable
fee that has been established by the City to defray the
cost of processing the submittal. No submittal shall be processed
until the submittal is complete and the required fee has been paid.
A landscape plan shall be submitted with the construction plan and
shall be forwarded to the Community Development Director for
review.
3. The Director of Public Works shall review construction plans to
determine if the plans comply with all of the standards and
specifications set forth in this Development Code and other City
regulations. If the Director of Public Works determines that the
construction plans do not comply with applicable standards, the
Director of Public Works shall require that modifications be made
to bring the construction plans into compliance with such
regulations and standards. After conducting a complete review of
the construction plans, the Director of Public Works shall approve
or deny the application for construction plans approval. The
Section
403.050
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
403.050
AO:464
Director of Public Works shall then give notice of the action taken
to the applicant and the Director of Community Development.
Improvements to be made under the jurisdiction of other public
service providers, municipal, County or State agencies shall be
submitted to the appropriate agency for review and approval.
Where review and approval of engineering drawings is required by
such agency, the Director of Public Works shall be given written
confirmation in a form as approved and acceptable by such
Director that the necessary reviews have been completed and
approvals have been granted.
4. Five (5) days prior to commencing construction activities the
applicant shall submit to the Director of Public Works and to all
approving agencies and to public utility companies that will provide
service to the subdivision, a general schedule of the timing and
sequence for construction of all required improvements.
5. No grading, removal of trees or other vegetation, land filling,
construction of improvements, or other material change, except for
the purpose of aiding in preparation of final engineering drawings
or plans, shall commence on each plat or phase of a plat of the
subject property until the developer has:
a. Received written approval of the construction plans and
construction permit from the Director of Public Works; and
b. Obtained necessary approvals and permits from other affected
municipal, County, State, or Federal agencies.
F. Development In Phases. When a subdivision is to be developed in one
(1) or more phases, developers shall install public improvements or post
financial guarantees as approved by the City for each phase. The City
may require public improvements to be installed or financial
guarantees to be posted for areas beyond an individual phase if the City
determines that such improvements or guarantees are necessary to
ensure the relative self-sufficiency of the development phase, pending
completion of the entire subdivision.
1. Bond Requirements. A maintenance bond in an amount equal to
one-half (1/2) the cost of construction and satisfactory to the City
Attorney shall be posted with the Director of Public Works or their
designate, guaranteeing against defects in construction of storm
sewers, streets, sanitary sewers, and waterlines for a period of two
(2) years. The contractor shall be responsible for all settlement of
backfill, fills and embankments, which may occur within two (2)
years of time after final acceptance of the contract under which the
work was performed.

403.050
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
403.050
AO:467
3. The phasing and timing of public improvements ensures
construction and performance guarantees.
4. Any deviations in the final plat brings the application in further
compliance with the Comprehensive Plan and the purposes and
intent of this Code.
5. Covenants meeting the City's approval and containing all
requirements of the UDC are approved by the City Attorney's
office.
6. The recommendations of professional staff.
I. Effect Of Decision. Approval of a final plat shall not constitute
acceptance of public improvements. Such acceptance will require
separate, formal action of the City Council. If the final plat is approved
by the City Council by ordinance, the City Clerk shall within ten (10)
days sign the final plat signifying approval by the City Council, the date
of approval and the date on which the City Clerk signs the certificate.
Approval of a final plat shall authorize the applicant to record the plat in
the office of the Recorder of Deeds for Jackson County, Missouri. No lot
within the subdivision may be sold until the final plat has been approved
by the City Council and any conditions placed on such approval have
been complied with or completed, and the plat has been officially
recorded by the County Recorder of Deeds. If the proposed final plat is
disapproved, the Director of Community Development shall, within ten
(10) days, notify the developer, in writing, of the action and the reasons
therefor and return the final plat to the developer.
J. Final Plat Expiration — Revocation Of Approval. If the developer fails to
record a final plat with the Jackson County Recorder of Deeds within
twelve (12) months from the date of final plat approval, the City Council
shall require the developer to explain extenuating circumstances
preventing recording of the plat. If the City Council determines that an
extension of time for recording would serve the best interests of the
City of Blue Springs, it may grant up to one (1) extension for a period
not to exceed six (6) months. If the City Council determines that an
extension of time for recording would not serve the best interests of the
City of Blue Springs, then the City Council shall formally revoke its
approval of the final plat and notify the developer and the Jackson
County Recorder of Deeds of such action.
K. Digital Plat Submission Standards And Procedures.
1. When final plat application is filed with the Community
Development Department, the applicant shall submit a digital file
of the plat in addition to the required paper copies of the plat. The
digital file shall be submitted with the application and again at the
time of the submission of signed copies of the final plat for
recording. The file shall be on a computer diskette or media which
is acceptable to the City's GIS Division.
Section
403.050
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
403.050

2. The submission of digital plat files shall conform to the formatting
standards, layering system and text styles of the GIS Department.
Where a digital file contains errors or does not fully comply with
City standards, the applicant shall make corrections and resubmit
the file prior to the final plat being recorded.
L. Subdivision Of Land Being Redeveloped Seeking Deviations,
Modifications And/Or Waivers Pursuant To Section 403.140. Pursuant
to Section 403.140 of this UDC, redevelopment [as the term is defined
in Section 403.140(D)(2)] seeking deviations, modifications and/or
waivers pursuant to Section 403.140, which requires platting or
replatting, shall comply with the procedures for submission of plats and
review and action thereon set forth in Section 403.140(I).
M. Administrative Plats. Administrative plat procedures provide an
expedited review and approval for minor adjustments to legal
boundaries, easements, and title of property for proper recording.
These adjustments have little or no impact on public facilities and
infrastructure, ownership and development patterns and are otherwise
determined to be in accordance with the City's long-range development
plans.
1. Applicability. Administrative plats may be filed for the following
adjustments to property:
a. Lot Line Adjustments. An adjustment to a previously platted lot
affecting no more than four (4) lots and results in no additional
lots.
b. Revised Final Plat. Revisions to a previously approved final plat
that are due to field conditions that could not have been
reasonably anticipated or discovered at the time of the plat, or
are due to a development program in the final plat that
required construction activity to determine the final legal
description. Revised final plats shall result in no additional lots
and no change to the development patterns and concepts in the
final plat.
c. Minor Subdivision. The combining of two (2) or more lots into
one (1) lot or the division of a parcel into no more than three
(3) lots, where no portion of the lots or remaining parcel have
been subject to a previous minor subdivision and public
improvements are not required.
d. Condominium Minor Plat. The subdivision of an existing
structure into fewer than three (3) units.
2. Criteria. Administrative plats may be approved upon a finding that:

in a manner approved by the utility and if required by a utility,
separate metering or an approved metering method for use of
utilities.
3. Approval Process. A pre-application conference is required.
Administrative plats shall be submitted on forms required by the
Community Development Director and contain all information
required by the forms. Within fifteen (15) days of submission of a
complete application the director shall take one of the following:
a. Approve the application;
b. Deny the application and state specific reasons; or
c. Refer the application to the Planning Commission if at any
point the Director determines that the application does not
meet the applicable or review criteria. Such referral may be
considered an application for a preliminary plat.

A. Overview/Applicability. A conditional use permit provides flexibility for
different uses within a zoning district and allows the potential for
additional uses that due to their varying design and operational
characteristics of the use or due to conditions in the area are not
generally appropriate in that district, but require a case-specific review
to determine the compatibility in a specific context and location.
B. Review Criteria. A conditional use permit shall be reviewed according
to the following criteria:
1. The application furthers the intent of the proposed zoning district
and supports that of any abutting districts.
2. Compliance of any proposed development with the requirements of
this Development Code.
3. Whether any additional site-specific conditions are necessary to
meet the purposes and intent of this Development Code and the
intent or design objectives of any applicable Subsections of this
Development Code.
4. The impact on the public realm, including the design and functions
of streetscapes and relationships of building and site elements to
the streetscape.
5. The adequacy of drainage, utilities and other public facilities.
6. Compatibility with the character of the area in terms of building
scale, building form, landscape and site design.
7. Compatibility with the area in terms of operating characteristics
such as hours of operation, visible and audible impacts, traffic
patterns, intensity of use as proposed or foreseeable, and other
potential impacts on adjacent property.
8. The application will not prevent development and use of the
neighboring property in accordance with the applicable
development regulations.
9. The long-range plans applicable to the site and surrounding area
are not negatively impacted considering the permanence of the
proposed use, the permanence of existing uses in the area, and any
changes in character occurring in the area.
10. The recommendations of professional staff.
C. Effect Of Decision. Findings of fact identifying and evaluating all factors
relevant to the application shall be made part of the public record.
Approval shall be subject to those specific facts and any additional
conditions made as part of the review and approval. Any amendment to
a conditional use permit shall require the same process as the original
approval.

A. Purpose. The purpose of these amendments to the City's UDC is to
facilitate the redevelopment of commercially and industrially zoned
areas of the City, while ensuring high quality development that is
compatible with adjacent development in all parts of the City, by
carefully evaluating redevelopment proposals within these areas
toward the goal of providing safe, functional, aesthetically pleasing
redevelopment that preserves the property values of adjacent
development without creating unnecessary costs for redevelopers.
B. Specific Objectives. The regulations of this Section are designed to
accomplish the above purpose by requiring that redevelopment
proposals undergo plan review; authorizing the City Council to deviate
from, modify and/or waive applicable zoning district regulations,
property development standards, supplemental standards,
performance standards, special use standards, operation standards,
subdivision design and improvement standards, the general
development standards of Chapter 407, and sign regulations of the City
Code Chapter 501; and establishing review criteria to guide the City
Council's discretion in deviating from or modifying these regulations
and standards and/or granting waivers thereto. The following are
specific objectives of these provisions:
1. Increase redevelopment opportunities in commercially and
industrially zoned areas of the City;
2. Ensure a strong business climate within these areas by promoting
quality design through a plan review process, providing latitude in
using innovative and less costly techniques in the redevelopment of
land that is not otherwise economically feasible to develop in
accordance with the then current Unified Development Code and
City Code requirements, and encouraging in-fill development in
these areas;
3. Provide for high quality, comprehensively designed and developed
commercially and industrially zoned areas that are well planned
and well maintained by:
a. Encouraging the most appropriate use of developed land by
providing over time better opportunities for redevelopment
and improvement of individual sites in a manner compatible
with adjacent development;
b. Protecting and enhancing property and building values and the
value of City investments in older commercially and
industrially zoned areas and maintaining and improving the tax
base and fostering redevelopment;
c. Protecting extraordinary public investment in public
infrastructure, public amenities and public facilities;
d. Securing more business development, job retention and
growth in the City;
Section
403.140
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
403.140
AO:482
e. Providing increased opportunities for property owners to
maximize their investment;
f. Increasing property taxes and other revenues to the City from
the redevelopment of older commercially and industrially
zoned areas; and
g. Implementing the Comprehensive Plan.
C. Applicability. The processes and procedures established by this UDC
text amendment shall apply to all developed tracts of land within the
City's jurisdictional boundaries that are shown on the Official Zoning
District Map as being in the NB, SO, GB, RC, LI or HI zoning district or
in any zoning district previously defined in the Unified Development
Code that is no longer defined herein, e.g., "CB."
D. Application Requirements.
1. Any person who owns an existing business in the City and who
desires to redevelop the property upon which that business is
located [as the term "redevelopment" is defined in Subsection
(D)(2) hereof] with deviation from, modification to and waiver of
the applicable regulations, requirements and standards of the UDC
and City Code shall submit a redevelopment modification plan
application to the City for review, recommendation and action as
required herein.

b. Expansion of an existing structure or structures, if the
expansion otherwise meets the definition in this Subsection,
constitutes "redevelopment," provided that this expansion
shall physically incorporate a minimum of fifty percent (50%)
of the existing structure(s) located on the land covered by the
redevelopment modification plan. In addition, a change in use
that will cause the use to lose its non-conforming use status,

shall include a reference to the redevelopment modification plan
for each such deviation, modification or waiver that is of sufficient
clarity to allow the Director to identify the proposed location for
each requested deviation, modification or waiver. The statement
shall also include a narrative description of the rationale for
granting each requested deviation, modification or waiver.
5. The redevelopment modification plan shall also be accompanied by
a statement (and such other information, plans or data as may be
appropriate) explaining how the proposed redevelopment will be
compatible with adjacent proposed or existing developments. The
statement shall address considerations, including, but not limited
to, the following:

through (3), then the applicant shall submit all three forms
of supporting documentation.

ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
403.140
AO:487
a. Redevelopment proposed by the redevelopment modification
plan incorporates generally accepted sound planning
principles and will provide sustainable value to the City;
b. Redevelopment proposed by the redevelopment modification

is proposed;
c. Adequate access roads or entrances and exit drives will be
provided and will be designed to prevent traffic hazards and to
minimize traffic congestion in public streets and alleys;
d. Adequate utilities, drainage and other necessary services or
facilities have been or will be provided to the redevelopment
proposed by the redevelopment modification plan;
e. The location and size of the redevelopment, as proposed by the
redevelopment modification plan, the nature and intensity of
the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it,
and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access
to it are such that the redevelopment will not dominate the
immediate neighborhood so as to adversely affect the
development and use of neighboring property;
f. The redevelopment is reasonably compatible with existing or
permitted uses on abutting sites in terms of building height,
setbacks, exterior building design features and materials
utilized, open spaces, bulk and scale, landscaping and
buffering, parking and circulation features;
g. Approval of the redevelopment proposed by the redevelopment
modification plan will not create an undesirable precedent;
h. The condition or value of property in the City or in the vicinity
will not be adversely affected by the redevelopment proposed
by the redevelopment modification plan;
i. The redevelopment would not occur but for the approval of the
redevelopment modification plan application with the proposed

hereinbefore referenced regulations, restrictions and
standards of the UDC and City Code;
j. The deviations, modifications and waivers proposed in the
redevelopment modification plan are the minimum required to
allow the proposed redevelopment to proceed;
k. The benefits to the City of the redevelopment, including, but
not limited to, the tax revenues generated and the jobs
created, outweigh the negative effects, if any, resulting from
the approval of the redevelopment modification plan
Section
403.140
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
403.140
AO:488
application with the proposed deviations, modifications and
waivers;
l. The redevelopment proposed by the redevelopment
modification plan will not be detrimental to the public health,
safety or welfare or materially injurious to properties or
improvements in the vicinity; and
m. Redevelopment proposed by the redevelopment modification
plan furthers the goals, spirit and intent of this Section and of
the UDC as a whole.
7. If the City Council approves a redevelopment modification plan
application with modifications, it may designate specific
requirements that must be satisfied to ensure the review criteria of
Subsection (F)(6) are met before issuance of a building permit. The
City Council may delegate to the Director of Community
Development the authority to determine whether the specifically
prescribed conditions attached to the approval have been satisfied
by the applicant. As a condition of approval, the applicant may be
required to execute a development agreement that is satisfactory
to both the applicant and the City.
8. No separate vote on individual deviations, modifications or waivers
proposed by the redevelopment modification plan is required for
the City Council to approve the redevelopment modification plan
application, though the City Council may choose to require
separate votes on each. At its discretion, the City Council may
evaluate the redevelopment modification plan application as a
whole to determine whether the redevelopment it proposes
satisfies the review criteria set forth hereinabove and the purposes
of this Section.

plan has been approved pursuant to this Section, shall record the
approved redevelopment modification plan with the Jackson County

redevelopment modification plan application pursuant to this Section, a
redevelopment modification plan application for the same or similar
tract(s) of land shall not be refiled for one (1) year from the date on
which the City Council denied the redevelopment modification plan
application.
I. Relationship To Subdivision Design And Improvement Standards.

from the platting procedures of Section 403.050, and the
redevelopment modification plans shall not be construed as plats.
Provided, however, if such redevelopment project requires platting or
replatting pursuant to Section 403.050, the applicant may submit a
combined preliminary and final plat that contains all the information
for both required by Section 403.050 to the Community Development
Director. The combined preliminary and final plat may include
deviations from and modifications to the subdivision design and
improvement standards of Chapter 406. In this instance, a staff report
shall be prepared, as required by Section 403.010(A)(3)(c), and the
combined preliminary and final plat shall be reviewed and acted upon
by the Planning Commission and City Council as required by this
Chapter 403, provided that the Planning Commission shall not
recommend approval and the City Council shall not approve the
combined preliminary and final plat unless each determines that, in
addition to the requirements of Section 403.050, it satisfies the review
criteria of Subsection (F)(6) hereof. If the City Council so determines,
it may approve or conditionally approve the combined preliminary and
final plat.
J. Expiration Of Approved Redevelopment Modification Plans. An
approved redevelopment modification plan shall expire and be of no
further effect if an application for a building permit for one (1) or more
buildings shown on the approved redevelopment modification plan is

plan is filed, the Director of Community Development shall
determine whether the revised redevelopment modification
plan involves substantial changes or minor changes and shall

5. For purposes of this Section, "substantial change" to the approved
redevelopment modification plan shall mean any change that is not
a minor change, as defined below, or the extension of the expiration
date of the redevelopment modification plan.
6. For purposes of this Section, "minor change" to the approved
redevelopment modification plan shall mean any of the following
changes:
a. Reconfiguration of building locations that do not change the
architectural style of the project or buildings or alter the
approved streetscape;
b. Increases in the number of lots to a number that is less than
five percent (5%) of the number of lots originally approved;

be deemed to run with the land and shall be transferable by the
applicant to another person or entity, provided that the provisions
of Section 405.080 on non-conformities shall thereafter be fully
applicable to the development.
3. If the applicant wishes to convey the property, with respect to
which a redevelopment modification plan has been approved, to
another person prior to the issuance of building permits for all
development and substantial reliance thereon, and such person
desires to construct the improvements in accordance with the
approved redevelopment modification plan, such person shall first
obtain the approval of the Director of Community Development in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Subsection (L)(4)
hereof.

property in accordance with the approved redevelopment
modification plan prior to issuance of building permits for all
development and substantial reliance thereon shall submit a
redevelopment modification plan application to the Director of
Community Development as specified in Subsection (D) of this
Section. The Director shall review the application and shall
approve the transfer of the rights to use the property in accordance
with the approved redevelopment modification plan if the Director
determines that review criteria of Subsection (F)(6)(g) through (m)
are met. This decision shall be submitted to such person, in writing,

procedures for approval of a revised redevelopment modification
plan as set forth in Subsection (K) hereof.
M. Issuance Of Building Permits. The Director of Community Development
shall not issue a building permit for redevelopment on property, if the
applicant is seeking deviations from, modifications to and waivers of the
applicable regulations, requirements and standards of the UDC or the
City Code, as provided for by this Section, until the City Council has
approved a redevelopment modification plan for the subject
redevelopment, and then only if the redevelopment modification plan
approval is still valid pursuant to Subsection 403.140(J) hereof.
N. Verification That Project Increases Have Been Obtained By Applicant.
Within thirty (30) days of the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days

buildings shown on the applicant's approved redevelopment
modification plan is issued, or on whatever date is the first available

follow the center lines of streets, alleys, waterways, and railroad
rights-of-way, unless otherwise indicated. When the designation of
a boundary line on the Zoning Map coincides with the location of a
street, alley, waterway or railroad right-of-way, the centerline of
such street, alley, waterway or railroad right-of-way shall be
construed to be the boundary line of such district.
2. Lot Lines. When zoning district boundaries do not coincide with the
location of streets, waterways or railroad rights-of-way but do
coincide with lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be the
boundary of such district.

vacated by official action of the City Council, the zoning districts
adjoining each side of such street, alley, or public way shall be
automatically extended to the center of such vacation, and all area
included in the vacation shall be subject to all regulations of the
extended district.

contradict those shown on the Official Zoning District Map, or in
case any other uncertainty exists, the location of district
boundaries shall be determined by the Director of Community
Development according to the procedures of Section 403.130.

Special Purpose Zoning Districts
Section 404.180. R-O, Restricted Overlay District. [R.O. 1996
§ 404.180; Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
A. Intent. By providing for flexible use or property development standards
tailored to individual projects or specific properties, the R-O, Restricted
Overlay District is intended to:
1. Ensure compatibility among incompatible or potentially
incompatible land uses;
2. Ease the transition from one (1) zoning district to another;
3. Address sites or land uses with special requirements;
4. Guide development in unusual situations or unique circumstances,
through a higher degree of specific planning for the site and
vicinity; and
5. Integrate a mix of different uses in a compact and walkable pattern
to meet the targets and range of uses identified for the places in the
Comprehensive Plan.
B. Applicability. The R-O, Restricted Overlay District, may be applied in
combination with any base zoning district through the planned
development process in Chapter 403. Although the R-O zoning may be
more specific and apply to a specific development project, the plan to
support the R-O zoning shall consider the broader context and consist
of at least ten (10) acres. Where any of this area is not under the control
of the applicant, this plan may document existing conditions and likely
future conditions of land use, development patterns, scale and intensity
of buildings, open space systems and street networks and streetscape
design, and how the proposed development impacts that context
through the criteria of the planned development process.
C. Use And Property Development Standards. The R-O, Restricted Overlay
District, can be used to modify and restrict the use and property
development standards of an underlying base zoning district. All
requirements of an R-O District are in addition to and supplement all
other applicable standards and requirements of the underlying zoning
district. Restrictions and conditions imposed by an R-O District may
include the following:
1. Identifying the specific uses or range of uses as permitted,
accessory or conditional uses, and in particular where those uses or
restrictions differ from the base zoning district(s);
2. Specifying the number or average density of dwelling units that
may be constructed throughout the project;

[R.O. 1996 § 404.200; Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
3. Specifying the types, location and amount of open spaces for
different purposes (open space system, frontage types, and buffers,
screens and landscape) throughout the project;
4. Adjusting the lot and building type standards to establish better
relationships to the streetscapes and open spaces;
5. Restrictions on access to abutting properties and nearby roads,
including specific design features;
6. Adjusting the application and effect of any of the general
development standards in Chapter 407; and
7. Any other design or development conditions that coordinate
different aspects of the planned development either within the plan
or with adjacent property.
D. Method Of Adoption. Restrictions imposed through an R-O District are
considered part of this Development Code text and Official Zoning Map.
All property included in an R-O District shall be identified on the Zoning
Map by adding the letters "R-O" to the base zoning district symbol. The
ordinance zoning or rezoning property to the R-O District shall
specifically state the modifications imposed pursuant to the R-O
District. The restrictions imposed shall be considered part of the text of
this Development Code and a violation of the restrictions shall be a
violation of this Development Code. The restrictions shall continue in
full force and effect until modified by the City Council by amendment to
this Development Code.
A. Intent. The intent of the ADP-O, Adams Dairy Parkway Overlay District
is to:
1. Provide for a high-quality, comprehensively designed and
developed corridor that is well planned and well maintained;
2. Provide for incremental development and improvement of
individual sites in a compatible manner, encouraging the most
appropriate use;
3. Protect property and building values and value of City investments
in the Adams Dairy Parkway Corridor and to maintain the tax base
and foster development of quality commercial and residential
structures;

Section 404.220. PR-O, Planned Residential Overlay District. [R.O.
1996 § 404.220; Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
(4) Providing dedicated easements, access ways, or linear
parks for general public use as part of a plan for the public
realm that better coordinates street types in Section
406.020, open space systems in Section 406.030, and
frontage types in Section 407.030 [maximum allowed —
twenty (20) percentage points].
b. The applicant has or will donate or sell land to the City for uses
for which the City deems a reduction in open space is
appropriate.
2. In no case shall the open space requirement result in a reduction of
the setback along Adams Dairy Parkway.
A. Intent. The intent of the Planned Residential Overlay District (PR-O
District) is to encourage unique and high quality neighborhood
development through an integrated neighborhood plan that provides
flexibility to the underlying residential zoning district regulations. The
use of the PR-O District can enhance the quality of development and
amenities, improve the design of the public realm, increase
compatibility between adjacent uses and developments, and reduce
negative impacts by using techniques such as: large-scale
developments; efficient use of land; innovative and imaginative
architectural approaches; design and site planning standards;
conservation and preservation of natural resources; urban amenities;
and greater open space. The following are specific objectives of the PRO
District:
1. Planned residential developments are groupings of buildings or
building sites that are planned as an integrated unit or clustered
under unified control or ownership. The sale, subdivision or other
partition of the property after zoning approval does not exempt the
project or portions thereof from complying with the development
standards, architectural quality, sign concepts and other conditions
that were established at the time of rezoning. The submission and
approval of concept and final plans represents a commitment by
the developer that development will follow approved plans in all
respects.
2. Planned residential developments should be designed in a manner
that will produce more usable open space, better recreational
opportunities and more attractive neighborhoods than would be
produced using the minimum standards contained in the
underlying residential zoning district regulations.
3. Encourage land that is to be annexed into the City of Blue Springs,
where appropriate, be planned:
Section
404.200
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
404.220
AO:526
a. To meet the increasing need for residential units in all price
ranges;
b. To provide amenities that enhance the overall quality of life
within the planned development and surrounding community;
c. To improve the design quality of residential units within the
City;
d. To coordinate with the City on capital improvements that are
needed to serve new development areas; and
e. To implement the Comprehensive Plan or any other master
planning documents approved by the City Council.
4. The developer may be given latitude in using innovative techniques
in the development of land not otherwise developable with
conventional zoning requirements.
B. Applicability. The PR-O District regulations may be applied in
combination with any base residential zoning district through the
planned development process in Chapter 403. The proposed plan may
include different regulations or additional development rules and
standards for properties within the PR-O District. In case of conflict
between the PR-O District regulations of this Section and other
regulations in this Title, the PR-O regulations of this Section shall
control. Where no special PR-O District regulation is stated, the
regulations of the underlying residential zoning district shall control.
C. Allowed Uses. In any PR-O District, unless otherwise restricted, any use
permitted in the underlying (base) zoning district shall be permitted.
The uses permitted in a PR-O District may be voluntarily restricted by
the applicant, or restricted as a condition of approval of the concept or
final plan by the Planning Commission or City Council.
D. Modification Of Underlying District Regulations. The PR-O District may
modify the underlying district regulations through the planned
development procedures in Chapter 403, and specifically through a
concept plan identifying the modifications and the reasons for
modifications to base standards. Changes in the allowed uses are not
allowed through the PR-O District except that duplexes may be allowed
in the SF-7 underlying zoning district through an approved PR-O
concept plan.
E. Planned Residential Development Design Standards. All PR-O Districts
shall be subject to the residential design standards in Section 407.080.
In addition to any other applicable design standards in Chapter 407, the
following standards shall also apply to the PR-O District.
1. Streetscape. All streets in the PR-O District shall be planned and
designed according to the street types identified in the Public
Works Design and Construction Manual and Section 406.020.

2. Streetlighting. Streetlighting may be provided within the
landscaping area. All poles shall be aluminum or other approved
metal. The lighting fixtures should be ornamental or decorative
where appropriate and maintained and all costs borne by the HOA
or the streetlighting utility company.
3. Entry Features. Subdivisions shall be designed to include entry
features that identify the neighborhood along collector and arterial
streets. Nothing shall be erected, placed, or planted, or allowed to
grow in such a manner which obstructs the view of the traveling
public based on the latest edition of the American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Green Book
sight distance standards. Signage may also be located within a
median area at the entrance to a subdivision. These features may
include special landscape, monument, signage, lighting and other
appropriate features. All improvements constructed within the
right-of-way shall be maintained by the Homeowners' Association.
4. Homeowners' Association (HOA) Covenants And Restrictions. Each
subdivision must adopt covenants and restrictions that, at a
minimum, are approved by the City and regulate the following:

subdivision to recover its costs to enter and maintain or repair
any right-of-way buffer or other improvements including
stormwater facilities or abating a nuisance on common area, or
revoke occupancy permits for failure to maintain common
areas such as storm detention which results in a nuisance or
lack of functionality of the improvement;
j. A no build easement across common area that may not be
relinquished or released without written approval by the City
Council;

Section 404.240. DDC, Downtown Development Code. [R.O. 1996
§ 404.240; Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
k. A change in the use of common area may not take place
without the written consent of the City Council; and
l. Prohibits any amendments of dissolution of the HOA without
the written consent of the City Council.
5. Residential Open Space. Every planned residential development
containing ten (10) or more dwelling units shall provide open space
that meets the type, design and location criteria of Section
406.030. In addition to the types of open spaces identified in
Section 406.030, private open spaces such as golf courses or
recreation centers with buildings including outdoor recreation
spaces may contribute to the open space system requirements for
the PR-O District.
6. Residential Density Bonus. If a planned development containing ten
(10) or more dwelling units includes an open space system that
exceeds the requirements and public benefits identified in Section
406.030, and is accessible from public and/or private streets, then
the subdivision may be allowed up to ten percent (10%) more
dwelling units per acre than the base zoning allows. These bonus
dwelling units must be compatible with and integrated into the
overall design of the planned development.
7. Landscaping. Each lot shall be landscaped in accordance with the
planting unit calculation identified in Section 407.040, provided
that, no less than forty-five (45) planting units shall be provided.
However, at least twenty-four (24) of the planting units shall be
deciduous trees that are a minimum of two and one-half (2 1/2) inch
calipers in size. The right-of-way buffer shall be provided as
described in Section 407.040(D) as an easement or separate tract
of land and shall be maintained by the HOA. All residential open
space areas, shall be seeded or sodded and landscaped and the
seeding or sodding and landscaping shall be perpetually
maintained.
A. Intent.
1. The intent of the Downtown Development Code (DDC) is to support
and implement the 2006 Master Plan as amended from time to time
for downtown that the City of Blue Springs has adopted.
2. The DDC is meant to reinforce key concepts and components of the
plan, such as:
(a) Creating a dynamic, mixed-use environment, where walking is
the predominant mode of transportation.
Section
404.220
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
404.240
AO:529
(b) Providing for a range of housing choices in close proximity to
each other, including vertical mixed use.
(c) Creative land development solutions that are not typically
found elsewhere in the City.
(d) Quality public spaces that are usable for a variety of public and
semipublic activities.
(e) Higher standards of design and construction for buildings,
public infrastructure and landscaping.
(f) A high degree of connectivity for pedestrian and vehicular
traffic.
(g) Buildings placed close to the street, so that streets and squares
are defined as "outdoor rooms."
(h) Utilizing all the streets for on-street parking. Parking lots and
garages shall not front the street.
(i) Expediting the development process to make conforming to the
plan easy.
B. Exclusions. For the property located within the area of the Downtown
Zoning Map, the standards contained in this Section supersede
provisions contained within the Blue Springs Unified Development
Code. Sections 403.070, 404.180 and 404.220 shall not be applied
within the area covered by the DDC.
C. Conceptual Framework And T-Zones.
1. Because of the unique characteristics of downtown Blue Springs, a
subclassification of organizing property and uses is established
with the DDC. The subclassifications for this Section are called
"transect zones" (T-Zones). T-Zones differ from conventional zoning
districts in that they are inherently mixed use and place more
emphasis on design than building use. The different T-Zones
establish a variety of scales, intensities and characteristics to
account for the differing conditions in the plan area. The zones are
shown in graphic format in the Downtown Zoning Map. Additional
requirements are also shown in the Downtown Zoning Map
Overlay. The DDC shall apply to those properties shown on the
Downtown Zoning Map. The zoning districts shown below may only
be applied to property shown in the corresponding color on the
Downtown Zoning Map.
2. T-Zone Definitions For This Section.
(a) T3 Sub-Urban. The most natural, least dense, most residential
context of a community.
Section
404.240
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
404.240
AO:530
(b) T4 General Urban. A predominantly residential context,
typically the largest zone within a community. It allows for the
widest variety of housing choice.
(c) T5 Urban Center. A denser, mixed-use context, typically
located near the center of a pedestrian shed or as a corridor
along important thoroughfares.
(d) CS Civic Space Zone. Sites reserved for civic buildings and/or
civic space.
The zones may be designated, for example, as a T3 or T-3 zone.
D. Performance Standards. The intent of the DDC is to allow for a mixture
of uses, often adjacent to or very close to each other. Issues of noise,
trash and operational hours are to be closely coordinated. Specific
standards include:
1. Businesses providing drive-up services shall not have a drivethrough
lane or window that abuts or faces a public street.
2. Outdoor eating areas for bars, taverns or restaurants are allowed
on the public sidewalk in zones T4 and T5 where the paved
sidewalk is a minimum of ten (10) feet wide and the location is
approved by the Director of Public Works. A minimum clear
sidewalk width meeting ADA requirements shall be provided and
maintained in an unobstructed condition.
E. Permitted Uses And Uses Allowed By Conditional Use. Within the area
covered by the DDC, a wide variety of uses and structures, from
residential to commercial, are allowed or allowed by conditional use. All
conditional uses and structures must be approved by the Downtown
Review Board. Structures shall be regulated by T-Zone. [Ord. No.

reduced by a factor of 0.9.
I. Signs. Sign regulations are governed by Chapter 501 of the City Code.
J. Roadway Standards. In general, roadways are to be designed for slower
design speeds to ensure the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists and
motorists. This entails narrower lane widths, the provision of on-street
parking on all roadway types and small curb radii at intersections. A
variety of roadway types are encouraged, and block perimeters should
be small. Specific Roadway Standards are noted in Appendix A, DDC
Roadway Design Criteria.71
K. Landscaping And Screening. [Ord. No. 4723, 3-19-2018]
1. A reasonable amount of landscaping is required with emphasis on
softening the visual impact of parking areas and enhancing the
overall appearance. Allowed species of trees may be placed in the
public right-of-way at the discretion of the Director of Public Works
with written approval. All required trees shall follow
recommendations of Great Trees for Blue Springs included in
Appendix A3 of the Comprehensive Plan.72 A minimum of one (1)
small street tree per twenty-five (25) feet of right-of-way frontage
or one (1) large street tree per forty (40) feet of right-of-way
frontage is required.

L. Building Materials. High-quality masonry building materials approved
for this district are stone, brick, cast stone and stucco. Synthetic stone,
such as pre-manufactured fiberglass, cultured stone, or glass-fiber
reinforced concrete, is permitted, provided that it is identical in
appearance and of equal or greater durability to natural stone. These
masonry materials shall be required on fifty percent (50%) of the sum
total of all building facades, except single-family houses which shall
have ten percent (10%) of the sum total of all facades. All accessory
units and garages shall be constructed from the same materials as the
main structure. "Stucco" in the DDC shall mean traditional stucco or
gypsum concrete/plaster materials with smooth sand finish. Exterior

[R.O. 1996 § 405.010; Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
A. Intent. This Section provides standards for a variety of building types.
Building types address the scale, siting, and primary intended use of a
building. The standards for different building types establish the
relationship of buildings to the public realm, and the compatibility of
types on a block or street. In combination with use standards, building
type standards reinforce the character of different zoning districts.

Duplex A building designed to
accommodate two primary
dwelling units that share a
common wall or floor/
ceiling. A duplex may be on
a single lot, or it may be
platted as separate lots
along the common wall line
subject to platting
restrictions. Variations of
this type based on scale and
lot size include standard lot
and neighborhood lot. Other
variations applicable to the
Downtown Development
code relate to configurations
of the units and include flat
over flat, paired house and
tandem house.
Duplex — Neighborhood
Row House A building type designed to
accommodate 3 to 7
dwelling units where each
unit is separated by a
common side wall and each
has its own private entrance.
Units may be on a single lot
subject to common
ownership restrictions or
platted on separate lots
along the common wall
subject to platting
restrictions.

• Walk-Up — a small
footprint/small-lot building,
two to four stories,
designed for 3 to 12
dwelling units.
Apartment — Walk-Up
• Low-Rise — a moderate
footprint/moderate-lot
building, two to four
stories, designed for 6 to 24
dwelling units.
Apartment — Low-Rise

larger variations in special
circumstances, designed for
24 to 120 units. Apartment — Mid-Rise
Apartment
Complex
A grouping of apartment
buildings in a common
development arranged
around an internal system of
streets/internal access,
walkways and common open
space. Variations are based
on the density of dwelling
units per parcel or lot area.

Accessory
Dwelling
(Building)
A building designed to
accommodate a secondary
and subordinate dwelling
unit on the same lot as a
primary dwelling unit. While
some accessory dwellings
may be in the principle
building of a detached
house, a common variant is
in a detached accessory
building, subject to all of the
lot and design standards of
the district.
Live/Work A building designed for a
primary dwelling unit but
has a secondary component
— typically at the building
frontage — designed for a
commercial and
occupational function of the
resident. Live/work
buildings may be on an
individual lot (most similar
to a small mixed-use
building) or attached by a
common wall with other live/
work buildings (most similar
to a row house).
Small Civic
Building
A building designed for a
small civic, institutional or
public use, with the building
design and site design
creating compatibility with
the residential scale and
neighborhood character of
the area.

Small
Commercial
A building designed to
accommodate a small retail,
commercial, service or office
function, typically one to two
stories. The buildings small
footprint and lot, and the
design of the frontage and
front portion of the building
to accommodate customer
or patron interaction allows
this building type to mix well
with other commercial uses
in a mixed-use context.

Table 405.010-3: Non-Residential Building Type Descriptions
Mixed Use A building designed to
accommodate ground floor
retail or commercial use
with frequent pedestrian
interaction, and upper level
residential, office or
commercial uses that
support the overall vitality of
retail on the site or in the
district. This building is
typically 2 to 4 stories.
Variations may include a
small-footprint small-lot
building designed for the
potential of a common party
wall or with very small
setbacks, or buildings
designed at the scale of a
half-block with multiple
tenancies and entrances
particularly at street level
(occupying the entire street
frontage along a single block
face).
Pad Site A free standing building
similar to a small
commercial building, but on
a larger lot that includes
more space for frontage
designs, landscape and
buffers, and access and
circulations. While pad site
buildings are free standing,
better planning and site
design can allow a series of
these buildings to create
improved relationships with
major streetscapes and also
become screens or liner
buildings for larger general
commercial buildings which
are set back from the public
realm.

is reasonably practicable, all subject to the limitations of this
Chapter. The limitations of this Chapter are intended to recognize
the interests of the property owner in continuing to use the
property but to control the expansion of the non-conformity and to
Section
405.070
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.080
AO:611
control re-establishment of abandoned uses and limit reestablishment
of buildings and structures that have been
substantially destroyed.
3. Authority To Continue. Non-conformities shall be allowed to
continue in accordance with the regulations of this Chapter.
4. Determination Of Non-Conformity Status. The burden of
establishing that a non-conformity lawfully exists is to be the
owner's burden and not the City's.
5. Repairs And Maintenance. Repairs and normal maintenance
required to keep non-conforming uses, non-conforming structures
and non-conforming signs in a safe condition shall be permitted,
provided that no alterations shall be made except those allowed by
this Chapter or required by law or ordinance.
6. Change Of Tenancy Or Ownership. Changes of tenancy, ownership
or management of an existing non-conformity shall be permitted,
provided there is no change in the nature or character, extent or
intensity of such non-conformity.
B. Non-Conforming Uses. Non-conforming uses shall be subject to the
following standards:
1. Enlargement. No non-conforming use shall be enlarged, expanded
or extended to occupy a greater area of land or floor area than was
occupied on November 18, 1996, and no additional accessory use,
building or structure shall be established on the site of a nonconforming
use. This provision notwithstanding, uses may be
extended throughout any part of a building or other structure that
was lawfully and manifestly designed or arranged for such use on
November 18, 1996.
2. Relocation. No non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other portion of such parcel nor to another lot unless
the use will be in conformance with the use regulations of the
district into which it is moved.
3. Discontinuance And Abandonment. If a non-conforming use ceases
for any reason for a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive
months (except where government action causes such cessation),
the subsequent use of such parcel or lot shall conform to the
regulations and provisions set by this Development Code for the
district in which such parcel or lot is located.
4. Damage Or Destruction. In the event that any structure that is
devoted in whole or in part to a non-conforming use is damaged or
destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than fifty percent
(50%) of its structural value prior to such destruction, such
structure shall not be restored unless such structure and the use
thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning
Section
405.080
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
405.080
AO:612
district in which it is located. The determination of such reduced
structural valuation shall be made by the City. When such damage
or destruction is fifty percent (50%) or less, no repair or restoration
shall be made unless a building permit is obtained within six (6)
months and restoration is actually begun within one (1) year after
the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to
completion.
5. Change In Use. A non-conforming use may be changed to a new
use, provided that the new use shall be of the same general
character or of a character less intensive (and thus more closely
conforming) than the existing, non-conforming use. The initial
determination of whether a proposed use is a conforming use or is
less intense shall be made by the Director of Community
Development, with an appeal to the Board of Adjustment. A nonconforming
use, if changed to a conforming use or less intensive
non-conforming use, may not thereafter be changed back to a less
conforming use than that to which it was changed.
6. Residential Uses In Non-Residential Districts. The other provisions
of this Section notwithstanding, any structure that is devoted to a
non-conforming residential use and that is located in an NB or
more intensive district may be remodeled, extended, expanded and
enlarged; provided that after any such remodeling, extension,
expansion or enlargement, such structure shall not be used to
accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units than
such structure accommodated prior to any such work.
7. Accessory Uses. No use which is accessory to a principal nonconforming
use shall continue after such principal use ceases or
terminates.
8. Outdoor storage, recycling collection stations, recycling collection
centers and solid waste collection and processing facilities. A nonconforming
use of land for outdoor storage for the sale of
merchandise may be continued only until July 18, 1996, after which
time the use shall be brought into full compliance with the use
regulations of the underlying zoning district. Any non-conforming
recycling collection station, recycling collection center or solid
waste collection or processing facility shall, by July 18, 1996, be
made to comply with all of the provisions of this Development Code
or be removed.
9. Redevelopment Seeking Deviations, Modifications And/or Waivers
Pursuant To Section 403.140. Redevelopment [as such term is
defined in Section 403.140(D)(2) of this UDC] which is completed
in accordance with an approved redevelopment modification plan
pursuant to Section 403.140 shall not be deemed to violate the
enlargement, relocation or damage or destruction provisions of this
Section. Redevelopment so constructed will, from the date of
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, have legal non-conforming
Section
405.080
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.080
AO:613
status pursuant to this Section, but also shall be subject to all the
provisions hereof.
C. Non-Conforming Structures. Non-conforming structures shall be
subject to the following standards:
1. Enlargement. Any expansion of a non-conforming structure that
increases the degree of non-conformance shall be prohibited. Other
expansions of the structure shall be permitted and shall not require
a variance. The initial determination of whether a proposed
expansion increases the degree of non-conformity shall be made by
the Director of Community Development with an appeal to the
Board of Adjustment.
2. Damage Or Destruction. In the event that any non-conforming
structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of
more than fifty percent (50%) of its structural value prior to such
destruction, such structure shall not be restored except in
conformance with the regulations for the zoning district in which it
is located. When a structure is damaged to the extent of fifty
percent (50%) or less, no repairs or restoration shall be made
unless a building permit is obtained within six (6) months, and
restoration is actually begun within one (1) year after the date of
such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
The determination of such reduced structural valuation shall be
made by the City.
3. Relocation. Non-conforming structures shall not be moved unless
the movement or relocation will bring the structure into
compliance with all applicable zoning district regulations.
4. Redevelopment Seeking Deviations, Modifications And/or Waivers
Pursuant To Section 403.140. Redevelopment [as such term is
defined in Section 403.140(D)(2) of this UDC] which is completed
in accordance with an approved redevelopment modification plan
pursuant to Section 403.140 shall not be deemed to violate the
enlargement, relocation or damage or destruction provisions of this
Section. Redevelopment so constructed, from the date of issuance
of a certificate of occupancy, will have legal non-conforming status,
pursuant to this Section, but also shall be subject to all the
provisions hereof.
D. Non-Conforming Signs.
1. Policy. It is the policy of the City to encourage and, to the maximum
extent practicable, require that all signs within the City be brought
into compliance with the requirements of Chapter 501.
2. Non-Conforming Signs Protected. A sign which was lawfully
erected prior to November 18, 1996, but which does not comply in
one (1) or more respects with the requirements of Chapter 501 may
Section
405.080
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
405.080
AO:614
remain in use, subject to all other applicable requirements of this
Development Code.
3. Signs Offered Additional Protection. Existing institutional bulletin
boards and signs, building markers, directional signs, subdivision
entrance signs and incidental signs shall not be affected by the
other parts of this Section, except that should said signs be
removed, replaced or substantially altered, they shall be brought
into conformity with Chapter 501.
4. Limitations On Non-Conforming Signs.
a. Change of copy or the substitution of panels or faces on nonconforming
signs shall be permitted. Repairs and maintenance
of non-conforming signs, such as repainting, electrical repairs
and neon tubing, shall be permitted.
b. It shall be unlawful to enlarge, structurally alter or move off
premises any existing sign, except in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 501.
c. Any non-conforming sign that ceases being used or ceases
being leased for a continuous period of one (1) year shall not be
reused for sign purposes until it is brought into full compliance
with the standards of Chapter 501.
d. Any non-conforming sign that pertains to a business or
institution that ceases operation for a period of six (6) months
or more shall not be reused for sign purposes until it is brought
into full compliance with the standards of Chapter 501.
e. Any time that a building permit is issued for work on a building
on a lot where such work enlarges the building floor area by
more than twenty percent (20%), or involves work with a
permitted value equal to one-half (1/2) or more of the taxable
value of the building or structure then located on the lot, any
non-conforming signs on the property shall be brought into
compliance with the provisions of Chapter 501 as part of the
construction project with such work to be completed before
permanent occupancy of the new or remodeled premises.
5. Treatment In Master Signage Plan. The master signage plan shall
contain a proposed plan for treatment of non-conforming signs on a
property as new signs are added. The following principles shall
control such a proposed plan:
a. Any addition of new signage to a property should be offset by a
proportionate reduction in the amount of non-conforming
signage on the property. That is, if a new sign will account for
ten percent (10%) of the permitted signage on the property,
then the non-conforming signage on the property should be
Section
405.080
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
405.080
AO:615
reduced by at least ten percent (10%) at the time that the new
signage is installed.
b. For any property for which the master signage plan contains
provisions consistent with Chapter 501, existing nonconforming
signs on the property may be disregarded in
computing the maximum total sign area permitted on the
property.
6. Redevelopment Seeking Deviations, Modifications And/or Waivers
Pursuant To Section 403.140. Redevelopment [as such term is
defined in Section 403.140(D)(2) of this UDC] which is completed
in accordance with any approved redevelopment modification plan
pursuant to Section 403.140 shall not be deemed to violate the
limitations on non-conforming signs provision of Section
405.080(D)(4)(e). Redevelopment so constructed, from the date of
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, will have legal nonconforming
status, pursuant to this Section, but also shall be
subject to all the provisions hereof.
E. Other Non-Conformities.
1. Applicability. The types of other non-conformities to which this
Section applies include, but are not necessarily limited to: fence
height or location; lack of or inadequate landscape buffers; lack of
or inadequate landscaping; lack of or inadequate off-street parking;
and other non-conformities not involving zoning district use or
property development standards.
2. Enlargement Or Change In Use. Where an addition, enlargement or
change in use is proposed to an extent in excess of twenty-five
percent (25%) of the floor area of the existing buildings or
structures, the entire lot shall be brought into conformance with
presently existing requirements of this Development Code as to
landscaping, buffering, off-street parking and other non-use and
non-property development regulations of this Development Code.
3. Redevelopment Seeking Deviations, Modifications And/or Waivers
Pursuant To Section 403.140. Redevelopment [as such term is
defined in Section 403.140(D)(2) of this UDC] which is completed
in accordance with an approved redevelopment modification plan
pursuant to Section 403.140 shall not be deemed to violate the
enlargement or change in use provisions of this Section.
Redevelopment so constructed, from the date of issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, will have legal non-conforming status,
pursuant to this Section, but also shall be subject to all the
provisions hereof.
F. Non-Conformities Created By Public Action. When lot area or setbacks
are reduced as a result of conveyance to a Federal, State or local
government for a public purpose and the remaining area is at least

A. Intent. It is the intent of this Section to:
1. Prioritize planning street networks and designing street types as an
important part of the civic infrastructure of the community.
2. Recognize rights-of-way as the most prominent part of the public
realm and the design of streets as a key determinant of community
character.
3. Value the design, function, appropriate application of different
types of streets in creating places and supporting development,
rather than solely moving cars.
4. Provide for efficient and safe movement of all potential users of the
streets, including pedestrians, bicycles, automobiles, and trucks or
transit.
5. Plan street networks that allow the design of streets to transition
along their length to best support anticipated and adjacent land
uses, building types and development patterns.
6. Improve access to places, blocks and lots with multiple connections
by different routes and different modes of transportation.
7. Implement the City's Comprehensive Plan, and specifically the
Transportation Plan and Livable Streets Policy with balanced
designs, so the interests of a single mode of transportation do not
unnecessarily compromise other modes of transportation.
8. Ensure the proper arrangement of blocks and lots within the
structure of the transportation network and civic space systems.
Section
406.010
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
406.020
AO:621
9. Create buildable lots based on required zoning and setback
standards, topography and other context.
10. Layout a pattern of lots and blocks that considers the proper
function for drainage, topography, lot access, and efficient utility
service.
B. Network Layout.
1. Generally. Arterial, collector and local streets shall generally be
laid out according to the policies of the Comprehensive Plan and
Major Street Plan, Chapter 360, and specifically any specific plans
created under the guidance of those plans. Network specific design
details are provided in the Public Works Design and Construction
Manual.
2. External Connections. Streets shall provide for the continuation of
streets in adjacent subdivisions and to future growth areas at
intervals that meet these standards, unless such continuation is
considered unnecessary by the City Council based on generally
accepted sound planning principles applied to that particular
context. Where street connections to adjacent areas are to be
provided for future use of those areas, they shall be constructed to
the subdivision boundary or to a point as close as practicable to
said boundaries and terminated with a barrier meeting MUTCD78
requirements.
3. Off-Sets. Slight jogs in continuous streets at points of intersection
with other streets shall not be permitted unless due to topography.
Where offsets cannot be avoided, a minimum distance of one
hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be established between center
lines of the intersecting streets.
4. Marginal Access Streets. Where marginal access streets are
required, the owner shall be responsible for improving said
marginal access streets according to City standards and shall
dedicate, after construction, such streets and rights-of-way to the
City of Blue Springs. A landscaped strip at least twenty (20) feet
wide shall be provided between a marginal access street and the
adjacent street. If such strip is dedicated to the City and accepted,
the City shall be responsible for maintenance thereof. If it is not
dedicated and accepted by the City, the POA79 shall be responsible
for maintenance of same.
5. Special Treatment Along Major Streets. When a subdivision abuts
or contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector street, the
City Council, upon the recommendation of the Planning
Commission, may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage
with a non-access reservation containing the landscape buffer

required by Section 407.040(D) along the rear property line, or
such other treatment as might be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties, to afford separation of through
and local traffic, and to retain the traffic carrying capacity of the
major street system. All such improvements shall be subject to the
approval of the Director of Public Works and the City Council.
6. Details for the following list of items are covered in the Public
Works Design and Construction Manual and design and
construction shall meet or exceed the standards and requirements
contained in such manual:
a. Cul-de-sac streets.
b. Terminus of roads other than culs-de-sac.
c. Alternate connections.
d. Intersections.
e. Marginal access streets.
f. Other required streets.
g. Special treatment along major streets.
h. Streetlighting.
C. Block Arrangement.
1. Generally. All blocks shall be arranged to have two tiers of lots,
each fronting on a public street. Double-frontage lots are generally
prohibited, except that blocks platted along intervening natural
features or parts of the civic space systems, regional transportation
routes or limited access roads may have lots that back to these
features provided there is an adequate buffer provided according
to Section 407.040(D). Residential lots shall generally not front on
a Standard Arterial or Standard Collector street types.
2. Blocks And Connectivity. Streets shall be laid out to provide a
network of blocks and streets based on the context and
development pattern. Table 407.020-1 establishes the basic block
structure for different place types in the Comprehensive Plan:

preserves these features and integrates them into the overall
structure of the community.
b. Regional Transportation Routes. Blocks or parcels abutting
intervening regional transportation routes such as highways or
rail rights-of-way may be larger, provided that street layouts
and development patterns achieve local connectivity in all
other ways possible.
c. Rural Parcels. Tracts divided into larger or rural lots may be
more than ten (10) acres, provided development is arranged to
allow future streets in compliance with these regulations, and
a logical pattern of resubdivision can occur with minimal
disruption of buildings, utilities, and other structures.
d. Oversized Parcels. Where oversized parcels are platted for
special land uses or development projects that involve largescale
buildings and patterns, such as campuses, large-scale
commercial areas, platted blocks may be larger, provided
internal access streets mimic the block structure and urban
design amenity of these standards, and create logical
extensions and connectivity to the public streetscapes.

D. Street Design.
1. Design Types. Streets shall be designed to reinforce the character
of the area and anticipated development pattern and land use
based upon the place types of the Comprehensive Plan. Each
functional classification may use the following street types so that
urban design features and cross sections better support the
development context and character of the area. Standards and
guidelines for rights-of-way widths, cross-section designs and
application of street types are found in the Public Works Design
and Construction Manual and the design and construction shall
meet the standards set out therein.

Neighborhood Street. The Neighborhood street design type is
appropriate where an improve neighborhood design amenity,
increased walkability, or a more compact and mixed-density
residential pattern is desired. It is characterized by large street
trees, sidewalks, narrow lanes, occasional on-street parking and
slow vehicle speeds.
Section
406.020
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
406.020
AO:625
Natural Street. The Natural street design type is appropriate for
areas where any natural features exist and are emphasized as an
urban design amenity, and particularly to implement the Image
Streets or LINC System on the City Image Framework of the
Comprehensive Plan. It is characterized by narrower roadways
with slow to moderate speeds and larger, informal and natural
landscape edges.
Activity Street. The activity street design type is appropriate for
areas where a high degree of pedestrian activity is desired and
particularly to implement the Pedestrian Priority Areas in the
Connections Framework of the Comprehensive Plan. It is
characterized by narrow lanes, slow speeds, on-street parking,
and a large, well designed pedestrian amenity zone to support
businesses and economic activity along these blocks.
2. Street Dimensions. In creating specific street sections for platting
streets, the following specifications and guidance shall be used:
a. The Public Works Design and Construction Manual Street
Types.

Urban Thoroughfares: A Context Sensitive Approach.
f. Kansas City Metropolitan Chapter of the American Public
Works Association Standard Specifications and Design
Criteria, Section 5200.
3. General Street Planning Standards.
a. Streets. All streets shall be designed to provide adequate
facilities for surface drainage. Drainage facilities shall comply
with the provisions of the Public Works Design and
Construction Manual and the design and construction shall
meet the standards and requirements set out therein.
b. Half-Street Improvements. Half-street improvements are
required when a subdivision abuts an existing street and where
unusual circumstances make them essential to the reasonable
development of a tract in conformance with this Chapter.
c. Decorative Islands.
(1) Decorative islands, when specifically approved by the City
Council, islands to be used for landscaping, statuary or
other decorative purposes may be constructed by an
owner in the center of a cul-de-sac or other roadway
pavement section. Decorative islands shall not be
approved if it is possible that their installation would in
any way impede traffic or create unsafe conditions, as
determined by the Director of Public Works.
(2) If decorative islands are approved, the owner shall, as a
condition of such approval, assign full responsibility for
maintenance of such islands to the Property Owners'
Association created by the owner for the subdivision.
Provisions of the Property Owners' Association articles of
agreement related to such maintenance shall be reviewed
and approved by the City Council before approval of the
final plat.
d. Private Streets: Private streets are generally unacceptable in
subdivisions in which any of the streets are dedicated to the
public. Exceptions will be considered in commercial and
Section
406.020
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
406.020
AO:627
industrial subdivisions, mobile home parks and planned unit
developments if:
(1) They are constructed to standards of the City of Blue
Springs Design and Construction Manual;
(2) A Property Owners' Association shall be formed to
maintain any private street with covenants in place to
assure that the City may tax bill or place a lien on all lots if
it becomes necessary to enter and repair or maintain such
private streets in a sufficient condition to allow utility, Cityowned
and emergency vehicles to enter and navigate
safely;
(3) A covenant is placed on all lots that requires a notice in
any and all sales contracts of any lot or portion thereof or
other interest in real estate other than a lease that the
property owners are responsible for the maintenance of
the streets in the subdivision; and
(4) An ingress egress easement is deeded to the City to allow
for entry for utility providers, code enforcement officials,
emergency responders, ambulance, police and fire
purposes.
e. Street Names And Signs. Street names shall not duplicate
names of any existing street in Blue Springs and adjacent
communities except where a new street is a continuation of an
existing street. Street names that are spelled differently but
sound the same shall be avoided. Generally no street should
change direction by more than ninety degrees (90°) without a
change in street name. The street name pattern previously
adopted by Blue Springs shall be continued except as approved
by the Community Development Director. Reflective street
signs, meeting the requirements of the MUTCD. Reflective
street signs, approved by the Director of Public Works, will be
provided and installed by the City at all street intersections at
the owner's expense.
f. Abutting Streets.
(1) Arterials/Thoroughfare. Where a subdivision or
development borders an existing or proposed arterial
street, but does not utilize the arterial street for direct
access to individual lots, the subdivider or owner shall be
required to provide sufficient right-of-way for its future
widening or construction.
Where a development proposes to access one (1) or more
individual lots from an arterial which it borders, the
subdivider or owner shall be responsible for any additional
improvements as deemed necessary to maintain the
Section
406.020
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
406.020
AO:628
present level of service and provide for the safe and
efficient movement of traffic.
(2) Non-Arterials. Where a subdivision or development
borders an existing or proposed road, other than an
arterial, or where there are plans to realign or widen a
road that would require use of some of the land in a
subdivision, the applicant shall be required to dedicate the
additional right-of-way required to widen or realign such
roads. The applicant shall also be required to construct the
equivalent of one-half (1/2) of a local street and
appurtenances. In lieu of the construction required above,
the City Council may at a minimum require the applicant
to deposit in escrow an equivalent amount of cash.
g. Design For Persons With Disabilities. Access ramps for
disabled persons shall be installed whenever new curbing or
sidewalks are constructed or reconstructed in the City of Blue
Springs. New sidewalk ramps shall comply with the
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)80
and Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG)
standards and be subject to review and approval by the
Director of Public Works. These standards shall apply to any
City street or connecting street for which curbs and sidewalks
are required by this Chapter or on which curb and sidewalk
have been prescribed by the City Council. Sidewalk layout
plans for all public and private access ways, and for all internal
access and circulation requirements of Section 407.020 shall
be prepared by a professional engineer and submitted with
construction plan to demonstrate compliance with all
applicable ADA requirements. The intent of the sidewalk layout
plan is to ensure the grading for sites/lots integrates with the
sidewalk, enough right of way is reserved to facilitate
construction meeting ADA standards, pedestrian facilities on
and along sidewalks are accessible, ADA compliant cross
slopes are carried across proposed streets, driveways, and
entrances, and fixed objects do not protrude into pedestrian
travel routes. Items to include in this plan are:

right of way lines or radial to curved streets. Following completion
of streets in a development, a recognizable mark, acceptable to the
Director of Public Works, shall be cut in the back face of curbing to
show the intersection point of all side lot lines extended to said
streets. Such marks shall be in evidence when the street is
inspected for final acceptance by the City.
3. Lot Access. Lot access shall be limited by the specific street type,
and the access guidance provided for each street. Access for any
street may be further modified by any specific access management
study. Where access is limited by these standards and guidelines,
alternative access through shared drives, internal access lanes, or
alleys shall be considered.
4. Corner Visibility. On corner lots, nothing shall be erected, placed,
planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially

previously set out, and where such improvements meet the
requirements of this Chapter and are in good condition as
determined by the City Council upon its consideration of the
opinion of the Director of Public Works, no further provision
need be made by the subdivider or owner to duplicate such
improvements. However, where such existing improvements
do not meet said requirements as determined by the City
Council upon its consideration of the opinion of the Director of
Public Works, the subdivider or owner shall provide for the
repair, correction, or replacement of such improvements so

b. Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns
an area presently abutting or continuing any existing public
street of less than the minimum required right-of-way width or
roadway width, land shall be dedicated so as to provide a
minimum street right-of-way width established by this
Development Code or by the policy of the City Council; and the
subdivider or owner of such proposed subdivision shall provide
additional roadway pavement meeting the minimum standards
set by this Development Code and the City Council. The City
Council shall determine what adjustment to make where the
aforesaid widening merges with existing streets which are of

The City Council may reduce the minimum roadway system in
the proposed subdivision if the extension of such roadway is
already improved at each end of such roadway in the
subdivision and the roadway in the proposed subdivision is two
(2) blocks or less in length.
A. Intent. The intent of this Section is to:
1. Establish a system of open spaces as an important part of the civic
infrastructure of the community.
2. Value the design, function, appropriate application of different
types of open space, rather than solely the quantity of space.
3. Recognize open space, whether public, common or private, as a key
determinant of community character.
4. Develop a greater perceived impact from open space by
coordinating the design and location of open spaces throughout
development and across multiple development projects.
5. Consider the context and multiple functions that open spaces can
serve to support development, including ecological, recreation,
aesthetic and urban design functions.
6. Create focal points for the community, neighborhood, district, or
development site to which private development and site plans
should respond to.
7. Integrate natural systems into the design of common or public open
spaces.
8. Preserve buffers along stream corridors.
B. Applicability.
1. Generally. These standards apply to all divisions of land involving
more than five (5) acres. All platted lots shall have access to one or
Section
406.020
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
406.030
AO:632
more of the open space types in this Section, within the specified
service area.
2. Exceptions. Any lot platted within the service area for any of the
open space system types below does not require any new civic
spaces, provided:
a. It is public; or
b. It is private or common and the property owner has a right to
access this property through easements, covenants or other
formal documentation of the entity with ownership and control
of the civic space.
3. The open space requirement is in addition to any landscape,
setback, buffer or frontage type requirement, however effective
site design can allow areas to meet multiple standards.
C. Open Space Types. Open space systems shall be designed based on the
planning context. The following tables indicate the types of open spaces
that are eligible for each particular area based on the place types in the
Comprehensive Plan.81 Standards and specifications for each open
space type are provided in Subsection (E).
D. Requirements.
1. Amount. The amount of space required shall be based on the base
zoning district(s) proposed or existing for the project and based on
the table below.

2. Location Criteria. The following location criteria shall be used in
determining the most appropriate locations and characteristics of
land to be designated as required open space systems.
a. Priority should be given to areas that provided the most visible
impact.
(1) Formal open spaces (pocket parks, greens, squares, or
plazas) should be located at prominent focal points within
a subdivision or development site, and included in or
designed as an effective extension of the public rights-ofway,
or other common areas.
(2) Natural open space (preserves, parks and greenways,
trails, or large parks) should be located along prominent
ridges, valleys and view corridors or areas where other
natural features such as significant vegetation or water
features exist. See the Public Works Design and
Construction Manual Section 5600 for stream buffer
requirements.
b. Open spaces should be located to provide the greatest
connectivity of open space systems with adjacent and future
development sites.
(1) Formal open space should be located according to an
overall urban design theme for the area, considering
where planned future transportation systems, block
patterns, and key building and site entrances will be
located for the site and for adjacent areas.
(2) Natural open space should be located in areas that have
the greatest potential for future expansion and
connectivity to land areas with similar physical features
and ecological characteristics on adjacent sites.
c. Open space shall be located in areas that maximize its
functional characteristics.
(1) Formal open space shall be centered in areas that will
have the greatest population density or development
intensity in order to provide the greatest pedestrian
accessibility possible.
(2) Natural open space shall be located in areas where the
ecological, aesthetic, and recreational impact will be the
greatest.
3. Reductions Of Open Space Requirements. The amounts required in
Subsection (D)(1) above may be reduced:
a. Based on a plan through the planned development process that
meets or exceeds the intent of this Section;
Section
406.030
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
406.030
AO:634
b. To the point where any lesser percentage of open space will
clearly meet both the service area and level of service targets
identified in Subsection (E) below; or
c. Any application that dedicates open space to the public in a
type, location and design standard that is acceptable to meet
general public needs.
E. Design Standards. Open space systems shall be designed according the
specific type, and the standards below for each different type.
Preserve
The size, location, and design of a
preserve shall be dependent on
the planning context, the
presence of natural amenities and
ecological functions worthy of
protection, and the ability of the
designated area to provide
significant continuity with nearby
natural features. However in
general these areas should
provide the opportunity of at least
10 acres of contiguous preserved
area; and ideally up to 50 or more
acres.
Service Area
N/A
Level Of Service
10 acres per 1,000 people
Design Elements
Preserves include any area of existing or restored natural areas such
as riparian corridors, flood hazard areas, unique geological
formations, important habitats, significant plant types or substantial
groupings of important plant types, wetlands, etc. The goal is to
protect the edges to maximize intact areas that provide valuable
ecosystem services for development, support preservation goals or
enhance the aesthetics and amenities of the area. Location and design
should be based on the guidance of Appendix A3 of the Comprehensive
Plan, Natural Resources and Open Space Policy Map, and areas
capable of expansion through further adjacent preservation efforts
may be viewed more favorable.

Section 406.040. Sewer And Water Utilities. [R.O. 1996 § 406.040;
Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
Sanitary sewer and water supply facilities shall be designed and located
according to specifications and procedural requirements of the City of Blue
Springs Design and Construction Manual and with requirements of the
Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Missouri Department of Health,
and Missouri Clean Water Commission. This document is hereby made a
part of this Chapter as though expressly rewritten and incorporated herein.

4558 § 1, 8-3-2015; Ord. No. 4723, 3-19-2018]
2. All open space shall require documentation that demonstrates the
ongoing maintenance and management of the space, including the
administrative and financial means to provide maintenance and
management and a no-build easement dedicated for use by the
residents of the development or the public which may not be
released without the written consent of the City Council. This
documentation shall be included as part of the final plat application
and recorded with the approved final plat. Dedication to the City or
other public entity subject to acceptance by and at the sole
discretion of the City or other public entity satisfies this
requirement.
A. General Standards.
1. In the planning and design of stormwater management systems in
the City of Blue Springs, the design criteria set forth in the latest
edition of the Blue Springs, Missouri, Design and Construction
Manual shall be used. This document is hereby referenced and
made a part of this Chapter as though expressly incorporated
herein.
2. It is the policy of the City to encourage the owner to locate and
design streets, blocks, lots, parks and open space in such a manner
as to reduce the velocity of overland flow, allow the maximum
opportunity for infiltration of stormwater into the ground, and to
preserve existing streams, channels, detention basins and
floodplain areas as open space.
3. Where the stormwater management plan, as approved by the
Director of Public Works, indicates that the proposed development
will aggravate downstream drainage or flooding problems,
provisions shall be included in the design of storm drainage
improvements for the temporary controlled detention of
stormwater runoff and its regulated discharge to the downstream
storm drainage system. If stormwater detention is required, the
criteria and policies set forth in the following Subsections shall be
applied in the design and development of the final stormwater
management plan for the proposed project.

Section 406.060. Easements. [R.O. 1996 § 406.060; Ord. No. 4558
§ 1, 8-3-2015]
B. Floodplains. When the proposed development abuts, includes, or
encompasses a portion of a floodplain, as defined herein, the
professional engineer preparing the stormwater management plan
shall review and in all ways comply with requirements of other City
ordinances regarding construction of buildings and other development
in the floodplain areas of the City. The engineer shall also consult the
flood insurance study as previously prepared for the City by the Federal
Insurance Administration. Any modification to the floodplain shall be
submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for a
revision to the National Flood Insurance Program (FIRM) maps. All cost
for the map revision or amendment shall be at the expense of the owner.
C. Initial Construction. The stormwater management system, BMP
facilities, distribution systems for drinking water, streets and the
sanitary sewers for the property shall be constructed by the developer,
its successors and assigns, in accordance with the plans and
specifications (the "plans") approved by the City and in accordance with
the Blue Springs Municipal Code, the Blue Springs Unified
Development Code and all other applicable regulations.
D. On-Site Stormwater Management System And BMP Facilities —
Maintenance. Except as otherwise expressly provided below for the
public portion of the stormwater system, the developer and its
successors and assigns, including the Homeowners' Association, shall
at all times adequately maintain the stormwater management system
and the BMP facilities as approved for the development in the approved
plans. The facilities to be maintained shall include all pipes and
channels built to convey stormwater to the BMP facilities, as well as all
structures, improvements and vegetation provided to control the
quantity and quality of the stormwater. "Adequate maintenance" is
herein defined as maintained in good working condition so that the
stormwater management system and the BMP facilities fully and
completely perform and function as designed and do not adversely
affect other elements of the overall stormwater.
A. Public Utility Easements. All public utilities, including lines for
streetlighting systems, which traverse privately owned property, shall
be protected by easements granted by the owner to the appropriate
public utility, and approved by the public utility. Such easements shall
be so located to minimize interference with the use of any lot or other
part of the subdivision. All easements shall be accessible from the
public right-of-way. The size of and restrictions pertaining to such
easements shall be in accordance with the standards and specifications
of the agency having jurisdiction over the utility lines and the
subdivision, and shall be indicated on both the preliminary plat and the
final plat submitted for approval.
B. Drainage Easements.
Section
406.050
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
406.060
AO:644
1. When a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage
channel or stream there shall be provided an easement for
drainage purposes adequate to convey the runoff from the 100-year
storm.
2. All drainage streams or channels shall be of such dimension as is
necessary to include the full width of the drainageway as
established by standards of the Kansas City Metropolitan Chapter
of the American Public Works Association. Design and construct
manufactured channels with a level area alongside of at least ten
(10) feet in width to provide access for equipment necessary for
construction, cleaning and maintenance of the drainageway.
3. Any portion of a subdivision that falls within Flood Zone A as
established by the Flood Insurance Rate Map shall be identified on
the preliminary and final plat and designated as a drainage
easement.
4. No fence, wall, planting, building or other obstruction may be
placed in a drainage easement without approval of the Director of
Public Works. There shall be no alteration of the grades or contours
within a drainage easement without the approval of the Director of
Public Works.
C. Landscape Easements. Where a non-access reservation is required
under this Chapter, a landscape easement shall be shown on the
preliminary and final plat. Said landscape easement shall be
immediately adjacent to the major street right-of-way and shall be the
full width of the landscape buffer required by Chapter 407. The final
plat and Property Owners' Association deed restrictions shall contain
language as approved by the Director of Community Development
which identifies the Property/Homeowners' Association as the entity
which shall have permanent responsibility and authority to enter upon
said landscape easement to maintain, plant, replant, replace, mow, clip,
trim, spray, chemically treat, repair, and otherwise maintain any and all
grass, trees, shrubs, flowers, plants, fences and walls. As an alternative,
a separate tract of land of at least the same width required for the
landscape buffer and subject to the same language outlined above may
be utilized instead of the landscape easement. No solid fence or wall
may be located within the separate tract or landscape easement.
Wrought iron, split rail or other see-through fences may be located
within the separate tract or landscape easement. Such fences must be
of the same type and style so as to be uniform in appearance along the
entire frontage of the subdivision, and may be no closer than five (5)
feet from the right-of-way line of the abutting street.
D. Cross-Access Easements. Unless waived by the City Council, any plat of
a non-residential subdivision which abuts an arterial, major, or minor
collector street shall provide an easement for the purpose of cross
access between the lots within the subdivision and the lots to which the
subdivision adjoins. Such right of access shall be noted on the
Section
406.060
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
406.060
AO:645
Section 406.070. Erosion Control. [R.O. 1996 § 406.070; Ord. No.
4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
preliminary and final plat of the subdivision. Said cross-access
easement shall be paved to specifications required for a residential
street and shall be maintained by the owner of the underlying property.
Failure to construct and/or maintain said paved area shall be unlawful.
E. No-Build Easements. Any plat of a subdivision shall show upon all open
space a no build easement that restricts the types of structures that
may be constructed and maintained within the open space which shall
be dedicated to either the owners of property within the platted area or
the public and which may not be released except by action of the City
Council.
A. Since considerable erosion can take place prior to the construction of
houses and other buildings, facilities, and features in a subdivision, the
stormwater management plan and construction plans for a subdivision
shall contain properly designed measures, as described and required by
the City of Blue Springs Design and Construction Manual, to control
erosion and sediment discharge which would emanate from the
subdivision area, especially within all critical drainage watershed areas
(as determined by the Director of Public Works). The measures shall be
incorporated into the final construction drawings. The measures shall
apply to all street and utility installations as well as to the protection of
disturbed land. Measures shall be instituted to prevent or control
erosion and sedimentation during the various stages of construction of
the subdivision. An erosion control plan must be submitted and
approved by the Director of Public Works prior to starting construction.
This plan should include regulatory mechanisms to control erosion and
sediment to the maximum extent practicable and allowed under State
law. In addition to the erosion plan, the owner must provide
documentation to the Director of Public Works' satisfaction that it has
received its NPDES permit from the Missouri Department of Natural
Resources. Failure to comply with erosion control plan will result in
revocation of the construction permit until the project is brought into
compliance.
B. Silting basins or diversion channels will be required during the
construction period to insure that mud and other debris is not washed
into natural watercourses or new or previously constructed storm
sewers. The Director of Public Works may impose supplemental
requirements or may delete requirements regarding sediment and
erosion control measures if the Director of Public Works determines
that additional or revised requirements are justified or that planned
measures will not adequately control erosion during construction. Each
person building any structure upon individual lots shall maintain
erosion control measures. The City's Codes Administration office shall
oversee erosion control measures on individual lots after platting and
the lots are released for construction.

Associations. [R.O. 1996 § 406.080; Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015;
Ord. No. 4723, 3-19-2018]
A. Owners shall form or cause to have formed a Property Owners'
Association or Homeowners' Association ("association") in accordance
with the following standards:
1. Recordation And Registration. The association shall be established
in recorded subdivision restrictions and duly incorporated before
any lot within the subdivision is sold. The association corporation
shall at all times be in good standing registered with the Office of
the Missouri Secretary of State.
2. Membership. Membership in the association shall be mandatory for
each owner of real property within the subdivision.
3. Responsibilities. Common open space, subdivision entrance
structures, or recreational ground must be owned and maintained
by the association in perpetuity. The association shall be
responsible for payment of property taxes on and maintenance of
all common open space areas and facilities, maintenance of liability
insurance, and other related duties of ownership. Upon completion
of relevant phase, designated stormwater conveyance, retention, or
detention facilities to be located on common open space shall be
maintained by the association. In the event of failure to maintain
such facilities to the standards required by the City or set forth in
the planned development final plan, or final plat if no development
plan is required, abatement by the City shall be authorized. Upon
completion of the abatement and certification by the Director of
Community Development and/or the Director of Public Works that
the deficiency has been abated, the Director of Community
Development and/or the Director of Public Works shall certify all
costs of such abatement, including enforcement costs and expenses
of staff time incurred in the remediation of the deficiency, to the
City's Director of Finance. The Director of Finance shall cause a
special tax bill therefor or add the costs thereof to the annual real
estate tax bill, at the Finance Director's option, to be assessed
proportionally against all lots and lot owners within the
development in an equal amount per individual lot or lot owner. The
amount caused by the Finance Director to be assessed shall be a
lien against all lots in the development.
4. Establishment Of Property Owners' Association Or Homeowners'
Association.
a. The owner shall file a declaration of restrictions and a
declaration of association with the preliminary and final plats
when approval is sought, setting forth the above conditions
and other features of the association which has been approved
by the City Attorney. The owner shall supply to the City Council
Section
406.080
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
406.080
AO:647
and the Planning Commission a copy of the articles of
incorporation and a complete set of the bylaws of the
association. Said declaration of restrictions and declaration of
association shall be recorded along with the final plat.
b. The City Council may require that, in addition to insertion of
covenants or provisions creating easements and provisions for
mandatory membership in the association in all deeds to home
buyers, the owner grant an easement over all common open
space to the City to insure that the area will remain open in
perpetuity. Such an easement is intended to preclude
development and preserve common open space; it may,
however, provide (at the option of the association) for public
access to, or use of, common open space.
c. If a development plan includes construction of a landscaped
decorative entryway, islands, statuary or other aesthetically
oriented theme or identity amenities which are to be located
within an easement, the association shall be specifically
charged with the responsibility for perpetual maintenance of
such areas. This shall not apply to landscaping within the
median strip of arterial or major collector streets where City
maintenance is provided.
d. In the event that an association established to own or maintain
common open space, or any successor association, shall at any
time after development of a residential subdivision fail to
maintain the common open space in reasonable order and
condition, the Director of Community Development and/or the
Director of Public Works or their designee may serve written
notice upon such association setting forth the manner in which
the association has failed to maintain the common open space,
and said notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of
maintenance be corrected within thirty (30) days thereof, and
shall state the date and place of a public hearing thereon which
shall be held within fourteen (14) days of said notice. At such
public hearing, the hearing officer may modify the terms of the
original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension
of time within which they shall be corrected. If the deficiencies
set forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof are
not corrected within said thirty (30) days, or any extension
thereof, the Director of Community Development and/or the
Director of Public Works, in order to preserve the taxable
values of properties within the residential subdivision and to
prevent the common open space from becoming a public
nuisance, may authorize appropriate City employees or their
agents to enter upon said common open space and maintain
the same for a period of one (1) year at the cost of the owner's
property served by the improvement so maintained. Said entry

Section 406.090. Historical Sites. [R.O. 1996 § 406.090; Ord. No.
4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
Any sites considered to have historical significance, either by the City, the
developer, or Federal agencies, shall be designated on any plan or plat
within which said sites may be located.
Section 406.100. Financial Guarantees. [R.O. 1996 § 406.100; Ord.
No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
Owners may be required to furnish such financial guarantees as allowed by
law, performance bonds, escrow deposit, or other financial guarantees as
may be determined by the City Council to be reasonably required to assure
performance in accordance with the development plan and to protect the
public interest in the event of abandonment of said plan before completion.
and maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use
the common open space.
e. Before expiration of said year, the Director of Community
Development and/or the Director of Public Works shall, upon
its own initiative or upon request of the association theretofore
responsible for maintenance of the common open space, call a
public hearing upon notice to such association or to residents
of the residential subdivision, at which public hearing the
hearing officer shall decide whether or not such maintenance
by the City should continue for a succeeding year. If the
hearing officer shall determine that the association is ready
and able to maintain the common open space in reasonable
condition and order, the City shall cease to maintain the
common open space at the end of said year. If the hearing
officer shall determine that such association is not ready and
able to maintain the common open space in reasonable
condition and order, the hearing officer may, in the hearing
officer's discretion, determine that the City shall continue to
maintain the common open space during the succeeding year
and, subject to a similar public hearing and determination, in
each year thereafter. The cost of such maintenance by the City
shall be assessed proportionally against all properties within
the residential subdivision that have a right of use and
enjoyment of the common open space, and shall become a tax
lien on said properties upon certification of the costs thereof to
the City Clerk by the Director of Community Development and/
or the Director of Public Works.
B. Any person who shall violate, fail, neglect or refuse to comply with any
provision of this Section shall be subject, upon conviction, to the
penalty or penalties provided in Section 100.080 of this Code.

Section 406.110. Alternative Design And Materials Usage. [R.O.
1996 § 406.110; Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
An owner may seek approval by filing an application form approved by the
Directors of Public Works and Community Development, to use different or
alternative designs and materials than those allowed under the UDC and
the Public Works Design and Construction Manual for a public improvement
or impervious surface. The Directors may consider such request and if
unanimous in their determination that: (1) such usage exceeds the
requirements and purpose of the requirement contained within the Manual
or the UDC, (2) the material or design requested is a functional equivalent
of the requirement contained in the Manual or the UDC, and (3) such usage
shall advance or meet a stated goal or policy adopted by the City Council,
they may submit a recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission
for consideration of such a request. Should the two (2) directors fail to both
agree that such usage meets the criteria of this Section, then the applicant
shall use the materials and methods set out in the UDC and the Manual.
The Planning and Zoning Commission and Council shall not consider the
request unless the two (2) directors make a finding together that the usage
meets the criteria of this Section. If the Planning and Zoning Commission
approves such request following referral after the directors' finding, then
the applicant may use such alternative design or material in constructing
improvements. If the Commission denies the request, the applicant may
appeal this denial to the City Council for consideration. The City Council
may approve, modify or deny the request in its total discretion. Should
the request be approved, the design and construction of the improvement
shall meet all the other requirements of the City Codes and be accepted by
the City only upon compliance with procedures for the acceptance of other
improvements.

Section 407.010. Parking And Loading. [R.O. 1996 § 407.010; Ord.
No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
A. Intent. It is the intent of this Section is to:
1. Emphasize the importance of site access from a variety of modes of
transportation wherever appropriate.
2. Provide the optimal amount of vehicle parking for individual sites,
recognizing that both too little parking and too much parking
create negative impacts.
Section
406.110
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
407.010
AO:650
3. Ensure the appropriate site location and design features that
mitigate the impact of parking on the public realm and urban
design goals for a district or adjacent sites.
4. Reduce or minimize runoff from surface parking.
5. Promote efficient site design and avoid the need to dedicate areas
of individual and adjacent sites to underutilized or redundant
vehicle parking.
B. Applicability. The standards of this Section shall apply to:
1. All new site plans or development applications.
2. Any change of use or expansion of an existing use, except that the
application shall only be responsible for the additional parking
required for that use, and any existing deficiencies may be credited
at the directors discretion.
3. The location, design and screening standards shall apply to all new
parking areas, and to renovations and expansions of existing
parking to the extent practical. Except when more than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the parking capacity or more than fifty percent
(50%) of the area is being altered, full compliance shall be
required.
4. For infill and rehabilitation projects, the Community Development
Director may waive the applicability of this Section where these
standards would result in less than ten percent (10%) additional
parking requirements.
C. Required Parking.
1. Minimum Vehicle Parking. Off-street vehicle parking spaces shall

Schedule C: Off-Street Parking
Schedule C uses have widely varying parking demand
characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street
parking standard. A developer proposing to develop or expand
a Schedule C use shall submit a parking study that provides
justification for the number of off-street parking spaces proposed.
The Director of Community Development shall review this study
and any other traffic engineering and planning data that are
relevant to the establishment of an appropriate off-street parking
standard for the proposed use. A parking study shall include
estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the
Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) and data collected from uses
or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the
proposed use. Comparability shall be determined by density, scale,
bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study shall document
the source of data used to develop the recommendations. After
reviewing the parking study, the Director of Community
Development shall establish a minimum off-street parking
standard for the proposed use.
The Director of Community Development and/or Planning
Commission may allow for a Schedule A or Schedule B use to
utilize the Schedule C parking study process to determine the
minimum number of parking spaces to be provided for a particular
use or development in instances where it is deemed necessary or
beneficial to tailor the parking to the particular needs of the use
or development based upon unique operational characteristics not
normally considered under Schedule A or B requirements.
2. Computing Off-Street Parking And Loading Requirements.
a. Multiple Uses. Lots containing more than one (1) use shall
provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of
the requirements for all uses, except that the shared parking
matrix in Section 407.010(D)(7) shall be used to convert the
maximum parking limits.
b. Fractions. When the required spaces result in fractions, any
fraction of one-half (1/2) or less shall be disregarded and any
fraction of more than one-half (1/2) shall be rounded upward to
the next highest whole number.
Section
407.010
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
407.010
AO:657
c. Area. All square footage-based parking and loading standards
shall be computed on the basis of gross floor area, except
where the parking schedules note otherwise.
d. Employees, Students And Occupant-Based Standards. Parking
requirements based on the number of employees, students,
residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the
largest number of persons working on any single shift, the
maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated capacity,
whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater
number of spaces.
e. Unlisted Uses. Uses not specifically listed in an off-street
parking schedule shall use the required parking for the listed
use deemed by the Director of Community Development to be
most similar to the use proposed or require a parking study in
accordance with Schedule C.
f. Off-Street Parking For Persons With Disabilities. Off-street
parking facilities shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with all requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act82 and the Uniform Federal Accessibility
Standards.
3. Maximum Parking. No site shall provide more than twenty-five
percent (25%) above the parking required by this Section. No site
shall provide more than ten percent (10%) above the parking
required by this Section without providing one (1) or more of the
following mitigating design elements:
a. Additional open space of at least fifty percent (50%) of the
excess area of parking, and designed to the standards of open
space types in Section 406.030 or frontage types in Section
407.030, and located in a way to minimize the impact of
parking on streetscapes and adjacent sites.
b. Design the excess space for dual purposes, as gathering space
or other pedestrian-scale, landscape or urban design purposes
generally, but accommodate limited or overflow parking at
other times.
c. The surface of lesser used or overflow parking shall be
designed as porous surface that allows stormwater to be
infiltrated. Any porous surface shall demonstrate that it has the
same or better performance standards than standard parking
surfaces and be approved by the Director of Public Works who
may require enhanced stormwater performance for the entire
parking area. Porous surfaces should be designed according to
the Mid America Regional Council and American Public Works
Association Manual of Best Management Practices for
82.Editor's Note: See 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.
Section
407.010
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
407.010
AO:658
Stormwater quality. A plan for routine and long term
maintenance shall also be submitted to ensure the continued
performance of the porous system.
d. The landscape material required by this Section shall be
increased by fifteen percent (15%) and located in a way to
minimize the impact of parking on streetscapes and adjacent
sites.
4. Bicycle Parking. All non-residential or multi-family uses within one
thousand (1,000) feet of a designated bicycle route shall provide
the following bicycle parking spaces. [Ord. No. 4585 § 7,
2-16-2016]

parking spaces
Other institutional or
entertainment uses
5% of the required vehicle spaces
Industrial uses 3% of the number of employees
Residential 1 per dwelling unit
5. Use Of Parking Area. Required parking areas shall be used solely
for the parking of vehicles and shall not be used for the storage of
vehicles, boats, motor homes, campers, mobile homes, inoperable
vehicles or materials. Temporary uses, special events, and other
seasonal site and building uses enabled by other Sections of this
Code may allow alternative utilization of parking areas based on
the standards and criteria of those Sections. Off-street or on-street
parking of vehicles weighing more than six (6) tons or containing
more than two (2) axles shall be prohibited in MF-18 and less
intensive districts. This provision shall not prohibit temporary
parking of vehicles making pickups or deliveries.
D. Parking Reductions. The parking required by Subsection(C) may be
reduced depending on context, and according to the following
strategies:
1. On-Street Parking Credit. All on-street parking within three
hundred (300) feet of any lot frontage shall count towards the
parking requirement at a rate of one (1) space for every two (2) onstreet
spaces.
Section
407.010
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
407.010
AO:659
2. Bicycle Parking Credit. All on-site bicycle parking designed and
located according to the Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle
Professionals Bicycle Parking Guidelines may reduce the required
vehicle parking at a rate of one (1) space for every four (4) bicycle
parking spaces up to a maximum of twenty percent (20%) of the
required vehicle parking.
3. Walkable Development Credit. All retail, service or institutional
uses may reduce the required vehicle parking by:
a. Five percent (5%) if there are more than one thousand (1,000)
dwelling units within one-half (1/2) mile, measured along the
direct pedestrian connections; and
b. Ten percent (10%) for all sites fronting on an activity street as
defined in Section 406.020(D).
4. Public Parking Credit. Any site within six hundred (600) feet of a
public parking area may reduce the required vehicle parking at a
rate of one (1) space for every three (3) public parking spaces.
5. Deferral Of Parking Space Requirements. A portion of the required
parking may remain unimproved until the Planning Commission or
the City Council deems it necessary to adequately serve parking
demand. The Planning Commission or City Council, whichever is
charged with granting final approval, shall determine that the
initial occupancy of the premises will be adequately served by the
lesser number of spaces and a site plan shall indicate the location,
pattern and circulation to and from the deferred parking spaces.
The area reserved for future parking shall be brought to finished
grade and shall be landscaped, and it shall not be used for any
permanent purpose or structure unless a revised site plan and
parking plan is approved.
6. Off-Site Parking. Required parking spaces shall be located on the
same lot as the use it is intended to serve, provided that the
Director of Community Development may allow all or a portion of
the required parking to be located on a separate lot subject to the
following standards.
a. Ineligible Activities. Off-site parking shall not be used for
residential uses, restaurants, bars or convenience stores and
other convenience-oriented uses. Required parking for persons
with disabilities shall not be located off-site.
b. Location. No off-site parking area shall be more than three
hundred (300) feet from the site served, measured along the
shortest legal, practical walking route. Off-site parking areas
shall not be separated from the site by a street right-of-way
with a width of more than eighty (80) feet unless a gradeseparated
pedestrian walkway is provided.
Section
407.010
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
407.010
AO:660
c. Zoning Classification. Off-site parking areas shall require the
same or a more intensive zoning classification than that
required for the use served.
d. Agreement For Off-Site Parking. Off-site parking areas under
different ownership than the use served require a written
agreement between the owners of record, in a form
recommended by the Director of Community Development for
recordation. Recordation of the agreement by the Register of
Deeds is required before issuance of a building permit.
7. Shared Parking. Required parking may be reduced for any site
containing multiple uses or for adjacent sites with different uses
according to the following table. Any shared parking arrangement
shall require an agreement among all landowners participating in
the agreement to ensure access, joint use, maintenance, and other
operational issues. A reduction program that differs from the table
below may also be approved in association with the agreement
upon preparation of the joint parking study for the sites and uses.

A. Intent. It is the intent of this Section is to:
1. Provide adequate access to all lots and blocks in conjunction with
the street networks, blocks and street types of a particular
development pattern.
2. Balance the interests of access for pedestrians and bicycles with
access for vehicles.
3. Protect the design integrity of streetscapes and minimize
interruptions in streetscape by curb-cuts and drive aisles.
4. Manage access and circulation within larger sites, development
projects and blocks.
B. Applicability. This Section shall apply to:
1. All new site plans and development proposals where street access
is proposed or altered, or where platting occurs in association with
the development;
2. Any infill or reuse where over fifty percent (50%) of the parking and
circulation area is being altered;
3. Any application in an area that is subject to a specific access
management study;
4. Any application on an activity street; and

5. Any application where streetscape improvements are required or
proposed.
C. Types. The following specific types of access shall be used to access
lots:
Table 407.020-1: Access Types
Unlimited Driveway
A driveway that is generally no
more than 16 feet to 24 feet wide
in the lot frontage area, but can
expand to larger pads and
approach areas closer to the
buildings. Often this may involve a
circle drive with two 8-foot to
12-foot access ways. This access
is used on larger lots with wide
frontages and deep building
setbacks.
No illustration intended
Double Driveway
A driveway that is typically
between 16 feet and 20 feet wide,
and provides an approach to a two
car garage. This access is
typically used on larger lots with
wide frontages.

AO:667
Table 407.020-1: Access Types
Single/Double Driveway
A driveway that is typically
between 8 feet and 10 feet wide
within the lot frontage area, but
can expand to a larger pad and
approach area up to 24 feet wide
closer to the buildings. This
access is used on smaller to
medium sized lots with narrower
frontages, but can accommodate
front or side loaded garages.
Single Driveway
A driveway that is 8 feet to 10 feet
at all points before the front
building line. It often provides
access to a larger pad and
approach area behind the front
building line to provide access to
detached or rear loaded garages.
This access is used on smaller lots
with narrow frontages, and on
streets were minimal
interruptions in the streetscape
are desired.

Table 407.020-1: Access Types
Shared Driveway
A driveway that serves two lots
and is typically located on a lot
line of the two properties and
coordinated with easements
benefitting both parties, and
extends to an area where each lot
has its own private pad and/or
approach area. Shared drives are
usually use the single driveway or
single/double driveway
configurations, and are used on
smaller lots with narrow
frontages, and on streets were
minimal interruptions in the
streetscape are desired.

Table 407.020-1: Access Types
Common Drive
An access point similar to a
shared driveway except that it
serves more than 2 but generally
no more than 6 lots. Common
driveways are typically located in
easements or common areas
owned jointly by all lots
benefitting from the access.
Common driveways can provide
access to smaller parking blocks
or parking areas where
maneuvering of vehicles can
occur.
No illustration intended
Drive Aisles
A system of internal access ways
designed to facilitate circulation
of vehicles within a site, often
coordinating access to parking
areas or cross-access between
multiple properties. The drive
aisles serve as an organizing
element for parking blocks and
building sites.

Internal Access Streets
A system of internal access ways
designed to mimic public
streetscapes and block structure.
This access coordinates
development and access across
multiple or larger scale projects,
typically on sites or parcels of
greater than 5 acres, so the
resulting internal block structure

Alley
A shared access system internal
to a block and serving all lots on
the block (or occasionally all lots
on a single block face for single
loaded blocks). Alleys typically
bisect a block with a simple
central alley, although H-shaped,
T-shaped or other similar
configurations can accommodate
irregular blocks or other
situations where alley access
points may be constrained.

D. Vehicle Access Requirements. The following requirements coordinate
adequate block and lot access based on the context of development, the
street type and other access coordination. Where adequate access to
any lot is limited by these standards, shared, common or internal block
access strategies in Subsection (C) shall be used to provide adequate
access to all lots.
1. Location And Spacing. Lot access location and spacing shall be
limited based on the functional class of streets in Table 407.020-2.
Spacing distance between access shall be measured from the
perpendicular curb face of the access points, and from the
perpendicular curb face of intersecting streets to the closest access
point for intersections.

407.020
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
407.020
AO:674
parking of vehicles weighing more than six (6) tons or
containing more than two (2) axles shall be prohibited in
MF-18 and less intensive districts. This provision shall not
prohibit temporary parking of vehicles making pickups or
deliveries. Driveway widths shall be limited to a maximum of
thirty (30) feet within the right-of-way.
c. Single- or two-family residences wherein the driveway length
exceeds two hundred (200) feet shall be allowed an exception
to the paving requirement for driveways but shall provide the
minimum number of parking spaces on a paved surface.
3. Corner Visibility. Sight distance standards are based on criteria in
the latest edition of the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Green Book. On corner lots
nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in
such a manner which will obstruct the view of the traveling public
based on AASHTO Green Book sight distance standards. This sight
triangle standard may be increased by the Director of Public Works
when deemed necessary for traffic safety. Additionally, right of way
is required at intersections per the City of Blue Springs Design and
Construction Manual to allow for the construction of Americans
with Disability Act83 sidewalk, curb ramps, signalization
components, etc.
4. Traffic Impacts. Wherever the City Engineer determines that the
above requirements will adversely impact the function of the
transportation network in the vicinity of the site, either due to
traffic impacts of the proposed use, or the design of the access in
relation to the streetscape, alternative access standards may be
required to better meet the intent of this Section. In addition, any
specific access management study or plan for a portion of the City
may alter the application of these standards and guidelines.
E. Pedestrian Access Requirements. All lots shall include direct pedestrian
connections and circulation routes at the same or greater frequency as
is provided by streets, driveways and internal access streets.
1. Generally. At a minimum, sidewalks shall directly connect each of
the following:
a. All public entrances to buildings;
b. The public sidewalk on adjacent streets or internal access
streets;
c. On-site parking areas;
83.Editor's Note: See 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.
Section
407.020
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
407.020
AO:675
d. Private, common or public areas that are part of the open
space system in Section 406.030, to the extent any are on the
site or adjacent to the site;
e. Adjacent sites, where pedestrian access between sites by way
of the public streets or internal access streets are remote
[more than three hundred (300) feet away].
2. Sidewalk Widths. Internal sidewalks shall meet the following
requirements:
Table 407.020-4: Internal Sidewalk Widths
Generally 5 feet minimum
Primary routes (between parking and
buildings) in multi-family projects
6 feet minimum
Any building facade abutting a parking
area or any sidewalk abutting parking
with vehicle overhangs
8 feet minimum
Along any non-residential building
facade with a primary entrance
12 feet minimum
3. Crossings. All driveways and alleys shall intersect with sidewalks
on the perimeter of the block at the sidewalk grade, and the
material and construction of the sidewalk shall continue across the
drive. For drive aisles and internal access streets, the vehicle grade
may interrupt the sidewalk. Where the pedestrian crossing exceeds
twenty-four (24) feet, cross-walks or other features to identify
pedestrian crossings may be required. Design features such as
bump outs, raised crossings, medians or other landscape and urban
design amenities that emphasize the pedestrian crossing and
shorten the distance pedestrians cross dedicated vehicle ways may
be considered.
F. General Standards. Note: Construction standards for improvements in
public right of way are located in the Public Works Design and
Construction Manual and design and construction of all improvements
shall meet the standards and requirements contained in such manual.
1. Off-street parking spaces shall be arranged so that no vehicle will
back directly onto a street. All private parking areas, drive aisles
and internal access streets shall be located off of the street right-ofway.
2. Access to property shall be allowed only by way of driveways, and
no other portion of the lot frontage shall be used for ingress, egress
or parking.
3. Any driveway design must allow an entering vehicle turning speed
of fifteen (15) miles per hour to help reduce interference with
through street traffic. Radii of driveway shall be sufficient to

Section 407.030. Frontage Design. [R.O. 1996 § 407.030; Ord. No.
4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
achieve this standard for the types of vehicles that the driveway is
intended to serve.
4. There must be sufficient on-site vehicle storage to accommodate
queued vehicles waiting to park or exit, without interfering with
street traffic.
5. Provisions for circulation between adjacent parcels should be
provided through coordinated or joint parking systems.
6. Driveway placement should be such that loading and unloading
activities will in no way hinder vehicle ingress or egress.
7. Driveway design must be such that vehicles entering the driveway
from the street will not encroach upon the exit lane of a two-way
driveway. Also, a right-turning exiting vehicle will be able to use
only the first through-traffic lane available without encroaching
into the adjacent through-lane.
8. No construction, grading, excavation, repair or reconstruction of
any street, curb or gutter; or any sidewalk or driveway between the
street and property line shall be commenced without first obtaining
a right-of-way work permit from the Director of Public Works.
9. Right turn lanes, left turn lanes, tapers, and other traffic control
features may be required to ensure proper design, function, and
minimizing impacts to traffic progression of the roadway.
Requirements must be based on a traffic analysis as described in
the Public Works Design and Construction Manual that considers
all potential users of the right-of-way and the development context.
10. Appropriate sight distances shall be provided based on the latest
edition of A Policy on Geometric Design and Highways and Streets,
issued by AASHTO. This guide shall be used based on the roadway
context, considering traffic controls, stopping points of vehicles
entering the roadway and the design speeds for on-coming
vehicles.
11. Any construction, grading, excavation, repair or reconstruction of
any street, curb, sidewalk or access point in the right-of-way shall
require a right-of-way work permit from the City.
A. Intent. It is the intent of this Section to:
1. Promote good site design by establishing a relationship of buildings
and sites with the public realm created by streetscapes and open
spaces.
2. Value the design, function, appropriate application of different
types of open space, rather than solely the quantity of space.
Section
407.020
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
407.030
AO:677
3. Promote designs for unbuilt portions of lots that serve multiple
functions, including active spaces for people, aesthetic functions,
buffer and screening and ecological functions, to increase the value
and minimize the impact of development.
4. Consider the context of sites and buildings and how the design of
site frontages can enhance the broader character of the area.
5. Create focal points for the site, block, or project that establish a
pedestrian scale or gathering places.
6. Support and expand the open space systems that support
development (see Section 406.030) with site-specific designs that
relate to the broader systems.
B. Applicability.
1. Generally. The standards in this Section apply to the design and
arrangement of buildings and open areas of a lot adjacent to the
right-of-way and along streetscapes. They supplement the building
and lot standards of zoning districts, and other site design
standards, however, effective use of frontage types can meet
multiple standards. These requirements also supplement the open
space system required in Section 406.030 of the subdivision
regulations and provide smaller scale project, block and sitespecific
civic spaces.
2. Specifically. The standards of this Section shall apply to:
a. All new site plans or development applications for new
buildings.
b. Any application for a building permit for additions or
rehabilitation, where twenty percent (20%) or more of the
existing frontage area will be reconfigured, or fifty percent
(50%) or more of the site will be reconfigured.
c. Any application on an activity street.
d. Any project where streetscape improvements are required or
proposed.
e. For infill and rehabilitation projects, the Community
Development Director may waive the applicability of this
Section where the nature of the application presents no work
along the street frontage and the opportunities to implement
the intent of this Section are not present.
C. Permitted Frontage Types. The permitted frontage types shall be based
on zoning districts and the block and street context of a site, as
indicated in Table 407.030-1.84 The limitations by street type shall apply
to public streets and to internal access streets designed to the
Section
407.030
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
407.030
AO:678
standards of that street type (see Section 407.020). Specific plans may
further specify frontage types permitted on a block or street basis.
D. Frontage Design Standards. Frontages shall be designed according the
specific type, and the standards below for each different type. These
standards are in addition to any other standards required for building
types and setbacks or site design, although proper design and
arrangement of open spaces may meet multiple goals and
requirements. [Ord. No. 4570 § 3, 10-5-2015]
Enhanced Streetscape Frontage

2. Improve the aesthetic character of development with natural
landscape materials.
3. Coordinate landscape and design amenities across multiple sites,
improving the character of districts and neighborhoods.
4. Screen and mitigate the visual, noise or other impacts of highintensity
areas of sites, including loading areas, external
equipment, or other site utility areas.
5. Focus particular attention on the design of landscapes to improve
the transitions and relationships to the public realm formed by the
open space system, streetscapes, internal access streets, and lot
frontages, or other similar public or common areas.
B. Applicability. The standards of this Section shall apply to all
development except:
1. Agriculture (limited) in the RE District; and
2. Improvements or repairs to existing development that do not result
in an increase in floor area and changes in use that do not result in
an increase in intensity.
C. Landscape Requirements. The required landscape materials shall be
based on a landscape plant unit system applied to four (4) different
types of areas on a site: frontage design (Section 407.030), parking

exists on a site prior to its development may be used to satisfy the
landscaping standards of this Section, provided that it meets the
Section
407.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
407.040
AO:689
size, variety and locational requirements of this Section. Any
existing trees that are healthy, not damaged during construction,
and otherwise meet the requirements of this Section may be
credited towards the plant unit requirement subject to the
following:
Table 407.040-4: Tree Credits
Diameter Of Tree At 4 Feet,
6 Inches Above Ground
Level Credit
15 1/4 inches or more 10 units per 5 inches (maximum
50 units per tree)
10 1/4 to 15 inches 30 units
6 1/4 to 10 inches 20 units
2 to 6 inches 10 units
Less than 2 inches No credit
6. Existing Tree Protection.
a. When preservation is required, measures will be taken to
preserve trees on site as practical or economically feasible.
Existing trees and their root zones that are to be saved shall be
protected from all construction activities, including earthwork
operations, movement and storage of equipment and vehicles,
and placement of construction materials and debris. Erosion
protection measures may be required to prevent siltation of the
tree preservation areas during construction. Protection zones
may be established by the Community Development Director to
ensure trees and their root zones are adequately protected and
are not damaged during site development operations. In any
event, it is the developer's responsibility to use adequate
protection measures to ensure tree preservation occurs.
b. Every effort shall be made to locate utility easements away
from tree preservation areas. However, utility easements may
be located adjacent to tree preservation areas as long as
adequate clearance and protection is provided for the tree
preservation area during the installation of the utilities
adjacent to the tree preservation easement. When utilities or
infrastructure systems must cross tree preservation areas,
every effort shall be made to minimize tree removal in such
areas.
c. To ensure protection of tree preservation areas, protection
zones shall be delineated on the site development plans. The
plans shall identify the type and diameter of trees to be saved.
Note: City staff may not enforce tree protection measures and
Section
407.040
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
407.040
AO:690
it will be the property owner's responsibility to ensure
measures are taken.
d. When preservation is required and trees die during
construction, the property owner shall be required to replace
the same type of tree amount and diameter in inches as was
present before construction. Multiple trees can be used to
accomplish the number of inches required; however, no
replacement tree can be less than two (2) inches in diameter.
Trees shall be replaced in the same general location as
originally grown. If there is not adequate room to replace the
trees in the same location, then the Community Development
Director may approve alternate locations.
D. Buffers, Screens And Fencing.
1. Buffers. Landscape buffers are required when certain land uses are
adjacent to one another or when adjacent to certain roadway types.
The standards are intended to help ease the land use transition
between areas of varying development intensity; to ensure land use
compatibility; and preserve the appearance of roadway areas. Each
type (A-D) identified in Table 407.040-586 shall be designed
according to the landscape requirements in Subsection (C) above,
and may be modified to meet the frontage designs in Section
407.030.
a. Location Of Buffers. Buffers shall be located adjacent to public
rights-of-way and along adjoining lots with a different zoning
classification. In the case of modifications or additions to an
existing building or site, buffers shall only be required along
those portions of the site that are directly affected by the
proposed improvements as determined by the City.
b. Use Of Buffers. Required buffers shall be reserved solely for
open space and landscaping. No proposed building addition,
structure, parking area or any other type of physical land
improvement shall be located in a required buffer, provided
that driveways or roads may cross required buffers if
necessary to provide access to the building site. Sidewalks,
paths and project identification signs may also be located
within required buffers.
c. Waiver For Small Sites. The area of required buffers shall not
be required to exceed ten percent (10%) of the site proposed
for development. In cases where buffer requirements would
consume more than ten percent (10%) of the site, the Planning
Commission may allow the width or location of buffers to be
reduced or eliminated. The property owner shall be required to
add plant material within remaining buffers or elsewhere on
86.Editor's Note: Table 407.040-5, Buffer Types, is included as an attachment to this Chapter.
Section
407.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
407.040
AO:691
the site and any combination of plants, screening walls and
fences or other solutions appropriate to the site and context
may be required to meet the intent of this Section.
d. Responsibility For Installing Buffers. The owner of the
developing property shall always be responsible for providing
required buffers. In those cases where a landscape buffer that
complies with the buffer standards of this Section is already in
place — whether on the site of the developing property or on
the site of the adjacent property — the property owner shall
not be required to install another landscape buffer. The
property owner of a subdivision or other developing site shall
only be responsible for ensuring that the intervening landscape
buffer complies with the standards of this Section. [Ord. No.
4795, 2-19-2019]
e. Berms And Fences Required. Anytime NB/SO, GB, RC, LI or HI
Districts abut a residential district, an undulating four (4) to six
(6) foot (or as high as practical) earth berm or six (6) foot fence
shall be required in the setback area. Along with the fence or
berm, a twenty-five percent (25%) reduction of plant units will
be allowed in that particular setback area. Exceptions may be
approved where terrain cancels out or removes the benefit of a
fence or berm or, in the opinion of the Community
Development Director, a fence or berm would not create the
desired effect. Where it is determined a fence or berm is not
appropriate, a buffer of one hundred twenty-five percent
(125%) shall be required.
2. Screening. All of the following shall be screened from streets or
adjacent property with dense evergreen plants, a fence or wall
meeting the standards of Subsection (D)(3), or a combination of
both.
a. Electrical and mechanical equipment such as transformers, air
conditioners, of communication equipment and antennas;
b. Permanent or temporary outdoor storage areas, which shall
further be subject to all setback standards for the lot, and
require at least a Type A buffer;
c. Trash enclosures;
d. Utility stations;
e. Delivery and vehicle service bays, except that bays do not need
to be screened from adjacent property with the same or more
intense zoning;
f. Any parking areas larger than ten (10) spaces and adjacent to
property zoned MF-14 or less; and
Section
407.040
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
407.040
AO:692
g. Any parking permitted within thirty (30) feet of a public rightof-
way shall be screened between two and five tenths (2.5) feet
and three and five tenths (3.5) feet high, limited to a
combination of plants and/or ornamental fences and walls with
architectural details and materials that complement those of
the principle building.
3. Fences. All fences for screening, security, or privacy shall meet the
following standards.
a. Front Fences. All fences in front of the front building line shall:
(1) Be no higher than four (4) feet;
(2) Be limited to ornamental or decorative materials that
complement the materials and design of the principal
building; and
(3) Except for screens for parking, have a transparency or
voids of at least thirty-three percent (33%).
b. Rear And Side Fences. All rear and side fences located behind
the front building line shall:
(1) Be limited to no higher than six (6) feet in TF (Two-Family)
and less intensive zoning districts and eight (8) feet in all
other districts; [Ord. No. 4723, 3-19-2018]
(2) On corner lots, fences within eight (8) feet the right-of-way
shall meet the standards in Subsection (D)(3)(a) for front
fences and not create a sight distance obstruction as
described in Section 407.020(D)(3).
c. Other Fence Design Standards.
(1) Any fences that could potentially create a sight obstruction
for vehicles crossing pedestrian areas or entering the
street may require greater transparency or additional
location restrictions to allow for safe sight distances.
(2) All fences facing public rights-of-way shall be constructed
so that the finished side faces the public right-of-way and
the support posts are inside the fence and screened from
view. [Ord. No. 4723, 3-19-2018]
(3) Fences may be located so that the fence face is at or near
the property line; otherwise the fence shall be setback at
least three (3) feet from the property line absent more
specific standards in these regulations. Any areas set back
three (3) feet or more from the property line, which could
become enclosed by other similarly located fences, may be
required to have at least one (1) gate for access and
maintenance equipment.
Section
407.040
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
407.040
AO:693
(4) Fences shall be constructed out of any of the following
materials:
(a) Wood or vinyl simulating wood;
(b) Wrought iron or aluminum simulating wrought iron;
(c) Stone, brick, concrete with stone or brick veneer, or
precast concrete simulated stone or brick; or
(d) Chain link or vinyl clad chain link in the rear or side
yard only, provided all exposed steel shall have a color
finished coat or be galvanized.
(5) Fences for security in non-residential districts or fences
around recreation amenities such as tennis courts or pools
may be exempt from the height and material standards.
(6) Any fence proposed across a drainage way or drainage
easement shall require review and approval by the
Director of Public Works.
d. Permits Required. No fence shall be erected, modified or
changed in any manner until a fence permit application has
been approved by the Director of Community Development.
Applications shall be filed upon forms provided by the City and
shall clearly show the type, material, and placement of the
fence.
E. Installation, Maintenance And Replacement.
1. Installation. All landscape materials shall be installed according to
sound nursery practices in a manner designed to encourage
vigorous growth. All landscape elements, living and non-living,
shall be healthy and in place prior to issuance of final occupancy
certificate. A temporary occupancy certificate may be issued prior
to installation of required landscaping if written assurances and
financial guarantees are submitted ensuring that planting will take
place when planting season arrives. The amount of the financial
guarantee shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five percent
(125%) of the estimated cost of the plant material based on written
cost estimates provided by the property owner and/or property
owner's representative.
2. Maintenance And Replacement. Trees, shrubs, fences, walls and
other landscape and screening elements depicted on plans
approved by the City shall be considered requirements of the
project in the same manner as parking, building materials and
other details of the plan. The land owner, or successors in interest,
or agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the
following: [Ord. No. 4795, 2-19-2019]
Section
407.040
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
407.040
AO:694
a. Regular maintenance of all landscape and screening elements
in good condition and in a way that presents a healthy, neat and
orderly appearance.
b. Proper care of all landscape material free from disease, pests,
weeds and litter. This maintenance shall include weeding,
watering, fertilizing, pruning, mowing, edging, mulching or
other maintenance, as needed, and in accordance with
acceptable horticultural practices.
c. The repair or replacement of required landscape structures
and screening elements (i.e., walls, fences, gates) to a
structurally sound condition and orderly appearance.
F. Alternative Compliance. Applicants may submit an alternative
compliance landscape plan to demonstrate that the intent of this
Section can be more effectively met through alternative means. If
approved, an alternative compliance landscape plan shall be
substituted for the standards in this Section only to the extent shown on
the plan.
1. Procedure. Alternative compliance landscape plans shall be
reviewed in accordance with the site plan and design review
procedures in Section 403.070, and the plan shall clearly delineate
and identify the modifications and alternatives proposed.
2. Review Criteria. Alternative compliance landscape plans may be
approved upon a finding that any of the following circumstances
exist on the proposed building site or surrounding properties:
a. Natural land characteristics or existing vegetation on the
proposed development site would achieve the intent of this
Section;
b. Innovative and exceptional landscaping or architectural design
is employed on the proposed development site to achieve a
buffering effect that is equivalent to the buffer standards of
this Section;
c. The required landscaping or buffering would be ineffective at
maturity due to topography or the location of improvements on
the site; or
d. The proposed alternative represents a plan that is as good or
better than a plan prepared in strict compliance with the other
standards of this Section.
G. Landscaping Plan Required. All plans submitted in support of a plan
review, conditional use, PD, and final plat shall include a landscape
plan. However, conventional single-family and two-family residential
developments are exempt from Section 407.040(G)(9) and (11). The
following plan standards apply: [Ord. No. 4625 § 9, 11-21-2016]

1. North arrow and scale.
2. Topographic information and final grading adequate to identify and
properly specify planting for areas needing slope protection.
3. The location and contours at one-foot intervals of all proposed
berms.
4. The location and dimension of all proposed and existing structures,
parking lots and drives, sidewalks. Refuse disposal areas, fences
above or underground utilities and storm drainage systems,
freestanding electrical equipment, recreational facilities, and other
freestanding structural features as determined necessary by the
City.
5. The location, size, spread (at the time of planting), type and
quantity of all proposed landscape materials, along with common
and botanical names of all plant species. The size, grading and
condition shall be specified according to American Association of
Nurserymen standards.
6. Mature size of plant material shall be drawn to scale.
7. Location of hose connections and other watering sources.
8. All landscaping required along with landscape calculation in a table
format on the drawing breaking out open space, buffers and
parking lot unit requirements, and plant units provided.
9. The landscape plan shall be properly sealed by a licensed
landscape architect, architect, engineer or plant nurseryman
licensed to practice in the State of Missouri.
10. All existing trees to be saved including type, size, location, and
condition shall be shown along with preservation methods
anticipated to ensure existing tree health and longevity.
11. Upon installation, a landscape architect, architect, engineer or
plant nurseryman shall submit a letter certifying the landscape
installation is substantially in compliance with the approved
landscape plan.
A. General. No parcel, lot, building, or structure in any zoning district
shall be used or occupied in any manner so as to create any dangerous,
harmful, noxious, or otherwise objectionable element or condition so as
to adversely affect the surrounding area or adjoining premises,
provided that any use that is allowed by the underlying zoning district
regulations, may be undertaken and maintained if acceptable measures
and safeguards are employed to limit dangerous and objectionable

elements to acceptable limits as established by the following
performance standards.
B. Fire Hazards. Any activity involving the use or storage of flammable or
explosive materials shall be protected by adequate firefighting and fire
suppression equipment and by such safety devices as are normally used
in the handling of any such material. Such fire hazards shall be kept
removed from adjacent activities to a distance which is compatible with
the potential danger involved.
C. Vibration. No vibration shall be permitted which is discernible without
instruments on any adjoining lot or property.
D. Noise. Noise which is objectionable due to volume, frequency, or beat
shall be muffled or otherwise controlled so that there is no production
of sound discernible at lot lines in excess of the average intensity of
street and traffic noise at the lot lines. Tornado sirens and related
apparatus used solely for public purposes shall be exempt from this
requirement.
E. Air Pollution. All uses shall be so operated such that no smoke, odor,
dust or other form of particulate matter shall be emitted that exceeds
the regulations established by the State of Missouri Department of
Natural Resources. Such uses shall be located so that prevailing winds
will carry such air pollution away from areas of greatest concentration
of persons. Also, such uses shall be kept removed from adjacent
activities to a distance which is compatible with the potential nuisance
or hazard involved.
F. Water Pollution. All uses shall conform to the requirements and
regulations established by the State of Missouri Department of Natural
Resources pertaining to the pollution of streams and other bodies of
water.
G. Toxic Gases. Every use shall be so operated that there is no emission of
toxic, noxious, or corrosive fumes or gases. The storage of toxic gases in
such quantities deemed by the Planning Commission or City Council to
constitute a potential hazard shall be located, dependent on their
weights relative to the normal atmosphere of the immediate vicinity.
Gases lighter than air shall be located in topographical areas having an
elevation greater than that of the surrounding area. Such toxic gases
shall also be located so that prevailing winds shall carry gases away
from the areas of the greatest concentration of persons and shall be
kept removed from adjacent activities to a distance which is compatible
with the potential hazard involved.
A. Intent. The intent of this Section is to:
Section
407.050
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section

AO:697
1. Eliminate adverse impacts from spillover of light and glare on
operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians, and land uses near light
sources. With respect to motor vehicles in particular, safety
considerations form the basis of these regulations. In other cases,
both the nuisance and hazard aspects of glare are regulated.
2. Provide attractive and appropriate-scaled features for the public
realm, streetscapes, common areas and other outdoor gathering
places for people.
3. Provide sufficient illumination that allows safe and comfortable use
of outdoor spaces, while minimizing the impact on adjacent
property.
B. Applicability. The following standards shall apply to all exterior lighting
except public streetlighting and other lighting that is specifically
exempted.
C. Flickering And Flashing Lights. No flickering or flashing lights shall be
permitted.
D. Light Location.
1. No fixtures that shine outward and create a glare from any
adjoining or abutting residential district or any street right-of-way
shall be permitted.
2. Lighting used to illuminate parking areas shall be arranged,
located or screened to direct light away from any adjoining or
abutting residential district or any street right-of-way.
3. Light sources of luminaires shall not be located within required
setback yard areas except on pedestrian walkways.
E. Maximum Illumination And Luminaire Height.

G. Measurements.
1. Metering Equipment. Lighting levels shall be measured in
footcandles with a direct-reading, portable light meter. The meter
shall have a color and cosine-corrected sensor with multiple scales
and shall read within an accuracy of plus or minus five percent
(5%).
2. Method Of Measurement. The meter sensor shall be mounted not
more than six (6) inches above ground level in a horizontal position.
Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been exposed long
enough to provide a constant reading. Measurements shall be
made after dark when the light source in question is turned on,
then when it is turned off. The difference between the two (2)
readings shall be compared to the maximum permitted illumination
and property line at ground level. This procedure eliminates the
effects of moonlight and other ambient light.
3. Exterior Lighting Plan. At the time any exterior lighting is installed
or substantially modified, and whenever a building permit is
sought, an exterior lighting plan shall be submitted to the Director
of Community Development in order to determine whether the
requirements of this Section have been met.
H. Color Of Light Source. Lighting fixtures should be color-correct types,
such as halogen, metal halide or high-pressure sodium vapor, to ensure
true color at night and ensure visual comfort for pedestrians. Lowpressure
sodium vapor lighting is permissible, especially in
developments where energy-efficiency is a priority. Mercury vapor
lighting is strongly discouraged.
A. Intent. The intent of this Section is to:
1. Increase the livability of neighborhoods.
2. Blend a variety of residential building types and projects into the
broader context of neighborhoods and respect the character of
surrounding residential areas.
Section
407.060
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
407.080
AO:700
3. Improve the appearance of neighborhoods that have a mix of
housing, and focus on the relationship of sites and buildings to the
public realm.
4. Create neighborhood character with details that emphasize the
human scale of neighborhoods, and promote connections and
relationships between neighborhoods and supporting areas.
B. Applicability. These standards apply to:
1. All residential districts Zoned TF or higher intensity;
2. Any residential restricted overlay district to the extent they are not
modified by an approved residential overlay concept plan;
3. Specific building types identified in Chapter 405.
C. Building Orientation And Patterns.
1. Individual buildings shall be oriented as follows:
a. Towards the public streetscape;
b. Towards a common courtyard, with access and orientation to
the public streetscape; or
c. Towards some other internal commons spaces, such as an
internal street network, greenway or other natural or civic
amenities provided through a planned zoning district.
2. All building types shall include allowed frontage types as provided
in Section 407.030.
3. To the maximum extent practicable, all buildings on a common
block frontage or similar grouping shall have the same orientation,
avoiding multiple parallel orientations to the public realm or
common space.
4. Where projects have multiple multi-family buildings on a single lot
or parcel and abut property used or zoned for single-family
detached houses, buildings shall orient perpendicular to internal
property lines to avoid disproportionate massing of large facades.
If a perpendicular orientation as described above is not possible
horizontal orientation may be used if the internal setback is
increased by at least fifty percent (50%).
D. Building Mass And Form.
1. The composition of buildings within the permitted building type,
setback and footprint allowances shall respect the surrounding
character of adjacent residential buildings including massing,
height, roof pitch and architectural features such as entrance
features, cornice and eaves, horizontal lines of windows, shutters,
dormers, belvederes and chimneys.
Section
407.080
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
407.080
AO:701
2. For projects including three (3) or more buildings, variation in
massing within the allowed footprints with main mass, secondary
masses or wings shall be used to avoid monotony of adjacent
buildings.
3. Windows, projecting bays and other simple composition details
associated with the internal floor plan of the building shall be used
to break up wall planes larger than six hundred (600) square feet or
greater than fifty (50) feet in horizontal length. However,
inordinately complex massing, such as multiple false peaks or bays
should be avoided.
4. Where buildings over three (3) stories are permitted, vertical
massing shall be created through either material or detail
differentiation creating a base [up to one (1) story from the ground
level] and a cap [up to fifteen percent (15%) of the uppermost
height] to distinguish it from the rest of the facade, or through step
backs of at least ten (10) feet for upper stories [above three (3)
stories].
5. Four-sided design, with entryways, windows and consistent
materials and architectural details shall be used on all elevations,
and blank walls and uninterrupted elevations shall be avoided.
E. Front Entrance Features.
1. Each building frontage shall include one (1) of the following front
entrance features:
a. A porch, at least eight (8) feet deep and at least eighty (80)
square feet. Porches may encroach into the required front
setback, provided it is between ten (10) feet and twelve (12)
feet deep, remains unenclosed, and includes only a single-story
roof structure.
b. A stoop, at least six (6) feet deep and at least forty-eight (48)
square feet. A stoop, including steps to the stoop may encroach
up to twelve (12) feet into the required front setback, provided
it remains unenclosed and does not include a roofed structure.
c. A portico, at least six (6) feet deep and between forty-eight (48)
and sixty (60) square feet. A portico may encroach up to six (6)
feet into the required front setback and may be enclosed or
unenclosed.
d. Low-rise or mid-rise apartment buildings may use a forecourt
or front entry plaza as the entrance feature.
2. All front entrance features shall have pedestrian-scale details,
including side light or transom windows, architectural
ornamentation, or single-story roofs or canopies that are integral to
the overall architectural character and design of the building.

twenty-five percent (25%) of the front facade. As an alternative to
facades with a larger percentage of front-loaded garages at or in front
of the front-building line of the structure, step backs of at least twelve
(12) feet to twenty (20) feet, side- or rear-orientation of garages, or
detached garages set behind the rear building line shall be used.
H. Accessory Structures. Detached garages, carports, trash receptacles/
dumpsters/compactors and other accessory structures shall

standards for street types and open space types in Chapter 406.
J. Access Limitation.
Section
407.080
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
407.080
AO:703
1. Driveway access shall be limited based upon the overall percentage
of lot frontage, as specified in Section 407.020. As an alternative to
lots with a large percentage of curb cuts and front access
driveways, small lots with narrow frontages shall use shared
driveways, common driveways, internal access streets and alleys.

have the primary and direct vehicle access to a collector or arterial
street classification. To the maximum extent practicable, access to
a local street that also serves single-family residences shall not
occur unless required for emergency. Large developments shall
have two (2) or more primary access points [one hundred fifty (150)
to one hundred ninety-nine (199) dwelling units two (2) primary
access points are recommended; two hundred (200) or more
dwelling units two (2) or more primary access points are required.]
K. Security And Crime Prevention. Site planning should integrate the
principles of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)
to the maximum extent practicable. Applicants are encouraged to
consult with the Blue Springs Police Department and the Community
Development Department regarding implementation of CPTED
principles. Applicant participation will be noted on the staff reports
delivered to the Planning Commission and to City Council. These
principles include:
1. Territoriality. Space within the development and along the edges
should be well defined and delineated to create a sense of
ownership, such that intruders and strangers stand out. This may
be accomplished through the use of pavement treatments,
landscaping, art, signage, screening, fencing and similar
techniques.
2. Natural Surveillance. An environment should be created where it is
possible for people engaged in their normal behavior to observe the
spaces around them. Space visibility should be maximized through
thoughtful design of building orientation, window placement,
entrances and exits, landscaping of trees and shrubs and other
physical obstructions. Nighttime illumination of parking lots,
walkways, entrances, stairwells and related areas should be
utilized to promote an environment in which natural surveillance is
possible.
3. Access Control. Access control should be planned and implemented
to restrict criminal intrusion, especially in areas where activity
cannot be easily observed. Access control may include but is not
limited to use of fences, walls, landscaping and lighting to prevent
or discourage public access to or from dark or unmonitored areas.
In addition, sidewalks, pavement, lighting and landscaping areas
should be used to guide the public to and from primary
development entrances and exits.

Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
4. Activity Support. Activity support should be implemented by
placing new or existing activities in an area so that individuals
engaged in a particular activity become part of the natural
surveillance of other areas. For example, picnic areas may be
located next to tot lots, not away from such areas, to assist in
observation of children at play. Additionally, playground fixtures
should not be built near ponds or detention basins or near streets.
5. Maintenance. Landscaping, lighting fixtures and other features
should be maintained to facilitate the principles of CPTED,
territorial reinforcement, natural surveillance and access control.
L. Privacy Assurance. Zero (0) lot line side yard setbacks shall be
permitted on one (1) side of a lot when shown on an approved final plat,
provided that the side yard of the adjoining lot must be at least fifteen
(15) feet. To maintain privacy for both the house and the adjoining side
yard, windows shall be offset. Clerestory windows are encouraged on
the zero (0) lot line side of the residence located on the zero (0) lot line
at least six (6) feet above the inside floor levels.
M. Open Space.
1. Projects with multiple multi-family buildings on a lot or parcel shall
have common open space as an organizing element of the project.
Pedestrian access to common open space systems shall occur
within five hundred (500) feet of every dwelling unit.
2. Any project over five (5) acres shall either be subdivided and meet
the open space standards of Chapter 406, or provide internal open
space that mimic the pattern and design of public open space
systems.
3. The following areas are not allowed as part of the common open
space:
a. Active private recreation facilities such as clubhouses.
b. Land on easements for overhead electric transmission lines.
A. Applicability. The design standards of this Section shall apply in NB and
more intensive zoning districts to any new development, building
addition or exterior renovation that requires a building permit from the
City of Blue Springs. Review for compliance with these standards shall
be conducted in accordance with the site plan and design review
procedures of Section 403.070.
B. Prohibited Materials. The following materials shall not be used as
exterior building materials and shall be prohibited on all exterior walls:

shall be prohibited from covering more than forty percent (40%) of
the exterior walls of any building.
C. Preferred Materials. The use of substantial amounts of masonry
materials (face brick, stucco, stone) is encouraged. The use of
aluminum siding and metal ribbed panels is strongly discouraged.
Evaluation of building materials shall be based on the quality of its
design and relationship and compatibility to building materials in the
immediate neighborhood.
D. Form, Scale And Proportion. The form and proportion of buildings shall
be consistent with the scale, form and proportion of existing
development in the immediate area.
E. Masses And Voids. The rhythm of structural mass to voids, such as
windows and glass doors, of a front facade shall relate to the rhythms
established in adjacent buildings.
F. Front And Street Side Exterior Walls. Front and street side exterior
walls, excluding windows, doors and overhead doors, consisting of a
single undifferentiated plane with a single texture or color shall be
prohibited. Visual interest may be accomplished through variations in
building plane, materials, colors, entrance canopies, and other design
features.
G. Visual Interest. Monotony of design in single or multiple building
projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be
used to provide visual interest. The use of different textures,
complementary colors, shadow lines and contrasting shapes may also
be used to provide visual interest.
H. Screening Of Equipment.
1. Roof-Mounted Equipment. Roof-mounted equipment, including
ventilators and satellite dishes, shall be completely screened from
view [one hundred percent (100%) opacity] or isolated so as not to
be visible from any public right-of-way or residential zoning district
within three hundred (300) feet of the subject lot. Roof-mounted
equipment shall be screened entirely from view using parapet walls
at the same height as the mechanical units. For additions to
existing buildings that do not meet this standard, individual
screens may be permitted with the design subject to approval by
the Director of Community Development. Parapet walls and any
other approved individual screens shall be coordinated with the

2. Equipment At Ground Level. All electrical and mechanical
equipment located at ground level shall be screened from view [one
hundred percent (100%) opacity] or isolated so as not to be visible
from the right-of-way of an arterial street or residential zoning
district within three hundred (300) feet of the subject lot. Such
screens and enclosures, when used, shall be coordinated with the
building to maintain a unified appearance.
I. Security And Crime Prevention. Site planning should integrate the
principles of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)
to the maximum extent practicable. Applicants are encouraged to
consult with the Blue Springs Police Department and the Community
Development Department regarding implementation of CPTED
principles. Applicant participation will be noted on the staff reports
delivered to the Planning Commission and to City Council. These

should not be built near ponds or detention basins or near streets.
5. Maintenance. Landscaping, lighting fixtures and other features
should be maintained to facilitate the principles of CPTED,
territorial reinforcement, natural surveillance and access control.
A. At the time of approval of a preliminary plat for a residential
subdivision, the Planning Commission shall designate a minimum
livable floor area classification for all lots within the subdivision.
Livable floor area shall not include open or screened porches, garages
or basements, except that finished basements designed for immediate
living space shall count towards the overall floor area for residential
buildings. Finished basements shall mean finished walls, flooring,
ceilings, cabinets, shelving, doors, windows, electrical outlets, and
plumbing.
1. Classification And Minimum Livable Floor Areas. The range of
classifications and corresponding minimum livable floor area shall
be as follows.
Classification

2. Criteria For Classification. Subdivisions are to be classified in a
manner that minimizes the difference in dwelling sizes between
adjacent residential developments. Unless the developer requests a
higher classification, the Planning Commission shall not classify
the subdivision more than one (1) step lower than the classification
of the abutting subdivision. More than one (1) classification may be
established within a subdivision when the Planning Commission
finds such multiple classifications appropriate to provide a more
harmonious transition in dwelling sizes. However, no more than
one (1) classification may be imposed on a single block within the
subdivision. In the event the proposed subdivision adjoins land not
previously classified, the Planning Commission may designate a
classification or classifications for the proposed subdivision that
will, in its judgment, be in harmony with the surrounding area. In
so doing, the Planning Commission may take into account the
average livable floor area and the minimum dwelling size
requirements set forth in deed restrictions of adjoining
subdivisions and the overall intent of this Section 407.110.
3. Classifications To Be Shown On Final Plat. Approved dwelling size
classifications shall be depicted on the final plat that is submitted
for recordation.
4. Effect Of Classification. No building permit shall be issued for
construction of a single-family dwelling that contains a total livable
floor area less than the minimum livable floor area permitted by the
classification approved by the Planning Commission, and it shall be
unlawful to construct a dwelling unit with less total livable floor
area than the classification requires.
5. Lots Not Classified. Each single-family dwelling to be constructed
on land not previously assigned a minimum livable floor area
classification shall contain a minimum floor area of eight hundred
fifty (850) square feet.

Section 408.010. Floodplain Management — FW-O And FF-O
Districts. [R.O. 1996 § 408.010; Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015; Ord.
No. 4625 § 10, 11-21-2016]
A. Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in
Section 89.020, RSMo., delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations
designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore,
the City Council of the City of Blue Springs, Missouri exercises such
responsibility as follows:
1. Findings Of Fact.
a. Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special
flood hazard areas of the City of Blue Springs, Missouri, are
subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all
of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
b. General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are
caused by:
(1) The cumulative effect of development in any delineated
floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities; and
(2) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
c. Methods Used To Analyze Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) that is the basis of this Section uses a standard
engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist
of a series of interrelated steps.
(1) Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood
factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood
selected for this Section is representative of large floods
which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur
on the particular streams subject to this Section. It is in
the general order of a flood which could be expected to
have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one
(1) year as delineated on the Federal Insurance
Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Jackson
County dated January 20, 2017, as amended, and any
future revisions thereto.
Section
408.010
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
408.010
AO:710
(2) Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a
standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of
the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the
regulatory flood.
(3) Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood
without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at
any point.
2. Intent. The intent of the Floodplain Management Overlay District
regulations of this Section are to:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in
flood heights or velocities.
b. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public
facilities which serve such uses, be provided with flood
protection at the time of initial construction.
c. Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
d. To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to
minimize those losses described in Section 408.010(A)(1)(b); to
establish or maintain the community's eligibility for
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
as defined in 44 CFR 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements
of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Section.
3. Compliance. No development located within the special flood
hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended,
converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the
terms of this Section and other applicable regulations.
4. Abrogation And Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this
Section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Section
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Section shall
prevail. All other City Code provisions inconsistent with this
Section shall be construed so as to be consistent with this Section,
and this Section shall control to the extent of the inconsistency
only.
5. Interpretations. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this Section shall be held to be minimum
requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing
body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other
powers granted by State Statutes to the City or other entities.
6. Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this Section and its adopting ordinance is considered
Section
408.010
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
408.010
AO:711
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering
and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare
occasions or the flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This Section does not imply that areas outside the floodway
and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be
free from flooding or flood damage. This Section shall not create
a liability on the part of the City of Blue Springs, any officer or
employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from
reliance on this Section or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
7. Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
Section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of
appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this Section shall not be
affected thereby.
B. Special Definitions. The following definitions shall apply only when
interpreting and administering the regulations of this Section. In case
of conflict with the definitions of Chapter 411, these special definitions
shall control as to this Section. In all other cases, the definitions of

AO:729
and/or their designee in the enforcement or administration of
this Section.
3. Further Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board
of Adjustment or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the
Jackson County Circuit Court as provided in Section 89.110, RSMo.
4. Floodplain Management Variance Criteria. In passing upon such
applications for variances, the Board of Adjustment shall consider
all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in this Section of the City Code, and the following criteria:
a. The danger to life and property due to flood damage;
b. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;
d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
e. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
f. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood
damage, for the proposed use;
g. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
h. The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive
Plan and floodplain management program for that area;
i. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
j. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected
at the site; and
k. The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems; streets; and bridges.
5. Conditions For Approving Floodplain Management Variances.
a. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/
2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots
with existing structures constructed below the base flood level,
Section
408.010
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
408.010
AO:730
Section 408.020. H-O, Historic Overlay District. [R.O. 1996
§ 408.020; Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
providing items (b) through six (f) below have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/
2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
b. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation,
or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local
inventory of historic places upon determination, provided the
proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued
historic designation.
c. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.
d. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
e. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or City ordinances.
f. A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a community official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of
insurance coverage; and
(2) Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with the record of all variance actions as
required by this Section.
A. Purpose. The H-O, Historic Overlay District, is intended to advance the

a. Development Permits. In acting on permit requests under this
Section, the Historic Preservation Commission shall consider
the extent to which the buildings or structures would be
harmonious with or incongruous to the old and historic aspects
of the surroundings. It is not the intent of this consideration to
discourage the contemporary architectural expression or to
encourage the emulation of existing buildings or structures of
historic or architectural interest in specific detail. Harmony or
incompatibility should be evaluated in terms of the
appropriateness of materials, scale, size, height, placement,
and use of a new building or structure in relationship to
existing buildings and structures and to the setting thereof.
b. Demolitions. In the case of the proposed demolition of an
existing landmark or building within a Historic Overlay
District, the Historic Preservation Commission shall review
such application and consider the following factors:
(1) The City's interest in protecting the public's health, safety,
and general welfare.
(2) The detrimental impact upon the historic architectural,
cultural, or economic character of the district or
community in general.
(3) The structural feasibility of rehabilitation considering both
the technological feasibility and the economic feasibility.
(4) The cost of rehabilitation and the remaining economic use
of the property if rehabilitated, and the economic impact
and hardship upon the owner.
6. Effect Of Report/recommendation. The Historic Preservation
Commission's recommendation for approval or disapproval of said

Section 408.030. Telecommunications Facilities. [R.O. 1996
§ 408.030; Ord. No. 4558 § 1, 8-3-2015]
permit application shall not be binding on the Director of
Community Development.
7. Guidelines For Rehabilitation. The Secretary of Interior's
Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating
Historic Buildings shall be the Historic Preservation Commission's
general guide concerning landmarks and older buildings in Historic
Overlay Districts.
A. Applicability. The following regulations shall apply to new
telecommunications facility uses, including facility replacement as set
forth in Subsection (D)(8). It shall not govern any broadcasting facility,
one owned and operated by a Federally licensed amateur radio station
operator, or one used exclusively for receive-only antennas. The use
shall not be regulated or permitted as an essential service public utility
or private utility. The foregoing notwithstanding, all pre-existing
telecommunications facilities within the City of Blue Springs, Missouri,
at the time of passage of this Section shall be registered with the City's
Director of Community Development within sixty (60) days from the
effective date hereof together with the height, width and location
thereof. The City of Blue Springs shall use its best efforts to notify all
persons or entities subject to the registration of the registration
requirement, but the failure of the City to notify an individual or entity
shall not relieve such individual or entity of the requirement of
registration. Failure to register an existing telecommunications facility
shall raise a presumption that said telecommunications facility was not
a legal non-conforming use on the date of passage of this Section.
Except as provided in this Section, any current legal use being made of
an existing telecommunications facility on the effective date of this
Section (herein non-conforming structures) shall be allowed to
continue, even if in conflict with the terms of this Section. However any
pre-existing telecommunications facilities must comply with any FAA or
FCC regulation or standard that requires retroactive application within
six (6) months of the effective date of such standard or regulation,
unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling
State or Federal agency. Failure to comply within the specified time
period shall constitute grounds for removal of the facility at the
operator's expense. Any telecommunications facility site that has
received City approval in the form of either a conditional use permit or
building permit prior to the effective date of this Section, but has not
yet been constructed or located, shall be considered a non-conforming
structure so long as such approval is current and not expired.
B. Purpose. The purpose of these provisions shall be:
1. To provide for the appropriate location and development of
telecommunications facilities and systems to serve the citizens and
businesses of the City of Blue Springs;
Section
408.020
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
408.030
AO:738
2. To minimize adverse visual impacts of communications antenna
and support structures through careful design, siting, landscape
screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
3. To maximize the use of existing and new support structures so as to
minimize the need to construct new or additional facilities;
4. To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of towers and
antenna towers as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single-use towers;
5. To ensure that any new telecommunications tower or structure is
located in an area compatible with the neighborhood or
surrounding community to the extent possible;
6. To facilitate the ability of the providers of telecommunications
services to provide such services to the community through an
efficient and timely application process;
7. To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through careful siting of tower structures;
8. To ensure that the regulation of telecommunications towers and
structures does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of
personal wireless services and does not unreasonably discriminate
among functionally equivalent providers of such service;
9. To create a hierarchy that influences both where new
telecommunications towers and facilities are located and the types
of antennas that are used and that favors co-location and City
owned sites and promotes use of an antenna with the least amount
of adverse visual impact;
10. To encourage the location of telecommunications towers in nonresidential
areas and to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas
where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; and
11. Telecommunications towers shall, to the extent possible,
accommodate emergency services antennas and shall not interfere
with any existing emergency service facilities.

to the extent that it provides only cable service as defined by Federal
law.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES — The offering of
telecommunications (for the transmission, between and among points,
specified by the user of information of the user's choosing, without
change in the form or content of the information as sent and received,
by wire, radio, optical cable, electronic impulses, or other similar
means) for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes or users
as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the
facilities used. They include all instrumentalities, facilities, apparatus
and services (among other things, the receipt, forwarding, and delivery
of telecommunications) incidental to the transmissions. Personal
wireless telecommunications services shall not be considered as
essential services, public utilities or private utilities.

B. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to provide a regulatory scheme
for the construction and operation of MWTs, providing electricity up to
ten (10) kilowatts, subject to reasonable restrictions, which will
preserve the public health and safety and minimize the visual,
environmental and operational impacts of MWTs on the City and its
residents.
C. Findings. The City finds that wind energy is an abundant, renewable
and non-polluting energy resource and that its conversion to electricity
will reduce our dependence on non-renewable energy resources and
decrease air pollution that results from the use of conventional energy
sources. MWTs also enhance the reliability and power quality of the
power grid, reduce peak power demands and help diversify the State's
energy supply portfolio.

Corner Lot
Interior Lot
2. Setback Exemptions In LI And HI Districts. No setbacks from a lot
line abutting a railway right-of-way shall be required in the LI and
HI Districts, provided that sufficient access for firefighting
equipment is available. Such access shall be approved by the
District Fire Chief, or their designate, before issuance of any
permit.
3. Setback Averaging. If the existing exterior setbacks of lots within
the same block, with the same zoning classification and fronting on
the same side of the street are less than the required exterior
setback of the underlying zoning district, applicants shall be
allowed to use the average exterior setback on that block. In such
cases, the "average setback" shall be the mean (average) setback of
Section
411.020
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section

all lots on the same side of the street within the same block as
the subject property. In no event shall lots with different zoning
classifications or undeveloped lots be included in the calculation of
the average setback, and in no case shall more than six (6) lots on
either side of the subject property be included in the calculation.
This provision shall not be interpreted as requiring a greater
exterior setback than imposed by the underlying zoning district,
and it shall not be interpreted as allowing setbacks to be reduced
to a level that results in right-of-way widths dropping below
established minimums.
Setback Averaging
If the existing exterior setbacks of lots within the same
block, with the same zoning classification, and fronting on
the same side of the street are less than the required
exterior setback of the underlying zoning district,
applicants shall be allowed to use the average exterior
setback on that block.
Average Setback
The average setback
shall be the mean
(average) setback of all
lots on the same side of
the street within the
same block as the
subject property.
4. Setbacks Reduced For Public Purpose. When an existing setback is
reduced because of conveyance to a Federal, State or local
government for a public purpose and the remaining setback is at
least seventy-five percent (75%) of the required minimum setback
for the district in which it is located, then that remaining setback
shall be deemed to satisfy the minimum setback standards of this
Development Code.
5. Build-To Lines. In cases where setbacks are referred to by a range
or a maximum, it shall be interpreted as a "build to line," at which
point or within which range a front building line shall be
established. Where the front building line is expressed as a
minimum percentage (%), it shall mean the minimum width of the
lot frontage that must be occupied by the facade at the front
building line, or any specified acceptable substitutes for a facade.

Specific uses are listed under each group which may relate to more
detailed guidance of plans or have specific limitations or standards
in these regulations. Where a proposed use appears to meet the
description of more than one (1) use, or is not described in this Section,
the Director shall make an interpretation on the most similarly
described use considering: (1) the intensity and scale of the proposed
use or proposed building type relative to site; (2) the typical site and
building type designs associated with the use from existing examples;
(3) the functional and operational characteristics of the use and
potential impacts on adjacent property; and (4) the potential
contribution of the use, and typical site and building type designs
to the character and intent of the district. Any use that may not be
interpreted as relatively equivalent to one described in this Section
is not anticipated by these regulations and may only be allowed by a
text amendment. Uses that are more specifically described shall not
also be considered to be part of a more general use description, unless
the context demonstrates a different intent. For example, grocery store
shall not be considered one (1) of the more general retail uses.

SIGN CODE
Section 501.010. User's Guide To Sign Code. [R.O. 1996 § 501.010;
Ord. No. 3221 § 3, 7-17-2000]
A. Purpose.
1. The Blue Springs Sign Code is a regulatory document adopted by
the City that is designed to govern the use, approval, construction,
change, replacement, location and design of signs and related
informational tools within the City. The Sign Code is not intended to
and does not restrict, limit or control the content or message of
signs. The Sign Code has a number of specific purposes:
a. To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of
communication.
b. To protect, conserve and enhance property values.
c. To enhance the attractiveness and economic well-being of Blue
Springs as a place to live and conduct business.
d. To encourage creative and well-designed signs that contribute
in a positive way to the City's visual environment, express local
character, and help develop a distinctive image in the City.
e. To recognize that signs are a necessary form of communication
and provide flexibility within the sign review and approval
process to allow for unique circumstances.
f. To create a framework for a comprehensive and balanced
system for sign regulation, to facilitate an easy and pleasant
communication between people and their environment, and to
avoid the visual clutter that is potentially harmful to traffic and
pedestrian safety, property values, business opportunities and
community appearance.
g. To encourage and, to the maximum extent practicable, require
that all signs within the City be brought into compliance with
the terms of this Sign Code.
h. To ensure proposed signage minimizes distractions and does
not create traffic hazards or sight distance issues for the
traveling public. [Ord. No. 4559 § 1, 8-3-2015]
2. The Sign Code allows for a variety in number and type of signs for a
use. The provisions of this Code do not necessarily assure or
provide for a property owner's desired level of visibility for the
signs.
B. Organization.
Section
500.150
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
501.010
AO:831
1. The Sign Code is divided into nineteen (19) Sections designed to
address specific issues about signs. In Blue Springs, the regulation
of signs is related to the actual or proposed use of the property.
This means that there are separate sets of regulations for:
a. Residential signs;
b. Public signs;
c. Commercial signs;
d. Industrial signs; and
e. Agricultural signs.
2. Related to these individual use standards are regulations for the
size and shape of signs, location of signs on the property or
building, overall sign design, sign maintenance and the approval
process. No single Section of this Sign Code contains all of the
regulations for any specific sign type. Reference must be made to
multiple Sections as described in the following Table:

are described in Table 2,92 Permitted Signs by Use. The purpose of Table 2
is to provide an overview of potential signs, each of the described sign types
have additional regulations described elsewhere the Sign Code.
1. "Standard Sign Permits" are appropriate for most sign applications.
This type of permit is intended for signs that comply with all
applicable terms of this Sign Code, without deviation or variation.
Standard sign permits are reviewed and approved by the Director
of Community Development or Planning Commission as
appropriate.
2. "Alternative Sign Permits" are appropriate for sign applications
that seek approval for a sign that is not completely described by the
terms of this Sign Code. Alternative Sign Permits are reviewed by
the Director of Community Development and approved by the Blue
Springs Planning Commission.
3. "Limited Sign Permits" are designed for the approval of temporary,
time limited signs and are approved by the Director of Community
Development.
D. Use. The Sign Code is intended to be used by the public, sign
specialists, City staff and City elected and appointed officials. Questions
regarding the Sign Code should be directed to the Director of
Community Development.
E. Conflict. When the provisions of this Sign Code are inconsistent with
one another or when the provisions of this Sign Code conflict with
provisions found in other adopted ordinances or regulations, the more
restrictive provision shall govern.
F. Interpretation. Interpretation of the provisions of the Sign Code shall be
made by the Director of Community Development.
G. Short Title. The regulations of this Title V, Chapter 501, of the City of
Blue Springs Code of Ordinances shall be officially known and cited as
the Sign Code of the City of Blue Springs, Missouri, also referred to
herein as the Sign Code.
A. All sign types have been designated in Table 2 according to their
appropriate use with specific categories of land use. Any sign or use not
included or specifically provided for in Table 2 may be assigned to Table
2 through interpretation by the Director of Community Development.

3559 § 18, 4-7-2003; Ord. No. 4000 § 1, 11-6-2006; Ord. No. 4303
§ 6, 7-7-2010]
Each use permitted in the City is limited to a specific amount of signage.
Table 3, Maximum Sign Area by Use, describes the appropriate
measurements for determining the maximum signage allowed by any
particular use.
B. The purpose of Table 2 is to provide basic information about the
distribution of sign types. All of the types identified in Table 2 are also
subject to the other regulatory provisions of the Sign Code as crossreferenced
in Table 1.
1. The sum of the area of all building and freestanding signs for the
use by lot must conform with the maximum sign area established in
Table 3.93
2. The size, location and number of signs for the use (regardless of the
type of permit required) must conform with the requirements
established in Table 3 and elsewhere in the Sign Code.
3. The characteristics and design of all signs (regardless of the type of
permit required) must conform with the requirements of the Sign
Code, except as permitted under the alternative sign permit
process.
C. All of the sign types are further described in Section 501.060,
Standards For Permitted Signs, Section 501.070, Standards For Limited
Permit And Exempt Signs, and Section, 501.190, Definitions.
D. Table 2 identifies the types of signs that may be appropriate for each
type of land use. In Table 2, signs are indicated as either: (L) allowed
with a Limited Sign Permit; (S) allowed with a standard sign permit; (E)
exempt from permit requirements; or (N) not allowed, except through
alternative sign permit approval process. The purpose of this Table is
only to identify overall sign types that may be appropriate for individual
uses. All signs, even those allowed with a limited sign permit, are
subject to additional regulations such as number, size, location and
design.
A. Table 394 contains more than one (1) measurement standard per use.
These are expressed in terms of:
1. Maximum number of signs;

Section 501.040. Measurement Standards. [R.O. 1996 § 501.040;
Ord. No. 3221 § 3, 7-17-2000]
2. Sign area permitted as a function of linear front footage of a lot;
and/or
3. Maximum sign size. The maximum total sign area may not exceed
the most restrictive (lesser) of the standards for measurement
identified in Table 3.
B. Notwithstanding Section 501.030(A) above, all existing non-residential
lots shall be permitted a minimum of fifty (50) square feet of signage,
except in the central business district, which shall be permitted a
minimum of twenty-five (25) square feet, all of which at any location
may be subject to standard or limited sign permit approval.
C. Lots fronting on two (2) or more streets are allowed the permitted sign
area for each frontage; however, the total sign area that is oriented
toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total
sign area allocation that is derived from the lot, building or wall area
frontage on that street.
D. The measurement of all signs on a lot as indicated in Sections 501.060
or 501.070 will be counted toward the maximum sign area
measurement.
E. A "use" shall include all purposes or activities for which the land or
buildings are arranged, designed or intended, or for which land or
buildings are occupied or maintained. A use may include multiple
ownership, tenancy or affiliations and may include accessory,
conditional and temporary uses.
F. Any measurement not specifically provided for in Table 3 may be
assigned to Sign Code Table 3 through interpretation by the Director of
Community Development.
G. The maximum sign size for individual tenant wall signs in multi-tenant
developments shall be the same as the maximum size for individual
uses, unless the size is restricted through a Master Sign Plan or
otherwise restricted in Table 3, such as through the size and/or location
of the building. For example, the maximum size of a wall sign for an
individual tenant in an office park would be two hundred (200) square
feet, provided the building facade is of a sufficient size to permit the full
two hundred (200) square feet of signage [wall signs are limited to ten
percent (10%) of building facade]. Where the facade is too small to
allow the full two hundred (200) square feet of wall signage, or where a
Master Sign Plan places other restrictions on tenant sign size, the more
restrictive wall sign measurement will prevail.
A. Sign Area Of Individual Signs. The area of a sign face [which is also the
sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one (1) face] shall be
computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or
Section
501.030
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
501.040
AO:836
combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the
writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any
material or color forming an integral part of the background of the
display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure
against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework,
bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise
meets provisions of this Sign Code and is clearly incidental to the
display itself. The depth (thickness) of a sign is not included in the sign
area if no message is placed there.
B. Sign Area Of Multi-Faced Signs.
1. Double-Faced Sign With Faces At Sixty Degrees (60°) Or Less.
Unless otherwise specified in these regulations, when the sign
faces of a double-faced sign are parallel or the angle formed by the
sign faces is sixty degrees (60°) or less, only one (1) sign face shall
be measured in computing the sign area. If the two (2) faces of such
a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the larger sign face shall
be considered the area of the sign.
2. Other Multi-Faced Signs. For all other multi-faced signs, the area of
each sign face shall be added together to compute total sign area.
3. Three-Dimensional Signs. Where a sign consists of one (1) or more
three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects,
sculpture or statue-like trademarks), the sign area shall be
measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane. Signs
with three-dimensional objects that exceed a projection of six (6)
inches from the sign face shall be subject to approval through the
alternative sign permit process.
C. Height Of Sign.
1. The height of a sign shall be computed as the vertical distance from
the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed
to be the lower of:
a. Existing grade before construction; or
b. The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of
any filling, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of
placing the sign.

Section 501.050. Illumination. [R.O. 1996 § 501.050; Ord. No. 3221
§ 3, 7-17-2000]
Sign illumination may be allowed by permit as indicated in Sections 501.060
and 501.070. Where a sign applicant seeks a permit for illumination, the
following standards shall apply:
2. In cases in which normal grade cannot reasonably be determined,
sign height shall be computed on the assumption that elevation of
the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of
the nearest point of the crown of a public street, or the grade of the
land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot,
whichever is lower.
A. Illumination shall be designed to eliminate negative impacts on
surrounding rights-of-way and properties. The light from an illuminated
sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness that will create a negative
impact on residential uses in direct line-of-sight to the sign.
B. Signs may not be illuminated in a manner that interferes with
(including glaring or blinding), misleads or confuses traffic. See Section
501.100.
C. External light sources shall be directed and shielded to limit direct
illumination of any object other than the sign.
D. Outdoor Lighting Standards. The following standards shall apply to all
sign illumination:
1. Light sources or luminaires shall not be located within a setback
required by zoning.
2. Maximum illumination and luminaire height.

I. Special Criteria For Certain Districts — Alternative Sign Permit
Application Process And All Signs In Adams Dairy Parkway Corridor.
Three (3) corridors or districts are identified in Table 2, Permitted Signs
by Use.95 They each represent areas of distinctive or unique character
within the City of Blue Springs. Applicants for sign approval within
these corridors may use the Alternative Sign Permit application process
to propose sign approvals that would be inappropriate due to size or
design elsewhere in the City. Questions regarding additional
constraints should be directed to the Department of Community
Development. The three (3) signage corridors are:
1. Interstate 70.
a. The Interstate 70 corridor is defined as land abutting
Interstate 70 or within one hundred (100) feet of its frontage
road right-of-way. High speed and high volume automobile
traffic characterize Interstate 70. It may be important,
therefore, for signage to be seen from a relatively long distance
and at high speeds.
b. Applicants that demonstrate need based on their specific land
use and site visibility may be granted a sign through the
95.Editor's Note: Table 2, Permitted Signs By Use, is included as an attachment to this
Chapter.

alternative application process that exceeds the height
limitation and mounting characteristics defined in this Sign
Code (such as a pole sign). No sign may exceed thirty-five (35)
feet in height.
2. Central Business District.
a. The Central Business District is defined by the boundaries: 7
Highway to 15th Street; Vesper Street to Walnut Street. It is a
pedestrian oriented district that is characterized by many
buildings that have no front property line setback. It is equally
important which signage be viewed by pedestrians as well as
by motorists.
b. Applicants may be granted latitude in signage design under the
alternative application process for setback allowances,
overhang dimensions, marquee signs and other signage
characteristics that contribute to the pedestrian or urban
nature of this district.
3. Adams Dairy Parkway.
a. The Adams Dairy Parkway corridor includes those properties
within the Adams Dairy Parkway Overlay District (ADP-O)
identified in Section 404.200 of the Unified Development Code,
and such properties as may be added to that District from time
to time. Authorized signs include those that are compatible
with their surroundings, are appropriate to the activity that
displays them, are expressive of the identity of individual
activities and the corridor as a whole, and are legible in
circumstances in which they are seen.
b. In addition to the general signage requirements contained
within this Sign Code, the following shall apply within the
Adams Dairy Parkway corridor:
(1) Height. No multi-tenant signs shall exceed a height based
on a rate of one (1) foot of height per one (1) foot of
distance from any right-of-way line, up to a maximum of
twenty (20) feet in height for signs visible from I-70, a
maximum of fifteen (15) feet in height for signs visible
from Adams Dairy Parkway, and a maximum of ten (10)
feet in height for signs visible from other streets or public
rights-of-way.
(2) Freestanding Business Signs. Signs for individual
freestanding office, flex tech, industrial or commercial
buildings will be permitted when no multi-tenant sign can
be obtained. No lot may have both a multi-tenant sign and
a separate freestanding business sign.

ARTICLE VI
Use And Management Of Rights-Of-Way
Section 505.300. Declaration Of Findings And Intent; Scope Of
Article. [R.O. 1996 § 505.300; Ord. No. 4557 § 1, 7-20-2015]
A. This Article is enacted to define the authority of the City and its officers
and employees with regard to public ownership, control and
management of its rights-of-way. The rights-of-way is a valuable public
resource that has required and will continue to require substantial
public investment and is intended to be used by the public in travel and
utilities when such use does not incommode the public.
1. Declaration Of Finding And Intent. The City of Blue Springs (Blue
Springs) finds that the public streets, alleys, easements and other
rights-of-way within Blue Springs:
a. Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property
in the business and social life of Blue Springs and in the
conduct of the health, education and commerce of its citizens;
b. Are intended for appropriately regulated public and private
uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that
intent;
c. Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other
public service entities delivering utility and public services
rendered for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare,
and general economic well-being of Blue Springs and its
citizens;
d. Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the
costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize
the inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from
such facilities' construction, placement, relocation, and
maintenance in the rights-of-way;
e. Are assets of the City of Blue Springs that taxpayers have spent
millions of dollars to acquire, and millions of dollars to improve
and maintain, and that when utility and similar companies and
other users of the rights-of-way excavate and otherwise disturb
the rights-of-way, the City must repave, reimprove, repair and
at times regrade the rights-of-way. Some of this expense is paid
for from the general revenue fund, and some from dedicated
tax sources;
f. Some rights-of-way users have failed to provide accurate
information to City contractors as to the location and nature of
facilities in the rights-of-way, or to relocate facilities prior to
City projects, and make demands on City contractors to pay for
damages to such facilities despite a failure to properly locate
Section
505.300
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
505.300
AO:909
and identify same, resulting in delays in public works projects
and increased costs to the City through higher bids from such
contractors, and have located facilities in such a way as to
interfere with large commercial trucks using the City's rightsof-
way; and
g. Passage of a rights-of-way ordinance to deal in a competitively
neutral fashion with telecommunications and other utility
providers will have a beneficial effect on all the citizens and
users of the rights-of-way as competition among utilities and
telecommunications providers within Blue Springs continues
to increase due to changes in technology, in Federal and State
law and increased demand for such services by City residents,
businesses, educational institutions, governmental officers and
other public and private institutions.
2. The City finds that the right to occupy portions of the rights-of-way
for limited times and at specific locations for the business of
providing telecommunications services or utility services is a
valuable economic right to use a unique public resource that has
been acquired and is maintained at great expense to City and its
taxpayers, and the economic benefit of such rights should be
shared with all the taxpayers of City.
3. The City finds that while telecommunications and fiber optic
facilities are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their
operations also involve rights-of-way, municipal franchising, and
vital business and community service, which are of local concern.
4. The City finds that it is in the best interest of its citizens to promote
the rapid, but safe, development of telecommunications, fiber optic
and utility facilities responsive to community and public interest, to
assure that telecommunications and utility companies provide
adequate, economical and efficient service to their subscribers, and
to assure availability for municipal services, educational and
community services while not compromising the public's rights to
use of the rights-of-way for travel and compensation for private
commercial use of the rights-of-way.
5. The City finds that it is in the interest of the public to establish
standards for all users of the rights-of-way not covered by a specific
franchise agreement such as the cable operator or payment of
gross receipts taxes regardless of type of service being provided
that:
a. Consider compensating the City for the fair market value of the
property used and reimbursement or recovery of one hundred
percent (100%) of ongoing costs associated with the use of
such property, including administrative actions as required by
Article VI, Sections 23 and 25, of the Missouri Constitution;

505.300

Section 505.301. Definitions. [R.O. 1996 § 505.301; Ord. No. 4557
§ 1, 7-20-2015]
b. Takes into account that a gross receipts license tax or a
franchise fee is paid by some users;
c. Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions
under which users may use valuable public property to serve
the public while creating and maintaining a level playing field
among similarly situated participants;
d. Fully protects the public, other rights-of-way users and the City
from any harm that may flow from such private commercial use
of rights-of-way while providing for innovative uses of
technology;
e. Protects the authority of the City, in a manner consistent with
Federal and State law, including, but not limited to, Sections
82.190, 82.230, 392.080, RSMo., and Article VI, Section 19 of
the Missouri Constitution as amended 1971, and as required by
Article III, Section 38(a) (prohibition on gifts or grants of
property to private entities), and Article VI, Sections 23 and 25
(no grant or aid to corporations of public property) of the
Missouri Constitution and as recognized by various State and
Federal courts;
f. Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and
use of City infrastructure, including recognizing that
disturbance of the rights-of-way and infrastructure therein for
utility and facility deployment impacts the rights-of-way in a
different and greater manner than other users both private and
public;
g. Minimizes physical disruption of the rights-of-way for other
users, the City, and travelers while maintaining aesthetic
quality throughout the City while also recognizing the rights of
abutting landowners, including but not limited to landscaping,
uninterrupted use of and undamaged private sewer laterals
and waterlines, irrigation systems and storm pipes;
6. This Article shall apply to all users of the rights-of-way engaged in
any activities defined in, regulated by, or requiring a permit
pursuant to this Article.
7. This Article and its application is in addition to all other City Codes,
provisions of this Chapter and the Design and Construction Manual
of the Department of Public Works as adopted, approved,
maintained and modified from time to time by the Director of Public
Works.

Section 505.350. Permit Conditions. [R.O. 1996 § 505.350; Ord. No.
4557 § 1, 7-20-2015]
A. Except as provided within this Chapter for sidewalk and driveway
excavation, no person may narrow, alter, affect or otherwise change or
impact the ROW without obtaining a permit under this Section.
1. Rights-of-way permit conditions include the following:
a. The Director may impose reasonable conditions upon the
issuance of a rights-of-way permit and the performance of the
ROW-user in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare, to ensure the structural integrity of the rights-of-way,
to protect the property and safety of other users of the rightsof-
way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to
the general public. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
505.070 of this Code, the deposit and fee for any ROW permit
for the installation of facilities under this Article involving
excavation or disturbance of surface or built infrastructure
such as a cut in a paved surface, and require repair or return to
a condition that is the same or better than before the
excavation, shall be one thousand five hundred dollars
($1,500.00). A portion of this fee shall serve as a deposit and be
refunded to the permit holder less twenty dollars ($20.00) for
issuance of the fee and the actual cost of inspection of the area
of excavation to determine if the requirements of this Article
have been met and any costs associated with the City repairing
the area of excavation or returning it to the condition that
existed just prior to the excavation.
b. Any right-of-way or permit fee involving the right-of-way
provided for in this Code, actions of City Council such as
passage of the budget or other policy of the City may be raised
from time to time by posting same on the City's website and in
the City Clerk's office thirty (30) days before the effective date
of same and providing electronic notice to the registered ROWusers
of such posting. The ROW-user may file an objection to
any fee and if it does so, the fee shall be reviewed by City
Council and approved, modified or rejected through a motion,
resolution or ordinance. The payment of this fee and deposit
shall not excuse or exempt the ROW-user from all costs it is
liable for under this Article.
c. When a rights-of-way permit is requested for purposes of
installing additional facilities and the performance and
maintenance bonds for additional facilities is reasonably
determined to be insufficient, the posting of an additional or
larger performance or maintenance bond for the additional
facilities may be required by the Director.
Section
505.350
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
505.350
AO:919
d. A ROW-user shall perform all excavation or work in full accord
with any and all applicable engineering codes adopted or
approved by the City and in accordance with applicable
Statutes of the State of Missouri, and the rules and regulations
of the commission or any other local, State or Federal agency
having jurisdiction over the parties. A ROW-user shall perform
all excavation or work in conformance with all applicable codes
and established rules and regulations and shall be responsible
for all excavation or work done in the rights-of-way pursuant to
its rights-of-way permit, regardless of by whom the excavation
or work is done.
e. Except in cases of an emergency or with approval of the
Director, no rights-of-way excavation or work may be done in
violation of a stop-work order issued by the Director if in their
determination conditions are unreasonable for such excavation
or work based on standard engineering and construction
practices.
f. A ROW-user shall not disrupt a right-of-way such that the
natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or
other waterways is interfered with. No person may park
private vehicles within or next to the work or excavation area,
except for such areas which may be designated and marked as
safe areas for vehicle parking in accordance with an approved
temporary traffic control permit.
g. If excavation or work is being done for the ROW-user by
another person, a subcontractor or otherwise, the ROW-user
shall be responsible for ensuring that the excavation or work of
said person is performed consistent with its rights-of-way
permit and applicable law and shall be responsible for
promptly correcting acts or omissions by said person.
h. The Director may establish in the rights-of-way permit
limitations on the amount of excavation or work which may
occur at one time and the amount of rights-of-way which may
be obstructed during construction.
i. The ROW-user shall, in the performance of any excavation or
work required for the installation, repair, maintenance,
relocation and/or removal of any of its facilities, limit all
excavation or work to that necessary for efficient operation.
j. The ROW-user shall not permit excavation or work to remain
open longer than is necessary to complete the repair or
installation, and in no event may excavation or work remain
open beyond the expiration of the rights-of-way permit or any
approved extension.
k. The ROW-user shall perform excavation or work on the rightsof-
way at such times that will allow the least interference with
Section
505.350
BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
505.350
AO:920
the peace and quiet of the neighborhood, and shall not work
between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. The ROWuser
may perform excavation work after regular working hours
for the Public Works Department inspectors and on weekends
if the Director approves such a schedule and the ROW-user
deposits with the City an amount mutually agreeable to cover
the additional costs to City of supervising and managing the
work during these time periods. City may draw on this amount
as it incurs costs for labor, materials and other expenses.
However, only restoration work will be allowed to be
performed on weekends.
l. The Director may limit the number of conduits that may be
installed by each ROW-user based on the reasonable needs to
ensure that no one ROW-user may unreasonably consume a
disproportionate amount of the available rights-of-way to deter
competition.
2. Temporary traffic control permit conditions include the following:
a. The Director may impose reasonable conditions upon the
issuance of a temporary traffic control permit and the activities
of the ROW-user in order to protect the public health, safety
and welfare, to ensure the structural integrity of the rights-ofway,
to protect the property and safety of other users of the
rights-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and
inconvenience to the traveling public.
b. A ROW-user shall comply with all laws, ordinances, codes,
regulations and all applicable engineering codes adopted or
approved by the City. A ROW-user shall be responsible for all
traffic control in the rights-of-way pursuant to its temporary
traffic control permit, regardless of who performs the
temporary traffic control.
c. The Director may order the cessation of temporary traffic
control approved by such permit if in the opinion of the
Director, based on standard engineering and construction
practice, conditions are unreasonable for the continuation of
such temporary traffic control. Except in cases of an
emergency or with the approval of the Director, there shall be
no interruption of normal traffic in violation of a stop-work
order issued by the Director.
d. No person may park private vehicles within or next to the
temporary traffic control area, except for such areas which
may be designated and marked as safe areas for vehicle
parking in accordance with an approved plan and areas where
parking is legally permitted under normal conditions.
e. If temporary traffic control is being done for the ROW-user by a
third person, such as a subcontractor, the ROW-user shall be

Section 505.360. Permit Validity And Display. [R.O. 1996 § 505.360;
Ord. No. 4557 § 1, 7-20-2015]
responsible for ensuring that the temporary traffic control of
said third person is performed consistent with the temporary
traffic control permit and applicable law and the permit holder
shall be responsible for promptly correcting any wrongful or
erroneous acts or omissions by said third person.
f. The Director may establish in the temporary traffic control
permit limitations to the extent to which traffic may be
impacted at any one (1) time.
g. The ROW-user shall limit all temporary traffic control to that
which is approved through the permit.
h. The ROW-user shall not impact normal traffic flow longer than
is necessary to complete the project, and in no event may the
impact to traffic exceed the expiration of the temporary traffic
control permit or any approved extension.
i. Non-emergency temporary traffic control on arterial and
collector streets may not be performed before 9:00 a.m. and
after 4:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday, nor anytime on Saturday,
Sunday or public holidays observed by the City of Blue Springs.
The Director may grant exception to this condition in the
temporary traffic control permit.
B. Issued rights-of-way permits and temporary traffic control permits are
not transferable without prior written consent of the Director. The
Director shall not unreasonably withhold consent for transfer of a
rights-of-way permit or a temporary traffic control permit.
A. Issued rights-of-way permits and temporary traffic control permits shall
be displayed by the ROW-user at all times at the indicated project item
and shall be available for inspection by the Director, other City
employees and the public at all times.
1. A rights-of-way permit and a temporary traffic control permit shall
only be valid for the area specified within such permit.
a. No ROW-user may cause any excavation or work to be done
outside the area specified in the rights-of-way permit, except as
provided herein.
b. No ROW-user may cause temporary traffic control to be done

BLUE SPRINGS CITY CODE Section
505.360
AO:922
excavated must do the following prior to the commencement of
excavation or work in that greater area:
(1) Make application for a rights-of-way permit amendment
describing the area in which the excavation or work will
occur; and
(2) Pay any additional fees required thereby.
d. Any ROW-user who determines that temporary traffic control is
necessary for an area greater than that which is specified in
the temporary traffic control permit must do the following
prior to the commencement of temporary traffic control in that
greater area:
(1) Make application for a temporary traffic control permit
amendment describing the area in which the temporary
traffic control will occur; and
(2) Pay all additional fees required thereby.
2. A rights-of-way permit and a temporary traffic control permit shall
be valid for sixty (60) days.
a. No ROW-user may commence excavation or work before the
rights-of-way permit start date or, except as provided herein,
may continue excavation or work after the end date. If a ROWuser
does not complete the excavation or work by the rights-ofway
permit end date, the ROW-user must apply for and receive
a new rights-of-way permit or a rights-of-way permit extension
for additional time.
b. No ROW-user may perform temporary traffic control before the
temporary traffic control permit start date or, except as
provided herein, continue temporary traffic control after the
end date specified in the permit. If a ROW-user requires
temporary traffic control beyond the temporary traffic control
permit end date, the ROW-user must apply for and receive a
new temporary traffic control permit or a temporary traffic
control permit extension for additional time.
c. One extension of up to sixty (60) days may be granted for a
rights-of-way permit or a temporary traffic control permit upon
request and may be granted without payment by the ROW-user

permit fees. To qualify for an extension, a supplementary
application must be submitted to the City prior to the permit
end date.
3. A rights-of-way permit and a temporary traffic control permit will
only be valid for those persons indicated on the approved permit

Section 505.370. Permit Denial. [R.O. 1996 § 505.370; Ord. No.
4557 § 1, 7-20-2015]
and may only be transferred with prior written consent of the
Director.
A. The Director may deny an application for a rights-of-way permit or a
temporary traffic control permit under this Chapter if:
1. The ROW-user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROWuser,
fails to provide all the necessary information requested by the
City for managing the public rights-of-way.
2. The ROW-user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROWuser,
including contractors or subcontractors, has a history of noncompliance
or permitting non-compliance within the City. For
purposes of this Section, "history of non-compliance, or permitting
non-compliance, within the City," shall mean the ROW-user, or any
persons acting on the behalf of the ROW-user, including contractors
or subcontractors, has failed to return the public rights-of-way to
its previous condition under a previous rights-of-way permit or
temporary traffic control permit.
3. The City has provided the ROW-user with a reasonable,
competitively neutral, and non-discriminatory justification for
requiring an alternative method for performing the temporary
traffic control, excavation or work identified in the respective
rights-of-way permit or temporary traffic control permit application
or a reasonable alternative route that will result in neither
additional installation expense up to ten percent (10%) to the ROWuser
nor a declination of service quality.
4. The City determines that the denial is necessary to protect the
public health and safety, provided that the authority of the City
does not extend to those items under the jurisdiction of the public
service commission, such denial shall not interfere with a ROWuser's
right of eminent domain of private property, and such denials
shall only be imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory
basis. In determining whether denial of a rights-ofway
permit or a temporary traffic control permit application is
necessary to protect the public health and safety, the Director may
consider one (1) or more of the following factors:
a. The extent to which the rights-of-way space where the rightsof-
way permit or temporary traffic control permit is sought is
available, including the consideration of competing demands
for the particular space in the rights-of-way, or other general
conditions of the rights-of-way.

b. The applicability of any ordinance, Code provision, or other
regulations that affect the location of facilities and public
travel in the rights-of-way.
c. The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the
rights-of-way, including whether the issuance of a rights-of-way
permit or a temporary traffic control permit for the particular
dates and/or times requested would cause a conflict or
interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other
event.
5. The area is environmentally sensitive as defined by State statute or
Federal law or is a historic district defined by local ordinance.
6. Any permit not granted within twenty-one (21) days after
application shall be deemed denied. The applicant may refile for a
permit without additional fees unless the failure to act on the
permit was the result of the applicant not submitting a complete
application or failing to provide information requested by the
Director or their designee.
A. ROW-users performing routine maintenance which does not require
excavation or work in the rights-of-way, which does not disrupt traffic,
and which does not require more than two (2) hours to complete, shall
be exempt from the requirement of a rights-of-way permit, provided
they meet all other requirements for performance such as return of the
rights-of-way condition. Failure to meet the other requirements for
working within the rights-of-way under the exemption shall result in no
future exemptions and permits will be required regardless of the time
to perform the work.
B. A ROW-user shall not be required to obtain a rights-of-way permit or a
temporary traffic control permit for temporary traffic control,
excavation or work which is necessary because of an emergency, and
that emergency is declared by a proper governmental authority with
jurisdiction over the emergency to be a disaster or state of emergency
under Federal, State or local law. In the event that temporary traffic
control, excavation or work is necessary during a disaster or state of
emergency, the ROW-user performing temporary traffic control,
excavation or work in the rights-of-way shall notify the Public Works
Department of the nature and scope of the temporary traffic control,
excavation or work to be performed in the rights-of-way, along with the
location of the temporary traffic control, excavation or work, and the
estimated time of the temporary traffic control, excavation or work.

A rights-of-way permit and temporary traffic control permit are required for
emergency situations. If, however, due to an emergency it is necessary for
the ROW-user to immediately perform temporary traffic control, excavation
or work in the rights-of-way, and it is impractical for the ROW-user to
first get a rights-of-way permit or a temporary traffic control permit, the
temporary traffic control, excavation or work may be performed, and the
required permit shall be obtained as soon as reasonably possible, but not
later than five (5) business days after the temporary traffic control,
excavation or work is begun. The ROW-user shall notify the City's Public
Works Department if emergency temporary traffic control, excavation or
work is necessary.

A. The ROW-user shall coordinate the placement of facilities in a manner
that minimizes adverse impact on any public improvement, as
reasonably determined by the City. Where placement is not regulated,
the facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such public
improvements so as not to impact or be impacted by such public
improvement as defined in the City's Design and Construction Manual.
B. All facilities shall be located and laid so as not to disrupt or interfere
with any pipes, drains, sewers, irrigation systems or other structures or
public improvements already installed. In addition, the ROW-user shall,
in doing excavation or work in connection with its facilities, avoid
disrupting or interfering with the lawful use of the streets, alleys,
sidewalks or other public lands of the City except as may be specifically
authorized by a temporary traffic control permit.
C. All facilities of the ROW-user shall be placed so that they do not
interfere with the use of rights-of-way and public lands. The City,
through its Director, shall have the right to consult and review the
location, design and nature of the facility prior to installation.
D. The ROW-user shall not interfere with the facilities and structures of
the other ROW-users without their permission. If and when the City
requires or negotiates to have a ROW-user cease using its existing poles
and to relocate its facilities underground, all other ROW-users using the
same poles shall also relocate their facilities underground at the same
time. The cost of such relocation shall be borne in accordance with this

Article and the Commission approved applicable tariff governing that
ROW-user.
E. All facilities and other appurtenances laid, constructed and maintained
by the ROW-user shall be laid, constructed and maintained in
accordance with acceptable engineering practice and in full accord
with any and all applicable engineering codes adopted or approved by
the City, the Code, the City's Design and Construction Manual,
applicable Statutes of the State of Missouri, and rules and regulations
of the FCC, the Commission, or any other local, State or Federal agency
having jurisdiction over the ROW-user.
F. The ROW-user shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take
all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete
on-site information regarding the nature and location of its facilities
within the rights-of-way, both underground and overhead, when
requested by the City or its authorized agent for a public improvement.
Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of the ROWuser
without any expense to the City, its employees, agents, or
authorized contractors.
G. Unless otherwise agreed to by the City and the ROW-user by license,
agreement or permit, the City shall not be liable for any damage to or
loss of any of the ROW-users' facilities within the rights-of-way unless
the damage is the result of the sole negligence, or willful, intentional, or
malicious acts or omissions of the City.
H. No above-ground facility, cabinet or storage/housing structure or
fixture located on the rights-of-way shall exceed any of the limits set
forth in the Unified Development Code and this Article without consent
of the Director and review and approval of the City's Planning and
Zoning Commission for a determination of the impact of such a facility,
cabinet or storage/housing structure on surrounding uses, including
view and plantings and sight triangles and mitigation of impact that
may be accomplished if such a facility, cabinet or storage/housing
structure is allowed. No above-ground facility, cabinet or storage/
housing structure shall be placed on the rights-of-way in such a way as
to impede or prohibit direct access by another ROW-user to its facilities
or any sight triangles or in such a way as to impede access and use for
the disabled, handicapped or pedestrians and vehicles in the normal
use of the rights-of-way. Cabinets should be located outside the ROW in
private easements whenever possible. A suitable reason must be
presented to the Director for each cabinet location to be considered for
placement in the ROW. The reason must detail why locations outside of
the ROW are not possible.

The Director may designate specific utility corridors by assigning specific
locations for each type of facility that is currently, or that the Director
expects will someday be, located within the rights-of-way. All rights-of-way
permits issued by the Director shall indicate the proper location for the
ROW-user's facilities and standard detail as required in the City's Design
and Construction Manual. Specific locations shall be specified in the City's
Design and Construction Manual and can include reservation of space for
any planned or future anticipated uses of the City, in its sole discretion.

If, in the preparation and planning of a public improvement, the Director
deems it appropriate for a conduit to be constructed by the City along,
across or under the rights-of-way, the Director shall contact all appropriate
ROW-users for their input on the planning and design of such conduit. If
a ROW-user desires to construct, maintain or operate facilities along such
rights-of-way, or any right, title or interest in the same, or transfer any
rights granted by the City to any person either by forced or involuntary
sale, or by ordinary sale, consolidation or otherwise, the ROW-user shall
notify the City of the same. In such case, the buyer, transferee, lessee
or assignee shall be subject to all provisions of this Article, including
the requirement to register. This provision shall not apply to the sale
of property or equipment in the normal course of business or to the
sale or lease of facilities to reseller ROW-users. No notice to the City
shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other similar
instrument, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for a pro
forma transfer to a corporation, partnership, or other entity controlling,
controlled by or under common control with the ROW-user.
B. A ROW-user may permit and has the authority to sell, sublet, or lease
any use of excess capacity and sell services for resale to any reseller
service provider providing service within the City, including the ROWuser's
subsidiary or affiliate. The reseller service provider shall first
register and obtain any necessary permit, license, certification, grant,
registration, franchise agreement or any other authorization required
by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to,
the City, the FCC or the Commission. The ROW-user shall also provide
the City, on at least a semiannual basis, the identity of entities with
which the ROW-user has entered into an interconnection and/or resale
agreement within the City. This notice will not relieve the reseller
service provider from its own obligation to register and obtain any
necessary franchise with the City. Nothing in this Article shall prevent a
facility based service provider from providing to any reseller service
provider the use of the facility based service provider's facilities in the
rights-of-way as authorized by Federal or State law.

rights-of-way concurrently, the Director may allow the ROW-user to use
such conduit if the ROW-user agrees to contribute to the expense of such
conduit. When a ROW-user is installing conduit in a trench, the Director
may install conduit for the City at City's cost for the conduit. The City shall
not be responsible for reimbursing any costs of the ROW-user in digging the
trench that the City does not specifically ask for.

rights-of-way at the same time and place. Applicants who apply jointly
for a rights-of-way permit may share in the payment of the rights-of-way
permit fee. Applicants must agree among themselves as to the portion
each shall pay.
B. The ROW-user shall participate in any joint planning, construction and
advance notification of excavation or work, including coordination and
consolidation of excavation or work as required by the Director. In
addition, the ROW-user shall cooperate with other ROW-users and the
City for the best, most efficient, most aesthetic, and least obtrusive use
of the rights-of-way.
A. A ROW-user shall promptly relocate or adjust any facilities located in
the rights-of-way as directed by the City for a public improvement. The
ROW-user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities
located in the rights-of-way as directed by the City which create a
threat to public safety. Such removal, relocation or adjustment shall be
performed by the ROW-user at the ROW-user's sole expense without
expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors
and shall be specifically subject to rules, regulations and schedules of
the City pertaining to such. The ROW-user shall proceed with the
removal, relocation, or adjustment of facilities with due diligence upon
notice by the City to begin removal, relocation, or adjustment.
B. The ROW-user shall promptly relocate or adjust any facilities located in
private easements for the construction of a public improvement at the
cost of the ROW-user if:
1. The City has condemned the private easement or the City has
purchased from the ROW-user the portion of the private easement
necessary for the public improvement; and
2. The City has compensated the ROW-user, through the
condemnation, purchase process, or other means of compensation,
for the cost of relocation of the ROW-user's facilities.

C. As soon as City prepared working drawings are available for public
improvements that will require the ROW-user to relocate or adjust its
facilities, the City shall provide the ROW-user with written notice of
required relocations or adjustments, the anticipated bid letting date of
the public improvement, and notice of the deadline for completion of
the relocations or adjustments. The ROW-user shall respond with any
conflicts and a proposed construction schedule within thirty (30) days,
subject to approval by the Director.
D. Following delivery of final design plans for such public improvements,
the ROW-user shall relocate or adjust its facilities in accordance with
the schedule set by the Director, provided the project is not delayed by
adverse weather conditions and other factors beyond the control of the
ROW-user. The ROW-user shall certify to the City, in writing, that its
facilities have been relocated or adjusted in accordance with project
plans provided by the City so as to allow the City, and its contractors, to
proceed with the public improvement.
E. If any facilities are not relocated in accordance with this Section, the
City or its contractors may relocate the facilities. The ROW-user and its
surety shall be liable to the City for any and all costs incurred by the
City should the City be required to have the facilities relocated,
including any increase in cost associated with the City's improvements
that are delayed or could be delayed by failure to move the facilities.
F. In the event the ROW-user is required to move its facilities in
accordance with this Section, any ordinary rights-of-way permit fee
shall be waived.
G. It is the intent of this Section for both the City and the ROW-user to
cooperate with one another so that the need for facility relocation is
minimized and, when required and feasible, relocations may be
completed prior to receipt of bids by the City for a public improvement.
H. Failure to comply with the relocation schedule set by the Director will
subject the ROW-user to penalties as provided in Section 505.670
hereof in addition to any other remedies available to the City.
A. A ROW-user owning abandoned facilities in the rights-of-way must
notify the City of its intent to abandon the facilities and must either:
1. Remove its facilities and replace or restore any damage or
disturbance caused by the removal at its own expense. The
Director may allow underground facilities, or portions thereof, to
remain in place if the Director determines that it is in the best
interest of public safety to do so. At such time, the City may take
ownership and responsibility of such abandoned facilities left in
place at its discretion;

ownership of its facilities to the City. If the ROW-user proceeds
under this Subsection, the City may, at its option, purchase the
equipment, require the ROW-user, at its own expense, to remove it,
or require the ROW-user to post a bond in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the City for reasonable anticipated costs to be incurred
to remove the facilities, except as otherwise provided herein.
B. If the City discovers abandoned facilities in its rights-of-way and the
owner of the abandoned facilities fails to respond within thirty (30) days
to a written notice sent by the City stating that the City considers the
facilities abandoned, or the City is unable to locate the owner of the
abandoned facilities after reasonable attempts, the City shall deem the
facilities to be abandoned, unless the City receives confirmation that
the ROW-user intends to use the facilities. Abandoned facilities are
deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or rights
it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
1. Abating the nuisance;
2. Taking possession and ownership of the facility and restoring it to a
usable function; or
3. Requiring the removal of the facility by the ROW-user.
A. If the City vacates a rights-of-way which contains the facilities of a
ROW-user, the vacation requires the relocation of facilities, and:
1. Vacation proceedings are initiated by the ROW-user, then the ROWuser
must pay the relocation costs.
2. Vacation proceedings are initiated by the City, then the ROW-user
must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the

3. The ROW-user shall participate in any joint planning, construction
and advance notification of temporary traffic control, including
coordination and consolidation of temporary traffic control as

any approved traffic control plan required by the temporary traffic
control permit.
A. Except as provided in this Chapter and other City Code, the following
shall regulate and control excavation within the ROW.
1. Prior to the commencement of placement of facilities, or repair of
existing facilities, the ROW-user shall provide at least ten (10) days'

event the excavation or work is not completed in a reasonable
period of time, the ROW-user may be liable for actual damages to
the City for delay caused by the ROW-user pursuant.
5. The ROW-user responsible for the excavation or work who leaves

necessary temporary traffic control and safety protection in
accordance with the temporary traffic control permit and any
applicable Federal or State requirement. The ROW-user shall also
be responsible for removing said debris from the rights-of-way. If
the ROW-user fails to comply with the temporary traffic control
permit or fails to remove debris from the rights-of-way, the ROWuser
shall be responsible for damages to the City, or its contractors,
resulting from said failures and shall indemnify the City and its
contractors as provided in this Article.
6. In the event the ROW-user severely disturbs or damages the root
structure of any tree or landscaping in the rights-of-way to the
detriment of the health and safety of the tree or plantings, the

and if it is not repaired or demolished by the owner, then the City
may abate the nuisance by repairing, securing, boarding,
demolition or other appropriate means.
3. In all cases where the conditions causing the building or structure

Section 515.870. Findings By Hearing Officer Following Hearing.
[R.O. 1996 § 515.870; Ord. No. 4517 § 2, 11-3-2014]
Within thirty (30) days from the date of the hearing required by Section
515.860. the hearing officer shall, upon the basis of competent and
substantial evidence offered at the hearing, make a conclusion of law as to
whether or not the building or structure in question is a public nuisance
demolished by the owner within the time specified in the order of
abatement; and if the owner fails to do so, then the City shall abate
the nuisance by demolition.
A. Whenever there shall be a failure to obey a notice to abate a public
nuisance issued as provided in Section 515.830 by not commencing
work in the time specified in the notice, or there shall be a failure to
proceed continuously with the work required therein without
unnecessary delay, the City Administrator, or their designee, who shall
serve as a hearing officer, shall call and have a full and adequate
hearing upon the matter, giving all interested persons at least ten (10)
days' written notice of the hearing. Any party may be represented by

by the owner if it should not. In the latter case, the cost of such
reporting shall be a lien upon the lot, tract or parcel of land upon which
the building or structure stands and shall be added to the costs of
performance for demolition or repair if the City shall be required to do
so, and shall be payable as provided for such costs. If an electronic
recording is made of the hearing, then the hearing officer shall

welfare of residents of the City, specifically finding as a matter of fact the
conditions of such building or structure which constitute the nuisance. If it
is found that the building or structure is a public nuisance, further findings
shall be made as to whether or not the procedures required by this Article
have been substantially met and complied with and whether or not the
abatement order of the Code Official to abate the nuisance was reasonable
in its terms and conditions and within the standards of this Article. If it is
found that the abatement order was not reasonable or within the standards
of this Article, it shall be the duty of the hearing officer to make their own
finding of fact as to what is reasonably required to abate the public nuisance
within the standards of this Article. If the hearing officer finds that a public
nuisance does not exist or that the procedures of this Article have not been
substantially met and complied with, the proceeding against the building or
structure shall be dismissed.

No. 4517 § 2, 11-3-2014]
A. If a proceeding is not dismissed following the findings required by
Section 515.870, the hearing officer shall issue an order of abatement
directing the building or structure to be completed, secured, boarded,
repaired or demolished, and vacated, as the case may be, within the
standards of this Article. This order, together with the findings of fact
and conclusions of law required by Section 515.870, shall be in writing
and shall be immediately delivered or mailed to each party to the
hearing or to their attorney of record. In addition, copies of the order
and findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be posted in a
conspicuous place in the office of the Code Official and within the City
Offices for the City of Blue Springs where public notices are posted for
a period of thirty (30) days from the date of issuance thereof. The order
shall state a reasonable time, which shall not be less than thirty (30)
days from the date of issuance, within which to comply with the order,
and shall further provide that if it is not complied with within such time,
the City Administrator, or their designee, may cause work to be done by
the City and its own crews or by contractors employed by the City for
that purpose, or the City may enter into contracts with persons engaged
in the business of repairing, securing, boarding or demolishing
buildings for the purpose of enforcing the order provided for in this
Section, provided there are unencumbered funds in the City budget for
that purpose.
B. In the alternative, upon the failure of the owner to comply with the
order of abatement directing completion, securing, boarding, repair,
demolition or other means of abatement of the building or structure as
required, or upon the finding of the hearing officer that the building is a
public nuisance under Section 515.810 hereof, the City Administrator
may request that the City Council exercise its authority of eminent
domain under Article VI, Section 21, of the Constitution of the State of
Missouri by declaring a public necessity for the taking of the property

to commence proceedings to obtain ownership of the building or
structure, and the property upon which it is located, by condemnation.
If the City acquires title to the property by eminent domain, the Code
Official shall thereafter abate the nuisance on behalf of the City by
repair, demolition or other appropriate action.
A. Whenever the City shall have caused the work to be done as provided
by Section 515.880, or incurred costs for emergency abatement as
provided in Sections 515.920 and 515.1000, the Code Official shall
certify the cost of the work to the City Clerk, who shall cause to be
prepared a special tax bill therefor and for the cost of the reporter at
the hearing, which shall likewise be certified by the Code Official. This
tax bill shall be issued against the lot, tract or parcel of land upon which
the building or structure is located and against the property owner. The
special tax bill, from the date of its issuance, shall be deemed the
personal debt of the property owner and shall be a lien on the lot, tract
or parcel of land until paid and shall be registered in the office of the
Director of Finance of the City in a book kept by them for such purposes
or in the same manner as other liens which the City has against
property.
B. If any nuisance abated by the Code Official or their designee as
hereinbefore provided extended before the abatement over the
property of more than one (1) owner, the cost of abating the same shall
be assessed in proportion to the amount of work and expense for each
proportionate part of the entire work in the area, and the special tax
bills hereinbefore provided for shall be levied and collected
accordingly; but, in determining who is the owner of any particular lot,
plot, or parcel of land as for instance in joint tenancy or in common,
shall be deemed a single owner in order to preserve to the City its lien
against the particular lot, plot, or parcel of land under the special tax
bill levied against the same as aforesaid.
C. At the written request of the taxpayer delivered to the City Clerk, a tax
bill for repair or demolition of a building or structure may be paid in ten
(10) equal annual installments, which installments, with interest
thereon to date on the unpaid balance, shall be due annually on the
anniversary of the date of issuance of the bill. Interest shall be at the
rate of eight percent (8%) per annum on the unpaid balance of the
special assessment, computed from the date of issuance. If any annual
payment of principal or interest shall not be paid within thirty (30) days
of its due date, the entire remaining balance of the tax bill shall
immediately become due and payable.
D. If a request for ten (10) annual payments is not made prior to the time

of the validity of the bill, the doing of the work and the liability of the
property and the property owner for the charges stated in the bill and shall
be collected if default should occur by suit brought in a court of competent
jurisdiction on behalf of the City. Judgment in any such suit may, at the
election of the City, order the property sold under special writ of execution,
with the proceeds thereof being applied first to the costs of sale, and the
remainder to the amount of the judgment, provided the property owner
shall remain personally liable for the amount of any deficiency remaining if
the proceeds of sale are not sufficient to pay the full amount of the lien, or
the City may forego the lien and elect to take a personal judgment against
the property owner for the entire amount of the unpaid special tax bill, with

emergency measures to vacate, repair or demolish a building or structure
which is a public nuisance under the provisions of this Article. The Code
Official shall provide notice to the extent such notice is possible and does
not interfere with the immediate preservation of the health, safety and
welfare of the public and occupants of the structure or building.

substantial endangerment to life, safety or sewerage system operation
or integrity, the Department may temporarily terminate such service as
is necessary to avoid or abate such condition. Service shall be restored
as soon as the emergency situation has been corrected. The
Department's decision to terminate service may be appealed to the City
Administrator pursuant to the provisions for hearing set forth in
Subsection (C) of this Section and Chapter 140 of the Code. However,
appeal of the decision shall not stay termination of the service. [Ord.
No. 4589 § 17, 3-21-2016]
F. In cases of repeated violations, the Department may revoke the permit
for the discharge of wastes into the sewage works, and effect the
