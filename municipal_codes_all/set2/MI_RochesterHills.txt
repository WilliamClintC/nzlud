PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rochester Hills, Michigan. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through Ordinance Number 399, June 19, 1996, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Chantal Parker, Code Attorney, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Beverly A. Jasinski, CMC, City Clerk, Jane Leslie, Deputy City Clerk, Susan Galeczka, City Council Liaison, and John Staran, City Attorney, for their assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

e.  If the petition is found to contain an insufficient number of signatures of registered electors of the City or to be improper as to form or compliance with the provisions of this Charter, the person filing such petition shall be allowed ten (10) days from notification of noncompliance for the filing of supplemental petition papers. The ten (10) days shall not be part of the ninety (90) day limitation. Only one supplemental filing shall be allowed. 
.4  When the petition is found sufficient and proper, the Clerk shall present it to the Council at its next regular meeting.  
Section 2.11 - Petition procedure 
Upon receiving an initiatory or referendary petition from the Clerk, the Council shall within thirty (30) days either:

Should the Council decide to submit the proposal to the electors, it shall be submitted at the next election in the City for any other purpose, or, in the discretion of the Council, at a special election. The result shall be determined by a majority vote of the electors voting, except in the cases where otherwise required by the Constitution or laws of the State. The Council shall approve the form of any question submitted to the electors. 
State Law reference Restrictions on number of special elections, MCL 117.5(c); special election approval, MCL 168.631, 168.639.  
Section 2.13 - Ordinance suspended - amended 
The certification by the Clerk of the sufficiency of a referendary petition, which was filed with the Clerk not more than thirty (30) days after the passage of the ordinance to which such petition refers, shall automatically suspend the operation of the ordinance in question pending repeal by the Council or final determination by the electors as the case may be. An ordinance adopted by the electorate through initiatory proceedings may not be amended or repealed by the Council for a period of two (2) years after the date of the election at which it was adopted and then only by the affirmative vote of not fewer than five (5) Councilmembers. Should two (2) or more ordinances adopted at the same election have conflicting provisions, the one receiving the highest vote shall prevail as to those provisions.  
Section 2.14 - Veto of Council action 
No ordinance or resolution of the Council shall have any force or effect if, within seventy-two (72) hours after the adoption thereof, the Mayor shall file in the office of the Clerk a written notice, with reasons, suspending the operation of such ordinance or resolution. In each case where the Mayor shall file such notice, such ordinance or resolutions shall not go into effect unless the Council shall within three weeks thereafter adopt such ordinance or resolution by the affirmative vote of not less than five (5) Members. If any such ordinance or resolution shall be passed, it shall become effective according to the terms thereof as originally adopted, except that it shall not be effective prior to the time of its last adoption. In the event a veto is overridden, the Mayor may not again veto the same resolution or ordinance.

The structure or pen shall have secure sides and a secure top attached to the sides and shall be designed to provide the dog with shelter from the elements of nature. If the structure or pen does not also have a secure bottom or floor securely attached to the sides, then the sides must be embedded into the ground no less than one foot. A hidden, in-ground electronic, fenceless or invisible fence pet containment system without a physical structure or pen as described in this subsection does not constitute a proper enclosure. 
(b)  While off its owner's property, a dog that has been determined to be a dangerous dog shall be kept on a leash no longer than four feet and muzzled in such a manner as not to cause injury to the dog or interfere with the dog's vision or respiration, but so as to prevent it from biting a person or another animal.

The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any dog that, at the time of the acts complained of, was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself, its kennel, its offspring, a person, or its owner's or custodian's property, or when the dog is a police dog engaged in the performance of its duties at the time of the attack. 
(b)  The owner of any dog that has been found to be a dangerous dog who fails to comply with the requirements of this division, including but not limited to failure to confine the dog in a proper and maintained enclosure, failure to post or maintain clearly visible warning signs, failure to properly leash and muzzle the dog while off the owner's property, failure to successfully complete a dog obedience program, or failure to maintain required insurance is guilty of a misdemeanor.

ARTICLE III. - DEER MANAGEMENT 
 
Sec. 14-90. - Findings and purpose. 
Increasing complaints about and incidences of deer/vehicle accidents, deer/human interaction, deer-related diseases and damage to private property make it necessary and appropriate to manage the deer herd in the City of Rochester Hills. The city council finds that the intentional feeding of deer contributes to an unnaturally large deer population resulting in traffic hazards, loss of natural fear of humans, risk of disease, and private property damage. By prohibiting deer feeding, the city council intends to manage the deer herd and improve public safety and quality of life in the city by reducing the occurrence of deer/vehicle accidents, deer/human interaction, the likelihood of deer related disease, and damage to private property. 
(Ord. No. 525, § 1, 9-22-08)  
Sec. 14-91. - Deer feeding prohibited. 
No person may place or permit placement on the ground or within five feet of the ground any fruit, berries, grain, vegetables, nuts, salt or other edible material or bait which may reasonably be expected to attract or feed deer unless such materials are covered or protected in a way to prevent deer from feeding on them. 
(Ord. No. 525, § 1, 9-22-08)  
Sec. 14-92. - Exceptions. 
The foregoing prohibition of deer feeding does not apply to: 
(1)  Naturally growing materials, fruit trees, other trees and shrubs, and live crops, plants, flowers and vegetation; 
(2)  Bird feeders; or 
(3)  Veterinarians, animal control officers, federal and state game officials and persons authorized by the city or other public authority in the course of their duties to treat, manage, count, capture or remove deer.

Sec. 22-132. - Findings and purpose. 
The city council finds the U.S. Surgeon General and other medical authorities have linked the use of tobacco products to numerous and serious health problems, and state law prohibits the sale, giving or furnishing of tobacco products to minors. Yet, despite this prohibition, the availability of tobacco products to minors continues to be a major problem, and tobacco product vending machines are often located in unattended and unmonitored areas allowing for the unlawful purchase of tobacco products by minors. Restricting tobacco product vending machines in the city to specified locations that are not generally accessible to minors will reduce the availability of tobacco products to minors and promote the public health, welfare and safety as a result. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to restrict tobacco product vending machines in the city to specified locations that are not generally accessible to minors.

It shall be unlawful for the owner, tenant or proprietor of any premises in the city to offer or sell tobacco products through a tobacco product vending machine except in the following specified locations: 
(1)  Access by minors to premises prohibited. A tobacco product vending machine may be placed or located wholly within premises or portions thereof to which access by minors is expressly prohibited either by law or by policy of the owner of the premises. 
(2)  Commercial and industrial buildings. A tobacco product vending machine may be placed or located wholly within a commercial building or industrial plant or a portion thereof where the general public is prohibited from entering by appropriate signs, where the tobacco product vending machine is intended strictly for the use of employees, and where minor employees are not usually admitted. 
(3)  Unattended and unmonitored areas. Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, no tobacco product vending machine shall be placed or located closer than 20 feet to any entrance or exit or within a restroom, coat room, outer waiting area, unmonitored hallway or any other area that is not constantly supervised or monitored during the hours the tobacco product vending machine is available for use, nor shall a tobacco product vending machine be placed or located in an area where it may be accessible to the public when the premises where it is located are closed.

(2)  Exercise of power of eminent domain. Failing agreement, such grantee may request that the city exercise its power of eminent domain for the necessary public purpose of enabling the grantee to serve residents of that multiple unit residential dwelling. 
a.  Condemnation proceedings. Upon request of such grantee, the city may commence condemnation proceedings in accordance with applicable law. 
b.  Considerations for just compensation. If such proceeding occurs, in preparing its good faith offer of just compensation, the city may consider the following: 
1.  The amount and fair market value of space occupied by the grantee's cable and related facilities. The fair market value of the space shall be assessed in light of the prior use, if any, of that space, together with any evidence of nonspeculative alternative uses; 
2.  The present value of any funds that the owner will reasonably expend over time in ensuring that the grantee conforms to all laws, regulations and reasonable conditions necessary to ensure the safety, convenient functioning, and appearance of the multiple unit residential dwelling; 
3.  The continued physical availability of other space on the premises for the installation of alternative modes of television program reception or delivery; 
4.  As an offset to the amounts set forth in subsections (b)(2)b.1 and (b)(2)b.2 of this section, any increase in the fair market value of the multiple unit residential dwelling attributable to the availability of the grantee's service to the property's tenants; and 
5.  Any other reasonable, nonspeculative factors that the city may find relevant. 
c.  Indemnification of city. The requesting grantee shall indemnify the city for all expenses and costs incurred by the city in the condemnation proceedings as well as for the full amount of the condemnation award made to the owner if such condemnation proceedings are completed or otherwise settled. 
(c)  Additional charge. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this article or the franchise agreement, the grantee shall be permitted to charge each resident of a multiple unit residential dwelling an additional charge, above and beyond the service rate for a single-family dwelling as specified in the franchise agreement, solely to defray the exact additional per-resident cost to the grantee of compensating the owner for access to the multiple unit residential dwelling. 
(d)  Justifiable withholding of service. Notwithstanding any other subsection of this section or any other section in this article, the grantee shall not be obligated to provide service to any multiple unit residential dwelling so long as the owner of that dwelling demands compensation from the grantee in an amount that is unreasonable or imposes financial or other conditions that would, in the grantee's reasonable business judgment, render provision of service to that dwelling uneconomical. 
(1)  Condemnation not required. The grantee shall not be obligated, in such circumstances, to request the city to institute condemnation proceedings. 
(2)  Installation charges. If the grantee subsequently agrees to render service to such multiple unit residential dwelling, there shall be no installation charges to the residents of such dwelling beyond those allowed in the franchise agreement. 
(e)  Prohibitions for owner. Neither the owner of any multiple unit residential dwelling nor his agent or representative shall penalize, charge or surcharge a tenant or resident or forfeit or threaten to forfeit any right of such tenant or resident or discriminate in any way against such tenant or resident who requests or receives cable communications service from a company operating under a valid and existing cable communications franchise issued by the city. 
(f)  Resale prohibited. No person shall resell, without the express written consent of both the grantee and the city, any cable service, program or signal transmitted by a grantee operating under a franchise issued by the city. 
(g)  Conformance to laws. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a person from requiring that cable communications system facilities conform to laws and regulations and reasonable conditions necessary to protect safety, functioning and appearance. 
(h)  Indemnity for damage. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a grantee from agreeing to indemnify the owner or his agents or representatives for damages or for liability for physical damages caused by installation, operation, maintenance, or removal of cable television facilities.

(c)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude a subscriber from requesting and receiving from the grantee a rebate greater than that provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.

Sec. 42-62. - Alarm user liability. 
Alarm users shall be jointly and severally responsible for violations of this article, including owner(s), co-tenants or lessor(s) and lessee(s).

(Ord. No. 515, § 1, 12-13-2006)  
Sec. 42-65. - Violations; penalties; fees. 
(a)  The occurrence of a false alarm shall constitute a violation of this article. To ensure that all alarm systems are properly maintained in good operating order and to minimize the cost to the city for false alarms, alarm users and alarm system contractors shall be held responsible as provided in this section. Notwithstanding any penalties provided for a violation of this article, and notwithstanding the fact that a prosecution for a violation of this article has or has not been commenced, alarm users shall pay to the city a fee or fine as provided in this section, for each false alarm, and shall also be held responsible as follows: 
(1)  First false alarm requiring a police response within a calendar year: warning notice pursuant to subsection (g), with no fine or fees. 
(2)  Second, third, fourth, and fifth false alarm requiring a police response within a calendar year shall be assessed fees as provided in section 54-436. 
(3)  Subsequent false alarms requiring six or more police responses within a calendar year shall be considered a municipal civil infraction and upon determination of responsibility therefor shall be punishable by a civil fine of not more than $500.00 and assessed an administrative fee as provided in section 54-436. 
(4)  Any false alarm that occurs after March 31, 2007, on an alarm system that has not been registered as required by section 42-33 shall be subject to an additional fee as provided in section 54-436. 
(5)  Where the occurrence of a false alarm is in premises that are leased or otherwise not occupied by the owner, the notice of infraction for the false alarms in subsections (g) and (h) shall be sent to both the owner(s) and the person who occupies the leasehold premises. 
(b)  Exceptions. No fine or fee shall be assessed for an alarm which was activated by criminal activity, attempted criminal activity, or a verified medical emergency for which the alarm was intended. 
(c)  Shut-off fee. Alarm systems equipped with audible signals that are not fitted with a shut-off device shall be subject to deactivation by representatives of the sheriff's department. The alarm user shall be subject to a shut-off fee as provided in section 54-436, in addition to any false alarm fees, which may be associated with the summons of an emergency police response. 
(d)  Payment due. Payment of the false alarm fee shall be paid to the city within 30 days after the city's mailing of an invoice for the fee to the address where the alarm system is located. The amount of the invoice shall constitute a debt in favor of the city and the obligation of the alarm user. The invoice shall also include the following provision: "A person aggrieved by this false alarm determination may submit a letter of appeal to the sheriff's department for review of the determination or penalty being appealed, as provided in section 42-66 of the City Code of Ordinances." 
(e)  Failure to pay. A person or entity liable for the payment of a police response fee who fails to make payment in full to the city within 30 days of the invoice date shall be responsible for a municipal civil infraction, and shall be responsible for fines up to $500.00, and for full payment of the fee, and for a five percent late payment penalty to reimburse the city for a portion of its administrative costs incurred for pursuing and processing the overdue invoice. This provision shall be tolled in the event that the alarm user appeals pursuant to the appeal provisions of this article, but such payment shall be due to the city within ten business days of the date of the appeal decision. 
(f)  City recourse. When payment of the city's invoice is not timely made, the city shall have the following recourse: 
(1)  The city may commence a civil action against a person who is liable for the payment of the cost of police response and who fails to make payment in full to the city as required by this article. The city shall be entitled to recover the collection expenses, statutory interest, court costs, and reasonable attorney fees incurred for pursuing the civil action. 
(2)  False alarms are deemed a public nuisance, and therefore any invoice, including the late payment penalty, which remains unpaid for 90 days from the invoice date, and which is not being reviewed pursuant to the appeal provisions of this article, shall constitute a lien against the premises to which the sheriff's department responded. The mayor or mayor's authorized representative may certify the delinquency to the city assessor and in such case the fee shall be entered upon the next tax roll as a lien against the premises which shall be collected and enforced in the same manner with the same interest and penalties as general property taxes against such premises. An additional $20.00 fee shall be added and certified to the tax assessing officer for collection. 
(3)  The city may cite the alarm user for a municipal civil infraction pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. 
(g)  First false alarm notice. For a first false alarm requiring a police response within a calendar year, the sheriff's department alarm compliance officer shall mail a false alarm warning notice to the alarm user at his, her, or its last known address by first class mail following the false alarm occurrence. The notice shall indicate the occurrence of the false alarm and the potential penalties, as set forth in this article, for future false alarm occurrences. The letter shall also include the following provision: "A person aggrieved by this false alarm determination may submit a letter of appeal to the alarm compliance officer, within ten business days, for review of the determination or penalty being appealed, as provided in section 42-67 of the City Code of Ordinances." 
(h)  Subsequent false alarms action. The occurrence of six or more false alarms requiring a police response within a calendar year is deemed to be a public nuisance. After the occurrence of a sixth such false alarm within a calendar year, the city attorney may seek abatement of the nuisance in conjunction with prosecution in the district court for a violation of subsection (a) of this section. In the event that the district court action does not result in an order requiring abatement of the nuisance, the city council may authorize the city attorney to initiate civil proceedings in the Oakland County Circuit Court for court-ordered abatement of the nuisance. 
(i)  Presumption as to "alarm user". For purposes of prosecuting violations of the penal provisions of this section, and for purposes of collecting the fees incurred because of excessive false alarms, "alarm user" is presumed to be that person whose name appears on the most recent assessment roll approved by the board of review, as updated, associated with the real or personal property protected by the alarm system.

(2)  Extenuating circumstances. The fee may be waived where in the alarm compliance officer's discretion cause is shown that the false alarm was attributable to extenuating circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the alarm system owner or lessee and did not result from neglect, disrepair, lack of maintenance or improper installation. 
(Ord. No. 515, § 1, 12-13-2006)  
Sec. 42-67. - Appeals. 
(a)  Appeals. In the event the request to waive the false alarm fee or other fee assessed by this article is denied by the alarm compliance officer, the alarm user may appeal the decision by submitting a written notice of appeal to the alarm compliance officer within ten business days of the denial. The alarm compliance officer shall forward the notice of appeal and all supporting documentation along with the sheriff department's file on the waiver request to the alarm appeal panel.

(b)  Failure to have an alarm system inspected after the written notice is issued pursuant to subsection (a) shall constitute a municipal civil infraction, punishable as provided by ordinance. 
(c)  Exemptions. Severe weather, power outages, transmission line malfunctions, malicious acts of person(s) not under the control of the alarm user, or any other cause clearly beyond the reasonable control of the alarm user may be considered in determining whether or not enforcement action will be taken against the alarm user as provided for in this article. 
(Ord. No. 515, § 1, 12-13-2006)  
Sec. 42-69. - No liability of city. 
The city assumes no liability for any defects in the operation of any security or fire alarm system, for any failure or neglect of any person associated with the installation, operation or maintenance of any alarm system, for any failure or neglect of any alarm user, for the transmission or receipt of alarm signals or any failure or neglect to respond upon receipt of an alarm from any source.

Sec. 70-400. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Persons under age 18 are prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing cigarettes and other tobacco products, and retailers are prohibited from selling them to minors. However, new tobaccoless products, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, are available which allow the user to simulate cigarette smoking and ingest nicotine. These products may be purchased by minors and are being marketed without age restrictions or health warnings and come in different flavors that appeal to young people. 
(b)  The production and distribution of e-cigarettes is not currently regulated by federal or state authorities, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not completed testing of these products. But, initial studies by the FDA have determined that e-cigarettes can increase nicotine addiction among young people and contain chemical ingredients known to be harmful, which may expose users and the public to potential health risks. 
(c)  Therefore, the Rochester Hills City Council determines that prohibiting the sale, giving or furnishing of e-cigarettes to minors and prohibiting the purchase, possession or use of e-cigarettes by minors is in the city's best interests and will promote the public health, safety and welfare.

(b)  E-cigarette cartridge shall mean a container which has openings on each end, serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece, allows the passage of a liquid to an atomizer and vapor from the atomizer to the user's mouth, and contains liquid for producing vapor in an e-cigarette. 
(c)  Minor shall mean an individual younger than 18 years of age.

ARTICLE IV. - COMPOSTING FACILITIES  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 86-301. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Aerobic composting means the process of biologically decomposing organic matter in an environment with oxygen present. 
Anaerobic composting means the process of biologically decomposing organic matter in an environment with little or no oxygen present. 
Carbonaceous compostable material means the portion of the compostable material stream consisting primarily of carbon content, including leaves, straw, hay, wood chips, sawdust, cornstalks, or other typically brown material. 
Compostable material means leaves, grass clippings, brush, wood or wood byproducts, Christmas trees or wreaths, lumber and wood pallets that are ground or shredded, vegetable prunings, garden waste, yard waste, and any other material intended to be processed at a composting facility. 
Composting means the process by which biological decomposition of organic solid matter is carried out under controlled aerobic conditions and which stabilizes the organic fraction into a material that can easily and safely be stored, handled, and used in an environmentally acceptable manner. 
Composting facility means a publicly or privately owned site where compostable materials are processed, applying composting technology, over an area exceeding one-quarter acre. Processing may include physical turning, windrowing, aeration, or other mechanical handling of organic matter. For purposes of this article, the term "composting facility" does not include premises where compostable materials naturally grown on the same premises are composted. 
Curing means the last stage of composting that occurs after much of the readily metabolized material has decomposed. It provides for additional stabilization and pathogen destruction via soil-dwelling microorganisms. 
Curing area means an area where organic material that has undergone the rapid initial stage of composting is further stabilized into a humuslike material, typically by allowing piled material to simply remain untouched for a month or more. 
Leafate means the liquid that has come in contact with or percolated through yard clippings and thereby has extracted dissolved and suspended material. 
Nitrogenous yard wastes means the portion of the yard waste stream consisting primarily of nitrogen content, including grass clippings or other typically green material. 
Operator means the person responsible for the operation of a composting facility.

(b)  As used in this section, "street" means the portion of any city street, highway or roadway that is improved, designed or ordinarily used for vehicular travel, including the shoulder, if any. 
(c)  Whenever the mayor finds, on the basis of snow, sleet or freezing rain accumulation, or on the basis of a forecast by the United States Weather Bureau or other weather service of snow, sleet or freezing rain that weather conditions will make it necessary that motor vehicle traffic be expedited and that parking on city streets be prohibited for snow plowing, de-icing and other purposes, the mayor shall declare a winter weather emergency and put into effect a parking prohibition on all or any portion of city streets as the mayor determines necessary by declaring such emergency as provided in this subsection. 
(d)  Once in effect, a prohibition under this section shall remain in effect until terminated by announcement of the mayor in accordance with this subsection, except that any street which has become substantially clear of snow and ice from curb to curb, or to the edge of the shoulder for streets without curbs, for the length of the entire block shall be automatically excluded therefrom. 
(e)  Whenever a vehicle becomes stalled or disabled for any reason, whether or not in violation of this subsection, on any portion of a city street to which the parking prohibition applies, the person operating the vehicle shall take immediate action to have the vehicle towed or pushed off the street. No person shall abandon or leave their vehicle in a city street (regardless of whether the person indicates, by raising the hood or otherwise, that the vehicle is stalled), except for the purpose of securing assistance during the actual time necessary to go to a nearby telephone or to a nearby garage, automobile service station or other place of assistance and return without delay. 
(f)  (1)  Declaration. The mayor shall cause each declaration of a winter weather emergency made pursuant to this section to be publicly announced, between 6:00 A.M. and 8:00 P.M., by means of broadcasts or telecasts from stations with a normal operating range covering the city, and the mayor may cause such declaration to be further announced in newspapers of general circulation when feasible. Each announcement shall describe the action taken by the mayor, including the time it became or will become effective, and shall specify the streets affected. 
(2)  Time of effect. The parking prohibition resulting from the mayor's winter weather emergency declaration shall go into effect two hours after it has been first announced. 
(3)  Record. The mayor shall make a record of each time and date when any winter weather emergency declaration is announced to the public pursuant to this section. 
(g)  Whenever the mayor shall find that some or all of the conditions which give rise to a winter weather emergency declaration no longer exist, the mayor may declare the winter weather emergency and parking prohibition terminated, in whole or in part, effective immediately upon announcement. 
(h)  Any provision of this section which becomes effective by declaration of the mayor or upon the occurrence of certain weather conditions shall, while temporarily in effect, take precedence over other conflicting city ordinance code provisions normally in effect, except that it shall not take precedence over city ordinance code provisions relating to traffic accidents, emergency travel or authorized emergency vehicles, or emergency traffic directions by a police officer. 
(i)  (1)  Enforcement authority. This section 98-108 shall only be enforceable by the county sheriff's department, who shall have the authority to issue and serve parking violation notices or appearance tickets for violations of this section 98-108. 
(2)  Civil infraction. Any person who violates this section is responsible for a civil infraction. 
(3)  Presumption of responsibility for parking or leaving vehicle. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner was the person who parked or left the vehicle in violation of this section. 
(4)  Service of appearance ticket. An appearance ticket for a violation of this section need not be served personally upon the violator, but may be served by attaching a copy to the subject vehicle. 
(5)  Impounding of vehicle. Any vehicle parked or left on any city street in violation of this section may be towed and impounded, and no person may recover any impounded vehicle without first paying the cost of removal and storage, notwithstanding, and apart from, any fine which may also be imposed for violation of this section.

When limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the department may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 CFR 403.6(c)(4) and shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of 33 USC 1317(d) and of this article. Industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(5)  Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pretreatment standards-baseline report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit to the department a report containing the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(17). Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to the director or regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40 CFR 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to resubmit this information. At least 90 days before commencement of any discharge, each new source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the department a report which contains the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(15). In such report, new sources shall include information concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the information requested in 40 CFR 403.12(b,)(4) and (5).

Sec. 102-732. - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability . This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities . 
(1)  The city engineer and/or representatives of the authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the city engineer or representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the city engineer and/or representatives of the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  The city engineer and/or representatives of the authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city engineer or authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  The city engineer has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.

(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the city engineer and/or designee and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the person operating the facility. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city engineer and/or representatives of the authorized enforcement agency access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity violated this article if the person denies the city engineer or authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article. 
(7)  If the city engineer and/or representatives of the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city engineer and/or authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 505, § 1, 4-5-2006)  
Sec. 102-733. - Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. 
The city engineer shall adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United States or State of Michigan. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 505, § 1, 4-5-2006)  
Sec. 102-734. - Watercourse protection. 
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee(s), shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. This responsibility does not apply to publicly or privately owned drains that are not owned by the property owner and are otherwise the responsibility of the drain owner. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 505, § 1, 4-5-2006)  
Sec. 102-735. - Notification of release or discharge. 
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the United States or State of Michigan said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city engineer within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence.

Sec. 106-27. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds trees growing in street or road rights-of-way, parks and other public property of the city are a vital element in the appearance, character and welfare of the city and its residents. These trees provide not only aesthetic benefits but functional ones as well by removing gaseous and particulate contamination from the air, sequestering carbon, returning oxygen to the atmosphere, reducing traffic noise, screening objectionable views, providing shade that reduces air temperatures, and reducing storm water runoff and soil erosion. 
(b)  However, despite their many qualities, trees that interfere with the use of street or road rights-of-way, parks and other public grounds of the city and dead, damaged or structurally unsound trees located on both public and private property in the city may, when they are not properly planted, maintained or removed, endanger pedestrians, motorists and adjacent residents; cause damage to streets, pathways, sidewalks, public utilities; and other property; harm other trees; and become a detriment, hazard, threat or potential liability for the city. 
(c)  Therefore, the purpose of this article is to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city and its residents by providing for the regulation of the planting, maintenance and removal of trees growing in, overhanging, encroaching into or interfering with public street and road rights-of-way, parks and other public grounds of the city and for the pruning or removal of trees located on private property in the city which threaten pedestrian or traffic safety or which may interfere with public utilities or public improvements. 
(Code 1976, § 4-14.01; Ord. No. 566, § 6, 4-2-2012)  
Sec. 106-28. - Promulgation of rules. 
The director is authorized to promulgate additional rules, regulations, and specifications consistent with this article concerning the planting, care, maintenance, removal, pruning, and protection of street trees, park trees, or trees on other public property owned or leased by the city. 
(Code 1976, § 4-14.07; Ord. No. 566, § 6, 4-2-2012)

Sec. 118-164. - Review by commission. 
(a)  Standards. In reviewing plans submitted pursuant to this division, the historic districts commission shall follow the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, as set forth in 36 CFR 67. Design review standards and guidelines that address special design characteristics of historic districts administered by the commission may be followed if they are equivalent in guidance to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines and are established or approved by the bureau of history of the department of state. The commission shall also consider all of the following: 
(1)  The historic or architectural value and significance of the resource and its relationship to the historic value of the surrounding area; 
(2)  The relationship of any architectural features of the resource to the rest of the resource and to the surrounding area; 
(3)  The general compatibility of the design, arrangement, texture, and materials proposed to be used; and 
(4)  Other factors, such as aesthetic value, that the commission deems relevant to its determination under the review standards and guidelines in this subsection. 
(b)  Basis for denial. Denial of any application shall be based only on the considerations set forth in subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  Interior arrangement review limitation. The historic districts commission shall review and act upon only exterior features of a resource and shall not review and act upon interior arrangements unless interior work will cause visible change to the exterior of the resource. 
(d)  Grounds for issuing notice to proceed. In addition to approval of an application pursuant to the standards contained in subsection (a) of this section, work within a historic district shall be permitted by the historic districts commission through the issuance of a notice to proceed if any of the following conditions prevail and if the proposed work can be demonstrated by a finding of the commission to be necessary to substantially improve or correct any of the following conditions: 
(1)  The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or to the resource's occupants; 
(2)  The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of substantial benefit to the community, and the applicant proposing the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning approvals, financing, and environmental clearances; 
(3)  Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the owner when a governmental action, an act of God, or other event beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within the historic district, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner; or 
(4)  Retaining of the resource is not in the interest of the majority of the community. 
(Code 1976, § 4-06.07.04)  
Sec. 118-165. - Filing of application decision document. 
(a)  Generally. After due consideration pursuant to this division, the historic districts commission shall notify the applicant of its decision and shall file with the city building department its certificate of appropriateness, notice to proceed, or denial of the application submitted to it for review, which shall be signed by the chairperson or secretary of the commission. The commission shall state the reasons and grounds for its action in writing and in its minutes. 
(b)  Certificate of appropriateness. After a certificate of appropriateness or notice to proceed has been issued and the building or demolition permit is granted to the applicant, the building department shall take such action as is necessary to require compliance with the approved building plans. The plans and specifications approved by the historic districts commission are required to be on site for inspections. The certificate of appropriateness or notice to proceed shall be effective for one year unless extended by the commission. 
(c)  Denial. A denial shall be binding upon the city building department, and no permit shall be issued in such case. The denial shall be in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Written explanation of reasons. A denial shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the commission of the reasons for denial and, if appropriate, a notice that an application may be resubmitted for commission review when suggested changes have been made. The denial shall also include notification of the applicant's right of appeal to the state historic preservation review board and to the circuit court. 
(2)  Changes suggested. If denial occurs, either before or after a denial, the commission shall endeavor to work out a feasible plan for preservation with the applicant and may give suggestions regarding changes in the application it deems desirable to the applicant. A written notice of changes required shall be provided to the applicant. 
(3)  Right of resubmission. The applicant may make modifications to the plans and shall have the right to resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
(Code 1976, § 4-06.07.05)  
Sec. 118-166. - Failure to act. 
The failure of the historic districts commission to render a decision within 60 calendar days after the date a complete application is filed with the commission pursuant to this division, unless an extension is agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the commission, shall be deemed to constitute approval. 
(Code 1976, § 4-06.07.06)  
Sec. 118-167. - Plans for preserving valuable structures. 
If an application for work is submitted under this division that will adversely affect the exterior appearance of a resource or for moving or demolition of a resource which the historic districts commission considers valuable to the city, state or nation and the commission determines that the alteration or loss of that resource will adversely affect the public purpose of the city, state or nation, the commission shall endeavor to establish with the owner of the resource an economically feasible plan for preservation of the resource. 
(Code 1976, § 4-06.07.07)  
Sec. 118-168. - Demolition or moving of resources. 
It shall be the public policy of the historic districts commission and the city to discourage the demolition, demolition by neglect, or moving of historic resources within a historic district.

(a)  Commencement. If any structure within a historic district has deteriorated to the extent the building department believes the structure should be demolished, repaired, or secured under article V of chapter 18 pertaining to dangerous buildings, proceedings under such article may be commenced. 
(b)  Petition for permission. After a hearing and determination by the hearing officer that the structure should be demolished, but before ordering it demolished, the building department shall petition the historic districts commission for permission to demolish the structure.

Sec. 122-28. - Division or partitioning of land. 
(a)  Pursuant to land division act. It shall be unlawful for any person to divide or partition any lot, outlot, or other parcel of land in a recorded plat or to divide or partition any unplatted parcel or tract of land, except in accordance with this article, unless the division or partition is approved and a part of a recorded plat pursuant to the land division act, Public Act No. 288 of 1967 (MCL 560.101 et seq., MSA 26.430(101) et seq.). 
(b)  Authorized. A lot, outlot, or other parcel of land in a recorded plat may be divided or partitioned into not more than four parts, and an unplatted parcel or tract of land may be partitioned or divided, if it is not in violation of the land division act, Public Act No. 288 of 1967 (MCL 560.101 et seq., MSA 26.430(101) et seq.), if there is compliance with the following:

Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2.  
Sec. 126-262. - Findings. 
Rapid growth, the spread of development, and increasing demands upon natural resources have the effect of encroaching upon, despoiling, or eliminating many of the trees and other forms of vegetation and natural resources and processes associated therewith, which, if preserved and maintained in an undisturbed and natural condition, constitute important physical, aesthetic, recreation and economic assets to current and future residents of the city. Specifically, the city council finds that: 
(1)  Public health protected. Tree and woodland growth protects public health through the absorption of air pollutants and contamination, through the reduction of excessive noise and mental and physical damage related to noise pollution, and through its cooling effect in the summer months; 
(2)  Public safety enhanced. Trees and woodlands enhance public safety through the prevention of erosion, siltation, and flooding; and 
(3)  Essential component of general welfare. Trees and woodland areas are an essential component of the general welfare of the city, providing play and recreational areas, natural beauty, and an irreplaceable heritage for current and future city residents. 
(Code 1976, § 4-12.01)  
Sec. 126-263. - Purpose. 
The purposes of this article are to: 
(1)  Provide for the protection, preservation, proper maintenance and use of trees and woodlands located in this city in order to minimize disturbance to them and to prevent damage from erosion and siltation, a loss of wildlife and vegetation, and/or from the destruction of the natural habitat. 
(2)  Protect the woodlands, including trees and other forms of vegetation, of this city for their economic support of local property values when allowed to remain uncleared and/or unharvested and for their natural beauty, wilderness character, and their geological, ecological, or historical significance. 
(3)  Provide for the paramount public concern for these natural resources in the interest of health, safety and general welfare of the residents of this city. 
(Code 1976, § 4-12.02)  
Sec. 126-264. - Applicability of article. 
(a)  Undeveloped land. This article shall apply to all land in the city which was undeveloped on August 3, 1988. 
(b)  Approved site plans and plats. This article shall apply to all land included within a site plan, preliminary subdivision plat, or condominium plan submitted to the city for approval, except this article shall not apply to land included within a site plan which received final approval or a preliminary subdivision plat which received tentative approval prior to August 3, 1988, provided the site plan or plat approval remains in effect and in good standing under article III of chapter 122 or under chapter 138 of this Code.

Sec. 126-266. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Municipal civil infraction. Any person who violates any section of this article shall be responsible for a municipal civil infraction, subject to a fine as provided in section 66-37, plus costs and other sanctions for each infraction. 
(b)  Injunctive relief. Any activity conducted in violation of this article is declared to be a nuisance per se, and the city may commence a civil suit in any court of competent jurisdiction for an order abating or enjoining the violation. 
(c)  Fee for illegally removed trees. In addition to any civil fine or sanction provided for a determination of responsibility for violation of this article, and notwithstanding whether or not the city has commenced a civil suit for injunctive relief: 
(1)  Payment to city tree fund. Any person who removes or causes any tree to be removed except in accordance with this article shall forfeit and pay to the city a civil fee equal to the total value of trees illegally removed or damaged, as computed from the International Society of Arboriculture Shade Tree Evaluation Guide or The Michigan Shade Tree Evaluation Guide. The fee shall accrue to the city, and, if necessary, the city may file a civil action to recover the fee. The city shall place any sum collected in the city tree fund. 
(2)  Tree replacement. Alternatively the city may require replacement of illegally removed or damaged trees as restitution in lieu of the fee. Replacement will be on an inch-for-inch basis computed by adding the total diameter measured at the diameter at breast height in inches of the illegally removed or damaged trees, unless an alternative basis of replacement or restitution is approved by the city. The city may use other reasonable means to estimate the tree loss if destruction of the illegally removed or damaged trees prevents exact measurement. 
(3)  Fee payment and tree replacement. The city may also require a combination of fee payment and tree replacement. 
(d)  Stop work order. The city may also issue a stop work order or withhold issuance of a certificate of occupancy, permits or inspections until the sections of this article, including any conditions attached to a tree removal permit, have been fully met.

e.  Erosion control; 
f.  Open space; 
g.  Outdoor recreation areas; and 
h.  Aesthetics. 
(2)  Increasing demands. The city council also finds increasing demands placed upon natural resources have: 
a.  Increased the potential for the loss of wetlands in the city; 
b.  The effect of encroaching upon, despoiling, polluting, jeopardizing or eliminating watercourses and wetlands within the city; and 
c.  Otherwise adversely affected desirable natural resources and processes. 
(b)  Purpose. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide for: 
(1)  Protection, preservation, proper maintenance, and use of watercourses and wetlands in the city in order to minimize disturbance to them and prevent damage from erosion, turbidity, or siltation and to prevent the loss of fish or other beneficial aquatic organisms, loss of wildlife and vegetation, or destruction of the natural habitat thereof; 
(2)  Protection of the city's potable fresh water supplies from drought, overdraft, pollution, or mismanagement;

(2)  Action of sign board of appeals. 
a.  Power. The sign board of appeals shall have the power to modify or reverse, wholly or partly, the notice or order given under this chapter, grant variances and grant extensions of time for the performance of any act required of not more than three additional months where the sign board of appeals finds such extension is in harmony with the general purpose with this chapter to secure the public health, safety and welfare. 
b.  Necessary vote. The concurring vote of four members of the sign board of appeals shall be necessary to reverse, wholly or partly, or modify any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the building official or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is required to pass or to effect any variation in this chapter. 
c.  Period of validity. No order or variance of the sign board permitting the erection or alteration of a sign, except for an interpretation made by the sign board, shall be valid for a period longer than six months from the date of approval, unless a permit for such erection or alteration is obtained within such period and such erection and alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit. 
d.  Site plan; transferability. A variance granted shall be valid only under a site plan or layout of the property which was considered by the sign board. A variance granted shall run with the land and shall transfer to a new owner. 
e.  Reconsideration. After a variance has been denied in whole or in part by the sign board, such application may not be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the last denial. However, a denied variance may be reconsidered by the sign board when, in the opinion of the building official or the sign board, newly discovered evidence or changed conditions warrant such reconsideration. 
f.  Conditions of approval. In authorizing a variance or extension, the sign board may attach conditions it determines to be reasonable, necessary or appropriate to further the purposes and spirit of this chapter and to protect the public health, welfare and safety. 
(3)  Scope of hearing. At the hearing held pursuant to this chapter, the applicant shall be given an opportunity to show cause why the notice or order should be modified or withdrawn or why the period of time permitted for compliance should be extended.

An appeal made under this chapter shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the building official certifies to the sign board of appeals, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that because of facts stated in the certificate an emergency exists, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed, except by a restraining order or by the circuit court, following timely notice of application therefor, to the building official. 
(5)  Variances. 
a.  Findings of fact. A variance to this chapter may be authorized by the sign board of appeals only in cases when competent, material and substantial evidence in the official record of the appeal supports all the following affirmative findings: 
1.  Special conditions. That special conditions or circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district. 
2.  Deprivation of rights. That literal interpretation or application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of property rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this chapter. 
3.  Substantial justice. Allowing the variance will result in substantial justice being done, considering the public benefits intended to be secured by this chapter, the individual difficulties that will be suffered by a failure of the sign board to grant a variance, and the rights of others whose property would be affected by the allowance of the variance, and will not be contrary to the public purpose and general intent and purpose of this chapter. 
b.  Support of findings. The findings of fact in subsection (5)a. of this section shall be made by the sign board of appeals, which is not empowered to grant a variance without an affirmative finding of fact in each of the categories listed in subsection (5)a. of this section. Every finding of fact shall be supported by the record of the proceedings of the sign board.

B.  Conditions. If the City Council determines that the proposed use is compatible with permitted and existing uses in the district, the Council shall then decide whether the proposed use shall be permitted by right, by special approval, or as a permitted accessory use.

The following shall apply in the issuance of any permit under this ordinance.

The terms "altered" and "repaired" shall include any changes in structural parts; stairways; type of construction; type, class or kind of occupancy; light or ventilation; means of egress and ingress; or other changes affecting or regulated by the City building code, the housing law of the state, or this ordinance, except for minor repairs or changes not involving any of such features. 
C.  Temporary permits. The building department may issue a temporary permit for a temporary building or use allowed in the zoning district for up to one year. The temporary permit may be renewed once by the Zoning Board of Appeals for a second one year period if the issuance of the permit would avoid an unreasonable hardship and not cause any undue or unreasonable disturbances to surrounding properties or in the general area.  
SECTION 138-1.303 - Certificate of Occupancy 
A.  Generally. A certificate of occupancy is required before any person may occupy or allow occupancy of any land, building or part thereof whenever: 
1.  A building permit is required. 
2.  Site plan approval is required. 
3.  Additional parking in connection with the use is required. 
4.  A nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use. 
If a certificate of occupancy is not required by this section, a change of occupancy or use of any land, building or part thereof may be made without obtaining a certificate of occupancy. 
B.  Certificates including zoning. A certificate of occupancy required for the erection or enlargement of buildings or structures; extension or alteration in whole or in part; or a change of use, occupancy, or a combination thereof shall also constitute a certificate of zoning as required by this ordinance. No such certificate shall be issued until there is compliance with all sections of this ordinance. 
C.  Certificate for existing buildings and uses. 
1.  Change of use or occupancy. A certificate of occupancy may be issued for a change of use or occupancy of existing buildings, structures, or parts thereof, if, after inspection, it is found that such buildings, structures or parts thereof, or such use of land, are in conformity with this ordinance. 
A certificate of occupancy shall be obtained before there is any new use or modification of an existing use of a building or land or part thereof, or if any additional parking is required by Article 11 for the new or modified use. If additional parking is required by Article 11, the additional parking shall be provided and there shall be compliance with all of the requirements of this ordinance that are reasonably related to providing the additional parking. Paving of the entire parking area, as otherwise provided by this ordinance, shall not be required if the existing parking area is not paved and the number of the additional required parking spaces does not exceed the number of parking spaces existing on the property by more than 25 percent. 
The Planning and Development Director and the directors of the building and public services departments may require a site plan in such detail as may be required to show compliance with this ordinance, and shall have discretion to determine what requirements of this ordinance shall apply. 
2.  Upgrading an existing building or improved land. Whenever an existing building or improved land is upgraded or otherwise improved, where a building permit or site plan is required, there shall be compliance with the provisions of this ordinance that are reasonably related to the improvement or changes being made. 
a.  Determination of which provisions of this ordinance shall apply shall be made by the Planning Commission if a site plan is required to be approved by the Planning Commission. 
b.  When a building permit is required but site plan approval is not required, the determination of which provisions of this ordinance shall apply shall be made jointly by the planning and zoning director and the directors of the building and public services departments. 
c.  Any such determination shall be documented with a written statement of findings stating the reasons for the determination. 
d.  A property owner may appeal an adverse determination by City Staff to the Planning Commission, and an adverse determination by the Planning Commission may be appealed to the City Council. 
D.  Temporary certificates of occupancy. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued if the property owner is entitled to a temporary certificate of occupancy under the building code, provided there is compliance with the additional requirements of this section. Any temporary certificate of occupancy issued shall specify a reasonable time for site improvements. Failure to comply with the time limit set forth shall be considered a violation of the time limit placed on the temporary certificate of occupancy for purposes of enforcing this ordinance and requiring completion of site improvements. 
1.  Duration of temporary certificate of occupancy. A temporary certificate of occupancy shall not be effective for more than six months. Thereafter, occupancy may only be authorized under a final certificate of occupancy. 
2.  Unfinished site improvements. All unfinished site improvements which are included on an approved site plan or which are otherwise required by this ordinance shall be constructed, installed or placed on the property and shall be approved by the City building or public services department within six months of obtaining a temporary certificate of occupancy. Failure to finish and obtain approval of such improvements shall constitute a violation of this ordinance giving rise to the penalties provided for in this ordinance and shall constitute a basis for relief in circuit court. 
3.  Cash, letters of credit and bonds. Whenever an applicant seeks occupancy of premises prior to the completion of all improvements and construction in accordance with an approved site plan and the requirements of the City's ordinances, or when the applicant occupies the premises at the time of application for a building permit and continued occupancy is contemplated during the time of construction, the applicant shall deposit cash, a certified check, an irrevocable bank letter of credit or a corporate surety bond forfeitable to the City in an amount equal to the estimated cost of the remaining improvements pursuant to such site plan and the requirements of this ordinance and the City ordinances and requirements. 
The estimate of such cost shall be solely in the discretion of the building and public services departments. As used in this subsection, the term "improvements" means those features and actions associated with a project which are considered necessary by the body or official granting zoning approval to protect natural resources or the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City and future users or inhabitants of the proposed project or project area, including roadways, lighting, utilities, sidewalks, screening, and drainage. The term "improvements" does not include the entire project which is the subject of zoning approval. 
This subsection shall not be applicable to improvements for which a cash deposit, certified check, irrevocable bank letter of credit, or surety bond has been deposited pursuant to the land division act, PA 288 of 1967 (as amended) or the City drainage ordinance contained in Article II of ordinance 114 of the City Code of Ordinances. 
4.  Administration of Sureties. Such cash deposit, certified check, irrevocable bank letter of credit or bond shall run to the City and shall be forfeitable by its terms and conditions, automatically, 15 days after notice to the applicant that the requirements of the site plan or this ordinance have not been met according to the terms of the temporary certificate or a time specified in the building permit in the case of occupancy at the time of applying for the building permit. 
Such cash deposit, certified check, irrevocable bank letter of credit, or bond shall be considered posted with the condition that, upon passage of such 15 days after such notice in writing by first class mail at the last known address of the applicant, such amount shall automatically be transferred to the City fund, or otherwise enforceable by the City by any means available. Thereafter the City shall be authorized to go onto the property and complete the construction in accordance with the site plan requirements with the funds available.

CHAPTER 2. - SITE PLAN REVIEW 
 
SECTION 138-2.200 - Site Plan Review 
A.  Purpose. The site plan review procedures, standards, and required information in this Section are intended to provide a consistent and uniform method of review of proposed development plans, to ensure full compliance with the regulations and standards contained in this ordinance and other applicable ordinances and laws, to achieve efficient use of the land, to protect natural resources, and to prevent adverse impact on adjoining or nearby properties. It is the intent of these provisions to encourage cooperation and consultation between the City and applicant so as to facilitate development in accordance with the City's land use objectives. 
B.  Type of Review Required. Four levels of site plan review are required by this ordinance: site plan review not required; administrative review; sketch plan review; and site plan review. 
1.  Site Plan Review Not Required. Site plan review is not required for the construction of single-family dwellings and small accessory structures. 
2.  Administrative Review is required for certain small scale projects that do not impact neighboring properties. The Planning and Development Director shall have the authority to approve, approve subject to conditions, or deny any plan requiring administrative review. The Planning and Development Director or the applicant shall have the option to request Planning Commission consideration of plans eligible for administrative review. All appeals of administrative site plan decisions made by the Planning and Development Director shall be made to the Planning Commission. In such cases, the Planning Commission shall review the plan in accordance with the site plan review procedures set forth in Section 138-2.202. 
3.  Sketch Plan Review is required for smaller scale projects and expansions or changes in use for existing sites. Less detailed information is required for sketch plan review compared to site plan review, and the level of information required is intended to be only that necessary to verify compliance with applicable ordinance standards. 
The application requirements and review procedures for sketch plan review are the same as those established for site plan review in Section 138-2.202. 
4.  Site Plan Review is required for larger and more intense projects, including most new developments, major expansions, and redevelopment. Site plan review procedures and requirements are listed in Section 138-2.202.

CHAPTER 3. - CONDITIONAL USE APPROVAL 
 
SECTION 138-2.300 - Intent 
Conditional uses are uses that serve an area, interest or purpose that extends beyond the borders of the City, create particular problems of control in relation to adjoining uses or districts, may have detrimental effects upon public health, safety or welfare, or possess other unique characteristics that prevent such uses from being classified as principal permitted uses in a particular zoning district. 
This Chapter is intended to provide a consistent and uniform method for review of conditional use applications, ensure full compliance with the standards contained in this ordinance and other applicable local ordinances, and state and federal laws, achieve efficient use of the land, minimize or prevent adverse impacts on neighboring properties and districts, protect natural resources and facilitate development in accordance with the land use objectives of the Master Plan and any sub-area or corridor plans.  
SECTION 138-2.301 - Procedures and Requirements 
A.  Planning Commission Recommendation. Prior to the City Council making a discretionary decision on a conditional use, the Planning Commission, or the Zoning Board of Appeals if specifically indicated, shall hold a public hearing, make a record of the public comment, make a recommendation and forward such record and recommendation to the City Council before the decision is made. 
B.  Public Hearing Notice. The public hearing provided for in this subsection shall be held to comply with the requirements of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, PA 110 of 2006 (as amended), as set forth in Section 138-1.203. The notice of the public hearing provided for in this section shall state a public hearing before the City Council may be requested by those persons indicated in the preceding sentence. 
C.  City Council Decision. The City Council may deny, approve or approve with conditions a conditional use application. The decision on a conditional use shall be incorporated in a statement containing the conclusions relative to the conditional use specifying the basis for the decision, and any conditions of approval imposed on the application. 
1.  Approval. Upon determination that a conditional use proposal is in compliance with the standards and requirements of this ordinance and other applicable ordinances and laws, approval shall be granted. 
2.  Approval with Conditions. The City Council may impose reasonable conditions with the approval of a conditional use. The conditions may include provisions necessary to insure that public services and facilities affected by a proposed conditional use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads generated by the new development, to protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to insure compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner. Conditions imposed shall meet all of the following requirements: 
a.  Conditions shall be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety, welfare, and social and economic well being of those who will use the land use or activity under consideration, residents and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the community as a whole. 
b.  Conditions shall be related to the valid exercise of the police power, and purposes which are affected by the proposed use or activity. 
c.  Conditions shall be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance, related to the standards established in the Ordinance for the land use or activity under consideration, and necessary to insure compliance with those standards. 
3.  Denial. A conditional use application shall be denied upon determination by the City Council that a conditional use proposal does not comply with the standards and regulations set forth in this ordinance, or otherwise will be injurious to the public health, safety, welfare, or orderly development of the City. 
The City Council decision on a conditional use shall be incorporated in a written statement of findings relative to the conditional use under consideration. Said findings shall specify the reasons for the decision and any conditions imposed. 
D.  Coordination with Site Plan Review. 
1.  When a two-step site plan review process is used, the Planning Commission shall consider the preliminary site plan and conditional use simultaneously, and shall act upon the preliminary site plan prior to making a conditional use recommendation to the City Council. A final site plan associated with a conditional use may not be approved until the conditional use has first been approved by the City Council. 
2.  If the applicant chooses a one-step site plan approval process, the Planning Commission shall act upon the final site plan prior to making a conditional use recommendation to the City Council, and any action to grant final site plan approval shall be conditioned upon the City Council granting conditional use approval. 
E.  Resubmission. A conditional use application that has been denied shall not be resubmitted for a period of 365 days from the date of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of changed conditions found by the Planning Commission to be valid. 
F.  Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not have the authority to consider appeals of conditional use determinations by the City Council. 
G.  Expiration of Conditional Use Approval. Conditional use approval shall expire 365 days after the date of approval, unless the use has been established on the site, or the final site plan associated with the conditional use has been submitted to the Planning Department for review. Conditional use approval shall also expire upon expiration of the approved final site plan associated with a conditional use. Upon written request received by the City prior to the expiration date, the Planning Commission may grant one extension of up to 180 days, provided that the approved conditional use conforms to current Zoning Ordinance standards. 
H.  Rescinding Approval of Conditional Uses. Approval of a conditional use may be rescinded by the City Council upon determination that the use has not been improved, constructed or maintained in compliance with this ordinance, approved permits, site plans, or conditions of site plan or conditional use approval. Such action shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Public hearing. Such action may be taken only after a public hearing has been held by the City Council in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, PA 110 of 2006 (as amended) as summarized in Section 138-1.203, at which time the owner of an interest in land for which conditional use approval was sought, or the owner's designated agent, shall be given an opportunity to present evidence in opposition to rescission. 
2.  Determination. Subsequent to the hearing, the Council's decision regarding to the rescission shall be made and written notification shall be provided to the property owner or the owner's designated agent.  
SECTION 138-2.302 - Standards for Conditional Use Approval and Other Discretionary Decisions 
For decisions on conditional uses referred to in subsection (a) of this section and in all other instances in this ordinance where discretionary decisions must be made by a board, commission or official, including decisions on site plans, the requirements and standards as particularly set forth in this ordinance concerning the matter for decision shall be followed, and such discretionary decision shall also be based upon the findings that the conditional use will:

It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property and the operator of the use for which conditional use approval has been granted to develop, improve, operate and maintain the use, including the site, buildings and all site elements, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance and all conditions of conditional use approval until the use is discontinued. Failure to comply with the provisions of this Section shall be a violation of the use provisions of this ordinance and shall be subject to the same penalties appropriate for a use violation. 
The Mayor or his or her designee may make periodic investigations of developments for which a conditional use has been approved. Noncompliance with Ordinance requirements or conditions of approval shall constitute grounds for the City Council to rescind conditional use approval.  
CHAPTER 4. - VARIANCES AND APPEALS 
 
SECTION 138-2.400 - Jurisdiction, Powers and Duties

3.  Interpret the text and map and all matters relating thereto whenever a question arises in the administration of this ordinance as to the meaning and intent of any provision or part of this ordinance. Any interpretations shall be in a manner as to carry out the intent and purpose of this ordinance and zoning map, and commonly accepted rules of construction for ordinances and laws in general. See Section 138-2.405 and Section 138-2.406 for additional considerations. 
4.  Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, within the meaning of state law and this ordinance, in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this ordinance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power upon appeal in specific cases to authorize such variation or modification of the provisions of this ordinance so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. See Section 138-2.407 and Section 138-2.408 for additional considerations. 
B.  Review Considerations. In consideration of all appeals and all proposed variances to this ordinance the Zoning Board of Appeals shall, before granting any variance to this ordinance in a specific case, first determine that the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals, or welfare of the inhabitants of the City. 
C.  Majority Vote Required. Except for use variances, the concurring vote of a majority of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the building department, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is authorized by this ordinance to render a decision. 
D.  Limitations of Authority. 
1.  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to give or grant to the Zoning Board of Appeals the power or authority to alter or change this ordinance or the zoning map or to rezone, such power and authority being reserved to the City Council.

E.  Conditions. In authorizing a variance or taking any other action within its jurisdiction, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions as may be deemed necessary in the furtherance of the purposes of this ordinance, provided any conditions are in compliance with the standards for imposing conditions as contained in the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, PA 110 of 2006 (as amended).  
SECTION 138-2.401 - Exercising Powers 
In exercising the powers described in Section 138-2.400, the Zoning Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may take such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the building department from whom the appeal is taken.  
SECTION 138-2.402 - Notice 
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall make no recommendation except in a specific case and after a hearing conducted by such board. Notice of such hearing shall be provided in the manner established in the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, PA 110 of 2006 (as amended).  
SECTION 138-2.403 - Effect of Actions 
A.  Expiration of Approval. 
1.  No order of the Zoning Board of Appeals permitting the erection or alteration of a building, except in the case of an interpretation made by the Zoning Board of Appeals, shall be valid for a period longer than one year from the date of approval unless a building permit or site plan approval for such erection or alteration is obtained within such period and such erection and alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit or approved site plan. 
2.  No order of the Zoning Board of Appeals permitting a use of a building or premises, except in the case of an interpretation made by the Zoning Board of Appeals, shall be valid for a period longer than one year from the date of approval, unless such use is established within such period; provided, however, that where such use permitted is dependent upon the erection or alteration of a building, such order shall continue in force and effect if a building permit or site plan approval for such erection or alteration is obtained within such period and such erection or alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit or approved site plan. 
B.  Resubmittal. No request or appeal which the Zoning Board of Appeals has denied wholly or in part may be resubmitted to or reheard by the Zoning Board of Appeals for a period of one year following the effective date of the decision by the Zoning Board of Appeals, except where the Zoning Board of Appeals determines there is valid new evidence that was unavailable to the applicant at the time of the prior hearing or a substantial change in circumstances. Applications for a rehearing shall be in writing and shall be subject to the same rules and requirements as an original request.  
SECTION 138-2.404 - Appeals of Administrative Decisions 
A.  Authority. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error of law in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the person or body charged with administration or enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance. Such appeals may be taken to the Board by the person, firm or corporation aggrieved, or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected by the order, requirement, decision or determination, provided that a notice of appeal application is filed with Planning and Development Department within 21 days of such action. 
B.  Stay of Proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building or public services department certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals after the notice of appeal has been filed that by reason of facts stated in a certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed, otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice to the building or public services department and on due cause shown. 
C.  Public Hearing. The board shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal and shall give due notice in accordance with the public hearing requirements of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, PA 110 of 2006 (as amended) as summarized in Section 138-1.203 and shall render a decision on the appeal without unreasonable delay. Any person may appear and testify at the hearing, either in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. 
D.  Fee. A fee shall be paid at the time the notice of appeal is filed to the City treasurer to the credit of the general revenue fund of the City. The fees to be charged for appeals shall be set by resolution of the City Council. The fee for appeals shall be as provided in Section 110-437 for variance, interpretation or appeal of decision requests regarding alterations, modifications, additions or accessory buildings for existing single-family residences, and a fee as provided in Section 110-437 for all other variance, interpretation, appeal of decision or approval requests. 
E.  Required Findings. The Zoning Board of Appeals may reverse an administrative action only if it finds that the order, requirement, decision or determination was arbitrary or capricious, based upon an erroneous finding of a material fact, constituted an abuse of discretion, or based upon an erroneous interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance.  
SECTION 138-2.405 - Interpretation of Zoning District Boundaries 
Where the actual lines of streets, alleys, or property boundaries vary from the portions indicated on the Zoning Map, or some ambiguity exists as to zoning district boundaries, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to interpret the Zoning Map in such a way as to carry out the intents and purposes of Zoning Ordinance and Master Plan.  
SECTION 138-2.406 - Interpretation of Zoning Ordinance Provisions 
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to hear and decide requests for interpretations of Zoning Ordinance provisions in such a way as to preserve and promote the character of the zoning district in question, and carry out the intents and purposes of the Zoning Ordinance and Master Plan.  
SECTION 138-2.407 - Dimensional Variance 
A.  Authority. The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a dimensional (nonuse) variance to provide relief from a specific standard in this ordinance relating to an area, a dimension or a construction requirement or limitation, upon the concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Zoning Board of Appeals. 
B.  Practical Difficulty. A nonuse variance shall not be granted unless the Zoning Board of Appeals finds that there is a practical difficulty in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this ordinance. In determining whether a practical difficulty exists, the Zoning Board of Appeals must find that: 
1.  Compliance with the strict letter of the restrictions governing area, setback, frontage, height, bulk, lot coverage, density or other dimensional or construction standards will unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or will render conformity with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. 
2.  A grant of the variance will do substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the district, and a lesser variance will not give substantial relief to the applicant as well as be more consistent with justice to other property owners in the zoning district. 
3.  The plight of the applicant is due to the unique circumstances of the property. 
4.  The problem is not self-created. 
5.  The spirit of this ordinance will be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. 
6.  There is compliance with the standards set forth in Section 138-2.400B. 
7.  There is compliance with the standards for discretionary decisions as contained in Section 138-2.302 of this ordinance.  
SECTION 138-2.408 - Use Variance 
A.  Authority. The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a use variance to authorize a land use which is not otherwise permitted by this ordinance in the district where the property is located, upon the concurring vote of two-thirds of the members of the Zoning Board of Appeals. 
B.  Remedies Exhausted. An application for a use variance shall not be submitted or considered unless the applicant has first received a written determination from the building department that the proposed land use is not permitted under this ordinance in the district where the property is located, and, second has received a final decision from the City Council denying a rezoning of the property to a zoning district where the proposed land use would be permitted under this ordinance. 
C.  Unnecessary Hardship. A use variance shall not be granted unless the Zoning Board of Appeals finds, on the basis of substantial evidence presented by the applicant, that there is an unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this ordinance. In determining that an unnecessary hardship exists, the Zoning Board of Appeals must find that: 
1.  The property in question cannot be reasonably used or cannot yield a reasonable return on a prudent investment if the property would be used only for a purpose allowed in the zoning district. 
2.  The plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not to general neighborhood conditions. 
3.  The use to be authorized by the variance will not alter the essential character of the area and locality. 
4.  The problem is not self-created. 
5.  The spirit of this ordinance will be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. 
6.  There is compliance with the standards set forth in Section 138-2.400B. 
7.  There is compliance with the standards for discretionary decisions as contained in Section 138-2.302 of this ordinance.  
ARTICLE 3 - NONCONFORMITIES 
 
SECTION 138-3.100 - Intent 
Nonconformities are uses, structures, buildings, or lots which do not conform to one or more provisions or requirements of this ordinance or a subsequent amendment, but which were lawfully established prior to the time of adoption of this ordinance or amendment. Such nonconformities are not compatible with the current or intended use of land in the district in which they are located. Therefore, it is the intent of this ordinance to permit such nonconformities to continue under certain conditions, but to foster the elimination of nonconformities by discouraging their expansion, enlargement, or extension. Accordingly, the purpose of this section is to establish regulations that govern the completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and/or substitution of nonconformities, and to specify the circumstances and conditions under which nonconformities shall be permitted to continue.  
SECTION 138-3.101 - General Requirements 
A.  Repairs and maintenance. On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding the state equalized value of the property, provided that the floor area of the building as it existed on the effective date of this ordinance or amendment thereto shall not be increased. 
B.  Change of tenancy or ownership. There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of any existing nonconforming uses of land, structures and premises, provided there is no change or a lessening in the nature or character of such nonconforming uses except in conformity with this ordinance.  
SECTION 138-3.102 - Nonconforming Lots 
The following requirements shall apply to any legally created lot of record that does not comply with one or more of the dimensional requirements of this ordinance and that existed prior to the effective date of this ordinance or amendment thereto. 
A.  Construction permitted. Notwithstanding limitations imposed by other sections of this ordinance, a permitted use may be erected on any single lawfully created lot of record in existence at the effective date of this ordinance or amendment thereto. This section shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width or both that are generally applicable in the district, provided that the lot can be developed in compliance with other dimensional requirements (such as setback requirements) without any adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health, safety, and welfare. 
B.  Contiguous lots under common ownership. If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage and single ownership are of record on the effective date of this ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this ordinance, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this ordinance and no portion of such parcel shall be used or occupied which does not meet lot width and area requirements established by this ordinance, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this ordinance.  
SECTION 138-3.103 - Nonconforming Uses of Land 
Where, on the effective date of the ordinance amendment thereto, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following: 
A.  Expansion prohibited. No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of this ordinance or any amendment thereto. 
B.  Relocation prohibited. No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use on the effective date of this ordinance or amendment thereto. 
C.  Period of nonuse before nonconformity shall cease. If a nonconforming use of land ceases operation with the intent of abandonment for a period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located. 
D.  Establishment of a conforming use. In the event that a nonconforming use is superseded or replaced by a conforming principal use, the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.  
SECTION 138-3.104 - Nonconforming Structures 
Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of this ordinance or amendment thereto that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following: 
A.  Increase in nonconformity prohibited. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. For example, an existing residence on a lot of a width less than required in this ordinance may add a rear porch, provided that other requirements relative to yard space and land coverage are met. 
B.  Expansion of one-family dwellings. With respect to any structure which is considered nonconforming due to its noncompliance with a required side or rear yard setback, and notwithstanding subsection A. of this section, any enlargement or alteration of the structure which involves the extension of the existing side or rear building line shall be permitted without need for a setback variance or variance to this section, provided that the enlargement or alteration: 
1.  Is not located closer to the side or rear property line than the structure's existing nonconforming side or rear yard setback; 
2.  Is attached to a one-family dwelling located within an R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, or RE zoning district and is designed for use as enclosed or screened living space; 
3.  Is not taller than 16 feet or one story in height; and 
4.  Complies with all other requirements of this ordinance and does not necessitate any other variances. 
C.  Reconstruction. Nonconforming structures that are declared to be physically unsafe by the building official or otherwise damaged or destroyed by any means to an extent that the repair cost is greater than the assessed value of the structure shall not be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in complete compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. Buildings or structures that are listed on a local, state, or national register of historic buildings or places may be reconstructed provided that the nonconformity that existed prior to destruction is not increased. 
D.  Relocation. If such structure is moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(Ord. No. 165, § 9, 3-19-2012)  
SECTION 138-3.105 - Nonconforming Uses of Structures and Land 
If a lawful use of a structure or of structure and land in combination exists on the effective date of this ordinance or amendment thereto that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following: 
A.  Alteration prohibited. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
B.  Expansion within existing building permitted. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which existed on the effective date of the ordinance from which this ordinance derives or at the time of amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
C.  Nonconforming use superseded by conforming use. Any structure or structure and land in combination in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations pertaining to the uses permitted in the district in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. Section 138-3.104 shall apply to any nonconformity relating to the structure. 
D.  Period of nonuse before nonconformity shall cease. If such nonconforming use of land and structures ceases operation with the intent of abandonment for a period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance pertaining to the uses permitted in the district in which such land is located. Structures occupied by seasonal uses shall be excepted from this subsection only so long as seasonal uses shall continue. 
E.  Removal or destruction of structure. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.

(Ord. No. 170 , § 3, 6-16-2014; Ord. No. 179 , § 1, 8-8-2016)  
SECTION 138-4.101 - Zoning Map and District Boundaries 
The boundaries of the zoning districts are established as shown on the zoning map. The map, all notations, references, and other information shown thereon is as much a part of this ordinance as if fully described in this Article 4, provided: 
A.  Unless clearly shown otherwise on the Map, the boundaries of the districts are: 
1.  Lot lines; 
2.  The centerlines of streets, alleys, roads, watercourses, or such lines extended; and 
3.  The corporate limits of the City. 
B.  Where, due to the scale, lack of detail, or illegibility of the zoning map accompanying this ordinance there is any uncertainty, contradiction, or conflict as to the location of any district boundaries shown thereon, an interpretation concerning the exact location of district boundary lines shall be determined by the Building Official, upon written application or upon its own motion. Any decision of the Building Official in these matters may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals as set forth in Section 138-2.405.  
SECTION 138-4.102 - Zoning of Rights-of-Way 
All streets, alleys and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting upon such streets, alleys or railroad rights-of-way. Where the centerline of a street or alley serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such street or alley, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such centerline.  
SECTION 138-4.103 - Zoning of Vacated Areas 
Whenever any street, alley or other public way within the City is vacated by official governmental action and when the lands previously within the boundaries of the public way attach to and become a part of the land adjoining such street, alley or other public way, such lands shall automatically, and without further governmental action be subject to the same zoning regulations as are applicable to the land to which it attaches.  
SECTION 138-4.104 - Principal Uses and Conditional Uses 
In all districts, no structure or land shall be used or occupied, except in conformance with Section 138-4.300 (Table of Permitted Land Uses by District), and as otherwise provided for in this ordinance. Conditional uses may be permitted in accordance with Section 138-4.300 (Table of Permitted Land Uses by District), subject to a public hearing and approval by the Planning Commission in accordance with the procedures and conditions defined in Article 2, Chapter 3 (Conditional Uses).  
SECTION 138-4.105 - Prohibited Uses 
Uses that are not specifically listed as a principal use or conditional use permitted by this ordinance in a zoning district, or otherwise determined to be similar to a listed and permitted use, shall be prohibited in the district.  
SECTION 138-4.106 - Design and Development Requirements 
All principal permitted uses and conditional uses shall comply with any applicable requirements of this ordinance and other City Codes and Ordinances. No structure shall be erected, reconstructed, altered or enlarged, nor shall permits or certificates of occupancy be issued, except in conformance with this ordinance and other City Codes and Ordinances.  
CHAPTER 2. - PURPOSE OF DISTRICTS 
 
SECTION 138-4.200 - RE, R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 One-Family Residential Districts 
The RE, R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 one-family residential districts are designed to provide for one-family, low density dwelling sites and residentially related uses in keeping with the master plan of residential development in the City. The uses permitted by right and on special condition as conditional uses are intended to promote a compatible arrangement of land uses for homes, with the intent to keep neighborhoods relatively quiet and free of unrelated traffic noises.  
SECTION 138-4.201 - RCD One-Family Residential Cluster District 
The intent of the RCD one-family residential cluster district is to permit the development of one-family residential patterns which, through design innovation, will introduce flexibility so as to provide for the sound physical handling of site plans in situations where the normal subdivision approach would otherwise be unnecessarily restrictive. 
RCD one-family residential cluster districts are intended for those areas having at least one of the following characteristics: 
A.  An area generally parallel to, and generally not to exceed, 360 feet in depth on those unsubdivided parcels of land abutting a major thoroughfare or freeway of at least 120 feet of right-of-way width as indicated on the current City Master Thoroughfare Plan, so as to provide transition between such major thoroughfare and adjacent one-family detached housing on platted lots. The density in the cluster area shall not exceed 3.9 dwelling units per acre, including all residential roads, except as provided in Section 138-6.206 pertaining to floodplains, subaqueous areas, or wetlands. 
B.  An area generally parallel to, and generally not to exceed, 360 feet in depth on those unsubdivided parcels of land being so located as to provide transition between nonresidential or multiple-family districts and one-family development. The density in the cluster area shall not exceed 3.0 dwelling units per acre, including all residential roads, except as provided in Section 138-6.206 pertaining to floodplains, subaqueous areas, or wetlands. 
C.  An unsubdivided area which is found to be of such an unusual shape or which is found to contain unstable or generally unbuildable soil conditions or which is characterized by some other unusual physical or development factor which would make sound physical development under the normal residential subdivision approach, including lot size variation and subdivision open space plan, impractical. The following conditions shall exist: 
1.  The natural land forms are so arranged that the change of elevation within the site includes slopes in excess of 15 percent between these elevations. These elevation changes and slopes shall appear on at least 35 percent of the site rather than as exceptional or infrequent features of the site. 
2.  The achieving of road grades of less than six percent is impossible unless the site were mass graded. The providing of one-family clusters will allow a greater preservation of the natural setting. 
3.  The area in open space, including recreation areas and water, accomplished through the use of one-family clusters shall represent at least 25 percent of the horizontal development area of a one-family cluster development. This entire area may be used in computing density when preserved as open space. 
4.  The overall permitted density within an unsubdivided parcel not located in relation to a major thoroughfare, as described in subsections 1. and 2. of this section shall not exceed 3.0 dwelling units per acre, averaged over the entire area included within the general development plan, except as defined in Section 138-6.206 pertaining to floodplains, subaqueous areas, or wetlands.  
SECTION 138-4.202 - RM-1 Multiple-Family Residential District 
The RM-1 multiple-family residential district is designed to provide sites for multiple dwelling structures with height restrictions compatible with single-family residential districts, to serve the limited needs for the apartment type of unit in an otherwise single-family residential community, and to provide zones of transition. The RM-1 district is intended generally for the development of a planned complex of buildings on acreage parcels.  
SECTION 138-4.203 - RMH Manufactured Housing Park District 
The RMH manufactured housing park district is established to allow the development of state-licensed manufactured housing communities that comply with the requirements of this ordinance, applicable Manufactured Housing Commission rules, and PA 96 of 1987.  
SECTION 138-4.204 - MR Mixed Residential (Overlay) District 
The mixed residential (overlay) district is designed to permit the construction of varied residential development types on parcels greater than ten acres. The mixed residential (overlay) district is intended to result in higher quality development by providing design flexibility in lot size, lot configuration, and building type within densities allowed by the Master Land Use Plan and existing zoning; to result in better buffers from major thoroughfares for residential development; the protection of natural features, and the creation of site amenities such as open space or parks.  
SECTION 138-4.205 - B-1 Local Business District 
The B-1 local business districts are designed for the convenience shopping of persons residing in adjacent residential areas to permit only such uses as are necessary to satisfy those limited basic shopping and/or service needs which, by their very nature and size, are not related to the shopping pattern of the Citywide or regional shopping centers.  
SECTION 138-4.206 - B-2 General Business District 
The B-2 general business districts are designed to cater to the needs of the larger consumer population than serviced by the B-1 local business district.  
SECTION 138-4.207 - B-3 Shopping Center Business District 
The B-3 shopping center business districts are designed to cater to the needs of the larger consumer population than served by the B-1 local business district and the B-2 general business district and so are mapped typically in shopping center locations characterized by establishments so grouped as to generate larger volumes of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.  
SECTION 138-4.208 - B-5 Automotive Service Business District 
The B-5 automotive service business districts are established to accommodate those uses which attract and generate a high volume of moving or standing vehicular traffic. These districts are designed to be located on major thoroughfares in the City, other than freeways, and are generally incompatible with residential vehicular traffic from secondary thoroughfares (86-foot right-of-way) and local thoroughfares (60-foot right-of-way). 
(Ord. No. 179 , § 1, 8-8-2016) 
Editor's note Ord. No. 179 , § 1, adopted Aug. 8, 2016, deleted former § 138-4.208, which was entitled "B-4 Freeway Service Business District." Said ordinance further amended ch. 138 by renumbering §§ 138-4.209138-4.219 as §§ 138-4.208138-4.218 as herein set out.  
SECTION 138-4.209 - CI, Commercial Improvement District 
The CI commercial improvement district is intended to apply to certain business properties in the City which require relaxation of site improvement requirements in order to allow and encourage the upgrading and improvement of those properties. The irregularities of the parcels, the closeness of existing buildings to the roadway and adjacent buildings, and the lack of space for on-site parking hamper investment in the properties. Improvement and growth of such areas is determined to be of importance to the City and the general welfare of the area. 
(Ord. No. 179 , § 1, 8-8-2016)  
SECTION 138-4.210 - O-1 Office Business District 
The O-1 office business districts are designed to accommodate office uses, office sales uses and basic personal services, particularly larger planned office complexes and office centers. 
(Ord. No. 179 , § 1, 8-8-2016)  
SECTION 138-4.211 - ORT Office, Research and Technology District 
The ORT district is established to: 
A.  Permit the combination of certain uses that are complementary to one another within the same structure or within the same zone. 
B.  Provide for orderly and integrated planning, so as to avoid fragmentary, short-term, or speculative investments and to avoid delay in achieving the highest and best use of the area. 
C.  Optimize the City's tax base and encourage economic development. 
D.  Provide a tool for redeveloping and revitalizing areas where existing buildings and infrastructure are located. 
E.  Provide for satisfactory transitions to surrounding land use areas. 
(Ord. No. 179 , § 1, 8-8-2016)  
SECTION 138-4.212 - I Industrial District 
The I industrial districts are designed to primarily accommodate wholesale activities, warehouses, and industrial operations whose external, physical effects are restricted to the area of the district and in no manner affect in a detrimental way any of the surrounding districts. The I district is so structured as to permit, along with any specified uses, the manufacturing, compounding, processing, packaging, assembly, and/or treatment of finished or semifinished products from previously prepared material, it being the intent of the district that the processing of raw material for shipment in bulk form, to be used in an industrial operation at another location not be permitted. 
The general goals of this use district include, among others, the specific purpose to: 
A.  Provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations, to meet the needs of the City's expected future economy for selected types of manufacturing and related uses. 
B.  Protect abutting residential districts from the negative impacts of industrial land uses by separating them from manufacturing activities, and by prohibiting the use of such industrial areas for new residential development. 
C.  Promote manufacturing development which is free from danger of fire, explosions, toxic and noxious matter, radiation, and other hazards and from offensive noise, vibration, smoke, odor and other objectionable influences. 
D.  Promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with a well-considered plan. 
E.  Protect the character and established pattern of adjacent development, and in each area conserve the value of land and buildings and other structures and protect the City's economic tax base. 
(Ord. No. 179 , § 1, 8-8-2016)  
SECTION 138-4.213 - SP Special Purpose Districts 
The SP special purpose district is established to provide for uses which cater to the general public and require substantially larger sites. These uses do not fit readily into other districts and must be given special consideration. 
(Ord. No. 179 , § 1, 8-8-2016)  
SECTION 138-4.214 - FB-1, FB-2, and FB-3 Flex Business (Overlay) Districts 
The FB districts are designed to permit a wider range of uses in areas already used for commercial purposes. The FB districts are an optional method of development that permits a mixture of uses that may include residential, public, institutional, office, business, and retail commercial uses, depending upon the FB district. The FB overlay districts establish specific and detailed design standards for the physical development of the districts, while permitting the wider range of uses. 
(Ord. No. 179 , § 1, 8-8-2016)  
SECTION 138-4.215 - REC-W Regional Employment Center Workplace District 
The REC-W district is located along the perimeter of the overall REC area, and consists primarily of the City's existing industrial and technology parks developed in the 1980s and 1990s. It is the intent of the REC-W district to allow for their continued evolution while maintaining compatibility with residential land uses abutting the perimeter of the REC area. The REC-W district corresponds with the "Workplace" category as described in the M-59 Corridor Plan and as shown on the development plan therein. 
(Ord. No. 170 , § 4, 6-16-2014; Ord. No. 179 , § 1, 8-8-2016)  
SECTION 138-4.216 - REC-C Regional Employment Center M-59 Corridor District 
The REC-C district is located adjacent to M-59, forming a corridor along the freeway. Sites in the REC-C district are visible from M-59 and are a potential location for a range of industrial and office land uses that benefit from visibility from a major regional highway. Lands in the REC-C district primarily consist of existing industrial and technology parks developed in the 1980s and 1990s. It is the intent of the REC-C district to allow for their continued evolution and intensification. Lands in the REC-C district are not adjacent to residential land uses, reducing the potential for land use conflicts and supporting higher maximum height limits in the REC-C district. The REC-C district corresponds with the "Technology and Office Image Corridor" category as described in the M-59 Corridor Plan and as shown on the development plan therein. 
(Ord. No. 170 , § 5, 6-16-2014; Ord. No. 179 , § 1, 8-8-2016)  
SECTION 138-4.217 - REC-I Regional Employment Center Interchange District 
The REC-I district is intended to create a gateway into the REC district and the City at the Crooks and M-59 interchange. This area is not adjacent to existing residential development and has direct access to the regional road system, making it an appropriate location for higher intensity development, potentially with mixed land uses. The REC-I district corresponds with the "Interchange" category as described in the M-59 Corridor Plan and as shown on the development plan therein. 
(Ord. No. 170 , § 6, 6-16-2014; Ord. No. 179 , § 1, 8-8-2016)  
SECTION 138-4.218 - REC-M Regional Employment Center Mixed Use District 
REC-M districts are located along major roads at the perimeter of the REC area. The REC-M district is intended to allow for the development and redevelopment of property with mixed land uses that upgrade the image of the area and that provide services and living accommodations to support the businesses within the REC district and in adjacent areas. The REC-M district corresponds with the "Corridor Mixed Use" category as described in the M-59 Corridor Plan and as shown on the development plan therein.

CHAPTER 4. - DESIGN STANDARDS FOR SPECIFIC USES 
 
SECTION 138-4.400 - Adult Regulated Businesses 
A.  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
1.  Adult bookstore or video store means an establishment having a substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade in video cassettes, discs or films or media recorded, pressed, engraved or prepared for playback and books, magazines, and other periodicals which are distinguished or characterized by their emphasis on matter depicting, describing or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas, or an establishment with a segment or section devoted to the sale, rental and/or display of such material. 
2.  Adult cabaret means an establishment which features one or more dancers, strippers, male or female impersonators or similar entertainers, performers, wait staff or other persons who reveal or show specified anatomical areas of their bodies or who engage in, perform or simulate specified sexual activities. 
3.  Adult motion picture theater means an enclosed building used for presenting motion picture films, videocassettes, cable television or any other such visual media, distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matter depicting, describing, or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas for observation by patrons therein. 
4.  Specified anatomical areas means: 
a.  Less than completely and opaquely covered human genitals, pubic region, buttock and female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola; and 
b.  Human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, even if completely and opaquely covered. 
5.  Specified sexual activities means: 
a.  Human genitals in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal. 
b.  Acts of human masturbation, sexual intercourse or sodomy. 
c.  Fondling or other erotic touching of human genitals, pubic region, buttock or female breast. 
6.  Used, in the definition of the term "adult motion picture theater" in this subsection, describes a continuing course of conduct of exhibiting specified sexual activities and specified anatomical areas in a manner which appeals to a prurient interest. 
B.  It is determined necessary for the health, safety and welfare of the City to adopt this section pertaining to and regulating adult businesses for the following reasons: 
1.  Many parents are concerned about the influence of pornographic entertainment outlets and businesses and have chosen the City to raise their families because of the absence of such adult businesses. 
2.  Location of and easy availability of adult businesses in close proximity to homes, apartments, schools, churches and public parks give an impression of legitimacy to such uses and have adverse effects upon children, established family relations, respect for marital relationships and the concept of nonaggressive consensual sexual relations. 
3.  Location of adult businesses in close proximity to houses, apartments, schools, churches and public parks will draw persons who are not known in the community and will create police and safety problems in areas of the City which should be free of such problems. 
4.  Property values in areas adjacent to adult businesses will decline, thus causing a blight upon both commercial and residential areas of the City. 
5.  Location of adult businesses near or within residential neighborhoods and commercial areas of the City would be disruptive to youth programs such as Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls and church youth groups. 
6.  Location of adult businesses in close proximity to residential uses, schools, churches, parks and other public facilities will cause a degradation of the community standard of morality. Pornographic material has a degrading effect upon the relationship between spouses. 
C.  An adult motion picture theater, adult bookstore or video store or adult cabaret shall not be located: 
1.  Within 1,000 feet of any residential zoning district (R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, RE, RCD, RM-1 or RMH) or the property line of any single-family, two-family or multiple-family residential use. For purposes of this section, the term "multiple-family residential use" shall specifically include, but not by way of limitation, any retirement, convalescent or nursing home or facility or other housing for the elderly. 
2.  Within 1,000 feet of the property line of any public or private school, college or university, or of any nursery school, day nursery or child care center. 
3.  Within 1,000 feet of the property line of any church or other religious facility or institution. 
4.  Within 1,000 feet of any public park. 
5.  Within 1,000 feet of any other adult motion picture theater, adult bookstore or video store, or adult cabaret. 
The distances provided for in this subsection shall be measured by projecting a straight line, without regard for intervening buildings or structures, from the nearest point of the building, structure or tenant space within which the proposed use is to be located to the nearest point of the property line, specified use or zoning district boundary from which the proposed use is to be separated. 
D.  An adult motion picture theater, adult bookstore or video store, or adult cabaret shall be located only within a B-3 shopping center business district. 
E.  An adult motion picture theater, adult bookstore or video store, or adult cabaret shall be permitted only by special land use approval granted by the City Council after review and recommendation of the Planning Commission, and after public hearing pursuant to the discretionary decisions in Section 138-2.302 pertaining to special and conditional uses. The special land use shall be approved only if the following criteria are satisfied: 
1.  There has been compliance with all provisions of this section and all other sections of this ordinance and the City Code of Ordinances. 
2.  The establishment of an adult motion picture theater, adult bookstore or video store, or adult cabaret will not have a deleterious effect on the surrounding area or the City in general. 
3.  There is compliance with the standards included in Section 138-2.302.

Wireless telecommunication facilities shall conform and be subject to the following: 
A.  Wireless Telecommunicaiton Facility Support Structures. 
1.  Limitation on new support structures. It is the City's policy to minimize the proliferation of new wireless telecommunication facility support structures in favor of collocation of such facilities on existing structures. No new wireless telecommunication facility support structures shall be constructed unless the applicant for the new structure demonstrates, and the Planning Commission finds, that collocation on an existing structure is not adequate or is not reasonably feasible. 
2.  Monopole design required. All wireless telecommunication facility support structures, unless otherwise provided, shall have a monopole, unipole or similar non-lattice, single vertical structure design and shall be further designed to accommodate at least four wireless telecommunication arrays of antennas or panels. The applicant shall submit an affidavit by a design engineer registered in the state attesting that the support structure can support at least four wireless telecommunication arrays of antennas or panels. The site plan for any new support structure shall expressly state that the support structure shall be erected and available for collocation, and shall also show the proposed location of the applicant's and collocators' equipment shelters and related facilities. 
3.  Maximum height. Wireless telecommunication facilities shall not exceed 185 feet in height, as measured from the average grade at the base of the support structure to the top of the antenna or panel. In no case shall the height exceed any applicable height limitation established by county, state or federal regulations. 
4.  One support structure per lot. Except in the I zoning district, not more than one wireless telecommunication support structure may be located on a single lot. 
5.  Location on lot. If located on the same lot as another permitted use, a wireless telecommunication facility shall not be located in a front yard or side yard abutting a street, except that the Planning Commission may approve a support structure utilizing camouflage or stealth design for location in a front or side yard abutting a street if the Planning Commission determines that location will better facilitate a satisfactory and harmonious relationship with existing and prospective development of contiguous land and adjacent neighborhood. 
6.  Setbacks. Wireless telecommunication facilities shall be set back from the lot line a distance not less than one-half of its height or 65 feet, whichever is greater. However, when wireless telecommunication facilities are located on premises which abut a lot that is residentially zoned, the minimum setback from the lot line abutting the residentially zoned lot shall be equal to the height of the facility. All setbacks shall be measured from the edge of the facility. 
7.  Maintenance and removal. Wireless telecommunication facilities shall be installed and maintained in accordance with manufacturers' specifications and the building code. Upon discontinuance or cessation of use, the facility shall be removed by the owner thereof. 
8.  Signs. No sign shall be attached to or displayed on a wireless telecommunication facility. No signals or lights or other means of illumination shall be permitted on a facility unless required by state or federal law or regulation. The facility shall have a neutral color intended to blend with the surroundings. 
9.  Equipment shelters. If the wireless telecommunication facility is located on a site which is already improved with another building or structure, and an equipment shelter is proposed, the equipment shelter shall be constructed with exterior facade materials similar to the principal building or structure on the site. 
B.  Collocation. 
1.  Existing structures. Wireless telecommunication antennas or panels may be installed on existing buildings or structures provided such antennas or panels, and their supporting structure, do not exceed the height limitation set forth in subsection A.3. of this section. 
2.  Exemption from setbacks. Any wireless telecommunication antenna or panel mounted on an existing building or structure which does not increase the height of the building or structure shall be exempt from the setback requirements of subsection A.6. of this section. 
C.  Wireless telecommunication facilities located in one-family residential zones shall meet one of the following requirements: 
1.  Existing nonresidential building. The wireless telecommunication facility shall be mounted directly onto an existing, nonresidential building in a manner that does not increase the height of the building. The facility shall consist of material or color which is compatible with the exterior treatment of the building; 
2.  Existing nonresidential structure. The wireless telecommunication facility shall be located on an existing, nonresidential support structure, pole or tower such as a public or private utility tower, pole or structure, but not on a building. Such facility shall consist of a material or color which is compatible with the tower, pole or structure. Antennas or panels may extend above the top of the tower, pole or structure not more than 30 feet; however, the height to the top of the antenna or panel may not exceed 165 feet; or 
3.  New support structure on public property. The wireless telecommunication facility shall be located on a new support structure situated on public property. Any facility located on public property which is used for passive recreation shall be designed to minimize the conspicuousness of the facility (e.g., utilizing camouflaged or stealth designed poles or existing environmental features as screening). All such facilities located on public property shall meet the setback requirements of subsections A.6. and B.2. of this section.

SECTION 138-5.101 - Footnotes to the Schedule of Regulations 
A.  Building Height Measurement. In the R-1 through R-4 and RE districts, building height shall be measured from the average grade on the front façade of the building. 
B.  Average Front Setback. If there are existing homes within 200 feet of a subject lot, on the same side of the street, that have an average setback that differs from the front setback as required within this ordinance by more than ten feet, then the average front setback shall be used as the required front setback, provided, however, that in no instance shall a front yard setback be reduced to less than 20 feet. 
C.  Corner Lots. For corner lots, the side street yard shall not be less than 15 feet in the R-3 and R-4 district and 25 feet in the R-1, R-2, and RE districts. 
D.  Reduced Side Yard on Narrow Lots. If the lots or parcel is less than 60 feet in width, one side yard may be reduced to five feet providing the total of the two side yards shall be a minimum of 15 feet, except as denoted in Section 138-5.101.C above. 
E.  Nonresidential Lot Requirements. The minimum lot area and minimum lot width shall be determined by the use meeting all minimum yard requirements and all other requirements of this ordinance. In B-3 districts, parcels with less area or width than the minimum requirement may be permitted provided all of the following exist: 
1.  The parcel is part of a larger cohesive development. 
2.  The parcel is accessed through existing access points. Additional access points may only be constructed upon approval by the Planning Commission. 
3.  A covenant restriction prohibiting additional ingress/egress drives from abutting public thoroughfares without Planning Commission approval, shall be recorded at Oakland County.

4.  Where an O-1 district abuts an R, RCD, RM-1 or MH district, the minimum side yard requirement shall be 30 feet. 
5.  In B-1, B-2 and O-1 districts, a 25-foot setback is required for a side street yard on a corner lot and for the exterior side of parcel or lot on the exterior of the district. 
6.  In the B-3 district a front yard setback shall be required on any street frontage and from any adjacent parcel not zoned B-3. 
G.  Side Yard Setbacks Adjacent to a Residential District. Where a B-5 district abuts R, RCD, RM-1 or MH districts, the minimum side yard requirement shall be 50 feet. 
H.  Rear Yard Setback Adjacent to a Residential District. Where a B-3 district abuts an R, RCD, RM-1 or MH district, the minimum rear yard shall be 100 feet. The rear yard may be reduced to 50 feet with the approval of the Planning Commission after a public hearing in accordance with Section 138-1.203 and submittal of a plan which ensures there will be no significant negative impacts on the adjacent property as a result of the rear yard reduction. 
I.  Rear Yard Setback Adjacent to a Nonresidential District. Where a B district abuts a B, O-1, I (industrial) SP or CI districts, the rear yard may be reduced to ten feet with the approval of the Planning Commission, upon its determination that the requested reduction will allow for better development and will be compatible with adjoining properties. 
J.  Front Building Gas Stations are permitted, and shall comply with the design requirements of Section 138-4.404.B. The design standards and dimensional requirements of Section 138-4.404.B shall take precedence over the standard setback requirements for the B-5 district contained in Table 6. 
K.  Front Yard Parking Prohibited. Parking is prohibited in the required front yard setback area in the ORT zoning district. 
L.  Reduced Front Yard Setback. The required front yard setback may be reduced to 30 feet on internal streets in industrial subdivisions, provided there is no front yard parking. The front yard, except for areas approved for parking as provided for in this ordinance, shall be landscaped or planted in lawn, and the entire front yard shall be kept in a neat condition. 
M.  Reduced Side Yard Setback. The side yard in the interior of an industrial district may be reduced to 15 feet where there are no openings or windows, except for means of egress required by the building code, in the wall paralleling the side lot line, but where there are other openings or windows, the side yard shall not be reduced to less than 25 feet. 
N.  Building Spacing. When there is more than one principal commercial or industrial building on a lot or parcel, or a combination of parcels included in a unified development, the minimum spacing between buildings shall be 25 feet unless otherwise provided for in this ordinance.

On corner lots in the B-5 district, the setback from the right-of-way line shall be 25 feet, with both frontages to be considered as the front yard setback. 
O.  Large Buildings. In industrial districts, buildings in excess of 300 feet in length along any one side shall receive the approval of the Planning Commission, which approval shall be based upon compatibility with surrounding properties and buildings in reasonable attendance. 
P.  Parking in Required Side and Rear Yards. Parking and loading spaces may be located in required side and rear yards in the I (industrial) and ORT districts subject to Planning Commission approval. The Planning Commission shall approve such parking or loading only if sufficient access is provided to the building and that the location of the parking or loading spaces will not imperil the health, safety or welfare of employees in the building. Loading spaces that are thusly located and will be visible from a public thoroughfare or any adjacent property not zoned I or ORT shall be screened. Such screening shall be opaque to a minimum height of six feet. 
Q.  Outdoor Use Areas in the I (Industrial) District. Required side yards may be used for loading, unloading, and storage provided that in such instances the Planning Commission shall review the plans for such area to ensure sufficient access to the building or any storage or related areas to provide for the health, safety and general welfare of employees in the building. Dumpster and trash areas are subject to the requirements of Section 138-10.311. Storage areas are subject to the requirements of Section 138-4.430. 
R.  Yard Requirements when Adjacent to Residential Zoning Districts. Any yard abutting an R, RCD, RM-1, or RMH zoning district shall be as established by the Planning Commission, depending on the similarity of the proposed use to uses permitted on the O-1 and I (industrial) zoning districts. In addition, a Type D landscaping buffer yard shall be provided in such yards in accordance with the requirements of Section 138-12.300. 
S.  Freestanding Canopies. In the B-5 district, freestanding canopies may be permitted within the required front yard and/or within the required side yard adjacent to a public right-of-way subject to the following conditions: 
1.  Canopies shall be located not less than ten feet from a right-of-way or side lot line, and not less than 20 feet from a rear lot line. The amount of lot area covered by canopies shall not exceed 40 percent. 
2.  Canopies shall not exceed 17-1/2 feet in height, and a minimum clearance of 14 feet from grade shall be maintained. 
3.  Canopies shall not be attached to any other building or structure. 
4.  Canopies shall be of a type readily demountable not requiring unusual demolition procedure. 
5.  Canopies shall be supported by columns and shall not be supported or enclosed by walls. Canopy columns shall be faced in decorative materials such as brick. 
T.  Rear Yards Adjacent to Parks or Open Space. The minimum rear yard setback requirement may be reduced to 30 feet on lots that border on land permanently dedicated for park, recreation, and/or open space purposes, provided that the dimension of the park, recreation, and/or open space land shall not be less than 100 feet measured in a straight line not more than 20 degrees off of perpendicular to the rear lot line of such lot. 
For purposes of this footnote, permanently dedicated open space shall be determined as provided in Section 138-5.201 for open space option subdivisions. As to other residentially zoned property, dedicated open space shall be land dedicated for park, recreation and/or open space within an approved planned unit development (PUD) by way of recorded plan, easement, agreement or other satisfactory evidence, that the open space use is intended to be permanent. 
U.  Increased Building Height. In the R-3 and R-4 districts, the maximum building height may be increased up to 35 feet when all of the following conditions are met: 
1.  The building site shall contain at least 13,500 square feet of lot area. 
2.  Minimum side yard setbacks, including the total of two, shall be increased by one-half-foot for each one foot or part thereof by which the proposed building height is in excess of 30 feet. 
3.  If an increase in building height is proposed on a lot which shares a common side yard with a lot occupied by an existing dwelling, the increased height of the proposed dwelling shall not be more than 190 percent of the height of a dwelling on a lot sharing a common side yard. 
V.  Increased Building Height. The maximum height for buildings in the O-1 and ORT districts may exceed the maximum noted in Section 138-5.100 in accordance with the following requirements: 
1.  Height modifications for projects located on sites with less than five acres shall require conditional use approval in accordance with the procedures of Article 2, Chapter 3 (Conditional Use Approval).

Any structure in the O-1 or ORT district abutting land planned for one-family residential land uses on the Master Land Use Plan Future Land Use Map shall increase the required yard abutting the residential district by two feet for every foot in height above 30 feet as measured to the top of the highest beam for flat roof systems or to the mid-point of pitched roofs. 
W.  Reduced Minimum Lot Width and Area in the R-4 District. Where a proposed parcel is located within a plat where the underlying platted lots are less than the minimum lot width required in the R-4 district and where the resultant lot width would be consistent with the character of the existing one-family neighborhood the minimum lot width may be reduced to the width of the underlying platted lot or 60 feet, whichever is greater. When a reduced lot width is permitted the minimum lot area shall be 7,000 square feet. Buildings on such reduced lots shall comply with the minimum setbacks and all other requirements not involving lot width or area otherwise applicable in the R-4 district. 
(Ord. No. 165, § 7, 3-19-2012; ; Ord. No. 581, §§ 2, 5, 7, 11-11-2013 ; Ord. No. 174 , § 2, 6-1-2015; Ord. No. 179 , § 2, 8-8-2016; Ord. No. 182 , § 4, 2-5-2018)  
CHAPTER 2. - SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS AND EXCEPTIONS 
 
SECTION 138-5.200 - Lot Size Variation 
The intent of this subsection is to permit the subdivider or developer to vary lot sizes and lot widths so as to average the minimum size of lot per unit as required in Section 138-5.100 for each R-1, R-2, R-3 R-4, and RE one-family district. If this option is selected, the following conditions shall be met: 
A.  Lot Width. In meeting the average minimum lot size, the subdivision shall be so designed as not to create lots having an area or width greater than ten percent below that area or width required in the schedule of regulations and shall not create an attendant increase in the number of lots. 
B.  Density. In determining the maximum number of lots permitted, all calculations shall be predicated upon the districts having the following net densities (including roads): 
District 	Net Density
(dwelling units per acre) 
RE 	0.8 
R-1 	1.7 
R-2 	2.3 
R-3 	2.9 
R-4 	3.4 
 
C.  Phasing of Final Plat Approval Prohibited. The technique of averaging minimum lot size shall be acceptable only when the entire preliminary plat, which has received City Council approval, is carried through a final plat and is then recorded in its totality. Recording of portions of a preliminary plat shall not be acceptable under this option. 
D.  Average Lot Area Requirement. All computations showing lot area and the average resulting through this technique shall be indicated on the print of the preliminary plat. Such computations shall include the dimensions and area of each lot proposed on the preliminary plat, the total square foot lot area in all proposed lots, and the resultant average square foot area per lot. The average square foot area per lot shall not be less than the minimum lot size and area as required in this Article or elsewhere in this ordinance for the district in which the subdivision is located. 
E.  Exclusive Development Option. The modifications permitted under this subsection pertaining to average lot sizes shall not be applied in conjunction with the modifications permitted Section 138-138-5.201.  
SECTION 138-5.201 - Subdivision Open Space Plan Option 
The intent of this subsection is to permit one-family subdivisions to be planned as a comprehensive unit allowing, therefore, certain modifications to the standards as outlined in Section 138-5.100 to be made in the one-family residential districts. Development of a subdivision under these provisions shall be considered an option requiring the approval of the City Council, after recommendation of the Planning Commission, at or before tentative approval of the preliminary plat. The procedure and requirements for approval shall be as set forth in this section and as are provided for in Article III of Chapter 122 of the Code of Ordinances. The modifications to the standards may be made only when they shall comply with the following conditions: 
A.  Sanitary Sewer Required. The open space plan technique shall be permitted only when public sewers are provided for the proposed subdivision. 
B.  Lot Area Reduction. The lot area may be reduced up to 25 percent in the RE, R-1 and R-2 districts and up to 20 percent in the R-3 and R-4 districts, provided that the dwelling unit density shall be no greater than if the land area to be subdivided were developed in the minimum square foot lot areas as required for each one-family district under Section 138-138-5.100. 
C.  Maximum Density. All calculations shall be predicated upon the one-family district having the following gross densities: 
District 	Net Density (dwelling 
units per acre) 
RE 	0.8 
R-1 	1.7 
R-2 	2.3 
R-3 	2.9 
R-4 	3.4 
 
D.  Lot Width. In accomplishing the lot area reductions indicated in this subsection, lot widths shall not be less than the following: 
District 	Width 
RE 	100 feet 
R-1 	85 feet 
R-2 	80 feet 
R-3 	75 feet 
R-4 	70 feet 
 
The overall dimensions of each lot shall be sufficient to accommodate the proposed single-family dwelling unit and accessory buildings in addition to the minimum required yards as set forth in this subsection. Approval of a plat for the open space plan shall not permit a subsequent variance from the requirements of this section. 
E.  Yard Requirements. Each lot shall have at least the following minimum yards: 
Zoning District 	Front 	Sides 	Rear* 
		Least One 	Total Two 	
RE 	30 	10 	25 	35 
R-1 & R-2 	30 	10 	20 	35 
R-3 & R-4** 	25 	7 	15 	35 
R-3-OS 	25 	10 	20 	35 
R-4-OS 	25 	10 	20 	35 
 
*Rear yards may be reduced to not less than 30 feet when such lots border on land dedicated for park, recreation, and/or open space purposes as indicated in subsection G.2., of this section, provided that the width of such dedicated land shall not be less than 100 feet measured at the point at which it abuts the rear yard of such lot measured in a straight line not more than 20 degrees off of perpendicular to the rear lot line of such lot. 
**Subdivisions in the R-3 and R-4 residential zoning districts receiving tentative approval of the preliminary plat under this section after January 23, 1980 shall be developed according to the requirements of R-3-OS if zoned R-3, and R-4-OS if zoned R-4, and shall be designated on the current zoning map as R-3-OS if zoned R-3, and R-4-OS if zoned R-4. Minimum yard setbacks and maximum percentage of lot coverage by all buildings requirements as set forth in this section for R-3-OS and R-4-OS shall apply. 
F.  Lot Coverage. The maximum percentage of lot coverage by all buildings in the RE, R-1, R-2, R-3-OS and R-4-OS districts shall not exceed 25 percent. 
G.  Open Space Requirements. 
1.  Minimum Area. For each square foot of land gained under subsection B., of this section within a residential subdivision, through the reduction of the lot size below the minimum requirements as outlined in this section and Section 138-5.100, equal amounts of land shall be dedicated to the common use of the lot owners of the subdivision, and there shall be provisions ensuring adequate maintenance of areas. Dedication provisions and maintenance provisions shall be in a manner approved by the City. These dedications shall be retained as open space for park, recreation, and/or related uses. 
2.  Use of Open Space. The common area shall be dedicated only for park and/or recreation purposes. Each subdivision shall have at least one common area of at least four acres in size and shall be in a location and shape approved by the City Council in the first phase of a multiphase subdivision. When a subdivision is developed in phases, the common area required to reduce the lot sizes in any particular phase shall be in the plat to be recorded or already dedicated in an earlier phase. The four-acre requirement shall be on a one-time requirement for a phased development. Such land areas shall not include as a part of their minimum land area bodies of water, swamps, or excessive grades making the land unusable for recreation, and shall be so graded and developed as to have natural drainage. Fifty percent of the required open area may, however, be in the floodplain. A separate plan shall be submitted and approved before tentative approval of the preliminary plat for proposed open space areas depicting natural preservation areas, retention and detention areas and active recreation spaces, including what they might be used for such as playground equipment, etc. Common areas shall be generally distributed throughout the subdivision and shall be easily accessible from all parts of the subdivision. Any area to be used as common area which will be used for water retention shall be designed so that it will not be needed or used for holding water for more than a temporary basis 24 hours immediately after a rainstorm. 
3.  Open Space Layout. Where the area to be dedicated to the common use of the subdivision consists of more than one separate parcel, at least one of these separate parcels shall contain not less than four acres in area, provided that no single park area shall be less than one acre. A parcel divided by a river or stream shall be considered as one parcel. 
4.  Access to Open Space. Access shall be provided to areas dedicated for the common use of the subdivision for those lots not bordering on such dedicated areas by means of streets or pedestrian accessways of at least 20 feet in width. 
H.  Approval Criteria. In approving an open space development, the City Council shall review the application for compliance with the following goals and objectives: 
1.  Provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the natural character of open fields, stands of trees, brooks, lakes, floodplains, hills and similar natural assets. 
2.  Encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the development of residential areas. 
3.  Encourage a more efficient, aesthetic, and desirable use of open areas while recognizing a reduction in development cost, and by allowing the developer to bypass natural obstacles. 
4.  Encourage the provision of open space in all parts of the subdivision, and within reasonable distance of all lot development of the subdivision, and to further encourage the development of recreational facilities and areas. 
I.  Development Option. This plan for reduced lot sizes shall be permitted only if mutually agreeable to the City Council and the subdivider or developer. This open space technique is offered as an alternate to the requirements of minimum lot size specified in this subsection. The modifications permitted under this subsection shall not be applied in conjunction with the modifications permitted by Section 138-5.200 (average lot sizes). 
J.  Open Space Dedication Required. Under this subdivision open space plan approach, the developer or subdivider shall dedicate the total park area as set forth in this subsection at the time of filing of the final plat on all or any portion of the plat.  
SECTION 138-5.202 - Height Exceptions 
A.  Exempt Structures. The height limitations of this ordinance shall not apply to farm buildings, chimneys, church spires, flagpoles, or public monuments; provided, however, that the City Council may specify a height limit for any such structure when such structure requires authorization as a conditional use or as a use not otherwise included within a specific use district. The City Council shall only give approval if the total height is not adverse to the character of the area; detrimental to the use and/or value of the surrounding properties; and not injurious to the health, safety, and welfare of the City. In addition, any height requirement, variance, or waiver in excess of 70 feet shall require mandatory approval of the Federal Aviation Administration. 
B.  Municipal and school buildings with height greater than the maximum allowed in Section 138-5.100 (schedule of regulations) may be allowed, provided front, side and rear yards are increased above the minimum required yards by one foot for each foot of building height that exceeds the maximum height allowed. 
C.  Mechanical Equipment Rooms. With Planning Commission approval, mechanical equipment rooms such as penthouses may be permitted to exceed the height limitation by up to 12 feet. The architectural features shall be approved by the Planning Commission, which shall also determine the increase in height is not incompatible or detrimental to surrounding properties or the character of the area. 
(Ord. No. 183 , § 13, 6-18-2018)  
SECTION 138-5.203 - Permitted Encroachments 
A.  Terraces. An open, unenclosed paved terrace may project into a front yard for a distance not exceeding ten feet, but this shall not be interpreted to include or permit fixed canopies. 
B.  Projections into yards. Architectural features, not including vertical projections, may extend or project into a required side yard not more than four inches for each one foot of width of such side yard, and may extend or project into a required front yard or rear yard not more than three feet. Architectural features shall not include those details which are normally demountable from the structure such as gutters. 
C.  Overhangs. Overhangs of 24 inches or less, not including the gutter, may encroach into a required yard. When the overhang exceeds 24 inches, not including the gutter, the overhang must comply with setback requirements and setback measurements shall be taken from the edge of the overhang to the property line.  
SECTION 138-5.204 - Corner Clearance 
No fence, wall, shrubbery, sign, or other obstruction to vision above a height of 30 inches from the established street grades shall be permitted within the triangular area formed at the intersection of any street right-of-way lines at a distance along each line of 25 feet from their point of intersection, or within the triangular area formed at the intersection of any nonresidential driveway and a street right-of-way line at a distance along each line of 15 feet from the point of intersection between the driveway and the right-of-way. Canopy trees may be located in the corner clearance area provided that the first branch is a minimum of eight feet above grade level.  
SECTION 138-5.205 - Standard Methods of Measurement 
A.  Required yards. Attached accessory garages and other structures, and enclosed porches, patios, terraces and decks shall be deemed a part of such main building for the purpose of determining compliance with the yard requirements of this ordinance. 
B.  Lot coverage. Accessory garages and other structures, open and enclosed porches, patios, terraces and decks shall be deemed a part of such main building for the purpose of determining compliance with the lot coverage requirements of this ordinance. 
C.  Buildable lot area, open space and recreation area calculations. 
1.  Lakes, ponds, state or federally regulated wetlands, utility easements, public street right-of-ways and private road easements are excluded from area calculations for buildable lot area. 
2.  No area which, for the purpose of a building or dwelling group, has been counted or calculated as part of a side yard, rear yard or front yard building setback required by this ordinance may be counted or calculated to satisfy any open space or recreation area requirement of this ordinance.  
SECTION 138-5.206 - Frontage and Access Required 
No building permit shall be issued for any construction located on any lot or parcel of land in the City that does not abut an approved public or private street, or that does not meet the minimum lot width requirement along an approved public or private street. All access to public or private streets shall be hard surfaced with concrete or plant-mixed bituminous material, and shall meet the requirements of this ordinance and all other City ordinances.  
SECTION 138-5.207 - Building Grades 
A.  No person, firm or corporation shall alter an established surface drainage grade to the extent that normal surface drainage is materially obstructed. 
B.  Any building requiring yard space shall be located at such an elevation that a sloping grade shall be maintained to cause the flow of surface water to run away from the walls of the building. The balance of yard spaces shall be graded and adequate drainage provided where necessary to deflect proper drainage of surface waters from the said premises toward appropriate drainage collection systems. 
C.  When a new building is constructed on a vacant lot between two existing buildings or adjacent to an existing building, the yard around the new building shall be graded in such a manner to prevent surface water from flowing onto the adjacent properties. 
D.  Grading may be restricted by the Steep Slope regulations of this ordinance. Refer to Article 9, Chapter 2.  
SECTION 138-5.208 - Lots Adjoining Alleys 
In calculating the area of a lot that adjoins a dedicated alley or lane, for the purpose of applying lot area requirements of this ordinance, one-half the width of such alley abutting the lot shall be considered as part of such lot.  
SECTION 138-5.209 - Yards 
When yard regulations cannot reasonably be complied with, as in the case of a planned development in the multiple-family district, or where their application cannot be determined on lots existing and of record on the effective date of this ordinance, and on lots of peculiar shape, topography, or due to architectural or site arrangement, such regulations may be modified or determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals by the granting of a variance.  
ARTICLE 6 - SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRICT STANDARDS  
CHAPTER 1. - RM-1 - MULTIPLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS

ARTICLE 7 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT  
CHAPTER 1. - NEW PUD PROJECTS 
 
SECTION 138-7.101 - Purpose and Applicable Regulations 
A.  The Planned Unit Development (PUD) Option is intended to permit, with City Council approval subject to Section 138-7.106, private or public development which is substantially in accordance with the goals and objectives of the City's Master Land Use Plan. 
B.  The development permitted under this Article, planned unit development option, shall be considered an optional means of development only upon terms agreeable to the City. The provision of this option imposes no obligation on the City to encourage or foster its use. The decision whether to approve the use of this option shall be at the sole discretion of the City Council. 
C.  The PUD option permits flexibility in the regulation of land development by encouraging innovation through an overall development plan to provide variety in design layout; to achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy and the provision of public services and utilities; to encourage the creation of useful open spaces particularly suited to the needs of the parcel(s) in question; and to provide appropriate housing, employment, service and shopping opportunities. 
D.  It is further intended that the PUD option may be used to permit nonresidential uses of residentially zoned areas; to permit residential uses of nonresidential zoned areas; to permit densities or lot sizes that are different from the applicable district(s) and to permit the mixing of land uses that would otherwise not be permitted; provided that other objectives are met and the resulting development will promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
E.  It is further intended that the development will be laid out so that the various land uses and building bulk will relate to each other and to adjoining existing and planned uses in such a way that they will be compatible, with no material adverse impact of one use on another.  
SECTION 138-7.102 - Definition 
The term "planned unit development" means a specific parcel of land or several contiguous parcels of land, for which a comprehensive physical plan meeting the requirements of this Article, establishing functional use areas, density patterns, a fixed system of streets (where necessary), provisions for public utilities, drainage and other essential services and similar factors necessary or incidental to development has been approved by the City Council and which has been, is being, or will be developed in accordance with the approved final plan.  
SECTION 138-7.103 - Criteria for Qualification 
The PUD option may be used in any zoning district classification; however, in order to qualify for the PUD option, it must be demonstrated that all of the following criteria will be met: 
A.  The PUD option shall not be used for the sole purpose of avoiding applicable requirements of this ordinance. The proposed activity, building or use not normally permitted shall result in an improvement to the public health, safety and welfare in the area affected. 
B.  The PUD option shall not be utilized in situations where the same land use objectives can be accomplished by the application of conventional zoning provisions or standards. 
C.  The PUD option may be used only when the proposed land use will not materially add service and facility loads beyond those contemplated in the master land use plan. The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the added loads will be accommodated or mitigated by the applicant as part of the PUD. 
D.  The PUD shall meet as many of the following objectives as may be deemed appropriate by the City: 
1.  To preserve, dedicate or set aside open space or natural features due to their exceptional characteristics or their environmental or ecological significance in order to provide a permanent transition or buffer between land uses, or to require open space or other desirable features of a site beyond what is otherwise required in this ordinance. 
2.  To guarantee the provision of a public improvement that would not otherwise be required to further the public health, safety or welfare, protect existing uses or potential future uses in the vicinity of the proposed development from the impact of a proposed use, or alleviate an existing or potential problem relating to public facilities. 
3.  To promote the goals and objectives of the master land use plan and other applicable long range plans such as the master thoroughfare plan. 
4.  To facilitate development consistent with the Regional Employment Center goals, objectives, and design standards in the City's master land use plan. 
5.  To preserve and appropriately redevelop unique or historic sites. 
6.  To permanently establish land use patterns that are compatible with or will protect existing or planned uses. 
7.  To provide alternative uses for parcels that can provide transition or buffers to residential areas and to encourage redevelopment of sites where an orderly transition or change of use is desirable. 
8.  To enhance the aesthetic appearance of the City through quality building design and site development.  
SECTION 138-7.104 - Uses Permitted 
A.  A land use plan shall be submitted for the area within the PUD. The land use plan shall be defined by the districts of the zoning ordinance that are to apply to the components of the PUD area. 
B.  Principal uses permitted and special land uses permitted in the zoning ordinance shall be allowed within the districts identified on the PUD plan, except that City Council may prohibit some uses from districts designated on the PUD plan. The City Council may also permit uses not otherwise permitted in the district if specifically noted on the PUD plan. Conditions applicable to principal uses permitted and special land uses permitted shall be used as guidelines for design and layout. Conditions may be waived or modified by the Planning Commission provided that such waivers or modifications are indicated on the PUD plan.  
SECTION 138-7.105 - Height, Bulk, Density, and Area Standards 
The height, bulk, density and setback standards of each zoning district shall be applied to each specific district area designated on the PUD plan, except as specifically modified and noted on the PUD plan.  
SECTION 138-7.106 - Submittal, Review and Approval Process 
The submittal, review and approval process shall consist of the following two steps: 
A.  Step One: PUD option application and preliminary plan. 
1.  Authorized applicant. A person owning or controlling the land may request consideration of the PUD option. The applicant shall submit a request for a determination as to whether the parcel qualifies for the PUD option under the criteria set forth below in subsection [2.]c., Planning Commission Review. 
2.  Submittal of proposed PUD preliminary plan. Application shall be made to the Planning Department for review and recommendation by the Planning Commission. The application shall include the following:

d.  Written verification from the owner of the property that the applicant is authorized to pursue a PUD. 
3.  Planning commission review and public hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with Section 138-1.203, report its findings and make a recommendation to the City Council concerning the PUD option application and preliminary plan. The Planning Commission shall review the proposed PUD preliminary plan for compliance with the following objectives and requirements: 
a.  The proposed PUD promotes the land use goals and objectives of the City. 
b.  All applicable provisions of this Chapter shall be met. Where provisions of this Chapter conflict with any other sections of this ordinance, the provisions of this Chapter shall control and apply to the lands within a PUD area. 
c.  There is, or will be at the time of initial development, adequate means of disposing of sanitary sewage and supplying the development with water, and the road system and stormwater drainage system are adequate. 
4.  City Council review. Upon receipt of the Planning Commission recommendation, City Council shall review the PUD option application and preliminary plan and make the final determination on the applicant's fulfillment of the above-stated objectives and requirements. 
a.  Reserved. 
b.  Once an application for PUD and the preliminary plan have been approved by the City Council, no development or other use may take place on the property within the PUD except in accordance with the approved preliminary plan or in accordance with an approved amendment thereto. 
c.  No approved plan shall be terminated except with the approval of the City Council and the applicant, its successor or assign. 
B.  Step Two: Submission of final site plans and schedule for completion of the approved PUD. 
1.  If City Council approves the application, it shall require the applicant to prepare a PUD agreement, conforming to [Section 138-7.108] below, setting forth the conditions upon which the City's approval is based. After review and recommendation by the City attorney, Planning Commission and subsequent approval by the City Council, the agreement shall be executed by the City and the applicant. Approval shall be granted only if the City Council determines all provisions of this ordinance have been met and that the proposed development will not adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare. 
2.  Prior to the issuance of any permits for activity within the PUD area, final site plans and open space plans for a project area shall be submitted to the planning department for review and recommendation by the Planning Commission and final City Council approval based on the following: 
a.  Review and approval of site plans shall comply with this section except as otherwise modified in the approved PUD plan. Review and approval of plats shall comply with Act No. 288 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1967 (MCL 560.101 et seq.), as amended, and applicable ordinances of the City. 
b.  Before approving any final plan, the Planning Commission shall determine that: 
i.  All portions of the project area shown upon the approved plan for the PUD for use by the public or the residents within the PUD have been dedicated to such use in the PUD agreement; 
ii.  The final site plans are in conformance with the approved PUD agreement and PUD plan; 
iii.  In accordance with the PUD agreement, provisions have been made to guarantee open space and common area improvements shown on the final plan, and that maintenance of such improvements is assured in accordance with the PUD agreement. 
3.  Plans for tree removal permit and wetland permit review shall be submitted at the time of step two review. 
4.  Final site plans for the PUD area must be submitted and approved within two years of the execution of the PUD agreement, or such other period of time stated in the PUD agreement. If such plans have not been submitted and approved within the prescribed time, the right to develop under the approved plan may be terminated by the City. 
5.  If development of approved final site plans is not substantially completed in three years (or such other period of time stated in the PUD agreement) after approval, further final submittals under the PUD shall cease until the development of part in question is completed or cause can be shown for not completing same. An applicant may request up to two one-year extensions of PUD approval subject to City Council approval. 
(Ord. No. 183 , § 15, 6-18-2018)  
SECTION 138-7.107 - Fees 
Fees for review of PUD plans under this ordinance shall be set forth in City Code Chapter 110.  
SECTION 138-7.108 - PUD Agreement 
The PUD agreement shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: 
A.  The permitted uses of the property. 
B.  The permitted density and/or intensity of use. 
C.  Dimensional provisions, including but not limited to, building floor areas, setbacks, and building height.

The PUD agreement shall not prevent the City from applying new or amended regulations that do not conflict with the PUD agreement. 
H.  A requirement that if changes in federal or state laws or regulations enacted after the agreement has been executed operate to prevent compliance with parts of the agreement, or render compliance impractical or unreasonably difficult, the inconsistent provisions of the agreement shall be modified, deleted or suspended as necessary to conform to such changes in federal or state law. 
I.  Procedures for amending the PUD agreement. 
J.  Penalties for violating the PUD agreement or failing to complete improvements included in the PUD. 
(Ord. No. 183 , § 16, 6-18-2018)  
SECTION 138-7.109 - Amendments to PUD Plan 
Proposed amendments or changes to an approved PUD plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall determine whether the proposed modification is minor in nature and does not to violate the area and density requirements or materially affect the overall character of the PUD plan. In such case, the Planning Commission may approve or deny the proposed amendment. If the Planning Commission determines the proposed amendment is material in nature, the amendment must be reviewed by the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council in accordance with the procedures applicable to final approval of the planned unit development.  
CHAPTER 2. - EXISTING PLANNED NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS 
 
SECTION 138-7.200 - Continuation 
Only planned neighborhood development projects which were approved and not rescinded, vacated or denied, and which were actually in the process of construction under provisions of Ordinance No. 36, which ordinance was repealed on May 29, 1975, may continue to completion under the provisions of this Article.  
SECTION 138-7.201 - Procedure for Completion 
A.  Effect of preliminary approval. 
1.  No development may take place in any area approved under Ordinance No. 36, before its repeal, except in accordance with the plan approved or in accordance with a City Council approved amendment thereto. 
2.  After the preliminary approval, the development shall progress without any unreasonable delay. If, in any one-year period, there is no filing of a final plan, and there is land which has not yet received final approval, the City Council may request a conference with the developer regarding the progress of the development. If it appears, after a hearing, for which notice shall be given to the developer, there is no reasonable likelihood the project will continue, the board may terminate the approvals previously given. 
B.  Submission of final plans. Before any building permits shall be issued for buildings and structures within the area of planned neighborhood development, a final plan for any given project area of not less than 50 acres shall be submitted to the City Council for review following a recommendation by the Planning Commission. If the open space for the entire planned neighborhood development has been irrevocably committed to that purpose, a final plan need not contain an area of at least 50 acres. The City Council may consider and approve a site plan of less than 50 acres if it appears in the best interest of the development and the objectives of this ordinance and if to do otherwise would cause a hardship. A final plan shall meet the following requirements: 
1.  A detailed site plan, fully dimensioned, showing a fully scaled plan view of all buildings other than detached single-family, all public roads rights-of-way and private streets, boundaries and acreage of each zone district and the proposed ultimate density thereof, parking areas, utilities, churches, schools and areas to be set aside for the use of the public or by residents within the development (scale: 1" = 50'). 
2.  The proposed topography (contour interval of at least two feet) shall be superimposed on all site plans (scale: 1" = 50'). 
3.  Typical floor plan for all principal buildings and structures, other than single-family detached dwellings, with a schedule of building types to be included in the final plan. 
4.  Approval of each functional use area within a project area shall be based on the area meeting the standards of this ordinance as to density. To accomplish this standard, open space and/or common areas of adequate size shall be shown with each project area being presented. This total land area shall then be used to compute density. Subaqueous or submerged bottomland of lakes or streams shall be excluded in computing the area of a parcel except that where the lands abutting such lakes or streams are developed in park or open space for the use of residents of the neighborhood, the surface area of such lakes or streams may be used to compute density. 
5.  The term "open space" shall be defined as areas without buildings other than those incidental to recreational activities having a nature of a park. The term "common areas" shall be those areas designated as such which are set aside for use, in common, by the residents of the project which shall include community centers, swim clubs, etc. 
C.  Approval of final submittal by City Council. Approval of each project area shall be effective for a period of three years. If development is not completed in this period, further submittals under this planned neighborhood development approach shall cease until the project in question is completed or sufficient cause can be shown to the City Council for not completing the development. In reviewing and approving the final plans, the following conditions shall be set forth: 
1.  Approval shall be granted by the City Council only after review and recommendation by the Planning Commission. Public hearings shall not be required. 
2.  A dedication of all main collector roads shall be made so as to cause continuity of public access between the adjacent major thoroughfare and ingress and egress to all private development within the plan. 
3.  Before approving any final plan, the City Council shall determine that: 
a.  All areas shown upon the comprehensive plan for the entire planned neighborhood development area for use by the public or the residents of land within the planned neighborhood development, in common, have been irrevocably committed to such uses by dedication, restrictive covenants or in some other manner satisfactory to the City Council. 
b.  The final plan is in general conformity with the original plan previously approved. 
4.  Provisions, satisfactory to the City Council, have been made to provide for the financing of any improvements shown on the plan for open spaces and common areas which are to be provided by the applicant and that maintenance of such improvements is ensured by a means satisfactory to the City Council. 
5.  Proceeding with a planned neighborhood development should be permitted only if it is mutually agreeable to the City Council and the developer or sponsor.  
SECTION 138-7.202 - Limits on Height, Bulk, Density, and Area by Land Use 
A.  Boundary Strip. All of the standards of the schedule of regulations which were in effect at the time of the original approval of the project, for the applicable one-family district shall be applied to a strip at least 360 feet in depth around the outer boundaries of the area proposed for a planned neighborhood development where such area abuts a one-family district. Development of this strip shall be in complete conformity with the zoning requirements of the abutting one-family district and shall be developed only with one-family detached residential structures, provided that the strip may be penetrated by park, golf course, or other related open space, subject to the approval of the Planning Commission. All other uses permitted in the one-family districts shall be prohibited from this strip. The City Council may vary or eliminate this 360-foot requirement when the parcel in question cannot be practicably developed at this depth, due to topography, existing or proposed abutting development, or abutting heavily traveled major thoroughfares, existing or proposed. It may also be waived when the abutting land use does not require a buffer of single-family homes. 
B.  Density. The overall maximum permitted density within any planned neighborhood development (PND) shall not exceed the following density: 
1.  In those use districts zoned R-1-A or R-1-B one-family residential prior to approval of a plan was approved under section 1402(3) of Ordinance No. 36, the maximum density of the PND shall not exceed 3.9 dwelling units per acre, subject to subsection B.3. of this section. 
2.  In those use districts zoned R-1-C or R-1-D one-family residential prior to approval of a plan that was approved under section 1402(3) of Ordinance No. 36, the maximum density of the PND shall not exceed 5.6 dwelling units per acre, subject to subsection B.3. of this section. 
3.  The overall density of the PND shall be averaged for the entire PND area included within the proposed plan. Nonresidential use areas and subaqueous or submerged bottom land of lakes or streams, except as provided in Section 138-7.201.B.4. shall be excluded in computing the area of the parcel and, therefore, the related density. Areas where a public or semipublic use is located or placed shall be included for density computation on the basis of 67 percent of the area. A semipublic use shall be defined as a use involving a major office or headquarters of a recognized charitable organization, a YMCA, church, etc. 
C.  One-family dwellings required. Not less than 65 percent of the area planned for residential development must be devoted to single-family detached dwellings; however, the board, after the recommendation of the Planning Commission, may vary this when the parcel in question cannot practically be developed on this basis. 
D.  Common areas. On the final development plan of any one project area, the common areas and open spaces shown on the plan may be used to maintain the average density as required under subsection B. of this section. 
E.  Yard requirements. Except as set forth for the 360-foot strip around the outer boundary of the planned neighborhood development, all yards for one-family development may be reduced from the requirements of the schedule of regulations as follows subject to the review and approval of the Planning Commission: Front yards may be reduced by ten feet. At least 20 feet of combined side yards shall be provided between buildings. 
F.  Multiple family. Only areas zoned for multiple-family residential on May 29, 1975 shall be developed under the schedule of regulations in effect at the time of the original approval of the project, with the inclusion of the open space and common areas in the computations of density. Any new areas rezoned to multiple-family residential after May 29, 1975, shall be developed under the schedule of regulations in effect at the time of development. Land area once used in computing density for one project shall not again be used to compute density in another. Where one-unit and two-unit structures are proposed, there shall be compliance with the following: 
1.  A property owner desiring to develop land zoned multiple-family residential with one-family and/or two-family dwelling units, other than as a subdivision which meets the requirements of the regulations for the R-4 single-family residential district, shall first obtain the approval of the City Council, after recommendation by the Planning Commission. Approval under these provisions shall allow the property owner certain latitude for innovative designs and concepts as an alternative to the normal setback requirements, etc. Therefore, special provisions for regulation of the development are necessary in order to ensure a harmonious development and the avoidance of potential problems after the project is completed. 
2.  Before tentative approval of a preliminary plat shall be given, a site plan shall be presented and approved which meets the requirements of Article 2, Chapter 2 pertaining to site plan review. 
3.  Before approval shall be given, the property owner of the total area approved for a planned neighborhood development and the City shall agree to the number of dwelling units allowed for the total planned neighborhood development, which shall include the designation of density limitations for specific areas of the development. The property owner and the City shall agree to a specific reduction in density for an area zoned multiple-family residential which is developed under these provisions for one-family and two-family dwelling units. Once an area is so developed under these provisions, another area of the planned neighborhood development may not be increased in density to compensate for the allowable units not used in the areas developed under these provisions for one-family and/or two-family dwelling units. 
4.  No more than 5.6 dwelling units per gross acre on the average of the acres with lots located thereon may be allowed for any area designated in a site plan and developed under these specific provisions for one-family and/or two-family dwelling units. 
5.  Before approval the property owner shall provide and the City Council shall approve a written agreement which will be recorded and will be binding upon and run with the land that will provide for an association which will be continuous and have the authority to enforce deed restrictions and/or covenants, and will ensure restrictions and/or covenants containing at least the following: 
a.  Prohibition of any accessory buildings. 
b.  Prohibition of swimming pools in any area except common areas. 
c.  Prohibition of any dwelling unit, once built, from being converted to any multiple-family building without the expressed written approval of the City. 
6.  With reference to Ordinance 36, section 1401, subsection E. shall be modified to allow a reduction in the side-to-side minimum distance between buildings in accordance with the following formula but not less than "X." 
Y (LA + LB) 
T = 2 Where T equals the required minimum horizontal area between the sidewall of building A and the sidewall of building B. 
LA and LB as defined in subsection E. 
X and Y shall be defined as follows and determined from the following table: 
X = The minimum permissible distance, in any instance 
Y = The average distance 
Side-to-Side Relationship (in stories) 	X (in ft.) 	Y (in ft.) 
One to one 	6 	13 
One to more than one 	8 	14 
More than one to more than one 	10 	15 
 
Where building distance formula are not applicable, the minimum distance may be reduced to 20 feet. 
The minimum distance between windows in adjacent buildings shall be 13 feet. 
7.  The minimum floor area for a single level dwelling unit shall be 912 square feet. The minimum first floor area of multilevel, one-family and two-family dwelling units shall be 650 and 575 square feet, respectively. If a basement is not provided, an additional 100 square feet shall be added to the minimum required first floor area for utilities. 
8.  The platting of lots shall be permitted. Minimum yard setbacks, as stated in the schedule of regulations, need apply only to the peripheral bounding lot lines of the planned development, except where boundary lines are contiguous to planned open space, a 15-foot minimum setback shall be required; the intent is to allow flexibility in the placement of all lot lines within the site, provided the required minimum distances between buildings is maintained. Furthermore, the maximum percentage of lot coverage by all buildings, as stated in the schedule of regulations, shall apply to the entire planned development so platted and need not apply to individual lots. In locations where building walls are less than five feet from lot lines, wall openings shall not be permitted and an easement provided so that a minimum of five feet is available for maintenance access.  
SECTION 138-7.203 - Scheduling of Construction 
A.  Under this Article, the entire neighborhood area shall be fully developed and/or platted and recorded within a period not to exceed ten years from the date of approval of the initial project area plan with the granting of subsequent one-year extensions by the Planning Commission being permissible. 
B.  In the development of any planned neighborhood development, the percentage of platted and recorded single-family lots at any given time in relation to the number of multiple-family dwelling units approved for building permits shall be at least in proportion to the ratio between the total number of single-family units and the total number of multiple-family units planned for the entire development.  
ARTICLE 8 - FLEX BUSINESS OVERLAY DISTRICTS  
CHAPTER 1. - ADMINISTRATION 
 
SECTION 138-8.100 - Intent 
The Flex Business (FB) Overlay Districts are designed to foster vital, lively, and sustainable development that creates an imageable neighborhood identity for the various portions of the City located in one of the FB overlay zoning districts. The FB districts are adopted to implement the vision of the Master Land Use Plan. 
These form-based zoning regulations are at a basic level similar to traditional use-based zoning techniques because they regulate the same characteristics of development. Both traditional use-based zoning regulations and the form-based regulations regulate four major components of development - use, site design, building design, and management. The difference between the form-based regulations and traditional use-based regulations is the emphasis and specificity of regulation placed on each of the four elements. Where traditional use-based zoning regulations emphasize the regulation of uses and contain much less specificity about design, the form-based regulations emphasize design and permit greater flexibility in use. 
The intent of the form-based regulations is to create proper physical form through simple and clear regulations for the design of new development or redevelopment. For the purposes of this Article 8, proper physical form means development that permits a mixture of land uses in close proximity; streets that serve the need of pedestrians, bicyclists and motor vehicles equitably; provides places for informal social activity and recreation; and creates building frontages that define the public space of streets. With proper urban form, a wide range of uses within the building may be comfortably and naturally accommodated.  
SECTION 138-8.101 - Flex Business Overlay Districts Established 
The FB overlay districts are optional overlay districts. Any land that is located within the boundaries of a FB overlay district will have two zoning designations, the FB Overlay and the standard underlying zoning district as shown on the Zoning Map. 
Property in a FB overlay district may continue to be used as permitted by the standard zoning district. Any new development or major redevelopment in a FB overlay district may be accomplished following either the requirements of this Article 8 or the regulations applicable in the underlying zoning district. 
Minor redevelopment of existing buildings and uses developed in accordance with the standards of the underlying zoning district may be permitted to redevelop according to the dimensional standards of this Article 8, even if those dimensional standards may violate the dimensional standards applicable in the underlying zoning district. In the case of such minor redevelopment, the Planning Commission shall determine which regulations of this Article 8 shall apply based on the size, scale, and location of the proposed minor redevelopment.  
SECTION 138-8.102 - Instructions 
A.  Application of Requirements. The provisions of this Article 8 are activated by "shall" or "must" when required, "should" or "encouraged" when recommended, and "may" when optional. 
B.  Conflict. Wherever there appears to be a conflict between the regulations of this Article 8 and other sections of the Zoning Ordinance (as applied to a particular development), the requirements specifically set forth in this Article 8 shall prevail. For development standards not addressed in this Article 8, the other applicable sections of this Zoning Ordinance shall be used as the requirement.  
SECTION 138-8.103 - Approval Process 
Any proposed development using the FB overlay option shall require only site plan approval unless a use or design characteristic that requires conditional use approval as identified in this Article 8 is proposed as part of the development. 
A.  Site Plan Approval. Site plan approval shall be required in accordance with the requirements of Article 2, Chapter 2. The type of site plan review required shall be as identified in Section 138-2.200 and the site plan review process shall follow the procedures of Section 138-2.202. Site plans must contain all of the information required by Section 138-2.208. 
B.  Conditional Use Approval. For any proposed development or establishment of use in a form-based district that requires conditional use approval, the application shall be reviewed following the procedures and review criteria of Article 2, Chapter 3. 
C.  Site Condominium and Subdivision Development. Any proposed site condominium or subdivision in a form-based district shall be approved following the procedures contained in the City's site condominium or subdivision control ordinance with the exception that any design requirement contained in this Article 8 shall take precedence over any similar design requirement contained in the condominium or subdivision control ordinance.  
SECTION 138-8.104 - Permitted and Optional Regulations 
Wherever in this Article 8 reference is made to permitted and optional improvements, permitted improvements shall be permitted by right, while optional improvements shall require the approval of the reviewing body. An optional improvement or layout may be permitted by the reviewing body if it is consistent with the following criteria: 
A.  The requested option is consistent with the intent of the form-based district as established in Section 138-8.100. 
B.  The requested option is consistent with existing or planned development on adjacent or nearby parcels. 
C.  The requested option will not negatively impact the potential of adjacent parcels to develop in accordance with the standards of this Article 8. 
D.  The requested option will, in the opinion of the reviewing authority, result in a superior site design or layout than would a permitted improvement or layout.  
SECTION 138-8.105 - Existing Development in the Flex Business Overlay Districts 
A.  Any development activity in the FB overlay districts that requires administrative or sketch plan review, or does not require development review per Section 138-2.200 may be reviewed following the requirements of this Article 8. Site or building improvements shall be consistent with the provisions of this Article 8 to the greatest extent possible; however, complete compliance with the provisions herein is not required. 
B.  Any development activity in the Flex Business Overlay districts that requires site plan approval shall comply with all of the requirements herein, except as may be modified per Section 138-8.604.  
CHAPTER 2. - PERMITTED USES 
 
SECTION 138-8.200 - Permitted Uses 
The following Table 9 lists the uses that are permitted as principal, conditional, and accessory uses in the FB overlay districts. If a use is not listed in the following table, it is not permitted in the FB overlay districts. Refer to Section 138-8.700 for a description of the uses in Table 9.

CHAPTER 3. - STREET DESIGN STANDARDS 
This Chapter establishes the street design parameters applicable in the Flex Business Overlay Districts. 
 
SECTION 138-8.300 - Street Types 
Each street in and adjacent to a form-based zoning district shall be assigned one of the following street functions. The street function will determine what kinds of buildings and uses can be located along that street, and how buildings will look and be placed along the street. 
The following Table 10 describes the street types and their intended function. Perimeter streets are meant to carry large volumes of traffic and are primarily intended to serve the needs of vehicular traffic. Perimeter streets are major roads that already exist in the City and are defined as principal or minor arterials in the City's Master Thoroughfare Plan. Interior streets are intended to carry vehicular traffic and to promote pedestrian activity, and will be new streets that are constructed within the development or existing collector or local roads. 
For the purposes of determining building frontage and placement, along with street design standards for new streets, a development plan in a FB overlay district shall designate all streets using one of the following four categories: 
Table 10. Street Types in the FB Overlay Districts 
  	STREET TYPE 	FUNCTION 
PERIMETER 

STREETS 	FREEWAY 	Long-distance, high-capacity, high-speed roadway traversing the City. M-59 is the only Highway located in Rochester Hills. 
	ARTERIAL 	Any principal or minor arterial, as defined in the City's Master Thoroughfare Plan 
INTERIOR STREETS 	MAIN STREET 	A "main street" within a development. A main street will typically be a new street that is not an arterial as defined in the City's Master Land Use or Master Thoroughfare Plan. However, a main street may be a collector street as defined in City's Master Thoroughfare Plan. 

Main streets are intended to serve as the principal interior streets in the FB overlay districts. If a development has interior streets, it must have at least one main street. 
	MINOR STREET 	Minor streets provide access to parking and service areas. Minor streets fill out the street network and form blocks, and may be upgraded to major streets in the future. Major circulation aisles in parking lots should be designed as minor streets. 
 
(Ord. No. 170 , § 17, 6-16-2014)  
SECTION 138-8.301 - Street Network and Blocks 
Development in the FB overlay districts must provide an interconnected network of streets, drives, or other public passageways. 
A.  Blocks. The street network in a form-based zoning district need not form an orthogonal grid, however, sufficient intersections shall be provided to create walkable and pedestrian scale development. 
1.  Block Perimeter. The maximum block perimeter in a FB overlay district is 2,200 feet. 
2.  Block Length. The portion of any block between intersecting streets may not exceed 500 feet without a dedicated pedestrian pass-through providing access through the block to another street. 
3.  Pedestrian Pass-Throughs. Pedestrian pass-throughs shall have a minimum width of eight feet, shall be designed so they cannot be enclosed or locked, and shall be designed to be safe and interesting for pedestrians. Security lighting sufficient to maintain a minimum light level of one footcandle measured one foot above grade level shall be provided in pedestrian pass-throughs. 
4.  Interior Streets. Interior streets are not required to intersect at ninety degree angles, and may be bent or curved, but must connect to other streets. Jogs or centerline offsets shall be at least 100 feet for interior streets. 
B.  Stub Streets and Culs-de-Sac. 
1.  Stub Streets may be provided to facilitate continuation of the street network on adjacent developed or undeveloped parcels. A stub street intended to connect to future development shall not be considered a cul-de-sac if it is less than 200 feet in length. 
2.  Culs-de-sac are not permitted in a form based zoning district except as an optional improvement where physical or natural boundaries such as freeways or protected natural areas create no practical expectation that the street network will be continued in the future. 
C.  Perimeter Street Intersections. Intersections of interior streets with an arterial street shall be separated by at least 330 feet along the perimeter street. 
D.  General Requirements. 
1.  Street Connectivity. Street connections for the continuation of the street network onto adjacent properties shall be provided when the potential exists for the continuation of those streets on adjacent parcels. A minimum of one future street connection shall be provided for each 600 feet or fraction thereof of common property line between two parcels. 
2.  Public and Private Streets. Internal streets in the form-based districts should be dedicated to the public to ensure connectivity between adjacent parcels. Accordingly, public streets are permitted while private streets are an optional improvement. See Section 138-8.104 for approval procedures for optional improvements. 
3.  Cross-Access. If private streets are proposed, blanket cross-access easements shall be provided for all private streets in a development to ensure that the internal street system may connect to the internal street system on adjacent parcels. The blanket cross-access agreement shall provide for reciprocal cross-access for connection to streets on adjacent parcels without limitation. 
4.  Public Transit Nodes. Area shall be set aside to accommodate a public transit node every 1,500 feet along a perimeter street to accommodate future transit service. 
5.  Pedestrian Circulation Network. Development in the form-based districts shall incorporate a pedestrian circulation network that connects all portions of the site with the regional pathway network via dedicated sidewalks or pedestrian pathways.  
SECTION 138-8.302 - Street Design 
A.  General Standards Applicable to All Internal Streets. 
1.  Design Speed. Internal streets in the form-based districts shall be designed with a maximum design speed of 25 miles per hour. In cases where an internal street is intended to serve as a collector street, has a length exceeding 2,640 feet and provides access to more than one perimeter street the design speed may be raised to 35 mph. 
2.  Alleys and Rear Access Lanes. Alleys and lanes that provide access to the rear of buildings are permitted. The intersection of alleys and rear access lanes with an interior street shall be set back a minimum of 100 feet from the centerline intersection of any two streets. Alleys and rear access lanes may only intersect with a street having a right-of-way of 66 feet or less. 
 
Figure 1. Clear Vision Area 
3.  Clear Vision Area. A clear vision area shall be maintained at all street intersections. The clear vision area shall be kept free of any objects or structures located between a height of two and eight feet, and no parallel parking spaces may be located within a clear vision area. The clear vision area is defined as any area that is located in the right-of-way or road easement area of more than one interior street. (See Figure 1 at right.) 
4.  Curbs. Vertical curbs with a minimum height of six inches are required along all interior streets (except where an alternate treatment is permitted or recommended by this Article 8). 
5.  Curb Radius. 
a.  Interior Streets in the FB Overlay Districts. The curb radius at the intersection of two interior streets in the Flex Business districts shall not exceed 15 feet (or 25 feet, if a corner bump-out is provided). 
b.  Intersections with Perimeter Streets. The curb radius at the intersection of an interior street and a perimeter street shall not exceed 30 feet unless a larger radius is required by the Michigan Department of Transportation or the Road Commission for Oakland County, as is applicable. 
6.  Effective Turning Radius. A service and emergency vehicle circulation plan that shows the effective turning radius for large vehicles at all corners shall be provided to demonstrate that the effective turning radius at all corners is sufficient to accommodate service and emergency vehicles. The street design standards listed in this section may be modified as necessary to provide emergency vehicle circulation routes through the development. 
7.  Sidewalks at Driveway Crossings. When a sidewalk crosses a vehicle driveway, the driveway shall retain the elevation of the sidewalk. The appearance of the sidewalk shall be maintained across the driveway to indicate that the sidewalk remains part of the pedestrian zone and that pedestrians have the right-of-way. 
8.  Crosswalks. Pedestrian crosswalks shall be distinguished in the parking and vehicle travelway zones through the use of pavement striping or a contrasting type of pavement (such as brick pavers or integrally colored scored concrete). 
9.  Traffic Calming Measures. The use of raised intersections, lateral shifts, and traffic circles are encouraged as alternatives to more conventional traffic calming measures such as speed bumps. If a raised intersection is proposed, bollards or other protective measures shall be used to separate vehicular and pedestrian areas in the intersection. 
B.  Street "Zones." Streets consist of three zones - the travelway zone, the parking zone, and the pedestrian zone. The elements that are included in each street zone are as follows (see Figure 2 on following page): 
1.  Travelway Zone. The travelway zone accommodates vehicles in transit, and consists of vehicle travel lanes, left turn lanes, public transit infrastructure (such as dedicated rapid bus lanes or light rail tracks) and boulevard medians. 
2.  Parking Zone. The parking zone accommodates vehicles at rest and includes on-street parking lanes. The parking zone can also accommodate public transit elements by replacing some parking spaces with transit stops. 
3.  Pedestrian Zone. The pedestrian zone is located between the curb and the edge of the right-of-way or road easement. The pedestrian zone is further separated into four sub-zones (see Figure 3 on following page): 
a.  Edge Area. The edge area is the space adjacent to and including the curb. The edge area is necessary to allow the doors of cars parked along the street to open and close freely, and must have a width of 2.5 feet. In general the edge area shall remain clear of obstructions, but streetscape elements such as parking meters, light posts, traffic control signs, and tree grates may be located in the edge area. 
b.  Furnishings Area. The furnishings area accommodates amenities such as street trees, planters, and sidewalk furniture. The furnishings area can be paved (with street trees located in tree grates), or it may be landscaped with a street lawn. Outdoor eating areas or other similar uses associated with a use in an adjacent principal building may be located in a furnishings area. 
c.  Walkway Area. The walkway area is the basic sidewalk area where pedestrians walk. The walkway area must remain clear of obstructions at all times to allow free pedestrian travel. No permanent structures or uses are permitted in the walkway area. 
d.  Frontage Area. The frontage area is the portion of the pedestrian zone adjacent to the edge of the right-of-way or road easement when a building is located at the lot line. When the building is set back from the lot line, the pedestrian zone will not have a frontage area, and any frontage area will serve as walkway area. The frontage area is intended to accommodate door openings, window shoppers, and the tendency of people to shy away from walls higher than waist height. The frontage area may also be used for outdoor eating areas or other similar accessory uses associated with a use in the adjacent principal building.

CHAPTER 4. - DIMENSION AND DESIGN STANDARDS 
 
SECTION 138-8.400 - In General 
A.  Lot Design Standards. The lot design standards set forth where buildings, parking, and other improvements shall be placed on a lot. The lot design standards are based on the type of street (see Section 138-8.300) upon which the lot has frontage. 
B.  Building Entrances. Buildings located on corner lots or lots that front upon two or more streets shall be required to have a principal entrance onto each street or a corner entrance oriented toward the intersection of the two streets. 
C.  Density. There are no maximum or minimum density standards for residential dwelling units in the form-based overlay districts. The number of dwelling units that may be developed will be determined by lot design requirements such as the maximum height and minimum parking requirement for buildings.  
SECTION 138-8.401 - Setback Requirements 
Buildings in the FB overlay districts shall comply with the following minimum and maximum setback requirements. When there is a minimum and a maximum requirement for a setback, the building must be located within the build-to area that is created by the minimum and maximum setback requirement. 
The setback requirements for a building are based on what kind of street the lot has frontage on. If a lot has frontage on more than one kind of street, such as a corner lot at the intersection of a main street and an arterial street, the setback requirement shall be based on the type of street each side of the lot faces. Any frontage that faces a street shall be considered a front yard.

Notes to Table 12: 
  Interior Yards are yards adjacent to a lot line that abut land located in the FB overlay district with a nonresidential underlying zoning district. 
  Perimeter Yards are yards adjacent to a lot line that abus land not located in the FB overlay district or land located in the FB overlay district that has a residential underlying zoning district. 
  Building Frontage in Build-To Area is the width of the front façade of the building that is located in the build-to area (the area between the minimum and maximum setback requirements) divided by the lot width at the minimum setback line. 
(Ord. No. 170 , § 17, 6-16-2014)  
SECTION 138-8.402 - Front Yard Landscaping Requirements 
All landscaping requirements of Article 12 shall apply in the form-based districts, with the exception that the front yard layout landscaping requirements shall supersede any conflicting requirement of Article 12. The front yard landscaping requirements of the following Table 13 shall be required between the property line and the building, and are in addition to any street tree planting requirements.

CHAPTER 5. - BUILDING STANDARDS 
 
SECTION 138-8.500 - Private Frontage Requirements 
This Section 138-8.500 establishes private frontage standards for buildings in the FB overlay districts. The private frontage is the area between the building façade and the front property line. The design and treatment of the building façade and the private frontage area define the character of the building and how that building relates to the street. This, in turn, defines the character and context of the street itself. By way of example, when buildings are set back from the street with a lawn between the building and the street it creates a more residential feel along the street. 
Buildings in the FB overlay districts shall comply with the requirements of one of the following private frontages. Note that any specific dimensional requirements included in this section are in addition to any other dimensional requirements of this Article or Ordinance. 1 
A.  Shopfront Frontage. 
DESCRIPTION 
A frontage where the building façade is located close to the front lot line with the building entrance at sidewalk grade. This frontage type is suitable for nonresidential uses on the first floor. 	ILLUSTRATION

CHAPTER 6. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
SECTION 138-8.600 - Parking 
The following parking requirements are applicable in the form-based districts, and replace similar requirements set forth in Article 11. Any requirement of Article 11 that is not superseded by one of the following parking requirements shall remain in effect in the form-based districts. 
A.  Minimum Parking Required. 
1.  1.5 parking spaces per residential dwelling unit. 
2.  1 parking space per 400 square feet of nonresidential building space. 
B.  Maximum Parking Permitted. The maximum surface parking requirement shall be 200 percent of the minimum parking requirement. The maximum parking requirement may be modified by the reviewing authority if the applicant can submit evidence that additional parking will be required to accommodate maximum parking demand on a typical day. 
Parking spaces in parking garages are exempt from the maximum parking standard. 
C.  On-Street Parking shall be counted toward the minimum parking requirement. 
D.  Parking Lot Layout. Parking lot layout, maintenance, and construction shall comply with all of the requirements of Article 11. 
The Planning Commission may modify the dimensional requirements of Article 11 based on evidence submitted by the applicant indicating that the modification will result in superior site design, will achieve the same purpose as if the parking lot were designed according to conventional standards, and will function in a safe and efficient manner. 
E.  Parking Lot Access. Parking lots or parking structures may only be accessed from a minor street. 
F.  Parking Structures. Parking structures are permitted in the form-based districts, provided that they comply with the following requirements: 
1.  Setback from Arterial and Main Streets. The parking structure and all parking spaces within shall be set back a minimum of 80 feet from any Arterial or Main street. If liner shops are located on the ground floor of a parking structure located along a main street, the building shall not be considered a parking structure, but rather shall be considered a shopfront building subject to the requirements of Section 138-8.500.A. 
2.  Setback from Minor Streets. Parking structures shall be set back a minimum of seven feet from any minor street. 
3.  Height. Parking structures may be no taller than any adjacent building located within 20 feet of the structure. Stand alone parking structures set back 20 or more feet from any adjacent building may not exceed the maximum height permitted for a building at that location within a form-based district, or the height of the tallest building within 150 feet of the parking garage, whichever is lower. 
4.  Design Guidelines. Any parking structure façade that will be visible from a perimeter or interior street, civic/open space, or building shall comply with the following design guidelines: 
a.  The façade shall comply with the building material requirements of Section 138-8.502. 
b.  The parking structure shall have the appearance of a flat-roofed building with a parapet cap type. 
c.  The ground floor of the structure shall be differentiated from upper floors through the use of a horizontal expression line. 
d.  Exterior elevator towers or stair wells shall be open to public view, or enclosed with transparent glazing. 
e.  Views into the parking structure shall be minimized. Facades of parking structures shall be designed without continuous horizontal parking floor openings. Decorative trellis work or another architectural element that will screen the view of parked cars in the structure shall be provided on all exterior openings. 
G.  Loading Space. There are no specific loading requirements in the FB overlay districts; however, buildings and sites shall be designed such that trucks and large delivery vehicles may be accommodated on the site without encroaching onto a perimeter or interior street. Further, loading facilities such as truck docks shall be located and screened such that they are not visible from any perimeter or interior street.  
SECTION 138-8.601 - Outdoor Amenity Space 
A.  Outdoor Amenity Space Required. All developments in the FB overlay districts shall provide outdoor amenity spaces with a minimum area of two percent of the gross land area of the development. The size and disposition of the amenity space shall be proportionate to the size and scale of the development. The emphasis of the amenity space requirement is on the quality rather than the quantity of the space. 
B.  Stormwater Management Facilities. All stormwater management facilities in FB overlay districts shall be attractively designed as a site amenity. However, stormwater management facilities may not be used to satisfy the amenity space requirement. The area of a stormwater management facility is defined as any area within 25 feet of the freeboard elevation of a detention pond.  
SECTION 138-8.602 - Landscaping and Buffering 
All landscaping requirements of Article 12 shall apply in the FB overlay districts, with the exception that the front yard layout landscaping requirements in Table 11 shall supersede any conflicting requirement of Article 12.  
SECTION 138-8.603 - Signs 
Exterior signs in the FB overlay districts shall be governed by the sign requirements of Article VI of Chapter 134 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Rochester Hills. 
(Ord. No. 165, § 11, 3-19-2012; Ord. No. 182 , § 6, 2-5-2018)  
SECTION 138-8.604 - Modification of Dimension and Design Standards 
A.  Intent. The requirements of this Article 8 are comprehensive in scope and detailed in nature. The regulations have been designed to establish specific design criteria for new development in the form-based districts while still allowing for flexibility in site layout and design, architecture, and landscaping. However, unique site conditions or other factors may justify modifications from the dimensional standards of this Article 8. It is the intent of this Section 138-8.604 to establish a procedure by which the reviewing authority may modify the dimensional standards of Article 8, and the procedure by which those dimensional standards may be modified. 
Relief from any standard or provision of this ordinance not specifically identified as a modifiable standard shall require a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals following the procedures of Article 3 of this Zoning Ordinance. 
B.  Modification Procedure. The reviewing authority shall determine that all of the following apply prior to approving a requested modification: 
1.  The proposed development will still meet the purpose and intent of the form-based districts as identified in Section 138-8.100 if the requested modification is approved. 
2.  The applicant shall submit evidence demonstrating that compliance with the strict standards of this Article 8 makes development impractical on the site, and that the modification is necessary to develop in accordance with the standards of this Article 8. 
3.  The requested modification will not make further development on the site or adjacent or nearby sites according to the standards of this Article 8 impossible or impractical. 
4.  The requested modification is the smallest modification necessary. If the proposed development could be constructed in a substantially similar manner with a smaller modification, the smaller modification may be approved. 
5.  The modification will permit innovative design. 
C.  Modifiable Standards. Only the standards and regulations specifically identified below may be modified. If the reference refers to a subsection, only the identified standards of that subsection may be modified. If the reference refers to an entire section, any standard in the entire section may be modified. 
1.  Street network and block requirements (Section 138-8.300).

ARTICLE 9 - NATURAL FEATURES  
CHAPTER 1. - NATURAL FEATURES SETBACK 
 
SECTION 138-9.100 - Intent 
It is the intent of this section to require a minimum setback from natural features and to regulate the use of property within the setback in order to prevent physical harm, impairment and/or destruction of or to natural features. It has been determined that, in the absence of a minimum setback, intrusions in or onto natural features would occur, resulting in harm, impairment and/or destruction of natural features contrary to the public health, safety and general welfare.  
SECTION 138-9.101 - Nonapplicability to Parcels Planned Before January 1, 1990 
This section shall not apply to property for which a site plan or condominium plan has been approved or for which a preliminary subdivision plat has received tentative approval or any subsequent approvals prior to January 17, 1990, provided the site plan, condominium plan or plat remains in effect and in good standing.  
SECTION 138-9.102 - Natural Features Setback 
Except as may be permitted pursuant to Section 138-9.103, a minimum setback of 25 feet from a natural feature, as defined in this ordinance, shall be observed, and any filling, land balancing, dredging, construction or any deposit, installation or removal of any material, including structures, soils, minerals, and/or vegetation, within a natural feature setback is prohibited. Any land located within a natural features setback is intended to be kept in a natural state.  
SECTION 138-9.103 - Reduction of Setback 
The minimum setback may be reduced upon application by the property owner and determination by the official or body responsible for review and approval of the proposed construction, activity or operation that such construction, activity or operation is not likely to endanger or materially and adversely affect the natural feature. Incidental to the consideration of an application to reduce a natural feature setback, the City may require, at the applicant's expense, an investigation to determine the nature, location and boundaries of the natural feature. In determining whether to authorize a reduction of the minimum setback, the official or body responsible for review and approval of the proposed construction, activity or operation shall consider the following criteria: 
A.  The nature, environmental sensitivity and size of the natural feature. 
B.  The nature, necessity and economic value of the proposed construction, activity or operation. 
C.  The feasibility of alternatives. 
D.  The probable impact of the proposed construction, activity or operation on the natural feature and the cumulative effect of other existing and anticipated activities on the natural feature. 
E.  The probable impact on fish and wildlife and their habitats. 
F.  The maintenance of historic, scenic, ecological and recreational values, and the character of the area.  
SECTION 138-9.104 - Exemptions 
The following activities shall be exempt from regulation under this section, although other sections of this ordinance may apply: 
A.  Beach sanding. 
B.  Installation of a dock, seawall or fence. 
C.  Lawn maintenance. 
D.  Grading and filling required by the City. 
E.  Construction, maintenance and improvement of public streets, highways, roads or pedestrian-bicycle pathways within an existing right-of-way or a public easement, in such a manner as to minimize adverse effect on a wetland or watercourse, provided, except in emergencies, that: 
1.  Prior written notice is given to the City engineer and written consent is obtained from the City engineer prior to commencement of work; 
2.  The work is conducted using good management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns, and chemical and biological characteristics of wetlands are not impaired; and 
3.  Any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
F.  Installation, maintenance, repair or operation of utilities, including water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage systems and facilities, and electric, gas, telephone and cable television lines, in such a manner as to minimize adverse effect on a watercourse or wetland, provided that, except in emergencies: 
1.  Prior written notice is given to the City engineer and written consent is obtained from the City engineer prior to commencement of work; 
2.  The work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns, and chemical and biological characteristics of wetlands are not impaired; and 
3.  Any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
G.  Maintenance, repair, cleaning and upgrading of any natural and humanmade drainage course, watercourse, drain, pipe, ditch, stream, creek, swale, detention and retention basin and pond which serves to transport or hold stormwater runoff, provided that, except in emergencies: 
1.  Prior written notice is given to the City engineer and written consent is obtained from the City engineer prior to commencement of work; 
2.  The work is conducted using good management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns, and chemical and biological characteristics of wetlands are not impaired; and 
3.  Any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
H.  Activities that are authorized on state- or City-regulated wetlands without a state or City permit under section 30305 of Public Act No. 59 of 1995 (MCL § 324.30305, MSA § 13A.30305) or section 126-502 of the City's code of ordinances are specifically authorized in the natural features setback.  
SECTION 138-9.105 - Protective Barrier 
The City may require that a suitable protective barrier be erected and maintained along the perimeter of the natural feature setback area to prevent construction or development activity from encroaching into the natural feature setback, and to maintain the natural feature setback area in a natural and undisturbed state in perpetuity after construction is completed. 
A.  Permanent Barrier Required. Protective barriers shall be permanent and not easily removed. Barriers should also be decorative and highly visible to discourage encroachments into the natural features setback area. Boulder walls are an example of a permanent and visible barrier. 
B.  Signs delineating the perimeter of the natural features setback area are easily removed and therefore are not sufficient by themselves to fulfill the intent of this section. However, signs are encouraged in conjunction with a permanent barrier.  
CHAPTER 2. - STEEP SLOPES 
 
SECTION 138-9.200 - Findings and Purpose 
A.  Findings. The City Council of the City of Rochester Hills finds that: 
1.  The establishment of regulatory and conservation practices to prevent disturbance of steep slopes is needed to protect public health, safety and general welfare. Experience has demonstrated a need for effective protection of steep slopes, including careful review and regulation and the implementation of stringent mitigation measures where, in the opinion of the reviewing authority, no practical alternative to such disturbance exists. However, in all cases where the reviewing authority determines that total avoidance of steep slopes is not practical, such disturbance should constitute the minimum disturbance necessary to ensure the property owner a reasonable use of the property. 
2.  The disturbance of steep slopes can aggravate erosion and sedimentation beyond rates experienced in natural processes. Erosion and sedimentation often include the loss of topsoil, a valuable natural resource, and can result in the disturbance of habitats, degradation of surface water quality, degradation of wetlands, alteration of drainage patterns, gullying of land, obstruction of drainage structures, intensification of flooding both on and off the subject site, failure of slopes and the mass movement of earth and danger to the natural environment, man-made structures and the safety of persons. 
3.  Steep slopes, including stabilizing deep-root vegetation located thereon, are important environmental features that contribute significantly to the natural beauty of the City. Over-development of or improperly managed disturbance to these steep slopes is detrimental to the environment and the overall character of nearby areas. 
4.  Regulation can allow the reasonable use of private property by encouraging flexible development design so as to avoid disturbance of steep slopes. Regulation can also permit limited disturbance of steep slopes that are conducted in accordance with acceptable engineering practices and will not negatively impact the integrity of the steep slope or other nearby environmental features. 
B.  Purpose. These regulations are adopted with the intent of providing a reasonable balance between the rights of the individual property owners and the public interest in preserving the valuable functions of steep slopes. The purpose of these Steep Slope regulations are to: 
1.  Provide qualitative and quantitative development controls in order to preserve, protect and conserve steep slopes within the City of Rochester Hills. 
2.  To maintain and protect the natural terrain and its vegetative features, wetlands, water bodies and watercourses. 
3.  Prevent flooding, protect important scenic views and vistas, preserve areas of wildlife habitat, and provide safe building sites. 
4.  Protect property within the City by preventing erosion, creep and sudden slope failure.  
SECTION 138-9.201 - Applicability 
Steep slope areas fall into three categories: a Moderate Steep Slope is a slope equal to or greater than one vertical on five horizontal 20 percent but less than one vertical on four horizontal 25 percent and with a vertical elevation change of ten feet or greater. A Very Steep Slope is a slope equal to or greater than one vertical on four horizontal 25 percent but less than one vertical on 2.5 horizontal 40 percent and with a vertical elevation change of ten feet or greater. A Bluff Slope is a slope greater than or equal to one vertical on 2.5 horizontal 40 percent with a vertical elevation change of 15 feet or greater. The provisions of this Section shall apply to lands defined and/or designated as steep slope areas. 
A.  Regulated Slopes. 
1.  Slopes Located Within 200 feet of a Watercourse. Any Moderate Steep Slope, Very Steep Slope, and/or Bluff Slope that is located within 200 feet of the Clinton River, Paint Creek, Sargent Creek, Stony Creek, or a tributary of any of the aforementioned watercourses shall be considered a regulated slope. 
2.  Slopes Not Located Within 200 feet of a Watercourse. Any Very Steep Slope and/or Bluff Slope that is not located within 200 feet of the Clinton River, Paint Creek, Sargent Creek, or Stony Creek shall be considered a regulated slope. 
B.  Steep Slope Inventory. The City shall prepare an inventory map of regulated steep slopes within the City. 
C.  Presumption. A steep slope inventory map indicates the location of known steep slopes within the City. Steep slopes may also exist that are not indicated on the map. Such slopes not indicated on the map are regulated by the provisions of this Chapter. 
D.  Exemptions. 
1.  The reviewing authority may waive the requirements of this Article 9, Chapter 2 for activities on or near slopes that are demonstrated to be man-made. Examples of slopes that are man-made include but are not limited to spoils piles, embankments for roads or railroads, berms, etc. The applicant must demonstrate that construction activity near or on the slope, including the possible removal or elimination of the steep slope area, will not impact or cause to be impacted a nearby natural feature or destroy views or alter the appealing aesthetic character of the area near the man-made slope if requesting an exemption. 
2.  Moderate and Very steep slopes covering a horizontal area of 5,000 sq. ft. or less are exempt from the provisions of this Article 9, Chapter 2. For the purposes of this exemption, where a steep slope is located on two or more contiguous parcels the area of the entire steep slope shall be used to calculate if the area exemption applies.  
SECTION 138-9.202 - Permitted and Regulated Activities 
A.  Allowable Activities Outside of a Steep Slope Setback Area. Any activity that does not impact a steep slope or is located outside of a steep slope setback area shall not be subject to the requirements of this Article 9, Chapter 2. 
B.  Allowable Activities on a Steep Slope or in a Steep Slope Setback Area. The following activities are permitted on a steep slope between the toe of slope and top of slope and within a steep slope setback area without a steep slope permit: 
1.  Normal ground maintenance that does not require disturbance of existing terrain. Normal ground maintenance includes customary best management practices for deep root vegetation and the mowing, trimming, or pruning of non-deep root vegetation. Normal ground maintenance activities do not include regrading or disturbing the soil surface, and must comply with all other applicable laws and regulations. 
2.  The planting of vegetation that does not require the removal of existing deep-root vegetation and does not disturb the natural contour of the land. 
3.  Fence construction in accordance with all other applicable laws and regulations. 
4.  The disturbance to steep slopes under temporary emergency conditions, as determined by the City's Engineering Services Department, where such disturbance is necessary to protect persons or property from present and imminent danger. 
5.  Maintenance and repair of existing roads, driveways, walkways and retaining walls. 
6.  Construction or expansion of roads in a public right-of-way. 
7.  Public health and safety activities and emergency uses by or on behalf of a public agency. 
C.  Regulated Activities. The following activities involving the creation of a new steep slope, alteration or disturbance to an existing steep slope between the toe of slope and top of slope, a manmade change to the land within a steep slope setback area, or any other activity not specifically listed as an allowable activity in Section 138-9.202.B., above, shall not be permitted unless a Steep Slope Permit is issued by the proper reviewing authority: 
1.  Constructing, operating, or maintaining any use or development. 
2.  Erecting or installing buildings or other structures, improvements, or utilities (exception: fence construction or maintenance, which is a permitted activity). 
3.  Depositing or removing material. 
4.  Land balancing or other grading. 
5.  Removal of deep-root vegetation. 
6.  Constructing, operating, or maintaining a stormwater outlet sewer. 
D.  Steep Slope Setback. Regulated activities identified in Section 138- 9.202.C., above, may not occur in the steep slope setback area unless a steep slope permit is issued. The steep slope setbacks are defined based on the type of steep slope, and are defined as follows: 
1.  A 15-foot setback is required from the top of a moderate steep slope with a ratio of one vertical to five horizontal (20 percent slope or greater). 
2.  A 25-foot setback is required from the top of a very steep slope with a ratio of one vertical to four horizontal (25 percent or greater). 
3.  A 50-foot setback is required from the top of a bluff slope with a ratio of one vertical to 2.5 horizontal (40 percent or greater). 
4.  A 15-foot setback is required from the toe of any steep or very steep slope. A 25-foot setback is required from the toe of any bluff slope. 
E.  Measurement of Steep Slope Setback. Many slopes will qualify as two or more types of steep slope due to changes in topography and the grade of the slope. In such a case, the setbacks defined in subsection D., above, shall be measured parallel to the top of slope and any transition contour lines where the grade of the slope changes and the slope changes to a different type of slope (i.e. moderate steep slope to a very steep slope). 
The steep slope setback line shall be defined as the setback line that is farthest from the top of slope. Refer to the illustrations on the following page for a graphic representation of a transition contour.

SECTION 138-9.203 - Review Criteria 
In reviewing any request for a steep slope permit, the reviewing authority shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Any steep slope permit application must satisfy the following review criteria: 
A.  General Criteria. 
1.  Structures shall be designed in a manner that averts or minimizes alteration to the steep slope and that otherwise complies with the grading standards in 138-9.203.B. 
2.  Feasible alternatives to the proposed action, including avoidance of disturbance of the steep slope area and the availability of reasonable alternative building locations on the subject site or on any other adjacent parcels under the control of the applicant. 
3.  The suitability of the proposed activity to the area for which it is proposed. Structures should be sited on existing level areas of the site. 
4.  The suitability of soils and/or other structural characteristics of the slope that make the slope suitable for development, or unsuitable for development due to the slope's susceptibility to erosion, creep, or failure. 
5.  The proposed mitigation measures will adequately protect steep slopes from erosion, sedimentation, or damage beyond a natural rate of change. 
6.  The availability of technical improvements, safeguards, or other mitigation measures that could feasibly be added to the proposal. 
7.  Proposed method(s) of restoring disturbed areas of a steep slope. 
B.  Specific Criteria. 
1.  The alignment of roads and driveways shall follow the natural topography to minimize regrading and comply with design standards for maximum grades set forth in the City's engineering standards. 
2.  The natural elevations and vegetative cover of steep slopes shall be protected from disturbance to the maximum extent possible. 
3.  All regrading shall blend in with the natural contours of the land. 
4.  Cuts and fills shall be rounded off to eliminate sharp angles at the top, bottom and side of regraded slopes. 
5.  The angle of cut and fill slopes shall not exceed the natural angle of repose of the soil in the cut or fill, except where retaining walls or other structural stabilization is used; generally, for soils, cut and fill slopes should be not steeper than one vertical to three horizontal (33 percent slope). 
6.  Any disturbance of steep slopes shall be completed within one construction season, and disturbed areas shall not be left bare and exposed during the winter and spring thaw periods. 
7.  The disturbance of existing vegetative ground cover shall not take place more than seven days prior to commencing grading and construction.

B.  Conflicts. Wherever this Article 9, Chapter 2 is inconsistent with any other law of the City of Rochester Hills, whichever law imposes the more stringent restriction shall prevail.  
SECTION 138-9.210 - Definitions 
As used in this Article 9, Chapter 2, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated: 
APPLICANT: Any individual, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company, organization or other legal entity of any kind, excluding the City of Rochester Hills and its governmental agencies, who requests the reviewing authority to issue a permit, or to whom a permit has been granted under the provisions of this Chapter. 
CITY COUNCIL: The City Council of the City of Rochester Hills. 
CREEP: The gradual movement downhill of soil or loose rock on a steep slope. The process of creep may result in the migration of the top of slope contour and destabilization of the slope. 
DEEP ROOT STABILIZING VEGETATION: Vegetation that increases soil strength and stability by providing reinforcement and increasing the shear strength of soils. Deep root vegetation contains a fibrous root system that penetrates more than four feet below the surface (in a mature plant). Deep root stabilizing vegetation includes certain native species of trees, shrubs, and native grasses. Turf grass root systems are typically only four to six inches deep, so turf grasses do not qualify as deep root vegetation. The City maintains a list of acceptable native deep-root vegetation appropriate for use on steep slopes. 
DISTURBANCE: The removal of vegetation, except as specifically permitted herein, or the filling, excavation, regrading or removal of soil, rock or retaining structures in areas of steep slope, whether by manual labor, machine or explosive. The condition of disturbance will be deemed to continue until the area of disturbance is revegetated and/or permanently stabilized. 
DISTURBED AREA: Any steep slope area for which a disturbance is proposed or is ongoing. 
GRADING: Adjusting the degree of inclination of the natural contours of the land, including leveling, smoothing, grubbing, tilling, and other modification of the natural land surface. 
HORIZONTAL AREA: The horizontal area is the area of a level plane drawn underneath the steep slope with the toe and top of slope as the boundaries of the horizontal plane. For instance, a topographical map shows the horizontal area of a steep slope by rendering the slope area on a level plane. 
LAND IMPROVEMENT PERMIT: The written approval issued by the Engineering Services Department permitting the actual commencement and continuation of grading work in accordance with an approved grading plan or construction engineering plan. 
MATERIAL: All liquid, solid or gaseous substances. 
PERSON: Any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company, organization or other legal entity of any kind, including public agencies and municipal corporations. 
PLANNING COMMISSION: The Planning Commission of the City of Rochester Hills. 
PROJECT: Any proposed or ongoing action that may result in direct or indirect physical impact on a steep slope, including, but not limited to, any regulated activity. 
REVIEWING AUTHORITY: The City agency(s) or public official(s) empowered to administer the permit procedures of this Chapter. 
SLOPE: Slope is defined as "rise over run," and is determined by dividing the vertical change in grade by the horizontal distance over which that grade change occurs. The vertical and horizontal distance of a slope is measured from the toe of slope to top of slope. 
 
Measurement of Slope 

STEEP SLOPE: Any geographical area, whether on a single lot or not, having a topographical gradient of 20 percent or greater (ratio of vertical distance to horizontal distance) between the toe of slope and top of slope and a minimum area as defined below. Known steep slope areas are identified on the City's Steep Slope Map. Steep slopes are further categorized as: 
1.  MODERATE STEEP SLOPE: A slope equal to or greater than one vertical on five horizontal (20 percent) but less than one vertical on four horizontal (25 percent) and having a minimum vertical elevation change of ten feet from the top of slope to toe of slope. 
2.  VERY STEEP SLOPE: A slope equal to or greater than one vertical on four horizontal (25 percent) but less than one vertical on 2.5 horizontal (40 percent) and having a minimum vertical elevation change of ten feet from the top of slope to toe of slope. 
3.  BLUFF SLOPE: A slope equal to or greater than one vertical on 2.5 horizontal (40 percent) and having a minimum vertical elevation change of 15 feet or more from the top of slope to toe of slope. 
 
TYPES OF STEEP SLOPE 
STEEP SLOPE PERMIT: The written form of City approval granted by the reviewing authority and required by this Chapter for the issuance of a work permit and the conduct of any regulated activity on a steep slope. 
STRUCTURE: Anything constructed or erected, the use of which requires location on or in the ground or attachment to something having location on the ground, including, but not limited to, buildings, athletic courts, swimming pools and decks. 
 
TOE OF SLOPE: The base or bottom of a slope at the point where the ground surface changes to a flatter grade (less than 20 percent), and below which no further steep slope exists within 100 feet of the toe of slope line. 
TOP OF SLOPE: The top of slope is the point where the grade changes from less than to greater than 20 percent. 
TRANSITION CONTOUR: A contour elevation that marks a change between two types of steep slope. Transition contours also occur if a steep slope includes a plateau of land that has a slope of 20 percent or less with a horizontal distance of less than 100 feet. If such a plateau exists, the contour line where the slope changes from 20 percent or more to less than 20 percent shall be considered as transition contours, and not as a top or toe of slope.

CHAPTER 2. - EXTERIOR LIGHTING 
 
SECTION 138-10.200 - Purpose 
The purpose of this Chapter is to preserve, protect, and enhance the lawful nighttime use and enjoyment of all properties in the City through the use of appropriate lighting practices and systems. Exterior lighting shall be designed, installed and maintained to control glare and light trespass, minimize obtrusive light, conserve energy and resources, maintain safety, security and productivity, and prevent the degradation of the nighttime visual environment. It is the further intent of this Chapter to encourage the use of innovative lighting designs and decorative light fixtures that enhance the character of the community while preserving the nighttime visual environment.  
SECTION 138-10.201 - General Provisions 
The design and illumination standards of this Chapter shall apply to all exterior lighting sources and other light sources visible from the public right-of-way, road easement, or adjacent parcels, except where specifically exempted herein. 
 
Figure 5. Lighting FixtureOrientation and Shielding 
A.  Shielding. Exterior lighting shall be fully shielded and directed downward at a 90 degree angle. Oblique lenses (such as many wall-pack fixtures) are prohibited. All fixtures shall incorporate full cutoff housings, louvers, glare shields, optics, reflectors or other measures to prevent off-site glare and minimize light pollution. Only flat lenses are permitted on light fixtures; sag or protruding lenses are prohibited. 
B.  Intensity. The following light intensity requirements shall apply on all sites within the City. 
1.  The intensity of light within a site shall not exceed ten footcandles. Exception: the maximum intensity permitted in areas of intensive vehicular use, such as the area underneath gas station pump canopies, in the immediate vicinity of ATM facilities, or outdoor sales areas shall be 20 footcandles. 
2.  The maximum light intensity permitted at a street right-of-way line shall be one footcandle. 
3.  The maximum light intensity permitted at any property line other than a street right-of-way shall be 0.5 footcandles. 
C.  Glare and light trespass. Exterior lighting sources shall be designed, constructed, located and maintained in a manner that does not cause off-site glare on neighboring properties or street rights-of-way. In general, the hot spot, or light emitting element of any light fixture shall not be directly visible from a neighboring property, as this is the primary cause of glare. 
D.  Lamps. 
1.  Wattage. Lamps with a maximum wattage of 250 watts per fixture are permitted for use in the City to maintain a unified lighting standard and to minimize light pollution. The Planning Commission may permit the use of lamps with wattages up to 400 watts if the applicant can demonstrate that the higher wattage fixture is necessary to provide adequate lighting on the site and that the light fixture is in compliance with all other requirements of this Chapter. The exemption for higher wattage lamps shall not be granted if the same lighting effect can be reasonably accomplished on the site by incorporating additional 250 watt fixtures into the site design.

ARTICLE 11 - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING  
CHAPTER 1. - GENERALLY 
 
SECTION 138-11.100 - Purpose 
Off-street facilities designed for the parking of self-propelled motor vehicles for occupants, employees and patrons of buildings erected, used, altered or extended after the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance shall be provided and maintained in accordance with the provisions of this Article. Such facilities shall be maintained and not encroached upon so long as the principal use remains, unless an equivalent number of spaces are provided elsewhere in conformance with this ordinance. 
The purpose of this Article is also to protect water quality and the capacity of drainage and stormwater management systems; to limit the number of off-street parking spaces and amount of impervious surfaces that may be permitted on a parcel of land or accessory to a use or building; to establish flexible minimum and maximum standards for off-street parking and loading; and to promote the use and development of shared parking facilities and cross-access between sites.  
SECTION 138-11.101 - Scope 
Adequate off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided in all districts in accordance with the provisions in this Article whenever a structure or use is established, constructed, altered, or expanded, an existing use is replaced by a new use (change of use), or the intensity of a use is increased through additional dwelling units, an increase in floor area or seating capacity or similar means. Such spaces shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this Article.  
SECTION 138-11.102 - General Standards 
The following general standards shall apply to all off-street parking and loading facilities: 
A.  Provision of Spaces. There shall be provided in all zoning districts, at the time of erection or enlargement of any main building or structure, automobile off-street parking with adequate access to all spaces. The number of off-street parking spaces, in conjunction with all land or building uses, shall be provided prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, as prescribed in this section. 
B.  Location of Spaces. 
1.  Proximity to Site. Off-street parking for other than residential use shall be either on the same lot or within 300 feet of the building it is intended to serve, measured from the nearest point of the building to the nearest point of the off-street parking lot, provided, further, that such off-street parking may be located in a different zoning district than the building it is intended to serve only if that building and its proposed use would also be permitted in the different zoning district. 
2.  Location in Non-Required and Rear Yards. Off-street parking may be located within any non-required yard and within the rear yard setback. Refer to Section 138-5.100 on for yard setback requirements. 
3.  Location in Required Front and Side Yards. Off-street parking shall not be permitted in a side or front yard setback except as follows: 
a.  Off-street parking may be permitted to occupy a required front yard after approval of the parking plan layout, provided that there shall be maintained a minimum unobstructed and landscaped setback of 20 feet in I (Industrial) districts and ten feet in all other nonresidential districts between the nearest point of the off-street parking area, exclusive of driveways, and the nearest right-of-way line. The buffer area between the parking lot and the right-of-way line shall be landscaped in accordance with Section 138-12.301.B. 
b.  In I (Industrial), REC-W, and REC-C districts, required side yards may be utilized for parking and loading and unloading provided that in such instances the Planning Commission shall review the plans for such area to ensure sufficient access to the building or any storage or related areas to provide for the health, safety and general welfare of employees in the building. All off-street loading and unloading areas shall be provided with adequate obscuring screening at least six feet in height, except it shall not be required on the interior of the district where the area is not visible from a thoroughfare or other zoning district. 
c.  Off-street parking may be located in a required side yard abutting a nonresidential zoning district in B-1, B-2, B-3, B-5, CI, O-1, ORT, REC-I, REC-M, and SP districts provided that there shall be an unobstructed and landscaped setback of at least ten feet maintained between the nearest point of the off-street parking lot, exclusive of driveways, and the side lot line. Such unobstructed and landscaped setback shall extend continuously and uninterrupted along the side lot line from the nearest right-of-way line or private road easement to the rear yard. The unobstructed and landscaped setback of at least ten feet may be reduced or waived by the Planning Commission or Planning and Development Director (relative to site plans not submitted to the Planning Commission) upon determining that such reduction or waiver is compatible with and/or part of a comprehensive plan with the adjacent properties. 
d.  Off-street parking may be located in the required interior side yard in SP districts provided that type B screening is provided as required by Section 138-12.300 between the nearest point of the off-street parking lot, exclusive of driveways, and the interior side lot line. 
4.  Setback from Residential Districts and Uses. Parking areas, and circulation or access drives shall be setback from adjoining or abutting residentially zoned property as follows: 
a.  Where the parking lot or drive abuts a residential district at the side or rear lot line said parking lot or drive shall be setback a minimum of ten feet from said lot line. 
b.  Where the parking lot or drive shares common, contiguous street frontage with an abutting residentially zoned parcel, said parking lot or drive shall maintain the same minimum front or street side setback required for the residential parcel dependent upon orientation to the common street of said parcel and other residential parcels in the same block. 
c.  Private roads, private drives and off-street parking areas, including maneuvering lanes, shall not be permitted within required yards in the RM-1 and RCD districts where the adjacent property is zoned one-family residential. 
5.  Setback from Buildings. Parking, loading areas, and circulation or access drives shall set back at least five feet from any building or structure. Concrete curbing shall be installed along the perimeter of the vehicular use area to prevent encroachments. 
C.  Alteration of Existing Parking. Existing off-street parking facilities accessory to an existing building or use shall not be reduced to an amount less than the minimum required by this Article for a similar new building or new use. The minimum required off-street parking spaces shall not be replaced by any other use unless adequate parking facilities meeting the standards of this Article have first been provided at another location acceptable to the Planning Commission. 
D.  Residential Parking. Residential off-street parking spaces for single-family and two-family dwellings shall consist of a parking strip, driveway, garage or combination thereof and shall be located on the premises they are intended to serve. 
E.  Pedestrian Circulation. The parking lot layout shall accommodate pedestrian circulation. Pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided, distinguished by textured paving or pavement striping, and integrated into the sidewalk network. 
F.  Cross Access. Common, shared parking facilities are encouraged. As such, wherever feasible, cross-access connections between adjacent parking lots, or a future connection when no adjacent parking lot exists but can reasonably be expected to be constructed on an adjacent parcel at a future date are required. Blanket cross-access easements across the entire parking lot area shall be provided for connected lots under separate ownership or management. The cross-access easement shall be without limitation and shall be recorded with the Oakland County Register of Deeds. 
G.  Permit Required. 
1.  Construction. No parking lot shall be constructed unless and until a permit for such construction is issued by the public services department. Application for a permit shall be submitted in such form as may be determined by the City and shall be accompanied with two sets of plans for the development and construction of the parking lot showing that the provisions of this section will be fully complied with. No final occupancy permit shall be issued by the building department until the parking lot has been completed. 
2.  Maintenance. A permit from the Building Department shall be required for any parking lot resurfacing or restriping activity. Application for such permit shall be accompanied by two sets of plans demonstrating that the provisions of this section shall be fully complied with. 
H.  Prohibited Activities. The outdoor storage of merchandise, motor vehicles for sale, trucks or equipment, wrecked, junked or unlicensed vehicles, or the repair of vehicles in areas designated for parking (including the maneuvering lane) is prohibited. 
I.  City Parks Exempt. The standards and regulations applicable to off-street parking shall not be applicable to publicly owned City parks. A parking plan shall be submitted and reviewed by City staff when a new park is proposed or modifications in an existing park are proposed. In those cases wherein the Planning Commission will review and approve a site plan for a park, a parking plan must be included and approved based on current and future expected usage. 
(Ord. No. 170 , § 12, 6-16-2014; Ord. No. 179 , § 3, 8-8-2016; Ord. No. 182 , § 8, 2-5-2018)  
CHAPTER 2. - MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PARKING REQUIRED 
 
SECTION 138-11.200 - General Provisions 
A.  Minimum Parking Required. Off-street parking, stacking, and loading spaces shall be provided in accordance with the minimum requirements of Section 138-11.204. The Planning Commission may reduce the number of required spaces as described in Section 138-11.202, Modification of Standards. 
B.  Maximum Parking Permitted. In order to minimize excessive areas of pavement which negatively impact aesthetic standards and contribute to high volumes of stormwater runoff, the maximum amount of off-street parking permitted for any use shall not exceed 125 percent of the minimum parking requirements of Section 138-11.204. This requirement shall not apply to single-family or two-family dwellings. The Planning Commission may permit additional parking over and above the maximum parking limit based on evidence indicating that the maximum parking permitted will not be sufficient to accommodate the use on a typical day. 
C.  Uses Not Listed. For uses not specifically listed in Section 138-11.204, the default parking standard for that type of use shall apply, unless the Planning and Development Director or his designee determines that the standard for a similar listed use is more appropriate. 
D.  Uses Meeting More Than One Category. Where more than one use is present in a building or a site (such as a gas station with convenience store and restaurant; or a place of worship with day care center and community center) the various components of the use shall comply with the requirement for each component. In such a case, the applicant must provide information regarding the floor area, employees, or other relevant information for each use in order to allow the City to determine the minimum parking requirement for the use. 
E.  Fractional Spaces. When units or measurements determining the number of required parking spaces result in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded, and fractions over one-half shall require one parking space. 
F.  Units of Measurement. The following units of measurement are used in calculating required parking: 
1.  Floor Area: Where floor area is the unit for determining the required number of parking spaces, said unit shall mean gross floor area. 
2.  Usable Floor Area: Usable floor area shall mean the floor area used for service to the public and shall not include floor area used for storage or processing and packaging of merchandise where it is undertaken in a room in which service to the public is not involved. When usable floor area is not known at the time of site plan submittal, 80 percent of the total floor area shall be used for usable floor area for parking computations. 
3.  Places of Assembly: For places of worship, sports arenas or similar places of assembly in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews or similar seating, each 24 inches of such seating shall be counted as one seat. 
4.  Employees: For requirements stated in terms of employees, the calculation shall be based on the maximum number of employees on the premises during the largest shift.  
SECTION 138-11.201 - Shared Parking 
Different types of uses have different peak usage times, for instance, residential land uses generate the most parking demand during evening and night hours, while office uses generate the most parking demand during business hours. Therefore, the minimum parking requirement may be adjusted by a shared parking factor that considers a mixture of uses sharing a common parking facility. The uses that share a common parking facility may be located within a single building or in separate buildings located on the same or different sites. 
A.  Shared Parking Procedure. The number of shared parking spaces required for two or more land uses sharing a parking lot or located on the same parcel of land shall be determined by the following procedure: 
1.  Multiply the minimum parking required for each individual use, as set forth in the Shared Parking Factor Table below, by the appropriate percentage indicated in the Shared Parking Factors table below for each of the six designated time periods. 
2.  Add the resulting sums for each of the six columns. 
3.  The minimum parking requirement shall be the highest sum among the six columns resulting from the above calculations. 
4.  Other Uses. If one or all of the land uses proposing to make use of shared parking facilities do not conform to the general land use classifications in the Shared Parking Factor table, as determined by the Planning Commission, the applicant shall submit sufficient data to indicate the principal operating hours of the uses. Based upon this information, the Planning Commission shall determine the appropriate shared parking requirement, if any, for such uses. 
Table 14. Shared Parking Factors 
Land Use 	Weekdays 	Weekends 
	1:00 a.m.  7:00 a.m. 	7:00 a.m.  7:00 p.m. 	7:00 p.m.  1:00 a.m. 	1:00 a.m.  7:00 a.m. 	7:00 a.m.  7:00 p.m. 	7:00 p.m.  1:00 a.m.

Office/Service 	5% 	95% 	5% 	0% 	10% 	0% 
 
B.  Agreement. A written agreement between joint users in a form approved by the City shall be filed with the Oakland County Register of Deeds. The agreement shall assure the continued availability of the parking facility for the uses it is intended to serve. 
(Ord. No. 170 , § 17, 6-16-2014)  
SECTION 138-11.202 - Modification of Parking Requirements 
The Planning Commission may modify the numerical requirements for off-street parking based on evidence submitted by the applicant that another standard would be more reasonable because of the level of current or future employment or customer traffic. 
The Planning Commission may attach conditions to the approval of a modification of the requirements of Section 138-11.204 that bind such approval to the specific use in question.  
SECTION 138-11.203 - Deferred Parking 
If the minimum number of required parking spaces exceeds the amount necessary to serve a proposed use, the Planning Commission may approve construction of a lesser number of parking spaces, subject to the following: 
A.  The banked parking shall be shown on the site plan and set aside as landscaped open space. 
B.  The banked parking shall be constructed upon request by the Building Official, after the City documents three incidents of problem parking on the site within any one year period. 
C.  Banked parking shall be located in areas that are suitable for future parking and comply with Ordinance requirements.

CHAPTER 3. - PARKING DESIGN STANDARDS 
Off-street parking facilities, other than parking for one or two-family dwellings, shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following: 
 
SECTION 138-11.300 - Barrier-free Parking Requirements 
A.  Minimum Number of Barrier-free Spaces. Barrier-free parking spaces shall be provided per the following Table 16: 
Note: the existing Table 16 will be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 
Table 16. Barrier-Free Parking Requirements 
Total Parking Spaces Provided 	Minimum Number of Barrier-Free Spaces Required 
Up to 25 	1 
26-50 	2 
51-75 	1 + 4% of total parking provided in lot 
76-100 	1 + 4% of total parking provided in lot 
101-150 	2 + 3.33% of total parking provided in lot 
151-200 	2 + 3.33% of total parking provided in lot 
201-300 	4 + 2.33% of total parking provided in lot 
301-400 	5 + 2% of total parking provided in lot 
401-500 	5 + 2% of total parking provided in lot 
501-1,000 	5 + 2% of total parking provided in lot 
1,001 and over 	15 + 1% of total parking provided in lot 
 
Notes to Table 16: 
1.  Fractional Spaces. Whenever a fractional space is required by the above Table 16, it shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. 
2.  Example Calculation. A parking lot with 140 parking spaces would have a minimum barrier-free parking space requirement of two spaces plus 140*.0333 = 2 + 4.66 = 6.66 spaces, rounded up to seven spaces. 
3.  Van Accessible Spaces. All barrier-free parking spaces are required to use the Universal Design concept to allow van access in any barrier-free space, and therefore no spaces need be designated specifically for van access. 
The above Table 16 is greater than the 2010 ADA requirements for accessible design, as published by the U.S. Department of Justice as of the date of adoption. If new ADA standards affecting barrier-free parking requirements are adopted that are greater than those contained in this ordinance, they shall supersede Table 16. 
B.  Barrier-Free Space Layout. All barrier-free spaces shall be designed using universal barrier-free design. All spaces shall be 132 inches (11 feet) in width with a 60 inch (five-foot) access aisle (see the following Figure 7). 
Figure 7. Barrier-Free Space Layout 
 
The Planning Commission may permit 96-inch (eight-foot) wide barrier-free spaces with an adjacent 60 inch (five-foot) access aisle when the applicant can demonstrate that providing 132 inch (11 foot) wide spaces will constitute a hardship in meeting the minimum parking requirement or other site design requirements. When 96 inch (eight-foot) spaces are permitted, a minimum of one out of every eight spaces shall be van accessible (with at least one van accessible space being provided on-site in all cases). 
C.  Location and Construction. 
1.  Barrier-free spaces shall be accessible from and conveniently located near each primary building entrance. 
2.  All access aisles shall be level with the parking space, and access aisles cannot include a ramp or sloped area to accommodate a person with a disability using a lift or ramp. 
3.  The access aisle must be connected to an accessible route to the appropriate accessible entrance of a building or facility. 
4.  The parking access aisle must either blend with the accessible route or have a curb ramp complying ADA standards. Such a curb ramp opening must be located within the access aisle boundaries, not within the parking space boundaries. 
5.  Barrier-free spaces shall be identified by above-grade signs and pavement striping in accordance with ADA standards.

ARTICLE 12 - LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING  
CHAPTER 1. - GENERALLY 
 
SECTION 138-12.100 - Purpose and Intent 
The purposes and intent of the landscaping and screening requirements of this Article are to: 
A.  Minimize the transmission from one land use to another of nuisances associated with noise, dust, glare, and litter. 
B.  Minimize visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area. Minimal screening provides an impression of separation of spaces, and more extensive screening can entirely shield the visual effects of an intense land use from a less intense land use. 
C.  Establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion of intense land uses, the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of screening. 
D.  Establish aesthetically pleasing, functionally appropriate and sustainable landscaping design for the long-term enhancement of the appearance of development in the community. 
E.  Safeguard the public health, safety and welfare, and preserve and enhance aesthetic qualities that contribute to community character.  
SECTION 138-12.101 - Scope 
Wherever in this ordinance a greenbelt, planting and/or material is required, the landscaping shall be planted prior to the issuance of any temporary or final certificate of occupancy and shall thereafter be reasonably maintained consistent with the intent of the approved landscaping design plans. If it is not possible to install the landscaping prior to the certificate of occupancy, a performance guarantee shall be posted consistent with Section 138-22.208.  
SECTION 138-12.102 - Submittal Requirements 
All landscape plans shall be signed and sealed by a registered Landscape Architect, and shall include all of the information required by Section 138-2.208.  
SECTION 138-12.103 - Design Standards 
A.  Visibility. Landscaping and screening materials shall be laid out in conformance to the requirements of Section 138-5.204 (Corner Clearance), and shall not conflict with visibility for motorists or pedestrian access. 
B.  Plantings near utility lines and fire hydrants. Required plant materials and screening shall be arranged to avoid conflicts with underground and overhead utility lines and access to or visibility of fire hydrants. The anticipated height at maturity of trees planted near overhead utility lines shall not exceed the line height above grade. 
C.  Protection. Where pavement and landscape areas interface, concrete curbing or similar measures shall be provided to protect plants from vehicle encroachment.  
SECTION 138-12.104 - Walls 
[A.  ] Walls required under this Article shall have no openings for vehicular traffic or other purposes, except such openings as may be approved by the City. All walls required in this ordinance shall be constructed of decorative stone or brick. The height of the wall shall be measured from the prevailing grade of the land on the side of the wall facing the less intense use. Walls shall be erected on a concrete foundation which shall have a minimum depth of 42 inches below a grade approved by the building department and shall not be less than four inches wider than the wall to be erected. 
[B.]  A six-foot tall decorative opaque vinyl fence or densely planted evergreen landscaping sufficient to form a living green wall with a minimum height of six feet may be permitted by the Planning Commission in lieu of a masonry wall when the characteristics of the two abutting uses would make such a substitution appropriate.  
SECTION 138-12.105 - Irrigation 
To assist in maintaining plant materials in a healthy condition, all landscaped areas (including lawns) shall be provided with an automatic, underground, or drip irrigation system, subject to the following: 
A.  The Planning Department may approve an alternative form of irrigation for a particular site, or may waive this requirement upon determining that underground irrigation is not necessary for the type of proposed plant materials. 
B.  All automatic irrigation systems shall be designed to minimize water usage, and shall be shut off during water emergencies, periods of protracted rainfall, or water rationing periods. 
C.  The irrigation requirement may be waived by the reviewing authority if the project incorporates landscaping that will contribute points towards LEED certification or an equivalent rating system.  
SECTION 138-12.106 - Location of Screening 
Screening required under this Article shall be located directly adjacent to the lot line except where underground utilities interfere. Upon approval of the Planning Commission and when mutually agreeable to affected property owners, required screening may be located on the opposite side of an alley right-of-way when a nonresidential district abuts a residential district. The continuity of the required screening on a given block shall be a major consideration of the Planning Commission in reviewing such request.  
SECTION 138-12.107 - Tree Removal 
Please refer to Chapter 126, Article 3, Divisions 13 of the General Code of Ordinances for tree removal and replacement requirements. Trees provided as replacement trees shall not count towards the requirements of this Article, however, trees to be preserved may be counted towards the minimum requirements in accordance with Section 138-12.204.  
SECTION 138-12.108 - Performance Guarantee 
A.  Performance Bond. 
1.  Whenever a site plan requires any type of landscaping, the applicant may be required to post a Performance Bond prior to the issuance of a temporary or final Certificate of Occupancy to ensure the completion of landscaping (including irrigation). If the landscaping is not 100 percent complete when any certificate of occupancy is requested, the City will inspect the landscaping and determine the percentage of completion and a performance bond must be submitted to the City by the Developer in the sum equal to the unfinished portion of the landscape work. The City will have the authority to determine the percentage of completion and the bond amount required. If the landscaping is 100 percent compete and approved no Performance Bond will be required. 
2.  If a Performance Bond is required it must be a cash bond or a corporate surety bond or irrevocable bank letter of credit in the full amount of the sum due as determined by the City. 
3.  All residential developments must post a Performance Bond (100 percent of estimated cost of landscaping) prior to the issuing of the Land Improvement Permit. 
B.  Maintenance Bond. A Maintenance Bond in the sum of 25 percent of estimated cost of landscaping (including irrigation) must be posted prior to the issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy (including temporary). The Maintenance Bond is held for a period two years, at the end of which time the City shall inspect the landscaping. Once, inspection issues are addressed the unused balance of the Maintenance Bond will be released. 
For all residential developments the Maintenance Bond must be posted prior to the release of the Performance Bond. The Maintenance Bond shall be released as specified above.  
SECTION 138-12.109 - Maintenance 
The owner of the property shall be responsible for all maintenance of site landscaping, as follows: 
A.  Landscaping shall be kept in a neat, orderly and healthy growing condition, free from debris and refuse. 
B.  Pruning shall be minimal at the time of installation, only to remove dead or diseased branches. Subsequent pruning shall assure proper maturation of plants to achieve their approved purpose. 
C.  All dead, damaged, or diseased plant material shall be removed immediately and replaced within six months after it dies or in the next planting season, whichever occurs first. For purposes of this Section, the planting season for deciduous plants shall be between March 1 and June 1 and from October 1 until the prepared soil becomes frozen. The planting season for evergreen plants shall be between March 1 and June 1. Plant material installed to replace dead or diseased material shall be as close as practical to the size of the material it is intended to replace. The City may notify property owners of the need to replace dead, damaged, or diseased material. 
D.  The approved landscape plan shall be considered a permanent record and integral part of the Site Plan Approval. Unless otherwise approved in accordance with the aforementioned procedures, any revisions to or removal of plant materials, or non-compliance with the maintenance requirements of this Section 138-12.109 will place the parcel in non-conformity with the approved landscape plan and be a violation of this ordinance. 
E.  If protected trees are damaged, a fine shall be issued on an inch-by-inch basis at a monetary rate as defined by the Forestry Department.  
SECTION 138-12.110 - Installation 
All landscaping shall be installed in a manner consistent with the standards of the American Association of Nurserymen, the approved site plan, and the following: 
A.  Deadline for installation. Installation of required screening and landscaping shall be completed prior to or at the time of completion of building construction, except when building construction is completed during the off-season when plants cannot be installed, in which case the owner shall provide a performance guarantee to ensure installation of required landscaping in the next planting season. 
B.  Extension. The City may extend the deadline to allow installation of required plant materials by the end of the next planting season, upon determination that weather conditions, development phasing, or other factors would jeopardize required plant materials and prevent their installation by the deadline specified in this Section. 
C.  Performance Guarantee. Installation and maintenance bonds may be required. Refer to Section 138-12.108, above.  
CHAPTER 2. - PLANT MATERIAL STANDARDS 
All plant materials shall comply with the following standards: 
 
SECTION 138-12.200 - General 
Whenever a landscape planting screen or other plantings are required under this ordinance, such plantings shall be installed according to accepted good planting procedures and in a sound, workmanlike manner. All plant material shall meet current standards of the American Association of Nurserymen and approved by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI 260.1, 1996). 
A.  All plant material shall be true to name in conformance to the current edition of Standardized Plant Names established by the American Joint Committee on Horticultural Nomenclature, or other source accepted by the City.

B.  A minimum four-inch layer of shredded hardwood bark shall be placed in all planter beds containing trees or shrubs and around the base of all trees planted within lawn areas (mulch cover the entire planting pit width). To aid in maintenance operations all shrubs planted within lawn areas are to be planted in groups and mulched as a group, and hedgerows are to be mulched as one continuous strip. 
C.  Live groundcovers such as myrtle (Vinca minor), blue rug junipers (Juniperus horizontalis 'Wiltonii'), Baltic ivy (Hedera helix 'Baltica', Pachysandra (Pachysandra terminalis) and other similar vines and plant material shall be mulched with a two-inch layer of shredded hardwood bark. Any deviations must be approved by the City's landscape architect.  
SECTION 138-12.202 - Permitted Landscape Materials 
Landscape materials used to satisfy the requirements of this Article shall be common to the area and suitable for their intended use. Species native to southeast Michigan are encouraged. The Planning Department will maintain on file a list of prohibited plant materials that may not be used to satisfy the requirements of this Article. Bare root stock of any kind is not permitted.  
SECTION 138-12.203 - Plant Material Spacing 
Spacing of plant materials required under this Article shall be as follows: 
A.  Plant materials shall not be placed closer than four feet from the fence line or property line. 
B.  Where plant materials are planted in two or more rows, planting shall be staggered in rows. 
C.  Where shrub plantings are required to form a continuous hedge or used for screening purposes, the plants shall not be spaced more than 36 inches on center at planting, and shall have a minimum height and spread of 30 inches at planting. Shrubs that will not attain sufficient width to form a complete hedge spaced 36 inches on center shall be planted at a spacing that will allow them to form a complete hedge within 2 years of planting. 
( Ord. No. 581, § 9, 11-11-2013 )  
SECTION 138-12.204 - Existing Vegetation 
Healthy existing trees on a site may be used to satisfy any of the requirements of this Article, subject to the reviewing authority's approval and the following. This Section 138-12.204 does not replace or supersede the requirements of the City's Tree Conservation Ordinance. 
A.  Site plans shall show all existing trees which are located on the portions of the site and on portions of adjacent sites within 20 feet of the site that will be built upon or otherwise altered, and are six inches or greater in caliper, measured 4.5 feet above grade. Trees shall be labeled "To Be Removed" or "To Be Saved" on the site plan, with tree species and caliper noted for trees to be saved. Only trees six inches in caliper or greater may be used to satisfy any landscaping requirement of this ordinance. 
B.  The Planning Commission may require City inspection of existing plant materials prior to or as a condition of site plan approval to determine the health and desirability of such materials. Such inspections shall be performed by the City or by a certified arborist or similar qualified consultant. 
C.  Where plant materials are to be saved, prior approval shall be obtained by the property owner from the City prior to any delimbing, root pruning, or similar work. 
D.  Protective fencing shall be placed at the drip-line of existing trees, and around the perimeter of other preserved plant materials, with details of protective measures noted on the site plan. No vehicle or other construction equipment shall be parked or stored within protected areas. 
E.  In the event that healthy plant materials which are intended to meet the requirements of the Ordinance are cut down, damaged or destroyed during construction, said plant material shall be replaced with an equivalent species to the damaged or removed tree. Replacement trees shall be provided at the ratio of one replacement tree for each six inches in caliper measured 4.5 feet above grade level or fraction thereof of tree that is cut down, damaged, or destroyed, up to a maximum of four replacement trees, unless otherwise approved by the City based on consideration of the site and building configuration, available planting space, and similar considerations. 
F.  Transplanting of trees within the site is prohibited without the prior approval of the Planning Commission. If such trees are transplanted, their actual replacement value must be calculated and 100 percent of the replacement value must be included in the Maintenance Bond required by Section 138-12.108.  
SECTION 138-12.205 - Size and Variety of Plant Materials 
A.  To ensure adequate variety, and to avoid monotony and uniformity within a site, required plant materials shall not include more than 20 percent of any single plant species, and shall comply with the following schedule for minimum sizes at planting: 
Table 18. Plant Material Requirements 
Screening Materials 	Minimum Size at Installation 
Deciduous Shade Trees 	3 caliper-inches* 
Evergreen Trees 	10 feet height and 5 feet spread 
Deciduous Ornamental Trees 	2 caliper-inches* or 6 feet overall height 
Shrubs 	30 inches in height, 24 inches in spread when used for screening or buffering purposes, or 3 gallon container size when used for other purposes 
Groundcovers 	Shall be from flats 
 
*Caliper-inches measured 12 inches above grade. 
B.  The City may approve modifications from the above table for appropriate landscape materials that do not meet the above minimum size requirements or are not readily available at landscape supply yards in the required size. If smaller materials are approved the difference for the smaller materials shall be compensated with additional material being provided. In approving such a modification, the City shall determine that the substituted plant material size will meet the intent of this Article, and that providing a landscape material that meets the above size requirements is impractical or not feasible. 
(Ord. No. 170 , § 17, 6-16-2014)  
CHAPTER 3. - LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS 
 
SECTION 138-12.300 - Buffer Requirements 
Buffers or greenbelts and obscuring walls or fencing are intended to mitigate any potential negative impacts that a proposed land use may have on neighboring land uses, or to obscure unsightly items or areas from view off the site. The buffer or greenbelt is a designated unit of yard or open space together with any plant materials, barriers and screening designed to minimize negative impacts of adjacent land uses. Both the amount of land and the type and amount of landscaping specified are intended to minimize potential nuisances such as noise, glare, dirt, litter, unsightly areas and similar impacts. 
These buffer requirements are designed to be flexible. A single standard applied to all circumstances may not function as well and might impose unnecessary difficulties on development and lead to monotony. It is the intent of the following provisions to provide flexibility to the developer or property owner through the manipulation of four basic elements: distance, plant material type, plant material density and structural or land forms. 
Buffers shall be required as indicated in Table 19. Such buffers shall be provided along site perimeters without road frontage, except to permit driveways or other necessary site improvements. 
A.  Buffer Descriptions and Requirements. The following is a description of the intended character and function of each buffer type. The specific requirements for each buffer are listed in subsection B., and the type of buffer required between land uses is listed in subsection C. 
1.  Type A: Intended to separate uses, provide vegetation in densely developed areas, and to enhance the appearance of individual properties. 
2.  Type B: Low density screening to partially block visual contact between zoning classifications. 
3.  Type C: Medium density screen to partially block visual contact between zoning classifications and to create spatial separation. 
4.  Type D: Medium-high density screen intended to substantially block visual contact between zoning classifications and create spatial separation. Must form an opaque screen to a height of six feet within three years of planting. 
5.  Type E: High density screen intended to substantially block visual contact between zoning classifications and create spatial separation. Type E planting buffers reduce light and noise trespass that would otherwise intrude upon adjacent zoning classifications. Must form an opaque screen to a height of eight feet within three years of planting. 
B.  Buffer Requirements. The following table lists the minimum amount of plant material required in each buffer type. The following table lists only the minimum requirement, and nothing shall prevent a property owner from providing additional landscaping. Landscaping required by the following table may be planted in clusters at appropriate locations within the buffer or spaced regularly throughout the buffer, provided that the landscape plan meets the intent of the buffer type listed in subsection A., above. 
Table 19. Buffer Standards 
  	Buffer Type 1 
	A 3 	B 3 	C 3 	D 3 	E 3 
Buffer Yard Minimum Width 	6 	10 	20 	25 	50 
Buffer Yard Minimum Width (with wall) 	N/A 	N/A 	8 2 	8 2 	10 2 
Deciduous Trees (per 100 lineal feet) 	1.5 	2 	2 2 	2.5 2 	2.5 
Ornamental Trees (per 100 lineal feet) 	 	1.5 	1.5 2 	1.5 2 	1.5 
Evergreen Trees (per 100 lineal feet) 	1 	2 	4 2 	5 2 	6 
Shrubs (per 100 lineal feet) 	4 	4 	6 2 	8 2 	10 
Berm Height 3, 4 	 	 	 	 	6 ft. 
 
Notes: 
1.  Residential Buffers. All required buffers within residential developments must be placed within defined landscape buffer easements and may not be part of any individual residential lot. 
2.  Screening Wall. Where a screening wall is required, either a masonry or a densely planted "green" wall may be used at the discretion of the reviewing authority after taking into account specific conditions on and adjacent to the site. Screening walls shall comply with the following requirements: 
a.  Green Wall Requirements. Where a green wall is proposed, the plantings comprising the green wall shall be of a sufficient size and spaced on-center such that they will be sufficient to form an opaque screen to a height of six feet within three years of planting. The evergreen and shrub planting requirements of the above table shall be disregarded when a green wall is proposed, as the green wall plantings will serve the same purpose as the evergreen and/or shrub planting requirements. 
b.  Masonry Wall Requirements. All masonry screen walls shall be six feet in height, consist of decorative masonry or natural materials such as brick or stone, and capped with a stone or concrete cap. The color and material shall be coordinated with the materials of the principal building. 
c.  Landscaping With a Masonry Wall. Where a masonry wall is proposed, no evergreen trees are required. Instead, additional deciduous trees and shrubs shall be provided at the rate of 0.5 deciduous trees and two shrubs for each evergreen tree that would otherwise be required in the buffer yard. These additional deciduous trees and shrubs are in addition to the deciduous trees and shrubs otherwise required in the buffer yard. 
3.  Existing Vegetation. The berm or planting requirements may be waived or modified by the reviewing authority if existing vegetation will provide an equal or greater screen than that required by Table 17. If existing vegetation is removed or damaged during construction, buffer plantings shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Table 17. 
4.  Earth berms required under this ordinance shall consist of raised earth with side slopes of 3:1 or flatter with a four-foot-wide flat or slightly rounded crest contoured to the side slopes to facilitate maintenance. Berms shall be covered with grass or other ground cover to prevent erosion. 
C.  Required Buffer Types. The following Table 20 identifies required buffer types.

SECTION 138-12.301 - Parking Lot Landscaping 
The development of land for parking lot purposes alters natural topography, disturbs existing vegetation and creates impervious surface, all of which can have a negative effect on the ecological balance of an area by causing increases in air temperature and accelerating the processes of runoff, erosion, and sedimentation. Recognizing that the preservation or installation of vegetative cover in parking lots promotes the health, safety and general welfare by aiding in the stabilization of the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the process of air purification, ground water recharge, and stormwater runoff retardation while at the same time aiding in noise, glare and heat abatement, the following requirements for the landscaping of parking and outdoor display areas are enacted: 
A.  Interior Landscaping. Interior landscaping shall be provided within the boundaries of the parking lot unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission. If interior landscaping is provided along the perimeter of the parking lot, it shall be in addition to the perimeter landscaping requirements. 
1.  Interior landscaping areas equivalent to five percent of the vehicle use area shall be required in all parking lots of 20 spaces or more. One deciduous shade tree shall be required for each 150 square feet of required interior landscape area. The vehicle use area includes all areas used for vehicular circulation and parking. 
2.  Terminal landscape islands shall be provided at the end of each row of parking spaces to separate parking from adjacent drive aisles. Terminal islands shall be curbed, and shall be at least 144 square feet in area and 18 feet long for each single row of parking spaces. Each landscape island shall have a minimum of one shade tree. The Planning Commission may waive the requirement for terminal landscape islands in the interest of meeting barrier-free requirements. 
3.  Interior landscape islands shall have a minimum area of 160 square feet and a minimum width of eight feet (measured from the back of curb). Each landscape island shall have a minimum of one deciduous shade tree unless waived by the reviewing authority consistent with Section 138-12.308. 
4.  Parking lot divider medians with a minimum width of eight feet (measured from the back of curb) may be used to meet interior landscape requirements and shall form a continuous strip between abutting rows of parking. One shade tree or two ornamental trees shall be required for each 25 lineal feet of divider median or fraction thereof. Shrubs shall be planted to form a continuous hedge the full length of divider medians which separate parking areas from access drives. 
5.  Two feet of interior landscape areas (except parking lot divider medians) may be part of each parking space required by Section 138-11.204 of this ordinance. Wheel stops or curbing shall be installed to prevent vehicles from encroaching more than two feet into any interior landscaped area. If a landscape area is used for parking overhang, at least two feet of clear area planted with lawn or covered with mulch shall be provided where cars will overhang the curb to protect landscape plantings from damage. 
B.  Perimeter Landscaping. Perimeter landscaping shall be provided along the edge of any parking lot facing and located 100 feet of a public right-of-way, unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the parking lot will be sufficiently screened from view by buildings or other site features or improvements. Parking lot perimeter landscaping shall comply with the following standards: 
1.  Perimeter parking lot landscaping shall include a minimum of one deciduous shade tree per each 25 linear feet or fraction thereof and one ornamental tree per each 35 linear feet or fraction thereof. 
2.  Wherever a parking lot or vehicle parking space is located within 30 feet of a public street or right-of-way, the perimeter landscaping shall also include a continuous hedge of deciduous or upright evergreen shrubs planted not more than 30 inches on center between the parking area and the street. 
C.  Curbing Required. All landscaping and perimeter screening shall be protected from vehicle encroachment with concrete curbing or similar permanent means. 
D.  Snow storage area. Adequate snow storage area shall be provided within the site. Plant materials in snow storage areas shall be hardy, salt-tolerant groundcovers characterized by low maintenance requirements.  
SECTION 138-12.302 - Loading, Storage, and Service Area Screening 
Storage and loading areas are subject to the requirements of Section 138-4.430, and dumpsters and trash storage areas are subject to the requirements of Section 138-10.311. 
( Ord. No. 581, § 4, 11-11-2013 )  
SECTION 138-12.303 - Stormwater Management Pond Landscaping 
Where any pond, retention basin, detention basin, or other constructed stormwater management facility is required, it shall comply with the following requirements: 
A.  Basin configurations shall be incorporated into the natural topography to the greatest extent possible. Where this is not practical, the basin shall be shaped to emulate a naturally formed or free form depression. The basin edge shall consist of sculptured landforms to filter and soften views of the basin. 
B.  Basins shall be designed to avoid the need for perimeter fencing. Where such fencing is necessary, the location and design shall be subject to Planning Commission approval. 
C.  Basins shall be planted with a mixture of groundcover and wetland-based plantings native to Michigan, such as native grasses or wildflowers. 
D.  A Type A perimeter greenbelt buffer shall be provided in accordance with Section 138-12.300 (Buffer Requirements) and the following: 
1.  Plantings shall be clustered around the basin to achieve a variety of plant materials and to replicate a natural environment. Deciduous shade trees should be clustered around the south and west sides of the basin to provide shade and minimize solar heating of the water. 
2.  Trees shall be planted above the freeboard line of the basin. Any plantings proposed below the freeboard line shall be tolerant of wet or moist soil conditions. The location of plant materials shall take into consideration the need to provide access for routine basin maintenance. 
( Ord. No. 581, § 8, 11-11-2013 )  
SECTION 138-12.304 - Right-of-Way Landscaping 
Public rights-of-way and other public open-space areas adjacent to required landscaped areas and development sites shall be landscaped in a manner that enhances the visual character of City streets and minimizes adverse impacts of vehicular traffic on adjacent uses. Right-of-way landscaping shall be subject to the following: 
A.  Street trees. Street tree plantings shall be required for all development projects adjacent to or along the margins of street rights-of-way in the City, subject to the following: 
1.  Street trees shall consist of deciduous shade trees planted at a minimum concentration of one street tree per 35 linear feet of right-of-way. Required trees may be planted at regular intervals or in groupings. 
2.  Existing trees in good condition and of a desirable species located near or within street rights-of-way shall be preserved where feasible, and be counted toward the street tree planting requirement should the existing trees be 4 inches in caliper or greater. 
3.  Permits may be required by the Road Commission for Oakland County or Michigan Department of Transportation for installation of street trees within rights-of-way under their jurisdiction. Where such plantings are not permitted within a street right-of-way, required street trees shall be planted within the front yard setback area, or at an alternative location approved by the City. 
B.  Ornamental trees. Ornamental trees shall be required along street frontages for all development projects in the City. One ornamental tree shall be planted for every 35 lineal feet of right-of-way frontage. Ornamental trees may be clustered or planted at regular intervals. 
C.  Groundcover plantings within street rights-of-way. Street rights-of-way shall be irrigated and sodded with lawn grasses. 
D.  Maintenance of right-of-way landscaping. Right-of-way landscaping shall be maintained by the owner of the abutting lot(s), including any irrigation of the right-of-way.

SECTION 138-12.306 - Entranceway Landscaping 
In all R Districts, so called entranceway structures, including but not limited to walls, columns, gates, and landscaping that mark entrances to single-family subdivisions or multiple housing projects may be permitted and may be located in a required yard, except as provided in Section 138-5.204 (Corner Clearance), provided that such entranceways shall comply to all codes and ordinances of the City of Rochester Hills and shall be approved by the City. Entranceway landscape areas shall be located in established landscape easements and may not be part of any individual lot.  
SECTION 138-12.307 - Modification of Landscape Requirements 
Recognizing that a wide variety of land uses and the relationships between them can exist, and that varying circumstances can mitigate the need for landscaping, the Planning Commission may reduce or waive the screening and buffer zone requirements of this Article 12 and approve an alternative screening plan. The Planning Commission shall find that the following standards have been met whenever it modifies any landscaping requirement: 
A.  The landscape/screening plan shall protect the character of new and existing residential neighborhoods against negative impacts such as noise, glare, light, air pollution, trash and debris, and hazardous activities. 
B.  The alternate width and type of buffer zone and screening provided therein will ensure compatibility with surrounding and nearby land uses because: 
1.  The development is compatible with and sensitive to the immediate environment of the site and neighborhood relative to architectural design, scale, bulk, building height, identified historical character, disposition and orientation of buildings on the lot and visual integrity. 
2.  The site has natural existing vegetation and/or topography, natural bodies of water or wetland areas or other existing conditions which offer screening consistent with the standards set forth in this Article 12. The Planning Commission shall require the preservation of these natural features as a condition of site plan approval. 
3.  The arrangement, design and orientation of buildings on the site maximize privacy and isolate adjacent and nearby land uses from any potential negative impacts of the project.  
SECTION 138-12.308 - Waiver of Requirements 
The Planning Commission or official approving the landscape and irrigation plans may waive or reduce the requirements of this division upon determining that the following would apply: 
A.  The purpose of this Article cannot be met; and 
B.  Compliance with the requirements would impose a practical difficulty on the applicant or would create safety hazards to pedestrians or motorists. 
C.  Safeguard the public health, safety and welfare, and preserve the aesthetic qualities and enhance the community character.
