Mailbox Policy for the Municipality of Wilton



For convenience and practicality, mailbox installations have been allowed within the right-of-way of Maineโs public highways; however it is important to recognize that such installations have two very important conditions:

1)	The mailbox must be installed in accordance with applicable standards to ensure that mail can be delivered and that the mailbox does not create an obstacle or safety hazard to those that use or maintain the highway, and

2)	The mailbox is installed entirely at the ownerโs risk. In other words, if the mailbox incurs damage during any sort of highway operations or maintenance, the property owner is not entitled to replacement or compensation. In fact, if the mailbox was not installed in accordance with the applicable standards as stated above, the owner may even be held liable for injuries or damages that may have been incurred as a result.

Mailbox design and installation standards are available from several sources, and mailbox owners are expected to consult this information prior to undertaking any mailbox installation or replacement. The following standards have nationwide relevance and were developed in cooperation with one another:

โข	The United States Postal Service (USPS) Mailbox Guidelines. The USPS defines the standards for mailbox construction, as well as the placement tolerance that must be met to accommodate postal operations. Specifics may be obtained from your local post office or online at: https://www.usps.com/manage/know-mailbox- guidelines.htm?

โข	American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Roadside Design Guide. The AASHTO Roadside Design Guide, Chapter 11: Erecting Mailboxes on Streets and Highways deals with the safety and construction of privately owned mailboxes, mailbox supports, and mailbox turnout designs and is less focused on postal operations. This publication may be obtained online through the AASHTO Bookstore at: https://bookstore.transportation.org/Item_details.aspx?id=1807

This municipality has developed this policy to promote compliance with these national standards and to help further clarify the expectations and responsibilities of Maine mailbox owners to improve the safety of our roads. The following pages further specify the details associated with the mailbox height, location, offset, and post type to minimize the potential hazards associated with mailbox installations and to reduce the opportunities for damage to mailboxes.
 

Mailbox Installation Standards

General Location:

Whenever possible, your mailbox should be located after your driveway opening. This location placement improves visibility, minimizes the amount of snow that comes off of the snow plow, and improves the approach for your mail carrier. The diagram below further clarifies this preferred placement:

 



Mailbox Support Design:

It is best to use an extended arm type of post with a free-swinging suspended mailbox. This allows snowplows to sweep near or under boxes without damage to supports and provides easy access to the boxes by carrier and customers. The following picture shows a free-swinging suspended mailbox:
 
Offset:
 


Mailboxes should be set back from the edge of the shoulder โ regardless of whether the
 
shoulder is gravel or paved. In other words, the face of the mailbox should be at least one foot (1โ) back from the edge of the normally plowed surface of the highway or the face of curb. Greater offset distances are encouraged whenever possible to allow the mail carrier to get further out of traffic and to further minimize potential damage to your mailbox. The following picture shows a mailbox with a reasonable offset:

























Height:
According to USPS standards, a mailbox must be installed with the bottom of the
mailbox located between 41โ and 45โ high above the surface of the highway shoulder. We recommend that this height be closer to the 45โ measurement to minimize conflict with the height of the plow truck wing when snow is being pushed back during, or between, winter storms. The following picture further clarifies the height considerations:

 
 
Post Size, Type and Embedment:

Mailbox posts must be sturdy enough to hold up the mailbox in all types of weather conditions, however they cannot be so rugged that they present a hazard to vehicles that inadvertently leave the road. If a mailbox support is struck by a vehicle, it must easily break away. Therefore, the following types of posts are deemed acceptable:
โข	4โ x 4โ wooden posts embedded 2 feet into the ground. Larger wooden posts may be used only if the post is drilled through with an appropriate spade bit to create a shear plane that is no higher than 6โ above the surface of the surrounding ground. The number and size of the drilled holes depends upon what is necessary to bring the cross- section of the larger post down to the equivalent cross-sectional area of a standard 4โ x 4โ post. (MaineDOT Standard Specification 606.06)
โข	1โ to 2โ round diameter steel or aluminum pipe or standard U-channel post embedded 2 feet into the ground.
โข	Unacceptable mailbox supports include: anything that is filled with concrete, masonry and stone structures, heavy steel structures, and most objects that were intended for other uses (e.g. antique plows, I-beams, and various other household tools and objects).

NOTICE: Mailboxes, attachments or support systems not consistent with this policy are considered โDeadly Fixed Objectsโ (aka. โDFOsโ) and are in violation of 23 MRSA ยง1401- A on state and state aid roads. On local roads, they can be considered as โobstructionsโ and a number of statutes relate to these obstructions. As such, when these installations are recognized by the municipality, the owner will be informed of the hazard and immediate removal will be requested. If the property owner does not comply with this request, the municipality may elect to remove the installation and seek reimbursement from the property owner for all costs incurred.

10.13	Open Space Subdivisions

1.	It is the policy of the Town of Wilton to encourage the development of open space subdivisions in order to preserve a sense of space, provide for agricultural, forestry, and recreational land uses, preserve other resources identified in the Town of Wilton Comprehensive Plan, and blend new development with the traditional open and  wooded, agricultural and village landscapes of Wilton.
This standard is intended to implement that policy by providing incentives that afford flexibility in road and lot layout and design and road frontage requirements to the landowner. It also allows the Board to waive or reduce certain otherwise applicable standards and provisions of this Ordinance and the Town of Wilton Zoning Ordinance if such landowners commit to the permanent preservation of important open space resources. These incentives are designed to encourage greater flexibility and more innovative approaches to housing development and environmental design which
will promote the most appropriate use of land, preservation of permanent open space, agricultural or forest land, important natural features, wildlife habitat, water resources, ecological systems, and historic and scenic areas for the benefit of present and future residents will be accomplished.

2.	An open space subdivision achieves the purposes of this performance standard by reducing the lot size, frontage and setback requirements as contained in the Town of Wilton Zoning Ordinance. It locates housing and accompanying uses in those areas where they have the smallest impact on identified environmental, wildlife, agricultural, forest, and other open space resources. These resources are then permanently preserved by the use of covenants and restrictions or conservation easements.
To qualify as an open space subdivision, a subdivision must achieve those of the following purposes that the Board determines to be applicable to its specific circumstances:
a.	Long-term protection and preservation of existing natural and other resources and landscapes identified in the Town of Wilton Comprehensive Plan, including, but not limited to:
i. State-defined critical areas and unique features and areas identified in the Comprehensive Plan;
ii Historic land use patterns and historic structures;
 
iii.	Points of visual access to or from water bodies and scenic vistas as identified in the Comprehensive Plan and points of access to water bodies;
iv.	Forest land
v.	Agricultural land
vi.	Wildlife habitat
b.	Maintenance or establishment of compatibility with surrounding land uses and the overall character of the town as defined by the comprehensive plan;
c.	Provision of adequate buffers for adjoining properties where needed;
d.	Contribution to town wide open space planning by creating a system of permanently preserved open spaces throughout the town and encouraging linkage of open space areas.
e.	Preservation of land suitable for agricultural and forestry uses, particularly where the open space subdivision borders active agricultural or forestry land or land suitable for the same;
f.	Preservation of traditional land uses;
g.	Provision for recreation facilities, including active and passive recreational space, in the most suitable locations for use consistent with the other purposes of this performance standard.

3.	An individual may apply for approval of an open space subdivision either after pre application review of a conventional subdivision or by initially filing an application for an open space subdivision. In either case, the Board shall review the application in accordance with Title 30-A M.R.S.A. Section 4404 and this Ordinance.
a.	Pre-application Procedure
i.	Any applicant for a subdivision with open space is encouraged, but not required, to submit at the pre-application stage a complete build out plan for the entire parcel.
ii.	After review of the pre-application, if the Board determines that the proposed subdivision with open space meets the purposes set forth in subparagraph 2.a.i-vi which are applicable to the proposed subdivision as well as other applicable provisions of this subsection, this Ordinance, the zoning ordinance and the comprehensive plan, the  Board shall permit the applicant to proceed with an application for an open space subdivision.
b.	Application Procedure
i. Required Plans: The submissions for a subdivision with open space shall include all plans and materials required for a conventional subdivision under this Ordinance.
c.	General Requirements
In Board review and approval of a subdivision with open space, the following requirements shall apply and shall supersede any inconsistent or more restrictive provisions of this Ordinance and the zoning ordinance.
i.	Use and District Requirements
(a) All subdivisions with open space shall meet the use standards of the districts in which they are located.
ii.	A lot for a dwelling unit created as part of a subdivision with open space shall not be further subdivided.

4.	Layout and Siting Standards
 
In planning the location and sitting of residential structures in a subdivision with open space, priority should be given to the preservation of the open space for its natural resource value. Human habitation activity located and sited on the least valuable natural resource portion of a parcel, taking into account the contours of the land and the steepness of slopes. The building lots on a parcel shall be laid out and the residential structures shall be sited according to the following principles. The Board in its discretion shall resolve conflicts between these principles as applied to a particular site.
a.	Upon soils least suitable for agricultural use and in a manner which maximizes the useable area remaining for the designated open space use. Where agricultural, forestry, or recreational, whether existing or future uses, are particularly targeted for  preservation;
b.	Within woodlands, or along the far edges of open agricultural fields adjacent to any woodland in order to reduce encroachment upon agricultural soils and to enable new residential development to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features;
c.	In such manner that the boundaries between residential lots and active agricultural use, commercial forest land, and/or wildlife habitat are well-buffered by vegetation, topography, roads or other barriers in order to minimize potential conflict between residential and agricultural and forestry uses;
d.	In locations where buildings may be oriented with respect to scenic vistas, natural landscape features, topography and natural drainage areas, in accordance with an overall plan for site development;

5.	Space Standards
a.	Shore frontage and shore setback requirements shall not be reduced below the minimum shore frontage or shore setback required in the Town of Wilton Zoning Ordinance.
b.	The required minimum land area per dwelling unit for the building envelope may be reduced to 20,000 square feet. The building envelope shall contain a minimum of  20,000 square feet of land area which does not include 100 year floodplains, areas of two or more acres of sustained slopes greater than 20 percent, or wetlands as defined by the Natural Resource Protection Act. If the lot area is reduced, the total open space  in the development shall equal or exceed the sum of the areas by which the building lots are reduced below the minimum lot area normally required in the district.
c.	Minimum road frontage requirements contained in the zoning ordinance may be waived or modified by the Board provided that:
I.	Any applicable provisions regarding roads in Subsection 7. below are satisfied; and
ii. Adequate access and turn-around to and from all parcels by emergency vehicles can be ensured by private roads and/or common driveways.
d.	A reduction of required setback distances may be allowed at the discretion of the Board, based upon the public benefits to be achieved from the design,
provided that the front and rear setbacks shall be no less than 25 feet, or that required for the applicable district, whichever shall be less. For the perimeter of an open space development, overall development setback shall not be reduced below the minimum front, side and rear setbacks required in the zoning district unless the Board determines that a more effective design of the project can better accomplish the purposes of this performance standard.
 

6.	Utilities
At the discretion of the Board, in order to achieve the most appropriate design and layout of lots and open space, utilities, including individual wells and septic systems, may be located on designated portions of the open space, if necessary, provided they shall not unreasonably interfere with the open space purposes or uses to be achieved under this section and for the particular parcel(s).

2.1	Definition
 
ARTICLE 2.	NONCONFORMANCE
(Amended 6/18/2007 and 6/16/2008)
 

Any lot, building, structure, use of land or portion thereof, existing at the effective date of adoption of, or any amendment to, this Ordinance, which as a result of the adoption or amendment to this Ordinance does not conform with one or more of the applicable provisions of this Ordinance, shall be considered lawfully nonconforming.

2.2	Land Use Requirements

Except as hereinafter specified, no building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, expanded, moved or altered and no new lot shall be created or existing lot altered except in conformity with all of the provisions of this Ordinance and the regulations herein specified for the district in  which it is located, unless a variance is granted.

2.3	Nonconformance

A.	Purpose
It is the intent of this Ordinance to promote land use conformities, except that lawfully nonconforming conditions that existed before the effective date of this Ordinance or an amendment to this Ordinance shall be allowed to continue, subject to the requirements set forth  in this section. Except as otherwise provided by this Ordinance, a nonconforming condition shall not be permitted to become more nonconforming.

B.	General
1.	Transfer of Ownership. Nonconforming structures, lots and uses may be transferred, and the new owner may continue the nonconforming use or continue to use the nonconforming structure or lot, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance.
2.	Repair and Maintenance. This Ordinance allows, without a permit, the normal upkeep and maintenance of nonconforming uses and structures including repairs or renovations which do not involve expansion of the nonconforming use or structure, and such other changes in a nonconforming use or structure as federal, state or local building codes may require.

C.	Nonconforming Structures
1.	Expansions. A nonconforming structure may be added to or expanded after obtaining a permit from the same permitting authority as that for a new structure, if such addition or expansion does not increase the nonconformity of the structure and is in accordance with subparagraphs (a) and (b) below.

a.	After January 1, 1989, if any portion of a structure is less than any required setback that portion of the structure shall not be expanded, as measured in floor area or
 
volume, by 30 percent or more, during the lifetime of the structure. If a replacement structure conforms to the requirements of Section 2.3.C.3, and is less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream or wetland, the replacement structure may not be expanded if the original structure existing on January 1, 1989 had been expanded by 30% in floor area or volume since that date.

b.	When a new, enlarged or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming structure, the new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board, basing its decision on the criteria specified in subsection 2, โRelocation,โ below, and the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure, except for expansions in conformity with Section 2.3.C.1.a above. In addition in shoreland areas (1) the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three additional feet, as measured from the uphill side of the structure (from the original ground level to the bottom of the first floor sill), it shall not be considered as an expansion of the structure; (2) there is less than 5 feet between the finished basement floor and the bottom of the first floor joists; and (3) the basement area is used exclusively for storage or mechanical purposes, and not for habitation.

2.	Relocation. A nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located, provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board, and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of State law and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules (Rules), or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said Rules. In no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming.

In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent, the Planning Board shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties, the location of the septic system and other on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation. When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure, the Planning Board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In addition, the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation. Replanting shall be required as follows:

a)	Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree, three (3) feet in height, for every tree removed. If more than five trees are planted, no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted. Replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed.
 
b)	Other woody and herbaceous vegetation, and ground cover, that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be re-established. An area at least the same size as the area where vegetation and/or ground cover was disturbed, damaged, or removed must be reestablished within the setback area. The vegetation and/or ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or ground cover that was disturbed, destroyed or removed.

c)	Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof.

3. Reconstruction or Replacement. Any nonconforming structure which is removed, or which is damaged or destroyed, regardless of the cause, by more than 50 percent of the market value of the structure before such removal or damage, may be reconstructed or replaced provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board in accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance, and provided a permit is obtained for the reconstruction or replacement within eighteen months of said damage, destruction, or removal. In no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity. If the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure, except as allowed pursuant to Section 2.3.C.1 above, as determined by the non-conforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location. If the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area, no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure. When it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with Section
2.3.C.2 above.

If any such structure is located within a floodplain along a river or other waterbody identified by the 100-year floodplain as designated on the Federal Emergency Management Agencyโs (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, such structure shall be reconstructed only in compliance with the standards of the Floodplain Management Ordinance for the Town of Wilton.

Any nonconforming structure which is damaged or destroyed by 50 percent or less of the market value of the structure, excluding normal maintenance and repair, may be reconstructed in place with a permit, from the Code Enforcement Officer.

In determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance to the greatest practical extent, the Planning Board shall consider in addition to the criteria in Paragraph 2 above, the physical condition and type of foundation present, if any.

4.  Change of Use of a Nonconforming Structure. The use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the Planning Board after receiving a written
 
application determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on any adjacent water body, tributary stream or wetland, or on the subject or adjacent properties and resources, than the existing use.

In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the Planning Board shall require written documentation from the applicant, regarding the probable effects on wildlife habitat, vegetative cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural beauty, floodplain management, archaeological and historic resources and functionally water-dependent uses.

D.	Nonconforming Uses
1.	Expansion of nonconforming uses outside of the shoreland zone may be allowed provided the Planning Board after reviewing written application determines that no greater adverse impacts would occur as the result of the expansion as defined below. In the shoreland zone, only expansions of non-conforming residential uses are permitted, in accordance with the 30% expansion limitation in Article 2, section 2.3.c.1.a.

a.	The expansion of a nonconforming use will be in accordance with any applicable Performance Standards set forth in Article 5 and 6, Site Plan Review Standards.
b.	The expansions of the nonconforming use will not encroach further on the required setbacks.
c.	The proposed expansion is of the same character or less noxious than the current nonconforming use.
d.	The expansion use will not create a traffic hazard nor increase an existing traffic hazard.
e.	That the amount of parking required to meet the minimum requirements for the proposed use exists on the site or will be otherwise provided in Ordinance.
f.	The amount of noise, odors, vibrations, smoke, dust and air discharges of the proposed expansion shall be equal to or less than the present use.
g.	The hours of operation of the proposed expansion will be compatible with the existing, surrounding land uses.

2.	Resumption Prohibited. A lot, building or structure in or on which a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding one year, or which is superseded by a conforming use, may not again be devoted to a nonconforming use except that the Planning Board may, for good cause shown by the applicant, grant a single extension, of up to one year of that time period where the application for extension is made before expiration of the original one-year period. This provision shall not apply to prohibit the resumption of use of a residential structure for residential purposes provided that the structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes at any time during the preceding five (5) year period.

3.	Change of Use. An existing nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the proposed use has no greater adverse impact on the subject and adjacent properties and resources than the former use, as determined by the Planning Board. The determination of no greater adverse impact shall be made according to the criteria listed in Section 2.3.(c).(4) above.
 

E.	Nonconforming Lots
1.	Lots of Record. A single lot of record which at the time of first recording of its legal description in the Franklin County Registry of Deeds met all minimum lot frontage and lot area requirements then applicable, but subsequently has become non-conforming as to minimum lot frontage or lot area as a result of the passage of this Ordinance or any amendment to this Ordinance, may be built upon, without the need for a variance, provided that such lot is not owned by the same person or persons as any other contiguous lot and provided that all other requirements of this Ordinance are met. Relief from the requirements of this Ordinance other than lot frontage or lot area may be granted only by variance from the Board of Appeals in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.

2.	Merger of Lots (a) If two or more contiguous lots are owned by the same person(s), and if any of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot frontage or lot area established by this Ordinance, the lots shall be merged to the extent necessary to create a lot or lots which comply with the lot frontage and lot area requirements of this Ordinance, and no portion of the lots so merged which does not meet the lot area or lot frontage  requirements of this Ordinance may be built upon, or may be sold if such sale would result in separate ownership of the non-conforming portion. (b) This section 2.3 (E)(2) shall require merger only of (i) unimproved lots with one another and (ii) unimproved  lots with lots which are separately improved with a principal structure. As used in this subsection, the term โunimproved lotโ includes any lot which does not contain a principal structure.

3.	Division of Single Lots Containing More Than One Principal Structure. Where a single lot of record contains more than one principal structure, each of which at the time of its construction complied with any applicable dimensional requirements, the lot may be divided and each principal structure may be conveyed separately upon approval by the Codes Enforcement Officer of a plot plan which complies to the fullest extent possible with the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, provided such dividing and conveyance comply with all other applicable local ordinances and State law.

4.	Nonconforming lots in the Shore land Zone. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraphs 1 through 3 above, any lot in the Shore land Zone which is not served by public sewer and has less than 20,000 square feet of lot area or less than 100 feet of shore land frontage is subject to the following restrictions:

a.	no conversions from seasonal dwellings (as defined in 30-A M.R.S.A. section 4201(4)) to year-round dwellings are allowed.
b.	no new year-round dwellings are allowed.

4.1	Resource Protection Zone

A.	Purpose
1.	To protect the most vulnerable shore land areas along with other areas in which development would adversely affect water quality, productive habitat, biological ecosystems, or scenic and natural values, and to discourage development in unsafe and unhealthful areas. The Resource Protection Zone may include areas located outside the Shore land Zone. The Resource Protection Zone may include but is not limited to:

a.	Wetlands, swamps, and bogs;
b.	Floodplains to the extent of the 100 year flood designation on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard  Boundary Maps; or other floodplains as mapped by the Town and depicted on the Zoning Map.
c.	Slopes subject to severe natural erosion or on which erosion would be expected to be severe as the result of human activities;
d.	Areas designated as having special historic or scenic or natural significance;
e.	Areas within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of freshwater wetlands, and wetlands associated with great ponds and rivers, which are rated โmoderateโ or โhighโ value waterfowl and wading bird habitat, including nesting and feeding areas by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIF&W) that are depicted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) data layer maintained by either MDIF&W or the Department as of May 1, 2006 or as subsequently adopted.  For the
 
purposes of this paragraph โwetlands associated with great ponds and riversโ shall mean areas characterized by non-forested wetland vegetation and hydric soils that are contiguous with a great pond or river, and have a surface elevation at or below the water level of the  great pond or river  during the  period of  normal high water. โWetlands associated with great ponds or riversโ are considered to be part of that great pond or river.
f.	Areas of two or more contiguous acres with sustained slopes of 20 percent or greater that are located in the shore land zone as defined herein; and
g.	Land areas along rivers subject to severe bank erosion, undercutting or river bed movements.
h.	Areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres supporting wetland vegetation and hydric soils, which are not part of a freshwater wetland as defined, and which are not surficially connected to a water body during the period of normal high water.



B.	Specific Performance Standards
The provisions contained in Section 4.8 governing the Varnum Pond Watershed Overlay District apply if the property is also located in said District.

C.	Special Permit for Single Family Residence
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.0.A and Table A, excepting structure setback requirements the Planning Board may issue a special permit for construction of a single family residence in the Resource Protection Zone if the applicant demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
1.	There is no location on the property, other than a location within the Resource Protection Zone, where the structure can be built.
2.	The lot on which the structure is proposed is undeveloped and was established and recorded in the Franklin County Registry of Deeds before the adoption of the Resource Protection Zone.
3.	All proposed buildings, sewage disposal systems and other improvements are:

(a)	Located on natural ground slopes of less than 20% and
(b)	Located outside the floodway of the 100-year floodplain along rivers and artificially formed great ponds along rivers based on detailed flood insurance studies and as delineated on the Federal Emergency Management Agencyโs Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Insurance Rate Maps; all buildings, including basements, are elevated at least one foot above the 100-year floodplain elevation; and the development is otherwise in compliance with the Floodplain Management Ordinance for the Town of Wilton. If the floodway is not shown on the Federal Emergency Management Agency maps, it is deemed to be ยฝ the  width of the 100-year floodplain. For purposes of this subparagraph, โfloodwayโ means the channel of a river or other watercourse and adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the 100-year flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot in height.

4.	The total ground-floor area, including cantilevering or similar overhanging extensions of all principal and accessory structures is limited to a maximum of 1,500 square feet.
 
This limitation shall not be altered by variance.
5.	All structures, except functionally water-dependent structures, are set back from the normal high-water line of a waterbody, tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland to the greatest practical extent, but not less than 75 feet, horizontal distance. In determining the greatest practical extent, the planning board shall consider the depth of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the type and amount of vegetation to be removed, the proposed building siteโs elevation in regard to the floodplain and its proximity to moderate-value and high-value wetlands.

ARTICLE 6.	SITE PLAN REVIEW

6.1	Purpose

Large scale development or major land use change can have a profound effect upon the cost and efficiency of municipal services and upon the environment of the Town of Wilton. The regulations and standards contained within the provisions of this Ordinance are sufficient to advance those objectives and to protect the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the citizens of the Town of Wilton where development involves only the construction of single and two-family dwellings and agricultural buildings; but those regulations need to be supplemented when development involves commercial, retail, industrial, institutional uses or multiple family residential developments.

6.2	Applicability

A.	This Article shall apply to, and site plan review and approval shall be required for, all development proposals for new construction, alterations or change in use to existing commercial, retail, industrial, institutional, recreational uses and structures, multi-family dwellings, topsoil removal and mining activities, their accessory uses and structures and all structures, uses and activities requiring Planning Board review under Table A.

B.	This Article does not apply to detached single or two-family dwelling units, the normal and customary practices involved with forestry and timber management and traditional agricultural operations.

C.	All proposed residential and commercial subdivisions shall be reviewed under the standards and criteria of the Town of Wilton Subdivision Ordinance.

6.3	Administration

A.	The following procedures and requirements shall apply to all applications for site plan review:

1.	All applications for site plan review shall be made in writing to the Code Enforcement Officer on the forms provided for this purpose. The application shall be made by the owner of the property or business or his agent as designated in writing by the owner, and shall be accompanied by the payment of an application fee pursuant to Section 7.3.A.

Any new occupancy of a business into a building location that has been previously approved for a site plan review by the Planning Board is required to apply for an occupancy permit to be reviewed by the Planning Board accompanied by the payment of an application fee pursuant to Section 7.3.A.

The completed application for site plan review, together with the documentation required in these regulations, shall be placed on the Planning Boardโs agenda for consideration
 
within thirty (30) days of its receipt. However, any application which is determined by  the Code Enforcement Officer to be incomplete shall not be placed on the agenda but  shall be returned to the applicant by the Code Enforcement Officer with an indication of the additional information required. Within sixty (60) days of the receipt of a completed application, the Board shall act to approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the site plan as submitted or amended. Prior to taking final action on any site plan review application, the Planning Board may hold a hearing to afford the public the opportunity to comment on the application.

2.	Abutting property owners shall be notified by mail of a pending application for site plan review. This notice shall indicate the time, date, and place of Planning Board consideration of the application. Failure of an abutter to receive notice does not invalidate Planning Board action on an application.

3.	One copy of the approved site plan shall be included in the application for a Building Permit.
4.	Prior to formal application, an owner or his authorized agent may request an informal review of the site plan by the Planning Board to determine its compliance with Town regulations.

C.	Administrative Appeals
To hear and decide administrative appeals, on an appellate basis, where it is alleged by an aggrieved party that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by, or failure to act by, the Planning Board in the administration of this Ordinance; and to hear and decide administrative appeals on a de novo basis where it is alleged by an aggrieved party that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by, or failure to act by, the Code Enforcement Officer in his or her review of and action on a permit application under this Ordinance. Any order, requirement, decision or determination made, or failure to act, in the enforcement of this ordinance is not appealable to the Board of Appeals.

When the Board of Appeals reviews a decision of the Code Enforcement Officer the Board of Appeals shall hold a โde novoโ hearing. At this time the Board may receive and consider new evidence and testimony, be it oral or written. When acting in a โde novoโ capacity the Board of Appeals shall hear and decide the matter afresh, undertaking its  own independent analysis of evidence and the law, and reaching its own decision.

When the Board of Appeals hears a decision of the Planning Board, it shall hold an appellate hearing, and may reverse the decision of the Planning Board only upon finding that the decision was contrary to specific provisions of the Ordinance or contrary to the facts presented to the Planning Board. The Board of Appeals may only review the record of the proceedings before the Planning Board. The Board Appeals shall not receive or consider any evidence which was not presented to the Planning Board, but the Board of Appeals may receive and consider written or oral arguments. If the Board of Appeals determines that the record of the Planning Board proceedings are inadequate, the Board
 
of Appeals may remand the matter to the Planning Board for additional fact finding.

D.	Variance Appeals
The Board of Appeals has the authority to hear and decide, upon appeal; in specific cases such a variance from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where; owing to the special conditions, literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in undue hardship. In granting any variance the Board of Appeals may prescribe conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this   Ordinance. The granting of a variance requires a majority vote of those Board of Appeals members present and voting, except that there must be a minimum of three (3) votes in favor of the variance.

As used in this Ordinance, โundue hardshipโ shall mean:
1.	That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted;
2.	That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
3.	That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality; and
4.	That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner.

E.	Setback Variance for Single Family Dwellings
The Board of Appeals may permit a variance from setback requirements for a single family dwelling which is the primary year-round residence of the applicant or its accessory structure(s) upon finding that strict application of the Ordinance to the applicantโs property would create undue hardship, defined for purposes of this subsection only as follows:

1.	the need for the variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
2.	the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality;
3.	the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner;
4.	the granting of the variance will not substantially reduce or impair the use of abutting property; and
5.	the granting of a variance is based upon demonstrated need, not convenience, and no other feasible alternative is available.

The Board may not grant a variance under this subsection if the result would be to exceed the maximum non-vegetated surface ratio allowed in the zoning district. Minimum setback from a water body or wetland may not be reduced under this subsection. Minimum front, side and rear setbacks may be reduced by more than 20% under this subsection only if the applicant has obtained the written consent of any affected abutting landowner.

F.	Disability Variance
(Amended 6/16/2014)
 
Notwithstanding Section 7.8.D.1-4 above, the Code Enforcement Officer may grant a variance to an owner of a residential dwelling for the purpose of making that dwelling accessible to a person with a disability who resides in or regularly uses the dwelling. The Code Enforcement Officer shall restrict any variance granted under this subsection solely to the installation of equipment or the construction of structures necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling by the person with the disability. The Code Enforcement Officer may impose conditions on the variance, including limiting the variance to the duration of the disability or to the time that the person with the disability lives in the dwelling. The term โstructures necessary for access to or egress from the dwellingโ shall include ramps and associated railings, wall or roof systems necessary  for the safety or effectiveness of the ramps.

G.	Public Hearings
For appeals from the decision of the Code Enforcement Officer or Planning Board, or appeals for a variance, and for the consideration of applications for permits requiring approval of the Board, the Board shall hold a public hearing as prescribed, herein:
1.	At least seven days before the public hearing, the Town Clerk shall cause notice to be published in a locally distributed newspaper and posted in a conspicuous place, which notice shall indicate the property involved, the nature of the appeal, and the time and place of the public hearing.
2.	The Town Clerk shall forthwith notify by mail the owners of all property within 500 feet of the property for which the appeal or application is made. Failure to receive this notice shall not invalidate the proceeding herein prescribed. The owners of properties shall be considered to be the parties listed by the Board of Assessors as against whom the taxes are assessed.
3.	The Code Enforcement Officer and the Chairman of the Planning Board, unless prevented by illness or absence from the State, shall attend all hearings and shall present to the Board, all plans, photographs, or other factual materials which are appropriate to an understanding of the case.
4.	The Board of Appeals shall not continue hearings to a future date except for good cause.
5.	The Board of Appeals shall state the reasons and basis for its decision,  including a statement of the facts found and conclusions reached by the Board. Copies of written decisions of the Board of Appeals shall be given to the Planning Board, Code Enforcement Officer, and the municipal officers within seven (7) days of  the Boards decision.
6.	For appeals in the shoreland zone the Board shall cause written notice of its decision to be mailed or hand-delivered to the Department of Environmental Protection within seven (7) days of the Boardโs decision.

H.	Appeal Procedure

2.	Any appeal to the Board of Appeals must be filed within 30 days of the date of the decision of the Code Enforcement Officer or Planning Board. The appellant shall file an appeal at the office of the Town Clerk upon forms to be approved by the Board of Appeals. The appellant shall set forth on said forms, the grounds of his appeal and shall
 
refer to the specific provisions of the Zoning Ordinance involved. A fee shall be paid at the time of filing as established under Section 7.3.A.

Following the receipt of the appeal, the Town Clerk shall notify forthwith the Code Enforcement Officer and/or Planning Board and the Chairman of the Board of Appeals.

A copy of each variance request in the shoreland zone, including the application and all supporting information supplied by the applicant, shall be forwarded by the town clerk to the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection at least twenty (20) days prior to action by the Board of Appeals. Any comments received from the Commissioner prior to the action by the Board of Appeals shall be made part of the record and shall be taken into consideration by the Board of Appeals.

I.	Successive Appeals
After a decision has been made by the Board of Appeals, a new appeal involving the same matter shall not be entertained by the Board until one year shall have elapsed from the date of said decision, except that the Board may entertain a new appeal if the Chairman believes, that owing to a mistake of law or misunderstanding of fact, an injustice was done, or if he believes that a change has taken place in some essential aspect of the case, sufficient to warrant a reconsideration of the appeal.

J.	Further Appeal
An aggrieved party may appeal from the decision of the Board of Appeals to the Superior Court as provided by the laws of the State of Maine.

7.8	Violations

The Board of Selectmen, on notification by the Code Enforcement Officer, shall institute or cause to be instituted, in the name of the Town, any and all actions, legal and equitable, that may be appropriate or necessary for the enforcement of this Ordinance.
