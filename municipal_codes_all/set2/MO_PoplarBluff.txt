to commit an offense has conspired with another person or persons to
commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other
person or persons.

law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and
of his/her participation in it.

designate the processing or disposal facility to be utilized by persons
operating under Section 230.060 of this Chapter, but only if the safety,
health and welfare of the citizens of the City mandate such designation.
In making such decision, the City may consider the location, availability
and economic impact of the disposal facility.
B. Hazardous wastes are not addressed under these provisions and will
require special handling and shall be disposed of only in a manner
authorized by State regulations.
A. No persons shall engage in collecting, transporting, processing or

of any such license.
B. No such license shall be issued until and unless the applicant therefor,
in addition to all other requirements set forth, shall file and maintain
with the director evidence of a satisfactory vehicle liability insurance
policy, covering all vehicles to be operated by the applicant in such
business, in the amount of not less than three hundred thousand dollars

dollars ($500,000.00) with an umbrella policy covering personal injury
and property damage in an amount not less than one million dollars
($1,000,000.00). Such policy may be written to allow the first one

notified of such cancellation by the insurance carrier in writing not less
than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of such cancellation and

D. If the application shows that the applicant will collect, transport,
process or dispose of solid wastes without hazard to the public health or
damage to the environment and in conformity with the laws of the State
of Missouri and this Chapter, the director may issue the license
authorized by this Chapter. The City Council shall have the authority to
limit the number of licenses issued under this Section in order to
preserve the health, comfort, safety and welfare of the residents, to
promote energy conservation and to provide for collection and disposal
consistent with good solid waste management practices. In making
such limitation, the Council may take into consideration the economic
stability of any applicant, such applicant's history in business
operations and the applicant's experience in solid waste collection and
disposal or the lack thereof. The license shall be issued for a period of
one (1) year and each applicant shall pay a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00)
for each solid waste processing or disposal facility to be operated and a
fee of five dollars ($5.00) for each transportation vehicle to be used. If

equipment or mode of operation so as to bring the application within
the intent of this Chapter, the director shall notify the applicant in
writing setting forth the modification to be made and the time in which
it shall be done.
E. If the applicant does not make the modifications pursuant to the notice
in Section 230.060(D) within the time limit specified therein or if the
application does not clearly show that the collection, transportation,
processing or disposal of solid wastes will create no public health
hazard or be without harmful effects on the environment, the
application shall be denied and the applicant notified by the director, in
writing, stating the reason for such denial. Nothing in this Section shall
prejudice the right of the applicant to reapply after the rejection of his/
her application, provided that all aspects of the reapplication comply
with the provisions of this Chapter. Nothing in this Section shall prevent
the denial of a license should the total number of annual licenses
already issued jeopardize the health, safety and welfare of the citizens
as provided for in Section 230.060(D).

F. If, at any time during the twelve (12) month license period, the licensee
materially modifies business operations or the licensee's collection
vehicles do not meet the requirements of Section 230.040 of this
Chapter, the City Council may revoke such license and cause the
rebidding of solid waste collection services provided for in Section
230.090 hereof. No licenses authorized by this Chapter shall be
transferable from person to person without the prior written consent
and approval of the City Council.

and the rules and regulations authorized herein, the director is
authorized to inspect all phases of solid waste management within the

where such inspections reveal violation of this Chapter, the rules and
regulations authorized herein for the storage, collection,
transportation, processing or disposal of solid waste or the laws of the
State of Missouri, the director shall issue notice for each such violation,
stating therein the violation or violations found, the time and date and
the correct measure to be taken, together with the time in which such
corrections shall be made.
H. In all cases, when the corrective measures have not been taken within
the time specified, the director shall suspend or revoke the licenses
involved in the violation; however, in those cases where an extension of
time will permit correction and there is no public health hazard created
by the delay, one (1) extension of time, not to exceed the original time
period, may be given.
I. In the event a license is revoked and the person continues to operate,
the director may request the action of a court of law to enjoin the acts
and to enforce compliance with this Chapter or any rule or regulation
promulgated thereunder. In any such action, the court may grant to the
City such prohibitory or mandatory injunctive relief as the facts may
warrant.
J. Any person who feels aggrieved by any notice of violation or order
issued pursuant thereto of the director may, within ten (10) days of the
act for which redress is sought, appeal directly to the Circuit Court of
Butler County, Missouri, in writing, setting forth in a concise statement
the act being appealed and the grounds for its reversal. Essentially,
such writing and action shall be in accordance with Sections 536.063 et
seq., RSMo., and as may be amended from time to time.
K. All motor vehicles operating under any license required by this Chapter
shall display the licensee's number or numbers on each side in colors
which contrast with that of the vehicle, such numbers to be clearly
legible and not less than four (4) inches high. Each license issued for
processing or disposal facilities shall be prominently displayed at the

school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a
divided highway of four (4) or more lanes may pull off of the main
roadway and load or unload students without activating the mechanical
and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for
other drivers to stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert
motorists that the school bus is slowing to a stop; provided that the
passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner
which indicates that drivers should proceed with caution and, in such
case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the school bus with due
caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers
at any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of
traffic, whether or not divided by a median or barrier, in such manner as
to require the passengers to cross more than two (2) lanes of traffic; nor
shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is
upon the road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is
plainly visible for at least five hundred (500) feet in each direction to
drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder and a
speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three
hundred (300) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon
other highways, and on all highways, only for such time as is actually
necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
E. The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need
not stop upon meeting or overtaking a school bus which is on a different

financial responsibility as required in this Section which conforms to
the requirements of the laws of this State. No non-resident shall
operate or permit another person to operate in this State a motor
vehicle registered to such non-resident unless the non-resident
maintains the financial responsibility which conforms to the
requirements of the laws of the non-resident's State of residence.
Furthermore, no person shall operate a motor vehicle owned by another
with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained financial
responsibility unless such person has financial responsibility which
covers the person's operation of the other's vehicle. However, no owner
or non-resident shall be in violation of this Subsection if he/she fails to
maintain financial responsibility on a motor vehicle which is inoperable
or being stored and not in operation.
B. For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall
mean the ability to respond in damages for liability on account of
accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said financial
responsibility, arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a
motor vehicle, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars

3. A surety bond according to Section 303.230, RSMo.
D. Proof of financial responsibility shall be carried at all times in the
insured motor vehicle or by the operator of the motor vehicle if the
proof of financial responsibility is effective as to the operator rather
than to the vehicle. The operator of an insured motor vehicle shall
exhibit the insurance identification card on the demand of any Peace
Officer, commercial vehicle enforcement officer or commercial vehicle
inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident
while that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the
officer's or inspector's duties.
E. However, no person shall be found guilty of violating this Section if the
operator demonstrates to the court that he/she met the financial
responsibility requirements of Section 303.025, RSMo., at the time the
Peace Officer wrote the citation.
F. Any person who violates any provisions of this Section shall be guilty of
an ordinance violation and shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished
by a fine of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than three
hundred dollars ($300.00) for each and every violation.

General Provisions
Section 405.010. Title, Intent and Purpose. [R.O. 2007 App. B §1;
Ord. No. 3900 §1(1), 3-6-1972]
A. Title. These regulations may be referred to as the "zoning ordinance".
B. Intent And Purpose.
1. These regulations have been based upon the Comprehensive Plan
for the City of Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Said Comprehensive Plan
included estimates of population growth, a land use plan, plans for
major thoroughfares, community facilities and public services.
2. The regulations are intended to preserve and protect existing
property uses and values against adverse or unharmonious
adjacent uses.
3. The land use regulations divide the area into a number of zoning
districts.
a. In the past, residential neighborhoods have deteriorated
because they were invaded by small isolated commercial uses
and by more intensive residential uses such as duplexes or
apartment buildings. The great majority of our population
desires to and does live in single-family homes which they own
and which are located on fairly large lots. The regulations
establish residential districts particularly designed to provide
maximum protection for single-family homes.
b. Other residential districts are established for two-family homes
and for apartments. Density, yard and parking regulations
would ensure good living conditions in these areas. Much of
present day building is by large projects instead of lot by lot.
The regulations provide for large scale developments (ten (10)
acres or more) which may be located in any residential district
with approval of the site plan and with conformity of the plan to
the overall density standards of the district. This introduces an
important measure of flexibility into the regulations.
c. Commercial districts recognize the different types of
commercial areas that will be needed by the future growth for
the community. There is a zoning district for the neighborhood
commercial area, i.e., the grocery store — drugstore complex
serving the adjacent residential neighborhoods. For the more
widely used commercial areas along major streets and
highways, there is a general commercial district. There is a
central commercial district for the downtown area and a
special planned district for the shopping centers.

A. Non-conforming uses are regulated as follows:
1. Non-conforming use of land. In the residential districts where open
land is being used as a non-conforming use and such use is the
principal use and not accessory to the main use conducted in a
building, such use shall be discontinued not later than two (2) years
from the date of passage of this Chapter. During the two (2) year
period such non-conforming use shall not be extended or enlarged,
either on the same or adjoining property. Any building incident and
subordinate to such use of land, such as a shed, tool house, storage
building, office or trailer, shall be removed at the end of the two (2)
year period, or if such building is so constructed as to permit the
issuance of a permit for a use not excluded from the district, such
building may remain as a conforming use; thereafter, both land and
building shall be used only as conforming uses.
2. Non-conforming use of buildings. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the lawful use of a building existing at the effective date of
this Chapter may be continued although such use does not conform
to the provisions hereof. If no structural alterations are made, a
non-conforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming
use of the same or of a more restricted classification.
Whenever a non-conforming use has been changed to a more
restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter
be changed to a less restricted use. The non-conforming use of a
building may be hereafter extended throughout those parts of a
building which were lawfully and manifestly arranged or designed
for such use at the time of the enactment of this Chapter.
3. Discontinuance of non-conforming uses.
a. No land used in whole or in part for a non-conforming use
which remains idle or unused for a continuous period of six (6)
months, whether or not the equipment or fixtures are removed,
shall again be used except in conformity with the regulations of
the district in which it is located.
b. No building or portion thereof used in whole or in part for a
non-conforming use which remains idle or unused for a
continuous period of one (1) year, whether or not the

equipment or fixtures are removed, shall again be used except
in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
4. Destruction of a non-conforming use.
a. For the purposes of this Subsection, a non-conforming use
structure shall be deemed "damaged" when said structure has
been damaged by any cause whatsoever to the extent of more
than twenty percent (20%) but less than fifty percent (50%) of
the fair market value of the building immediately prior to
damage. A non-conforming use structure shall be deemed
"destroyed" when said structure has been damaged by any
cause whatsoever to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more
of the fair market value of the structure immediately prior to
damage.
b. Any structure used in whole or in part for a non-conforming
use that has been damaged or destroyed by any cause
whatsoever may be restored or reconstructed to the use
immediately prior to the damage or destruction, provided that
the restoration or reconstruction is commenced within six (6)
months from the date of such damage or destruction and the
floor area of the structure is not increased above that existing
prior to the damage. The restoration or reconstruction must be
completed within twelve (12) months of the date of damage or
destruction. In the event restoration or reconstruction is not
commenced within the said six (6) month period or not
completed after commencement within the said twelve (12)
month period, the Building Inspector is directed to proceed to
declare said property a dangerous building as provided in
Chapter 505 of the Code of Ordinances. Restoration or
reconstruction must reflect the architectural character of the
neighboring or surrounding area. No material from the
structure may be used, except those materials in which the
structural stability has not been compromised or reduced by
the damage. All restoration or reconstruction of a nonconforming
structure following damage must be in conformity
with the regulations of this Chapter and all applicable building
codes.
5. Non-conforming advertising signs. All advertising signs in violation
of the provisions of Section 405.095 hereof shall be removed or

C. Character Of Development. The Commission shall confer with the
subdivider regarding the type and character of development that will be
permitted in the subdivision and may agree with the subdivider as to
certain minimum restrictions to be placed upon the property. Such
regulations shall be intended to protect the character and development
of the platted subdivision as well as that of the surrounding
development.
Where the subdivision contains sewers, sewage treatment plants, water
supply systems, park areas, street trees or other physical facilities
necessary or desirable for the welfare of the area and which are of
common use or benefit and are not or cannot be satisfactorily
maintained by an existing public agency, provision shall be made by
trust agreement, made a part of the deed restrictions acceptable to any
agency having jurisdiction over the location and improvement of such
Section
410.070
POPLAR BLUFF CITY CODE Section
410.070
AO:498
facilities, for the proper and continuous maintenance and supervision
of such facilities.
D. Dedication For Public Lands. All proposed subdivisions may be required
to dedicate a reasonable area for public use as a park, recreation area,
school or other public purpose sites. Such area so dedicated shall be in
addition to all dedications for streets and thoroughfares. In determining
the area to be so dedicated for public use, the Commission shall give
due consideration to present and anticipated population density within
such subdivision and to the present and future requirements for such
public needs. Such area so dedicated for the aforesaid purposes shall
not be less than five percent (5%) and shall not be more than ten
percent (10%) of the total land area within the subdivision.
E. Acquisition Of Land For Public Use. In addition to any areas so
dedicated according to the provisions of Subsection (D) above, where a
tract of land being subdivided includes lands proposed to be used for
parks, schools or other public purposes under the duly adopted
Comprehensive Plan of the City and environs, the subdivider shall not
plat such lands as a part of the subdivision's plat and shall confer with
the appropriate public agency regarding the time, method and amount
of payment for the agency to acquire the land. If no agreement has been
reached upon the acquisition of the area within two (2) years of the date
of submission of the final plan, the subdivider may then plat the balance
of the area.
F. Easements Along Streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located in an area which is being subdivided, the
subdivider shall provide an adequate easement along each side of the
stream for the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving or
protecting the stream or drainage course.
G. Corner Lots. Corner lots shall have an extra width to permit appropriate
building setback from both streets or orientation to both streets. Lots
abutting a pedestrian mid-block crosswalk shall be treated as corner
lots.
H. Uninhabitable Area. Lands subject to flooding or otherwise deemed by
the Planning and Zoning Commission to be uninhabitable shall not be
platted for residential purposes or for uses that may in the judgment of
the Planning and Zoning Commission increase the danger of health, life
or property or increase the flood hazard. Such land within a subdivision
shall be set aside for other uses, such as parks or other open space.
I. Back-Up Lots. Lots shall back into such features as freeways, arterial
streets, shopping centers or industrial properties, except where there is
a marginal access street, unless a secondary access is provided. Such
lots shall contain a landscaped easement along the rear at least twenty
(20) feet wide in addition to the utility easement to restrict access to the
arterial street, to minimize noise and to protect outdoor living areas.

screens shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet wide and shall not be a
part of the normal roadway right-of-way or utility easement.
L. Easements. Utility easements shall be of sufficient width to have at
least a ten (10) foot interval between water and sewer lines. Where
practicable, utility lines shall be placed in alleys or easements for same.
The subdivider shall properly clear the easement area of tree stumps,
roots and rocks and any other obstructions to the placing of utilities.
A. Permanent Markers. All subdivision boundary corners and the four (4)
corners of all street intersections shall be marked with permanent
monuments. A permanent monument shall be deemed to be concrete
with a minimum dimension of four (4) inches extending below the frost
line or steel pipe of at least one (1) inch diameter firmly imbedded in
concrete which extends below the frost line. Should conditions prohibit
the placing of monuments on the line, off-set marking will be permitted;
provided however, that exact off-set courses and distances are shown
on the subdivision plat.

noted on the subdivision plat, the elevation of such bench mark to be
based on the U.S.G.S. data.
B. Street Improvements. All streets and public ways shall be graded to
their full width, including side slopes, and to the appropriate grade and
shall be surfaced with concrete or bituminous material as approved by
the Governing Body. Such construction shall be subject to inspection
and approval by the City Engineer or other designated official.
C. Sidewalks. Within one (1) year of recording of the final subdivision plat,
concrete sidewalks shall be constructed along at least one (1) side on
every minor street shown on the plat in accordance with applicable
standard specifications and concrete sidewalks shall be constructed

POPLAR BLUFF CITY CODE Section
410.080
AO:500
amount estimated by the subdivider's engineer and approved by the
City planner or Building Inspector as necessary to complete such work
in cash or a cashier's check to be deposited in a non-interest bearing
account. If no sidewalks are constructed within three (3) years after
the recording of the final plat, the subdivider shall forfeit all sums
heretofore submitted to the City. Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this Section, a waiver from the sidewalk requirement may be
granted, by City Council with recommendation from the Planning and
Zoning Commission, if one (1) of the following cases are found

5. The cost to construct the proposed sidewalk would be significantly
greater than the average cost of sidewalk construction.
D. Water Lines. Each subdivision shall be connected with the water system
of the utility company in accordance with all State and municipal
requirements so as to provide water service to every lot within the
subdivision. The layout of the water system, the size of pipes and mains
to be used in the various parts of water systems and all other details
regarding the water system shall be determined by the manager of the
Utilities Department. Cost for all materials used in the construction of
water lines from the City mains to the subdivision and inside the
subdivision shall be paid for by the subdivider and the subdivider shall
receive no refund of any kind whatsoever. Provided however, the City
shall pay for fire hydrants and the added cost on water mains in size
above six (6) inches in diameter.
E. Sanitary Sewers.
1. The subdivider shall construct a sanitary sewer system and provide
lateral connections for each lot where a public sanitary sewer main
is available at the plat boundary or within a reasonable distance
thereto.
2. Where a sewer is not yet available but is planned for extension to
the subdivision, the subdivider shall install sewer lines, including
lateral connections, as may be necessary to provide adequate
service to each lot when connection with the sewer system is made.
The sewer lines shall be suitably capped at the limits of the
Section
410.080
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
410.080
AO:501
subdivision and the laterals shall be suitably capped at the street
right-of-way line.
3. When capped sewers are provided, on-site disposal facilities shall
also be provided. A sewer shall be considered to be planned for
extension to a given area any time after engineering and related
studies have been completed and the construction of facilities
adequate to serve the area containing the subdivision has been
programmed for completion within a reasonable time.
4. If a public sanitary system is not available under the conditions
stated above, the subdivision or area may be considered as one (1)
where it is necessary to construct a community disposal system or
individual septic tanks. Such systems must receive approval by the
Health Department and the City Council.
5. If, in the opinion of the Health Department or the City Engineer or
other designated official, factors exist which would create a public
health and sanitation problem if a certain area is platted, the
Commission will not approve the subdivision and platting of such
area until such factors are corrected by an adequate sewer system
or other method acceptable to the Health Department and City
Engineer or other designated official.
F. Storm Sewers And Drainage.
1. Storm sewers. Where a storm drainage system is reasonably
accessible, the subdivider shall connect with such storm drainage
system and shall do all grading and provide all drainage structures
that are necessary to properly carry the water to the storm
drainage system. Where a storm drainage system is not accessible,
the subdivider shall do all grading and provide all drainage
installations and structures that are necessary to properly carry the
water to locations which are acceptable to the City Engineer or
other designated official. Surface water will not be permitted to
cross the pavement at low spots. Inlets with connection pipe will be
required to carry the surface water from one side to the other.
2. Storm water drainage.
a. Wherever possible, existing drainage channels shall be used. A
drainage easement, in addition to the provided right-of-way
width, may be required where streets parallel streams or
drainage areas. Such easement widths shall be determined by
the City Engineer or other designated official. The design of
the drainage system shall consider and show:
(1) Storm drainage area of which the subdivision is a part.

Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purposes
Section 415.010. Statutory Authorization. [Ord. No. 7215 §§1 — 3,
11-1-2010]
The legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section 77.260, RSMo.,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt flood plain
management regulations designed to protect the health, safety and general
welfare. Therefore, the City Council of Poplar Bluff, Missouri, ordains as
follows.
Section 415.020. Findings of Fact. [Ord. No. 7215 §§1 — 3,
11-1-2010]
A. Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood
hazard areas of the City of Poplar Bluff, Missouri, are subject to
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
B. General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
1. The cumulative effect of development in any delineated flood plain
causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and
2. The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods,
hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
C. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) that is the basis of this Chapter uses a standard engineering
method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of
interrelated steps.
1. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as
its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated and the
depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this
Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be
expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any
one (1) year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's
FIS and illustrative materials for Butler County dated November
26, 2010, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
2. Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard
hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream
channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.

415.020
AO:509
Section 415.030. Statement of Purpose. [Ord. No. 7215 §§1 — 3,
11-1-2010]
3. Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
4. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood
height.
5. Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base
flood.
A. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Article I, Section
415.020(A); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as
defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to
meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of
this Chapter to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood
heights or velocities;
2. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that
serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of
initial construction; and
3. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the
intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

on slopes in order to guide floodwaters around and away from
proposed structures.
A. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article II,
Section 415.040 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that
carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall
apply:
1. The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based
on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway
must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without
increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one
(1) foot at any point.
2. The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements and other
development, within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has
been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in

conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; streets;
and bridges.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing
Subsections (B) through (F) below have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places or local inventory of
historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will
not preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
C. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon:
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause,
2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,

more resubmittals on the same project based on review comments by
the City.
A. A storm water management system shall be provided for protecting
lots, roads, streets and buildings in the project area from the potential
adverse impacts of storm water runoff. Streets, blocks, depths of lots,
parks and other public grounds and ultimate land usage shall be
determined, located and laid out in such a manner as to reduce the
velocity of overland flow and allow the maximum opportunity for
infiltration of storm waters into the ground and to preserve and utilize
natural streams, channels and detention basins and, whether possible,
to include streams and flood plains within parks or other public
grounds.
B. Minimum Detention Volume. The increased storm water runoff
resulting from the proposed development shall be detained on-site by
appropriate detention structures. The minimum volume of storage shall
be sufficient to store the volume from a 25-year storm under the
proposed developed conditions. Acceptable detention structures shall
include dedicated storm water detention basins; storage on flat roofs,
parking lots or streets; or by other acceptable techniques approved by
the administrative officer. Control devices shall be incorporated to
regulate discharge from storage in accordance with the provisions of
this Chapter.
C. Maximum Allowable Release Rate. The maximum allowable release rate
of storm water after development shall not exceed the beforedevelopment
rate for each rainfall event considered. Downstream
property, watercourses, channels or conduits shall not receive storm
water runoff from proposed development at a higher peak flow rate
than that which existed prior to the development.
Section
425.110
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
425.120
AO:573
D. Primary Outlet Release Rate. Detention basin control structures shall
be designed to release runoff at a flow rate not to exceed ninety percent
(90%) of the peak flow rate calculated for a 25-year frequency storm,
under predevelopment conditions, when the detention basin water level
is equal to the level required to store the minimum detention volume.
This flow rate shall be defined as the primary outlet release rate. The
primary outlet release rate shall not be exceeded prior to detaining one
hundred percent (100%) of the minimum detention volume in storage.
E. Low Flow Release Rate. The detention basin control structure shall
further be designed to limit the release rate of storm water during lowflow
conditions. The "low flow release rate" shall be defined as twentyfive
percent (25%) of the peak flow rate calculated for a 25-year
frequency storm, under predevelopment conditions, based on a 25-year
frequency storm. The low flow release rate shall not be exceeded prior
to detaining fifty percent (50%) of the minimum detention volume
F. The total drainage area must be used in calculating the release rates.
The required storage volume will be based on the project area only.
Extraneous flows from upland areas shall be by-passed or discharged
via overflow spillway or other devices.
G. Generally acceptable locations of the storm water runoff channels in
the design of the project area may include the following:
1. In a depressed median of a double roadway, street or parkway
provided the median is wide enough to permit required roadway
shoulders.
2. Centered on the rear lot lines in a block or entirely within the rear
yards of a single row of lots or parcels, provided that in either case
the lots are deep enough to permit side slopes in the runoff channel
and a building site of the elevation required by other Sections of
this Chapter.
3. In a depressed area along roadway, street or parkway provided the
area is wide enough to permit side slopes as required in other
Sections of this Chapter.
H. Alternative systems such as curb and gutter and storm sewers that
discharge into an appropriate detention basin may be incorporated into
the storm water management plan.
I. The smaller, uppermost reaches of drainage channels and swales
forming the natural drainage system near a watershed divide may be
relocated or eliminated and incorporated into the planned system of
storm sewers and open channels designed consistent with the
requirements of this Chapter.
J. A continuous easement may be provided abutting rear lot lines as
shown in the storm water management plan drawing(s) within which
utility lines and open drainage facilities may be located and maintained,

§31½-13; Ord. No. 6659 §2(Exh. A), 10-20-2003]
but on which no accessory buildings may be constructed. The utility
drainage easement shall be as specified in Section 425.160. Within the
area so designed for the passage or storage of waters, no structure may
be erected, no fences, shrubbery or trees planted or changes made to
the prescribed grades and contour of the specified floodwater or storm
water runoff channels.
K. All storm sewer outfalls shall be so designed, by reason of elevation of
the invert, by a flap gate or by other features, that when the receiving
stream is in full flood, the storm sewers will continue to drain the areas
they are designed to serve unless the provision is made for sewer backups
into planned storage locations.
L. All sanitary sewer manholes constructed in a flood plain, in a street
designed to provide detention or in an area designed for the storage for
passage of floodwater or storm water shall be provided with either a
water-tight bolted manhole cover, a water-tight concealed pick-hole
cover or be constructed with a rim elevation at or above the high water
elevation of the 100-year flood or the high water elevation of the design
storm, whichever is applicable to the specific area. No sanitary sewer
manholes shall be constructed in an area designated for storm water
detention where other feasible locations exist.
M. Projects that are to be developed in phases will normally require the
submission of a master plan of the applicant's contiguous land holdings.
Applications for individual project phases may be considered only when
the phases are totally independent of, or make sufficient provisions for,
adjacent lands.
A. Design Storms. Storm water systems will be designed with sufficient
hydraulic capacity as a minimum for the following frequencies and
durations:
Type of Facility
(Year) Design Frequency Year
Detention storage 100
Detention basin overflow 100
Primary drainage systems 100
Bridges 100
Secondary drainage systems (i.e., cross
drains and ditches for internal subdivision
drainage)

C. In critical areas, the administrative officer may require additional
hydraulic capacity above the minimum set forth above.
A. Method Of Evaluation. Differential runoff evaluation consists of the
determination of rates of runoff before and after development, the
determination of required volume of detention and verification of
adequacy of discharge and control structures.
B. Differential Runoff Rates. Differential runoff rates for all three (3) size
classes of projects shall be evaluated by the rational formula. The runoff
coefficients in Table II shall be used. Differential runoff rates shall be
evaluated by equation:
R = (Rd-Ru) (EQUATION 1)
Where R = Differential runoff rate
Rd = CI factor for developed conditions
Ru = CI factor for undeveloped conditions
C. Volume Detention. Volumes of detention for the three (3) classes of
projects shall be evaluated according to the following methods:
1. Volume of detention for projects of less than twenty-five (25) acres
shall be evaluated by the "simplified volume formula".
2. Volume of detention for projects of twenty-five (25) acres or greater
but less than two hundred (200) acres may be evaluated either by
the "simplified volume formula" or the "modified rational
hydrograph method".
3. For projects larger than two hundred (200) acres, the owner's
engineer shall submit his/her proposed method of evaluation for
the sizing of the detention basin to the administrative officer. The
method will be evaluated for professional acceptance, applicability
and reliability. No detailed review for projects larger than two
hundred (200) acres will be rendered before the method of
evaluation of the detention is approved.
4. Other analytical methods of evaluation of volume of detention will
be considered, provided that reliability, professional acceptance
and proper application are approved by the administrative officer.
D. Formulae. Any of the following methods may be used for calculating
detention volume as applicable:
1. Simplified volume formula. Total volume of detention shall be
computed by the equation:
Section
425.130
POPLAR BLUFF CITY CODE Section
425.140
AO:576
V = R x A x 30 (min) x 60 (see/min) (EQUATION 2)
Where V = Total volume of detention
R = Differential runoff rate
A = Area of project in acres
2. Graphic representation. For purposes of further analysis, the
simplified volume formula may be represented by a triangular
synthetic hydrograph as shown in Figure 1 (following Section
425.270) with the following elements:
Tb = Base time of hydrograph for developed project
without detention
Tb = 60 minutes
Tp = Time of peak runoff of developed project
Tp = 20 minutes
Qd = Total peak runoff of developed project in cfs.
Qd = A x Rd (see equation 1)
Qu = Total peak runoff of unimproved project in cfs.
Qu = A x Ru (see equation 1)
A = Total area of project in acres
Tq = Assumed time of peak differential for
unimproved project
Tq = Qu/Qd x 40
Tr = Assumed recedence time differential for
discharge at rates no greater than unimproved
condition
Tr = (30 Qd/Qu) - 60
V = Volume of detention
V = (Qd-Qu) x 30 (min) x 60 (sec/min)
3. Modified rational hydrograph method. This is a modification of the
unit hydrograph method of hydrologic evaluation simplified to
reflect features of present practice and some elements of
topographic characteristics, concentration patterns and routing.
Figure 1 (following Section 425.270) illustrates the elements of the
modified hydrograph. Steps to develop the hydrograph are as
follows:
a. Determine the time of concentration for the project by use of
Figure 2 (following Section 425.270) or similar reference
manual adopted by the City Engineer or other designated
official. Figure 2 is based on overland flow time from Seeley
Data Book for Civil Engineers. Enter chart with overland travel
distance; follow horizontally to slope curve then vertically
Section

down to C or P factor listed in Table II and obtain Tc. For
analysis of large improved channels, time for travel for
overland flow and channel are to be analyzed to determine
reasonable (Tc) time of concentration.
b. Determine time of peaking by equation:
Tp = D/2 + 0.6 Tc (EQUATION 3)
Where Tp
=
Time of peak discharge of developed
project in minutes
D = 20 minutes = storm duration in minutes
c. Determine the base time of the hydrograph without detention
by equation:
Tb = 2.67 Tr; (EQUATION 4)
d. Determine the base time of the hydrograph with detention by
equation:
Tr = Tb (Qd/Qu - 1) (EQUATION 5)
Where Tr
=
Additional time required for discharge at
a rate no greater than that of the
undeveloped condition
Qd = Total peak runoff of improved project in
cfs
Qd = A x Rd (see equation 1) (EQUATION 6) Qu
= Total runoff of unimproved project in
cfs
Qu = A x Ru (see equation 1) (EQUATION 7)
e. Determine the required volume of detention by equation:
V = ½ (Qd - Qu) Tb (EQUATION 8)
E. Control Structures. Detention facilities shall be provided with obvious
and effective control structures. Plan view and sections of the structure
with adequate detail shall be included in the drawing(s). Provision shall
be made to protect clogging of outlets by debris and/or silt. Access to
control structures shall be provided for maintenance and inspection.
Control structures shall be designed to regulate water discharges at the
primary outlet discharge rate and the low-flow discharge rate. A rating
table recording the relationship among detention facility water
elevation, stored volume and discharge flow rate shall be provided on
the drawing(s) clearly indicating the numeric values at the two (2)
design flow rates.
F. Design discharges for the outlet structure(s) shall be as follows:
Section
425.140
POPLAR BLUFF CITY CODE Section
425.140
AO:578
1. Primary outlet discharge rate. The primary outlet discharge rate
shall be calculated as ninety percent (90%) of the peak flow rate
determined for a rainfall event (storm) having a 25-year return
frequency, with a duration equal to the time of concentration for
the drainage basin watershed, under predevelopment conditions
(five percent (5%) imperviousness). The primary outlet discharge
rate shall not be exceeded prior to the detention structure
detaining one hundred percent (100%) of the minimum detention
volume.
2. Low flow release rate. The low flow release rate shall be calculated
as twenty-five percent (25%) of the peak flow rate determined for a
rainfall event (storm) having a 25-year return frequency, with a
duration equal to the time of concentration for the drainage basin
watershed, under predevelopment conditions (five percent (5%)
imperviousness). The low flow discharge rate shall not be exceeded
prior to the detention structure detaining fifty percent (50%) of the
minimum detention volume.
3. When emergency overflow structures are combined with control
structures, the control structure shall be sized to safely pass the
100-year flood under current runoff conditions, but not less than
thirty-five percent (35%) impermeable for the entire drainage area
considered. The overflow opening or spillway shall be designed to
accept the total peak runoff of the improved tributary area.
Consideration shall be given to anticipated land use upstream of
the control structure when determining the peak 100-year flood
runoff.
G. Detention Design Criteria. Detention in the overall system, including
swales, lakes, canals, greenways, etc., shall be provided as follows.
1. General.
a. Storage volumes. The minimum volume of storage provided in
detention basins, together with such storage as may be
authorized in other on-site facilities, shall be sufficient to store
the volume from a 25-year storm (under developed conditions).
b. Outlet control structures. Outlet control structures shall be
designed to operate simply and automatically. They will limit
discharges into existing or planned downstream channels or
conduits so as not to exceed predetermined maximum
authorized peak flow rates. Outlet control structures shall be
designed to safely discharge flows no greater than the primary
outlet release defined in Section 425.120(D) and when the
basin water level is at the 25-year storm level.
c. Emergency spillway. Emergency overflow facilities must be
provided in all instances so that stored waters will not exceed
the safe capacity of the basin. At a minimum, the emergency

sediments shall be controlled. The cleanup of accumulated debris,
flotsam and other materials after runoff events have subsided shall be
assured.
1. Detention facilities, when mandatory, are to be built in conjunction
with the storm sewer installation and/or grading. Since these
facilities are intended to control increased runoff, they must be
partially or fully operational soon after the clearing of the
vegetation. Silt and debris connected with early construction shall
be removed periodically from the detention area and control
structure in order to maintain close to full storage capacity.
2. The responsibility for maintenance of storm water management
facilities in single lot development projects shall remain with the
owner, developer and general contractor until final inspection of
the development is performed and approved and a legal occupancy
permit, where applicable, is issued. After legal occupancy of the
property, the maintenance of storm water management facilities
shall be vested with the owner of the property.
3. The responsibility for maintenance of storm water management
facilities in subdivision projects shall remain with the developer
"until such time as responsibility is transferred, under appropriate
legal arrangements, to the private individual owner in the
subdivision, the trustees of the subdivision, the City or such other
maintenance entity or authority as may be proposed and approved
by the City Council. Storm water detention facilities and drainage
facilities shall be designated on the subdivision plat and restricted
for use only for its intended purpose. Prior to receiving a building
permit, the owner or developer shall have a deed recorded in their
name for all lots containing restricted areas for storm water
detention facilities and drainage facilities. The recorded deed shall
contain detailed deed restrictions per Section 425.160. A copy of
the recorded deed shall be submitted to the City prior to obtaining
a building permit.
4. If responsibility is to be transferred to the private individual owners
in the subdivision, the developer shall assure perpetual
maintenance of the drainage management facilities, including
detention systems if any are included, through the adoption of
maintenance agreements or covenants for any facilities that remain
in private ownership. Such agreements or covenants shall be
subject to the approval of the administrative officer. Copies of all
agreements or covenants shall be provided to the administrative
officer.
5. If the responsibility is to be transferred to the trustees of the
subdivision, the developer shall establish a suitable indenture of
trust. Upon release of escrows required for the subdivision
development, the responsibility for maintenance shall be vested in
the trustees of the subdivision by virtue of the trust indenture. The

b. Facility operators shall allow the administrative officer ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that
must be kept under the conditions of a NPDES permit to
discharge storm water and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by State and Federal law.
c. The administrative officer shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the administrative officer to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
d. The administrative officer has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices
used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
e. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be
promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral
request of the administrative officer and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
f. Unreasonable delays in allowing the administrative officer
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water
discharge permit and of this Chapter. A person who is the
operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm
water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the administrative officer reasonable access
to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any
activity authorized or required by this Chapter.

part of the premises from which storm water is discharged and
he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this Chapter or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
Chapter or any order issued hereunder or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the
administrative officer may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.

of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own
expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural
BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which
is or may be the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm
water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall
be deemed compliance with the provisions of this Section. These BMPs
shall be part of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
H. Watercourse Protection. Every person owning property through which
a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain
that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris,
excessive vegetation and other obstacles that would pollute,
contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water through the
watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing
privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that
such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
I. Notification Of Spills.
1. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in
illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the
storm drain system or water of the U.S., said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup
of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services.
2. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person
shall notify the administrative officer in person or by phone or
facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to the administrative officer within three (3) business
days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the
owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3)
years.

alteration of an existing residence or structure within the City
of Poplar Bluff, Missouri, an application for a building permit
shall be submitted to the Planning Department.
b. Commercial applications must be accompanied by three (3)
complete sets of blueprints and one (1) set of building
specifications all of which have been signed, sealed and dated
by a professional architect or engineer, registered in the State

accompanying documentation, the Building Inspector shall
calculate and determine a building inspection fee, plumbing
inspection fee, mechanical inspection fee and electrical
inspection fee in accordance with the provisions of this

below:
a. The following formula will be used to determine the permit fee
for new commercial buildings within the City of Poplar Bluff.
Using the total cost of the project and applying the multiplier
of .0037 determines the permit fee. If the project has a
contract bid that has been accepted, that will be the total cost.
If no contract, a total cost will be supplied by permit applicant
and this will be compared to the total cost determined by using
the International Building Code (IBC) formula for determining
total construction cost. If the two (2) figures are close, the one
provided by the applicant will be used. If the figures are some
distance apart, the Building Department will determine
whether to average the two (2) or use the IBC calculated value.
(1) The IBC formula for determining construction value is:
Gross Area x Gross Area Multiplier x Type of
Construction Factor x Permit Fee Modifier
(2) Gross area is the actual square footage of the structure.
(3) Gross area multiplier is the factor applied to allow for local
differences in building costs compared to the national
building cost averages. This factor for new commercial
buildings shall be 0.72 and for new residential facilities
shall be 0.50.

10-5-1987]
As used in this Article, the following terms shall have these prescribed
meanings:
AIR-GAP SEPARATION — The unobstructed vertical distance through the
free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet
supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the flood
level rim of the receptacle and shall be at least double the diameter of the
supply line pipe measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel.
In no case shall the gap be less than one (1) inch.
AUXILIARY SUPPLY — Any water source or system, other than the public
water supply, that may be available in the building or premises or which is
not a water supply approved by the Missouri Division of Health.
BACK PRESSURE — Backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler or
other means that could create pressure within the system greater than the
supply pressure.
BACK SIPHONAGE — A form of backflow due to a negative or
subatmospheric pressure within a water system.
BACKFLOW — The flow, other than the intended direction of flow, of any
foreign liquids, gases or substances into the distribution system of the
public water supply.
BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE — A device to counteract back
pressures or prevent back siphonage.
CROSS-CONNECTION — Any physical arrangement whereby a public
water supply is connected directly or indirectly with any other water supply
system, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture or
other device which contains or may contain contaminated water, sewage or
other waste or liquid of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of
imparting contamination to the public water supply as a result of backflow.
By-pass arrangements, jumper connections, removal of section, swivel or
changeover devices and other temporary or permanent devices through
which or because of which backflow could occur are considered to be crossconnections.
DOUBLE-CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY — An assembly composed of two (2)
single, independently acting check valves, including tightly closing shutoff
valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for the
in-line testing of the water-tightness of each check valve.
PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY — Any system of water supply intended for human
consumption or other domestic uses, including source, treatment, storage,
transmission and distribution facilities, where water is furnished to any
community, collection or number of individuals or is made available to
Section
705.020
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
705.020
AO:917
the public for human consumption or domestic use, but excluding water
supplied serving one (1) single-family residence.
REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPAL BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE —
A device incorporating two (2) or more check valves and an automatically
operating differential relief valve located between the two (2) checks, two
(2) shutoff valves and equipped with necessary appurtenances for in-line
testing. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone
between the two (2) check valves, less than the pressure on the public water
supply side of the device. At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between
the check valves shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage
of either check valve, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain
this reduced pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet
pressure is two (2) pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open
to the atmosphere, thereby providing an air-gap in the device.
Section 705.030. Cross-Connection Control Program. [R.O. 2007
§37-104; Ord. No. 5130 §2, 10-5-1987; Ord. No. 5963 §1, 3-17-1997]
A. The purpose of this Article is to establish a cross-connection control
program to protect the health of water consumers by the control of
actual and/or potential cross-connections through the proper
installation and surveillance of backflow prevention devices on service
lines leading to premises where cross-connections exist or are likely to
occur and through the inspection and regulation of the plumbing within
the premises to minimize danger of contamination of the water system
on the premises or the public water supply itself.
B. All cross-connections, whether or not such cross-connections are
controlled by automatic devices, such as check valves or by handoperated
mechanisms such as gate valves or stopcocks, are hereby
prohibited.
C. Failure on the part of persons, firms or corporations to discontinue the
use of any and all cross-connections and to physically separate such
cross-connections will be sufficient cause for the discontinuance of the
public water service to the premises on which the cross-connection
exists.
D. Persons bearing proper credentials and identification shall make annual
inspections of premises served by the water supply of the City to check
for the presence of cross-connections. Documentation of the annual
inspection shall be submitted to the Superintendent of Water
Distribution, on the proper form, within ten (10) business days from the
date of initial installation or annual inspection. Should such a crossconnection
be found, the City, giving the customer not less than fifteen
(15) days' notice of its intention, will discontinue service. If an
immediate hazard to health is caused by the cross-connection, water
service to the premises shall be discontinued until it is verified that the
cross-connection has been removed. The Superintendent or other duly
authorized employee of the Poplar Bluff Water and Sewer Department

to check for the presence of cross-connections.
A. Backflow prevention devices shall be installed at the service connection
or within any premises wherein the judgment of the Superintendent,
the nature and extent of activities on the premises or the materials used
in connection with the activities or materials stored on the premises
would present an immediate hazard to health should a cross-connection
occur, even though such cross-connection does not exist at the time the
backflow prevention device is required to be installed. This shall
include, but not be limited to, the following situations:
1. Premises having an auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of the
auxiliary supply is in compliance with local standards and is
acceptable to the Superintendent;
2. Premises having internal cross-connections that are not
correctable or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it
impractical to ascertain whether or not cross-connections exist;
3. Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for crossconnections
cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at
sufficiently short notice to assure that cross-connections do not
exist;
4. Premises having a repeated history of cross-connections being

C. City's Rights Of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more
stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW
consistent with the purpose of this Chapter.
A. Upon promulgation of the Federal categorical pretreatment standards
for a particular industrial subcategory, the Federal standard, if more
stringent than limitations imposed under this Chapter for sources in
that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed
under this Chapter. The Superintendent shall notify all affected users of
the limitations contained in the Federal standard.
B. Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found
at 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471.
C. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with the sections below.
D. When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the City
convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to
convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of
the Superintendent. The City may establish equivalent mass limits only
if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in Sections below.
Section
710.180
POPLAR BLUFF CITY CODE Section
710.190
AO:950
1. To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must:
a. Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use
during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;
b. Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a
substitute for treatment;
c. Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data
from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as
the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the
actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average
production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
d. Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
e. Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the
industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits.
2. An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
a. Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the
equivalent mass limits;
b. Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
c. Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the
Superintendent whenever production rates are expected to
vary by more than twenty percent (20%) from its baseline
production rates. Upon notification of a revised production
rate, the Superintendent will reassess the equivalent mass
limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed
conditions at the facility; and
d. Continue to employ the same or comparable water
conservation methods and technologies as those implemented
pursuant to Subsection (D)(1)(a) of this Section so long as it
discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
3. When developing equivalent mass limits, the Superintendent:
a. Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of
Section
710.190
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
710.190
AO:951
the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum
and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion
factor;
b. Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to
reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
c. May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial
user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a
result of the implementation of water conservation methods
and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used
in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment
pursuant to Section 710.210. The industrial user must also be
in compliance with Section 710.480(B) regarding the
prohibition of bypass.
E. The Superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the
Superintendent. The conversion of other categorical pretreatment
standards mass limits is not permitted. The Superintendent may impose
flow monitoring requirements be included in periodic monitoring
reports to determine if there have been changes in flows that may
indicate dilution.
F. The Superintendent may convert the concentration limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 423, 425, 426, 428,
429, 433, 439, 442, 443, 444, 458, and 469 to mass limits for purposes
of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The
conversion is at the discretion of the Superintendent. The conversion of
other categorical pretreatment standards concentration limits is not
permitted. The Superintendent may impose water conservation targets
and flow monitoring requirements be included in the SIU's permit.
G. When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
Superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable
to individual industrial users.
H. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
Superintendent shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40
CFR 403.6(e).

Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been
calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this
adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be
submitted to the Control Authority.
(4) Wastewater samples must be collected by flow
proportional composite techniques, except as specifically
mentioned below. In the event flow proportional sampling
is not feasible, the Superintendent may authorize the use
of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4)
grab samples (unless Federal pretreatment standards
require more grab samples) where the user demonstrates
that this will provide a representative sample of the
effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may
be required to show compliance with discharge limits.
However, samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH,
Section
710.310
POPLAR BLUFF CITY CODE Section
710.310
AO:960
cyanide phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds
must be obtained using grab sample collection techniques.
(5) The Superintendent may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long
as the data provides information sufficient to determine
the need for industrial pretreatment measures.
(6) The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place
of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that
such sampling and analysis is representative of normal
work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the
POTW.
f. Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized
representative and certified by a qualified professional,
indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and
maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is
required to meet the pretreatment standards and
requirements.
g. Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M
will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the
shortest schedule by which the user will provide such
additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in
this schedule shall be no later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A
compliance schedule pursuant to this Section must meet the
requirements set out in Section 710.310(C).
h. Signature And Certification. All baseline monitoring reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with Section
710.400(B)(3).
C. Compliance Schedule Progress Reports. The following shall apply to the
compliance schedule required by Section 710.310(B)(2)(g).
1. The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events
leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable
pretreatment standard (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, executing contract for major components,
commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
2. No increment referred to in Subsection (c)(1) shall exceed nine (9)
months.
3. Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a
progress report to the Superintendent including, as a minimum,
Section
710.310
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
710.310
AO:961
whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be
met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply
with this increment of progress, the reason for delay and the steps
being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule
established.
4. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Superintendent.
D. Reports On Compliance With Categorical Pretreatment Standards
Deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final
compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in
the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction
of wastewater to the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment
standards and requirements shall submit to the Superintendent a
report containing the information described in Section 710.310(B)(2)(d)
through (f). For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this
report shall contain a reasonable measurement of the user's long-term
production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit
of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include
the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All
compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
Section 710.400(B)(3).
E. Periodic Industrial Self-Monitoring Reports.
1. All significant industrial users (SIUs) as defined in Section 710.020
subject to pretreatment standards shall submit during the months
of June and December a self-monitoring report to the
Superintendent. The report shall contain the results of sampling
and analysis of the discharge, including the flow rate and the
nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested
by the Superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standard. In cases where
the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best
management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user
shall submit documentation required by the Superintendent or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance
status of the user. The frequency of monitoring shall be as
prescribed in Section 710.320. The reporting frequency for any
industry may be altered by the Superintendent upon consideration
of such factors as actual flow rates and pollutant concentrations,
seasonal production schedules, etc.
a. If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this Section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling
location more frequently than required by the Superintendent,
using the procedures prescribed in Section 710.320 of this
Section
710.310
POPLAR BLUFF CITY CODE Section
710.310
AO:962
Chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
2. All significant industrial users (SIUs) as defined in Section 710.020
not subject to pretreatment standards shall submit during the
months of June and December a self-monitoring report to the
Superintendent. The report shall contain the results of sampling
and analysis of the discharge, including the flow rate and the
nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested
by the Superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standard.
3. In cases where a local limit requires compliance with a best
management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user
must submit documentation required by the Superintendent to
determine the compliance status of the user. These reports must be
based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by
the report, and in accordance with the techniques described in 40
CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. This sampling and analysis
may be performed by the City of Poplar Bluff in lieu of the
significant industrial user.
4. All periodic industrial self-monitoring reports must include the
certification statement in Section 710.400(B)(1).
5. The City may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical
Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the industrial user has
demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that
the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake
water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of
the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following
conditions:
a. The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined
to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged
from the facility, provided that the sanitary wastewater is not
regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise
includes no process wastewater.
b. The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit,
but in no case longer than five (5) years. The user must submit
a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted
for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit.
See Section 710.400(A)(10)(c).
c. In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one (1)
sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any
Section
710.310
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
710.310
AO:963
treatment present at the facility that is representative of all
wastewater from all processes.
d. The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in
accordance with Section 710.020, and include the certification
statement in 710.400(B)(1) [40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(h)].
e. Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA
approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest
minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
f. Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Superintendent
must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The
reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted
by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by
the Superintendent for three (3) years after expiration of the
waiver.
g. Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the
user's permit by the Superintendent, the industrial user must
certify on each report with the statement in Section
710.400(B)(3) that there has been no increase in the pollutant
in its waste stream due to activities of the industrial user.
h. In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the
user's operations, the user must immediately: comply with the
monitoring requirements of Section 710.310(D), or other more
frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the
Superintendent, and notify the Superintendent.
i. This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical Pretreatment
Standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical
Pretreatment Standard.
6. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with Section 710.400(B)(1) of this Chapter.
7. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities
shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good
working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for
the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.
F. Notification Of Violation/Repeat Sampling And Reporting.
Section
710.310
POPLAR BLUFF CITY CODE Section
710.310
AO:964
1. If the sampling performed by the user indicates a violation, the user
must notify the Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of
becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis
to the Superintendent within thirty (30) days after becoming aware
of the violation. Where the City has performed the sampling and
analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the City must perform the
repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the
violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. At
the Superintendent's discretion, resampling may not be required if
the Superintendent monitors the user's facility at least once a
month, or if the Superintendent samples between the user's initial
sampling and when the user receives the results of this initial
sampling.
G. Notification Of Changed Conditions.
1. Each user must notify the Superintendent and POTW of any
planned significant changes to the user's operations or system
which might alter the nature, quality or volume of the wastewater
at least ninety (90) days before the change.
2. For the purposes of this notification requirement, significant
changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty
percent (20%) or greater and the discharge of any previously
unreported pollutants.
3. The Superintendent may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including resubmission of a wastewater discharge
permit application under Section 710.400(A).
4. The Superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit
under Section 710.400(B) or modify an existing wastewater
discharge permit under Section 710.410 in response to changed or
anticipated changed conditions.
H. Notification Of The Discharge Of Hazardous Waste(s).
1. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director and the State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of
any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261.
Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and
the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user
discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain
the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user.
Section
710.310
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
710.310
AO:965
a. An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
b. An estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the waste stream discharged during that
calendar month; and
c. An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream
expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12)
months.
2. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty
(180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under
this Subsection needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous
waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions
must be submitted under Section 710.310(G).
3. The notification requirement of this Section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of
Section 710.310(E).
4. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection
(H)(1) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no
more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the
wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified under 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e). The discharge of more than fifteen (15)
kilograms of nonacute hazardous waste in a calendar month, or of
any quantity of acute hazardous waste as specified under 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than
such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
5. In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must
notify the Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management
Division Director and the State hazardous waste authorities of the
discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective
date of such regulations.
6. In the case of any notification made under this Section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
7. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not permitted to be discharged by this Chapter, a permit issued
thereunder or any applicable Federal or State laws.

Section 710.320. Monitoring Requirements. [Ord. No. 7854 § 2,
4-2-2018]
1. All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge
permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Superintendent as
the Superintendent may require.
A. When requested by the Superintendent, a user must submit information
on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within thirty (30)
days of the request. The Superintendent is authorized to prepare a form
for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this
information.
B. All significant industrial users (SIUs) shall be required to monitor their
discharge at the frequency stipulated in the individual industrial
discharge permit issued for each SIU. The minimum frequency for any
SIU shall be once every three (3) months. Monitoring shall consist of
sampling the discharge on a composite basis over a twenty-four-hour
period and determining the nature and concentration of pollutants
contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment
standard. Upon promulgation of a Federal categorical pretreatment
standard for a particular industrial category containing more stringent
monitoring requirements, the requirements of this Section shall
immediately be superseded. The Superintendent shall notify all affected
users of the more stringent requirements.
1. Except as indicated in Subsection (B)(2) and (3) below, the user
must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flowproportional
composite sampling techniques, unless timeproportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the Superintendent. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during
a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis
as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics
and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by
the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous limits.
2. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.
3. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety-day compliance reports required in Section 710.310, a

minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available,
the Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by Section 710.310(E)(4) [40 CFR 403.12(e) and
403.12(h)], the industrial user is required to collect the number of
grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
C. All sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordance with
procedures established by the State pursuant to Section 304(g) of the
Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto or with
any other test procedures approved by the State. (Where 40 CFR, Part
136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication
"Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants", April 1977 and amendments thereto
or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the
State.)
D. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report, based on data that is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
A. Every person discharging any industrial waste mixture into the sewers
or sewage works of the City or into any sewer connected thereto is
required to keep and maintain records of the data listed under Section
710.310, including documentation associated with best management
practices. Such records shall be available for inspection during regular
business hours by authorized representatives or employees of the City
upon presenting written credentials of their authority, and such
representatives or employees shall be permitted to make and retain
copies of such records. [Ord. No. 7854 § 2, 4-2-2018]
B. Records pursuant to Subsection (A) above must be kept and maintained
for a minimum of three (3) years. The time such records must be
maintained may be extended by the Superintendent.
C. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. Records
shall also include documentation associated with best management

Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
Section 710.340. Hazardous Wastes — Generally. [Ord. No. 7854 § 2,
4-2-2018]
Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this Chapter. Facilities to
prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans
showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall
be submitted to the City before construction of the facility. All existing users
shall complete such a plan by 1997. No user who commences contribution
to the POTW after 1997 shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the
system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the
City. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facilities as
necessary to meet the requirements of this Section.
Section 710.350. Hazardous Wastes — Accidental Spills,
Discharges. [Ord. No. 7854 § 2, 4-2-2018]
A. Any spill or accidental discharge of wastes which may create an
explosion hazard in the sewage works or in any way have a deleterious
effect upon these works, treatment process or constitute a hazard to
human beings, animals or the receiving stream shall be immediately
reported to the Superintendent by the person responsible for such spill
or accidental discharge.
B. Such notification shall set forth the time and place of the spill or
discharge, the type and quantity of material included in the waste and
actions taken to stop the spill or discharge.
C. It shall be the responsibility of each person having knowledge of the
spill or accidental discharge to have available, insofar as practicable
and reasonable, the following information:
1. Potential toxicity in water to human beings, animals and aquatic
life.
2. Suggestions on safeguard or other precautionary measures to
nullify the toxic effects of such wastes.
D. It shall be the responsibility of each person responsible for the spill or
accidental discharge to provide the Superintendent with written
verification of what measures are to be taken to prevent a recurrence of

hands of the Superintendent within seven (7) days after the spill or
accidental discharge occurred. This report shall also include a
description of the cause of the spill or accidental discharge. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or
other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this Chapter or other applicable law.
E. Significant industrial users are required to notify the Superintendent
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a
slug discharge. Upon notification, the Superintendent may reevaluate
the need for, or modifying of, a slug control plan.
A. At least once every two (2) years, the Superintendent shall evaluate
whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/
slug control plan. The Superintendent may require any user to develop,
submit for approval and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the
Superintendent may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental
discharge/slug control plan shall be in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8
and, at a minimum, address the following:
1. Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharge;
2. Description of stored chemicals;
3. Procedures for immediately notifying the Superintendent of any
accidental or slug discharge as required by Section 710.310(H)(1);
and
4. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants,
including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response. Should the significant industrial user make any
modifications to its accidental discharge/slug control plan, the City
shall immediately be made aware of the changes and provided a
revised copy of the accidental discharge/slug control plan.

for disconnection, has been paid in full.
B. No person shall maliciously or negligently break, damage, destroy,
uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or
equipment which is a part of the municipal sanitary sewerage system.
A. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge
permits and monitoring programs and from the Superintendent's
inspection and sampling activities shall be available to the public
without restriction, unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, that the release
of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable
State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission
of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
user furnishing a report that such information should be held
confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to

applicable authority.
3. Criminal Prosecution.
a. The Superintendent may refer any criminal violation to the
appropriate prosecutor.
A. Treatment Upsets.
1. Any industrial user which experiences an upset in operations that
places it in a temporary state of noncompliance, which is not the
result of operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance or careless or improper operation, shall inform the
Superintendent thereof immediately upon becoming aware of the
upset. Where such information is given orally, a written report
thereof shall be filed by the user within five (5) days. The report
shall contain:
a. A description of the upset, its cause(s) and impact on the
discharger's compliance status.
b. The duration of non-compliance, including exact dates and
times of non-compliance and if the non-compliance is
continuing, the time by which compliance is reasonably
expected to be restored.
c. All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset.
2. An individual user which complies with the notification provisions
of this Section in a timely manner shall have an affirmative defense
to any enforcement action brought by the Superintendent for any
non-compliance with this Chapter or an order or permit issued
hereunder by the user, which arises out of violations attributable to
and alleged to have occurred during the period of the documented
and verified upset.
B. Treatment Bypasses.
1. For the purposes of this Section:
a. "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams
from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
Section

POPLAR BLUFF CITY CODE Section
710.480
AO:986
b. "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage
to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes
them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss
of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does
not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
2. A bypass of the treatment system is prohibited unless all of the
following conditions are met:
a. The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
b. There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, including the
use of auxiliary treatment or retention of the wastewater, and
c. The industrial user properly notified the Superintendent as
described in Subsection (3) below.
3. Industrial users must provide immediate notice [within twenty-four
(24) hours] to the Superintendent upon discovery of any
unanticipated bypass. If necessary, the Superintendent may require
the industrial user to submit a written report explaining the
cause(s), nature and duration of the bypass and the steps being
taken to prevent its recurrence. The written submission shall be
provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of
the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected,
the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the
bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within
twenty-four (24) hours.
4. An industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation
of the treatment system. Industrial users anticipating a bypass
must submit notice to the Superintendent at least ten (10) days in
advance. The Superintendent may only approve the anticipated
bypass if the circumstances satisfy those set forth in Subsection (3)
above.
